sponsored thing or anything like that I want to make sure this is very clear this is just an opportunity to ask marketers and get some inside feedback on what's actually been going on there why all of the changes are happening what the final results are going to be okay and hopefully clarifying things up quite a bit so without further Ado I want to bring out Mark and say thank you very much for coming out here and joining us and you know clarifying all this stuff first off that just started way out of context I have no idea what the hell just happened there second off a lot of people still aren't happy 35 of the votes aren't happy telling us what's going on and uh giving us some some insight into the future and for taking what looked to be some extremely hard questions everybody in slack I'm in the slack with a bunch of other insiders and I have some really hard very strong questions so we'll be getting into those in a minute so anyway thank you again Mark I wanted to just start with letting you talk and you know say your piece first and and go over what's going on and get all of that out before we we dive into the questions if that's okay yeah awesome thank you I really appreciate being on Jason and thank you everybody uh for joining I'm not going to go over all of the changes here I'm sure we're going to talk about them a lot I hope people had a chance to to see my letter earlier today or to go through the fact and the other stuff there but I did just want to hit one part first that's really really important and that's just I just want to say I'm sorry um I I Know It uh it's been a very tough week to hear about can we pause this for a quick second what is he sorry about dude he's a team lead he's not the c-suite what what does he apologize who who are you apologizing for a bunch of the very well deserved feedback on the uh changes we made it's very clear we did not list uh take enough feedback listen to enough feedback uh before we rolled out the program uh and I think he's the CEO I know that comes with uh you know how hard it is to earn trust and I know how easy it is to lose trust uh so um super clear I've got a lot of work to do um and so I just I really really wanted to start with telling everybody here uh and frankly the game development community at large sorry uh and so you know with that I'm happy to talk through any of the questions and just cover whatever you want to talk about Jason all right that that's good because I've got a lot of questions I mean people there there's a lot of things that I think people aren't clear about and a lot of things that people are just really confused about like why why some decisions were made what those decisions are um and uh what's gonna happen in the future too so let's um get started I'm just gonna start diving into my giant list of questions so the first one was um why what why did you go about doing this whole thing the the pricing plan change putting this up posting it out there making a lot of people angry of course and then rolling it back a week later like what because they rolled it out thinking they're gonna make easy money the world exploded and they went oh well kind of this is the softest ball question I've seen yet I thought we are gonna get some Nolan Ryan out here what is the point of doing all that if you're gonna kind of do this roll back afterwards well uh the most fundamental thing that we're trying to do is we're building a sustainable business for Unity and for us that means that we do need to have a model that includes some sort of balanced exchange including shared success that's really really important for the the long-term future of how we think about um our business how we think about the engine and the main reason is really clear it has to be a sustainable business we want to keep massively and deeply investing in the engine we want to make sure that we can build the best editor and runtime for everyone to build the games today and tomorrow and that's the reason why we work on it very very focused on that it's very important for Unity it's just so you know they make about 2.2 billion dollars a year they have approximately 700 000 or 7 000 employees so that puts it at an average of What two hundred and eighty thousand dollars per employee as their income is their gross income and so they have to be able to make it below that line to just simply be profitable I assumed they're profitable oh that's fair and how much real quickly can we talk about just what for the people who haven't seen the the info talk about what the just overview the high level changes are for people who don't know so it's not completely removed but they're not profitable uh it's kind of surprising you could make 2.2 billion dollars a year making a game engine and not be profitable there are changes that it's only going to apply to specific versions and there were some other things can you just give a real quick overview of that for anybody who's just catching up right now and maybe hasn't seen that post yeah there's a there's a long fact with a whole bunch more details but I think I would just really maybe hit four seven thousand employees first one I'll just start by talking about Unity personal that's the version of unity that's free to use it's used by the majority of all of our game creators uh it's not a part of the runtime fee program at all uh and we made some other changes along with that the first one is we made sure that people have the option to remove the unity splash screen if they would like when they're using that particular product and we're also changing it so that before the way that Unity personal worked is you could use it up to a hundred thousand dollars of revenue for your company now it's 200 000 so twice the size so it's easier to use people come there's more cases and it's it's more flexible so that's that's number one not a part of the program totally free majority of our users so that's one of the changes is that the personal which is the vast majority no longer has the runtime fee associated with it I think that's good because the runtime fee was a solid 20 cents per install definitely don't worry we got the magical algorithms we will know when someone's trying to denial of wallet you a lot more flexibility and again because we've announced some other changes around sun setting unity plus that means that you can use Unity uh personal and not have to do the splash screen which is a reason that some people were using plus um the other the so then if we move on to the Run runtime program so the runtime fee applies for people who were over both uh a million dollars in sort of trailing 12 months Revenue money they've made over the last year on kind of an ongoing basis and uh a million engagements uh with new users essentially and for those users they're following changes the first one is this is with next year's uh LTS which would be you know what is 2023 LTS shipping in 2024. so it doesn't impact any games that have currently shipped and it doesn't impact the games people may have already been working on for a very very long period of time um I think this is good Lana Lux again gosh three years on strain just to get this dropped just a couple weeks ago on her crazy right and so this is a I think this is a good move to make it so that if you're building a game right now you are not gonna get boned by this right I think that that's probably a good a good move right in general I think really key pieces of feedback we heard is that it was a really big business model uh okay that people didn't expect uh and so why wasn't this that the setup from the beginning because it was going to be a time sensitive thing at that time January 1st we're gonna start charging really the reason why they didn't just do it as as an install versus this LTS is that you can continue to use Unity from 2023 for some amount of time I don't know how the exact rules work with unity and how the runtime and stuff all that works but there's going to be some amount of time that they're going to be able to use this older version of unity without having to upgrade thus avoiding the entire install fee altogether and so that's kind of this bypass workaround business and so instead they just wanted to get everybody on right so they're like instead of making it a version based they're just gonna make it time-based 2021 or 2024 January 1st boom we get all of it and yes 7 000 employees for a game engine is insane so it's you know it's very clear to us that having it start on a future version where everybody can make the choice to use it is is really really important the second that we heard along with that is that people need to know that they can rely on a set of terms when they start using a version of unity so we're going to make sure that that's the case um you know there are even some pieces about that things like the um GitHub repo that by the way I will just say prior to last week I did not know existed uh and now I know a lot about and we're making sure I think it's already back up there it has all of them in there obviously our website will always have our you know legal terms in terms of service and all those sorts of things but we'll make sure it's also on the GitHub so people uh people can track that and then the last that I would talk about is I've heard that that the TOs on GitHub thing is kind of more of I a misunderstanding in the sense that it was actually removed well before this debacle went down and so some people claims timing I don't know I you know maybe they did maybe they have 200 IQ maybe they don't I don't know but it was still removed before all this Unity stuff it just looks super shitty when people discover that the TOs removed from GitHub coinciding with really bad news it just makes it look horrible when you are you know using this this future version of unity you have a game that's over the million dollars million engagements um that there's a choice between either a 2.5 percent um Revenue share or measuring based on this calculated amount of you know initial user engagements that you can do and if you do both of those you'll always be billed the lesser of whatever that calculation is if you only wanted to do one of them leave the Box blank whatever this is really only for those um games that were over those thresholds by the way this is really good I actually thought that this was super smart of them because it at least makes people I mean first off they already they they're already adding a new fee which totally is screwing people in some sense in some capacity because they signed up already paying large multi-thousand dollars per seat per month per year depending on which one and now they're getting a new fee and at least it's like well we're going to reduce it down to two and a half percent royalty kind of like unreal or this install fee and will automatically choose the one that's lesser for you so it like feels nicer but you're still already getting a new fee so I think some people are going to be feeling you know a little uh it's apologetic not smart yeah I don't think people are very stoked at least this is the best possible option it's much better than it was but it's still not great right you're still getting a new fee there's a I mean and plus it's not like Indie Game Dev is known for its luxurious money that everyone's getting this is not PHP at all so sorry one more minute sorry one more minute uh you asked me and then the other key part of that one is it's self-reported so it's both numbers being self-reported both on the revenue side and on the user engagements yeah I think that's a big one well I think there are a couple questions about that that we'll get into but I think the the self-reporting and the the mix-up around there is a is a big one that I think people would be pretty happy with uh let's go there's a lot of questions so I want to go on to the next one which reads kind of uh meanly so I'm going to read early mean too did you even bother to talk to customers before you rolled out your version from last school no did you guys talk to customers can you talk a little bit about it um we did uh we talked to uh Partners large customers small customers lots of internal people we didn't listen to enough of their feedback just want to be clear we should have listened to more of their feedback and we need to do better and I can tell you rewind that for a second Partners large customer you rolled out your version from last week no did you guys talk to customers can you talk a little bit about that um we did uh we talked to uh Partners large customers small customers lots of internal people we didn't listen to enough for their feedback just want to be clear we should have listened more of their feedback okay so hold on I talked to larger customers maybe not a great customer base to talk to but still they should be able to express a lot of these problems with it all internal people I'm PR I feel like I'm pressing a little bit of X right here okay I'm feeling I I can feel myself reach I feel dude who do they talk to that was just like I'm ambivalent no no nobody's been ambivalent like if every I have not met one person that was just like unstuffy yeah it seems both practical and easy to track and fair right like you what did you listen to what were the other suggestions that they changed that's the question I want to hear what I mean if this was the best they came out with what shitty crazy ideas were the ones that didn't make it uh and we need to do better and I can tell you you know as an example uh on Sunday I think uh it's been a long week so the days of folks together a little bit but on Sunday I think we put up on uh on X a uh kind of a statement saying that we'll get back to in a couple of days the reason we didn't get back to in a couple of days is because we were as we were working through the plan we were going back and talking to Big customers independent developers Partners over and over again to get that feedback because I think the most fundamental thing about talking to customers is it's it's kind of an ongoing iterative conversation and we didn't do that well enough and you know now I'm very very convicted on this policy that we're doing that all right yeah I think that in my opinion at least the updates seem to kind of fix everybody's problems that I've talked to um especially we'll dive into the trust stuff later but I think that like that's that's the one part people are still a little iffy on but I think that that's even probably going to get mostly cleared up so let's go on to um the next question which was why didn't you just go with a REV share model from the get-go so why not just go hey we're two and a half percent now or whatever um why was there a whole install thing in the beginning anyway we think it's going to be cheaper for a lot of games uh so you know listen we're trying to build a model that we think is fair and sort of you know is a good sort of value exchange that works for games once they find a level of success and we also want to tie it to sort of this value that Unity brings which is you know our runtime that's that's inside of the games themselves uh and so it felt like a way where we could tie those two pieces together and um we think that in a pretty reasonable number of cases that that's actually a smaller number and we think that's good now um what we heard got a lot of really really good feedback is that there were cases where people first off couldn't plan because they're like well I don't know maybe something gonna go crazy yeah or I have this particular scenario and that doesn't work and so adding in the 2.5 Revenue share as an option you can only use that or where you have the both and so you can always plan for it and you know hopefully do better um definitely was frankly my opinion makes the plan uh better um based on what we were trying to do um so it was really good feedback yeah I was to be honest I said this in the streams earlier that the idea of had being forced on a REV share doesn't sound appealing to me but I've come from the background of MMOs and you know 50 60 AAA games where a small in selfie were looking less than one percent or a one percent fee so I like the option of both but um yeah I I haven't understood just to be just to be real and I'm trying I'm trying again I'm just trying to think about how does the average Indie developer feel about this I don't think they feel good about either of them especially when they're already paying a subscription fee I really think that the subscription fee has to be fully dropped or dropped or reduced or created Anew that makes sense say with customer support and other sorts of type things right because that would make a lot of sense if you're like okay I want to develop this game I pay nothing the entire time I develop it I pay nothing for all of it and when I go to release it then I have to pay if I make some money whereas if you're paying up until the point and then you pay when you make money it just kind of feels like you know that doesn't not really feeling great about that it kind of feels like there's something it just feels odd to have them both he's lying about talking to users look at his eyes they shift left okay I'm not into reading people's expressions first off we don't even know if this camera is mirrored he could be shifting right right now second off I don't I I just don't I don't have that much Alex jasms inside of me to be able to wear it the argument of just so hopefully that doesn't change and it will stay away I assume that's the plan no that's absolutely the plan or the plan is that choice all right so the next question is a is a point he's talking to people you got to realize that there is a team of lawyers right now sitting in this room with every question in order planned with every one of his potential answers and he is the highest ranked individual that doesn't come across as a lizard person who knows how to read from cue cards and act like a human right you wouldn't want to put Mark Zuckerberg whatever he is in front of the camera trying to tell everyone that they feel bad because No One Believes lizard person slidey you know I feel bad now um um like No One Believes that thing and so they they just found the most human person that works the highest up and this is what he gets okay he's reading you can tell he's looking at people at least who is responsible for the policy and its decision to roll out there you go great question listen this is my part of the business and there's a lot of people obviously internally that have worked on this the executive team has worked on this but I'm you know I'm responsible for what we're doing inside of create the entire executive team has been a part of this uh but I'll also say this is really important for Unity uh you know we are we have to focus on building a strong sustainable business that allows us to continue to you know invest in the ways that we want so we can build the best game engine that hopefully everybody wants to use to make great gains all right you really I mean do you really believe that the largest decision made in unity's history is driven by a non-c-suite guy a team lead I don't know maybe exact Suite this feels like I don't know this is a non-answer this is a non-answer I kind of do to be honest I kind of don't not this big uh these are largely driven with with higher people involved as well create is the games division but you still I mean you can't come across these things without massive bio buy-in from other people tend to agree there although there was an idea on the last stream that you should just make your own Fortnight and make billions off of that I like that would be nice if you don't mind that idea all right uh yeah if it was easy it's like uh make your own Fortnight I think that problem number one there is that's extremely impressive to do once yes I agree I think it would be nice but that's uh it's definitely a good dream this next question is what I have been wondering and I don't know anything about and they were wondering if it's legal to change the terms of service overnight and I don't know if it was necessarily overnight but do you know I don't know anything about the legal side of the stuff all I've heard is random speculation from people who are also not lawyers but what do you can you just address this question the legality of the terms of service change Unity did try to build their own game for two years and were unable to it is hard building games is literally like the hardest thing ever and maybe the GitHub think you'd mentioned uh you just kind of discovering that I don't know anything about it really well I mean I mean I think at sort of one level uh all companies change their terms over time you know frequently and constantly and consistently you know because frankly the world changes gaming is a very Dynamic world the world we live in is dynamic and there are obviously always new things that are that are being added or whatever however I want to back up from that and say you know it kind of comes back to your trust Point uh which is I think one thing that I heard a lot is people very very deeply need to know what they're signing up for when they pick a version of unity um to build their game on and that they can you know be sure that they can continue to use that and I think that feedback uh there's a lot of other things that come along with rust so I just want to be clear but that feedback is really really super clear and that's one reason why you know what I talked about today we're going to make sure that you can do that and it also does come back to the the GitHub thing again I didn't know about that it sort of was you know just how do you know about the repo so uh but uh and from the unity perspective we've always put our terms on the on the um web page and make sure that they're including the new ones and you know show the difference what's changed between those who you however you know we're a community you know we're we're heavily used by community of game developers so another way that we can make sure that that's clear is to put it in the types of tools that they use like repos and GitHub um so it's easy to track so um so so I so one thing I'm going to re-emphasize this one thing I really like about their change of making it so this version of unity gets the runtime fee from here on out one reason why I really like that is now the onus is on Unity to make the engine so appealing that the runtime fee is worth the upgrade I do think that that is a really I honestly think that that makes it kind of worth it uh I I really do think that this makes it so that people are gonna have to wait until they're compelled to really want it Casey replied okay hold on nice all right I'm gonna put you right here with me we're gonna go down low all right you ready for more I'm ready Casey does have a pro camera view look how good is he literally looks like he's in lighting from a video game like you already have you already have it all good looking I do Graphics programming what can I say it's clear I work with JavaScript like it's obvious what's going on here dolls and downloads and piracy and all that um yeah I figure you've got the details okay yeah and I'm gonna say like sounded like a little corporate here for a second while I use the words around it but I'm just going to use them and then try to explain them a little bit and that's you know the goal is as simple as saying that it's a legitimate user of your software on a particular distribution channel so uh okay what's a legitimate user well a legitimate user uh would be an actual user not your automated not your automated use not you know whether there was piracy not someone that had bought it and instantly refunded it but like a legitimate first time that someone was engaging with your free to play game or your paid game uh what's a distribution Channel well uh an app store is a distribution channel so if that user went to like a particular store and um you know bought it or downloaded or whatever uh then that then you would start thinking of that as sort of doing it now if they had multiple devices or they reinstalled it um you don't count those multiple times right because I might have gotten the same thing in my library from a store that I can use on a couple different devices great um that's one not two so uh there's a bunch more examples that are around that in the fact and we're very committed to making sure that we give more details around that but our intent is very simple which is that you know the first time that your game using our with our runtime engages with a very legitimate user on a distribution Channel like use that as account and then again we think that many times that that's will be much less than this 2.5 percent Revenue share um and so you could pay less or less do that or you just go to the revenue share if you didn't want to track that right so I kind of get two questions here with that with that answer Casey can you hear all this by the way I can't but I figured out a stream hacks which is I just have your Twitch channel on another page and I unmute it whenever they're talking so I got most of it okay you got most of it uh there's two things I kind of want to point up which is one they keep talking about the self-report model but everything he just said right there seems like they're tracking it and then on top of it he lightly touched on piracy like has unity solved piracy can the can they just can they just hand the industry this pyrus instant piracy song equation that they got like I don't think anyone solved this problem so there's it sounds like they have no idea it it does and I just keep going back to the exact same thing that I was thinking uh before which is that they had to get this fee in there because otherwise they can't comply with their previous TOS stuff that said they would never add anything other than fees basically so I'm just I'm still very skeptical I it's you know these discussions the answers that are being given here in the softball questions that he's being asked are just I mean we're also in the weeds who cares at this point that's not what people are mainly asking about is exactly how will you track installs like they have a trust issue to rebuild here and we're talking about the minutia of like whether two downloads on an app store counts as to install like really I mean okay we can you know you and I can sit here and react to that but is that really the important part yeah yeah well hopefully these upcoming questions are a little bit because I mean the guy alluded that there's some tough ones coming so you know I'm not I'm not gonna hold my breath okay here we go that makes sense I think it's most of the time at least like I said on the games that I've worked on it would be less than 2.5 but I I can I like that there's that option there um and just to real quick clarify one more time for everybody on the counting of those that's just you're going in now make sure I understand this right I'm just going into like Steam and saying hey I sold this many well subtracting my refunds from that funds exactly yeah okay yeah that's kind of what I expected I think yes self-reported Based on data that you easily have available not sort of like have to track some sort of user Behavior that's you know different than I've ever done or anything like that you don't have to go add-in analytics or some tracking or anything you just look at whatever your numbers are and then put those into the page yeah that's kind of been what I expected from the start but it was definitely I'll be honest uh I'm going to take a quick pause here I would be surprised that steam doesn't just hand them this information well I also don't understand what you're saying now because steams what steam reports is not installs it reports sales so what which is it is it sales or installs now I don't know because steam doesn't tell you every time a user installs and uninstalls your program as far as I know they only tell you how many you've sold that's what your dashboard says right so I mean is he does he even understand his own policy at this point I I don't know I I wish I was there asking the questions right all right we'll go it was very unclear because it said there was a proprietary algorithm in there I feel like those two words made the thing drastically more confusing and led to a lot of speculation even for me I wonder what I don't know what that means we want to be super clear that elk reporting and by the way both both the revenue side and on that is really key it's why this program is very important but we're trying to make sure that this is um you know easy for our game creators as well yeah no that's that's good I mean that seems like data at least I've always had if you sell games and have people download them you've got the info on how many you're downloading it or how much money you're making each month so that seems relatively straightforward and a lot better than some built-in tracking spyware thing that I kept hearing about yeah and again I I I'm sorry that I had to use the corporate jargon but the truth is there's just a lot of different scenarios and games and so like you know some people might say why isn't it sales but like sales doesn't work if it's a free to play game and so we're just you know we're trying to make sure that we can clearly Define that in a way that works for a bunch of different ways that that unity's used it makes sense it's just a now going away from the word installs I think was the number one thing this install has a reinstall in that yeah goes overboard so this next question is a big one I'm curious I don't know if you're going to know the answer to this but how many customers have you lost and how many more are you expecting to lose over this I mean I've seen a lot of people just say they're up and changing different engines or at least start looking into different options people talking about changing their future games is this uh have you guys track that or keeping an eye on that listen we uh we've seen all of the critical feedback and it really hurts to read those types of things and uh you know it's based on uh what we said uh and not getting the feedback so I think those are you know real reactions that people had uh it's tough to see my job our job at Unity is to make sure that we build the best product the best you know platform that we can so that you can build great games and we're going to focus on that and hope to give people a great option um so that they use it but I you know people definitely have options and if we don't do a good job um and if you know if they don't want to um you know if we don't continue to invest in the way that we want to then yeah we know that they'll go somewhere else and that's why that's our Focus uh Casey could you remind me again his answer I think I I think I blacked out there I mean he didn't uh right he he just he doesn't want to say it although uh I think I was a little ahead of you in the Stream uh for for this because I think in a second here he does say he hasn't seen any numbers oh okay okay let's let's I but that was most I mean to be completely fair to think in my like corporate world which is you can't possibly say on a live stream you've lost a lot of customers and be a publicly traded company like that's just gonna cause Panic fear Panic at the Disco is going down and your stock is going to plummet because it's still trading hours it's still after hour trading hours and so well and we also know so unless he is basically saying that the companies who said they switched off unity's ads system this week are lying we know that at least they have lost those customers temporarily right which he could have acknowledged and he chose not to so that also is a little suspicious because we have heard from people who specifically said we're stopping to use this now so I I didn't hear that factored in either he would have known about that those were big companies yep okay okay well I think that with the changes a lot of the people that were considering changing will probably um reconsider that especially to get into the um the terms of service type stuff which we'll get into those questions in a few minutes I think um let's go on though it's just tons and I'm running out of time we have a hard stop at two so I gotta go quick oh so now you'll be charging a revenue share and a seat license cost how is that benefiting your users you can talk about why they're why they both still exist listen our our goal is to build a sustainable business so that we can continue to invest but the the key thing I would say is the majority of our users pay neither majority of our users are using unitypersonal which is free to use and we want to continue to deeply invest in making that a great platform for building games then you know there are a variety of options where we're going to continue to add value into whether it's Unity Pro or Unity Enterprise or those sorts of things for you to use it and then for a subset of games that passes those really high thresholds there would be the runtime uh runtime program as well we feel like it's a balanced program um that allows us to to invest in the way that we want and be able to deeply deliver the features that will make it great for you people building The Amazing games that get built on Unity both today and tomorrow uh real quick I want to go back that last uh I was really hoping to hear a little bit more um because he he just explained what the pricing model was which we all know I mean I still just think it's kind of weird to have two two different charges like if I'm paying perceived you know it's it's weird to pay for something and then have to pay more when you use something oh uh I completely agree and I think one of the problems here is that that sounds a lot more like the kind of thing that would happen if you were two businesses negotiating on a contract so in a more complicated contract where it's like oh we worked with this other company and we worked out exactly all the details of how our businesses work and here's what we ended up with sometimes you get weird contracts like that but in the consumer space when you're talking about a contract of adhesion basically where I'm just signing up to publicly available terms that everyone else gets nobody's familiar with this I mean when you sign up for Adobe we sign up for Office 365 we sign up for thing Autodesk none of them have this weird back-end royalty right yeah the only person who has something with that is unreal who charges no seat license right yes so they seem to be doing two things two separate business models at the same time which again maybe uh you know they've tried to work out that math just so it ends up being beneficial for everyone or something like that but from a consumer's point of view it doesn't look good and there should be an answer for that because it doesn't look good look it feels like double dipping as your chat just said yeah it feels very double dippy all right we'll keep going question there's a couple people complaining that you didn't tell them how many people you've already lost I'm curious is that like a number you actually know like do you know that there's been a dip in users or is that something that you have to wait a little while to see I I mean I listen I see all of it on uh like any channel where we get feedback obviously we see all the the feedback I haven't seen anything in our like actual numbers uh that would show that not saying that that means it's not happening uh and I I will just say that it's my job to make sure that we build the best product um so that people don't want to do that and that they want to stay on unity and build great games okay okay yeah that's kind of what I figured I figured if you've seen a big giant drop you would have mentioned it but yeah I mean yeah here's one of the questions that I but I don't like one of my own questions finally if you could go back in time and redo this from the start I'm wondering how you would have done this differently like if you went back to you know January or whenever the the idea for this started coming up what would you have done different yeah listen we're going to do a business model transition that is new and it's different and there's a lot to work through there um so obviously I would have probably engaged in the conversation earlier listened more been more consistent and clear with some of the information we put out there a good example is you know we have a estimator that we put out today with it which we did before which meant everybody was going to their own sheets and all that kind of stuff so we created an information vacuum that made it even harder on its own so we would do a better job there but the actual fundamental thing is we didn't listen to enough feedback and the plan today is a great plan for Unity and I think it's a really strong plan for creators and that's because we got better feedback and it made us Build a Better plan so you know candidly what I would do if I went back is I would get that feedback yeah I I like that and the reason that okay I mean that's fair I think it's good to know you you know you've made a mistake you goofed up a little bit and you got to listen to people I mean you're being a little bit more charitable than I probably would be on this one prime uh so that is the analogy that I use here is it's like if your kid crashes the car do you want them to apologize for crashing the car or for not asking you first if they could crash the car right and there's a difference between those two things one shows that the person actually understands what they did wrong the other one is sort of like wanting to get the apology over with without actually acknowledging the actual things you did wrong so if the only thing you're gonna sit here and say you're sorry for is that you didn't listen enough well what about deleting the GitHub what about the fact that they removed the terms of service thing a few months back that would have prevented this kind of change what about them having known for over a year probably if the uh if the um Andreas and Horowitz guy's thread where he talked about having worked on these trades what about them knowing for that long and only spring inside game developers with three months to go where's the real apology for the unethical Behavior I don't care about your apology for not listening more yeah like it just doesn't hold water to me yeah I mean okay so maybe as me I'm a very chair I try to be a charitable guy okay Casey but you're much sweeter than me time you're much sweeter I I appreciate it I I love your show because you're so nice thank you I try to be a generally nice person here but I I think those are really good points which is they did know for a year which means they didn't start to listen and they did actually a great job of listening they put it out there everyone went what the hell and then they just pulled it back they actually I don't it's probably right he shouldn't be apologizing for not listening they listed perfectly they just told no one until the bomb was already lit which is probably a bad time to let people know that there's a bomb like they could have like said it a long time ago and got a lot of this feedback maybe before they put it out there so that that's fair take that's a fair take but and what about all the malfeasance what about deleting the GitHub what about deleting the TOs that those are the things I want to hear an apology for right it's like yeah maybe this blindsides you a bit that's okay I understand maybe you you miss you know you you thought it was going to go over better than it was that's all right you don't really need to apologize for that that's just a misstep but the the things that seem actually unethical where's the apology yeah Fair that's fair all right we'll keep going I wanted to ask that question too is because like I think a lot of people are concerned about what happens with future pricing changes if stuff needs to change in the future how is that going to be addressed if you know if this doesn't work out or something else totally drastically changes in the economy or the gaming scene um what's gonna happen so I'm I was kind of curious like it seems getting out there and having this be a conversation with questions from the beginning would have been a whole lot easier um a lot less painful at least all right let's go on to um the next one is unity in a bad place financially uh listen uh we're very focused on building a really strong company you can go back and look at our financials we had a really uh you know reasonable uh second quarter and we're optimistic about the 533 million um but we're also really focused on making sure that we have the sustainable ability to make sure that we continue to invest uh in where we're going I mean it's like I'm saying the same thing over and over again I don't really mean to be like doing like that sort of repeated thing but it's the truth this is about making sure that this massive investment that we put into our engine and tools is one that we can keep doing because for us that's the focus making sure that we can build the very best platform that we can I'm curious a little follow-up on that um or according to like your internal projections is this going to be enough to just keep things stable or do you feel like you're going to need to reevaluate in another year or two uh well listen you know when we make a shift it says that it doesn't start until next year obviously that means that games that are participating in the runtime are going to come later so like there's a shift on sort of where some of that comes but this is about a business model transition this isn't about hey we need to do something for the next three months or something like that this is about setting up the foundation of the company this program is critical for us for the foundation of the company to be able to continue to invest for a very very long period of time so if the shape kind of is like this you know like a little shape that goes like this versus being earlier that's less relevant than making sure that we have a right program that works for our creators that's why I believe that this is a better program because I think we got great feedback to make it a better program and work for Unity um okay so we don't know he did he didn't answer if they're in a bad financial position they're obviously focusing on growth like any Silicon Valley company it's all about growth growth growth growth growth growth um so this is naturally this is going to happen but I I think the thing that has to be stated is that the self-reporting I bet will app uh will uh end within the year there's no way they can keep self-reporting a real thing guess what I would say is once again I think you're being too nice um if you listen to the content of what he just said he said this is about creating a sustainable business Unity has been in business for over a decade they already ipo'd when was the point when they started looking around going maybe we should think about structuring this around being a sustainable business at some point they kind of had to know that this shoe was going to drop and the question is when when did he know that because if the answer is like five years ago and they were just trying to run this out for as long as they could that's a really bad thing right did they literally just wake up this year and go oh gosh we we this the first time we realized we don't make any money like I don't think so I just kept seeing her gross number and I'm like that's several Millions we're good yeah what like what's going on am I the only person who's hearing this I don't know if I was there I don't know how the the Jason Wyman guy is sitting there with a straight face I guess that's his job so I don't know I straight from this guy I'm flabbergasted so so this guy uh someone just said this in chat unreal unreal engine owned by epic who has 2200 employees epic games 2200 employees remember they made fortnite minimum right and they're still making a bunch of updates that Unity has 7 700 employees yeah that's so CR I still I'm still trying to think of what does 7 700 people do this is that this is no problem Unity is a game engine company operating on web scale Logistics basically and that does not work right it doesn't work they they kept trying to make it work with ads it doesn't work yeah they will make all the money because that's a real play they want ads they're going to make a lot more money from ads uh it just seems this all seems kind of wild I you know I'm curious what but their ads topped out I mean they have their whole their ads already make more than their engine so where where's the they they don't have that kind of growth in their ad space left I don't think Hmm right maybe I don't know app love and they make a lot more app love and makes a lot more than Unity and so okay so you think they can get more customers basically just to transition yeah they you know they I mean there's a I mean how many trillions of hours are there per year on on mobile games just just mobile games right like there has to be a pretty good surface area for them to go after anyways how much does applevin make I'm curious how much do they make in Revenue a year I don't know but they tried to buy Unity they make more than Unity they offer 20 billion for Unity which was effectively uh it was like 1.5 x their market cap interesting so they make enough to say I'll give you 20 billion which is still not as much as Elon offered on Twitter but they still good point all right I'm gonna look that up well let's go to the next one I'm gonna look that up so I can see what they're uh yeah well hopefully it works for everybody going forward too I think it it seems viable and it seems a lot better than the uh the previous one so I'm good with it so far let's go over um I got I want to get into these trust questions soon so let's get into the next one has the stagnation over the engine over the last several years been in part due to low revenue and will this price change fix that has that been like an internal thing where you just don't have the money to invest in whatever the new thing is that you're working on or get it done or is that not an issue I'm I have no idea what the answer is well I'm not going to accept the word stagnation because because we are extremely focused and have been for years in a huge amount of things that we're putting into the engine and by the way I know that um we get a lot of feedback where the engine isn't the editor doesn't work in ways that people want whether things that we could do better so I'm not trying to say that but we're focused in every one of our releases on putting out a bunch of new stuff like the 22 LTS I believe was really great LTS we made a ton of progress on things like dots 1.0 uh multiplayer and other features there's way more for us to do but we invest across an extraordinary number of platforms to make sure that Unity remains performant that it's easy to build games across those platforms forms and we're focused on continually adding features and functionality to make games better there's more for us to do and I want to invest deeply in it and but I don't believe we've stagnated I believe we've every one of those has been better and I believe you know the feedback we get where things aren't are always what pushes us to do better okay so the question was about stagnation just in case you were really looking into this this money question uh I mean I think one thing that's probably unfair with the stagnation question is that depends on the probably the complexity of the game you're making if you make several simple games maybe you don't notice that Unity has made some changes that just don't mean a lot to you uh so you know I don't try to I I tend not to trust every person's word when they say these things but at the same because you know ask somebody when was the last time Netflix is a home screen change they'll be like it hasn't changed in years and you're like actually it's changed like every two months it's like it's radically different you just don't notice it because it's hard to put a value or or something on there so it right is that I mean but it is I mean but I still hear it quite a bit which is there's just like Godot there's recently a post where someone's like I just made this blurred character in Godot in 20 minutes and I've been trying to do this for years in unity why like why is Unity popular and so I don't know it's interesting I mean this would be where where it would help I think you were saying uh Lana should come on the stream and you know this is where it would help to have someone who's whose bread and butter is working with unity right I simply don't know I hear the same things you hear but because I don't work with unity I don't know I I think possibly what people are reacting to is hey we expected more out of this engine and we feel like it's kind of treading water that doesn't mean necessarily that it's not still having work done on it it just means things people maybe imagined more seamless asset streaming better high-end rendering features a better level of detail management who knows what it is right in their head they thought because Unity announces these things and they hire people to work on them dots was a big thing they did all this stuff I suspect what they're really responding to is probably these things don't seem to be really transforming game development for people using Unity the way that maybe they hoped they would uh but I don't know it would I would love to hear from some Unity developers their specific feedback here because you know you and I don't really do this for our job yeah I've played I've played with unity but it doesn't make me an expert at all yeah I mean people who have to ship with it right they know uh this stuff and you know I don't I don't all right here we go okay I I won the multiplayer side at least I've seen some really good improvements so I tend to support it there's more to do but uh you know Unity is so used across such a large variety of use cases that like there are lots of like in any one of them 2D 3D multiplayer there's I'm proud of work that we've done and I would say that there's a lot more for us still to do yeah I I Unity is still my favorite engine it still does the most stuff that I need to do your favorite and I I haven't had a whole lot of complaints personally I know a lot of people have specific complaints about different systems and just some very valid ones um but overall it's been I think pretty pretty good um can you talk about this is okay here this is a a big one can you talk about the stock distribution and selling complaints because I I expect you probably can't oh I like this one so this is the stock distribution and selling complaints I actually think it's gonna be a huge nothing Burger but let's find out too much about it because I don't know he's not gonna tell us he's gonna say listen four times but I I but I'm still I hope we get something here anything about stock laws and all that stuff but I've seen all kinds of conspiracy theories posted about how you know people want Microsoft to buy the company and they're selling all their stock and all kinds of different things and I have no idea what how much of it is based in any kind of fact or rumor or just totally made up or what so and some of it's about like I know there were some complaints about uh Jr selling some stock which I assume he does regularly though and I I don't really know so can you talk about this and just explain that situation or is it something yeah no I'm happy to I'm happy to answer it I mean the the simple truth is that um all of the like Key Senior Executives like have extraordinary rules like legal rules on when that they can trade stock because of they have material non-public information or whatever the term is and so for almost all of us they're on this plan um can be something planned that you sort of have to commit the stock here and then it sells on a certain number of times and you have no control over it because the only way that you can actually trade the stock is to make sure that it trades in a way that you have no control so that stuff happens and every time it happens anything else that's happening someone says aha they did this thing when typically it's either you know uh that automated plan or that it was being you know some shares were granted and then that was the taxes that were being sold or whatever so that's the general I don't know about a specific so but I will tell you that I actually write a lot that particular one comes up every time anybody any one of those gets reported because they all have to be reported uh publicly but they're all on like automated plans so for those that don't know I I actually I share some of these rules at Netflix so I am not allowed to sell shares except for on specific intervals at specific times and I have to make multi-month like plans ahead of time to be able to sell something so it's like if I'm gonna sell something I'm like come on do good don't fall apart you know because you have to bet on the economy still doing good you know like I accidentally got a sold at 680 on Netflix stock the next month it was at 190 or something so you know like did I get did I get lucky I got real lucky on that one and so you know I it's actually probably a fair answer there I don't think they're doing some sort of Insider selling right beforehand because I don't see how it benefits them especially if they want to get bought if they want to get bought the stock the stonk's going up I I think uh realistically though what I would say is I think his answer is totally correct meaning that there's no chance that this was some kind of weird like dump and then an outs kind of scheme uh but what I would say is if you take a look at unity's stock price over the past several years what you could clearly see there is any executive would be crazy not to be selling their stock as fast as they can because it's been nothing but a giant down I mean if they could have sold all their stock back when it was at like 160 or whatever it was at they would have right so I think uh this misses a little bit of perspective which is do any did any of the executives think it was going to ride at 160 I doubt they did so I I mean I think they are somewhat negative on the future of their company they probably don't think it's worth 160 and that it's probably worth more down where it is right now like 30 or 40. so you know I mean it his answer is correct but also I don't think if you were like ask these guys oh if you could hold this for another 10 years and sell them then would you I don't think they would be like yeah that it's definitely gonna be worth way more in 10 years right we're gonna make tens of billions I don't think they probably think that right now I mean maybe they do maybe they're Eternal apps but it's you know so I think there's a little also a little tinge there but otherwise yeah I mean I don't think there was any weird timing Happening Here that's kind of yeah what I I assumed that you don't get to make those decisions and that you probably wouldn't want to because it's just too risky anyway and the amounts of stock that I I'm in there may be some other ones that are different but the the thing that I'd seen was a relatively low amount of uh stock and money for Jr yeah people were talking about so I wasn't sure what was why that was a big deal but maybe there's more to it and I don't know but yeah I assume it's like I said it was all kind of automated too um especially after talking to a couple people who explained it so um David helgson posted on I said that I lost my words so David posted on Facebook that he thought you up did you not consult your board before you decided to roll out this policy I like the way that that's that's good question here yeah it's on my Facebook but he's one of my Facebook friends so I definitely saw the post but I think they're the most the most important part there is it's not actually correct he said we up and uh David number one is on the board number two bleeds Unity number three is super connected to this particular the the game developer community in out and uh he has uh you know I think his pulse on what people are saying and people are talking to him all the time and you know he's saying the the uh you know we should have listened to more feedback and um you know he's right I bet he was he's on the board so I assume the whole board you know I think he would put himself uh you know he's on the board board was was in all those sorts of things but uh yeah and you know he doesn't like disappointing our creators any more than any of us do a little Maya culpa there we messed up ah I'm on the board trust us I'm gonna say because it's super radical that's just how I take those things you're not wrong I'm on the board but I'm still cool I will swear in public I mean everyone's in a hoodie on this call right everyone's in a hoodie Prime well you're not in a hoodie Casey no I mean I mean the people on their call and it was so I know everyone is cool let's go hoodie Central all right we'll keep going yeah nobody does that's a totally understandable okay I I would assume the whole board has has some insight and visibility and say on this kind of stuff all right now it's time for the uh the big question one that everybody keeps asking about in chat and um I think everybody is really really curious to know they want to know yeah that's a good time for water too without a drink double it up yeah this is a big one so how is Unity planning to regain the trust of its users after you change the terms of service on them overnight yeah just the biggest concern I think everybody has let's hear it it's a great question and there's only there's only one way to answer that and that's it to actions with words so the first thing I'll tell you is I'm committed to making sure that we continue to work as hard as we can to earn your trust that said actions show that not words now here's a couple of actions that we're taking today one is what I said about the terms of service to make sure that it's in there so that you can see action that's around that and see it inside of uh the actual terms number two is that's why we are doing things like putting the GitHub repo back up because we want to make sure that there's also visibility that's another way that we can make sure that there's visibility into our actions and the people see it but um I I totally get um you know trust is easy to lose and it's hard to earn and uh we have to show it and then people will judge us based on that and so my job our job is to make sure that we build the right tools go about it the right way and then see people see that and then it's up to them to make their own determination about trust I I can't tell you that you should trust me you have to decide that on your own that that's fair I think in the um on the terms of service thing one of the questions that came up earlier that I think is related to this is if you're locking them with a specific version so like 2019 is in the 2019 in terms of service or whatever is there anything um that stops you from just changing that in the future or is there like a legal thing in that terms of services we're not going to change this and we won't be changing this in the future or is there like oh people are worried that you know you could say that now and then three years from now just change it again I mean three years from now 2019 and 2020 it'll be pretty old but so yeah well um I mean we're not going to I you know I wrote that letter and I wouldn't put in the letter if I if I wasn't didn't think that the company was going to stand up for it uh and so we're not going to but that's why we're putting it in the terms it's words in the terms not just words in my letter um you know someone someone told me that bold text is not legal I said okay we're putting something bold in in an email and why we're gonna make sure like death repo uh you know and we'll make sure that we keep putting it on the website including what changed uh we'll make sure there are clearer systems there but that's how we're showing it I you know I don't know what other actions I can take other than that but that's what we're going to try to do as a company to make sure I'm gonna give I'm gonna give a controversial take here Casey and you're gonna probably call me you're gonna probably call me a nice guy again I actually think his answer wasn't bad I I think it was horrible okay let me give me my explanation though I'll give you yours I do not believe there's a single thing that he could have said that would have made me earn trust back he's 100 correct in two years we'll see if we have trust back and so I I I'm on I'm on that team that he actually can't will it into existence Casey go uh I agree with that part of what you said for sure however what he said in and of itself already tells me that he is untrustworthy the reason for that is because they already did and said everything he just said there is literally a post on unity's official corporate blog where they say exactly in fact you know what prime if you don't mind pausing long enough for me to read this to you let me read it this is from January 2019 their corporate blog retroactive TOS changes when you obtain a version of unity and don't upgrade your project we think you should be able to stick to that version of the terms of service in practice that is only possible if you have access to bug fixes for this reason we now allow users to continue to use the terms of service for the same major year-based version number including LTS builds that you are using in your project moving forward we will host TOS changes on GitHub to give developers full transparency about what changes are happening and when that's from 2019 Prime okay okay catch from 2019. they deleted it and removed that specific Clause they already removed the Clause he's saying they're adding to buy your trust this is the most untrustworthy thing you could say about this I mean what am I missing no you're here for perhaps the ignorant you know I I really want to believe the best in people but I feel like I just got had I mean this is why I said at the beginning I'm like where's the apology and the explanation for those things what I want to hear is all right look we had some bad actors in the company I wasn't aware of some of these things I should have been it turns out that some of the lawyers or some of the people who are working on this stuff they took a look at this and they thought that they could get away with this terms of service change that was deeply deeply bad unethical Behavior we are firing those people they are gone it will not happen again and we are specifically stating here publicly for everyone to see a verbal contractual agreement that we will no longer try to do anything like this right we will not silently delete this GitHub we will not silently remove terms of service if a term this important is removed we will make a public announcement on the day it is removed right none of these things were said which means they are not taking responsibility for this and they are not actually apologizing they're just going like uh we got to save this company tell them whatever tell them the same thing last time see if they buy it again for three years that's what I heard okay okay you're obviously a bit more in the know man I gotta quit this I gotta start being more of an because there's you're so much better no don't do it don't do it the world doesn't need another me Prime I I like the sweetness it's nicer it's better right you can have me on when you need a little vitriol and then I go away and you're more pleasant that's the better case for the world okay okay but I mean it was an excellent point which is they already stated they would do these things they backpedaled and they're now re-giving it as if it is some new thing which is not new thing but they didn't yeah they made no recognition of the wrong they did and so there's in some sense it's a Lie by Omission which is you don't want you don't want to do that that's Grody it's Grody yep yep all right continue on people is it just gonna take some time probably um so in the meanwhile the next question was why should users keep choosing unity in the future seems like a very soft question I'm sure they meant it as a very mean question and I had a hard question but I think people have a lot of choice there's a lot of really really good game engine and game engine technology out there our job is to make sure that ours is a great way uh that you can make great games across a lot of platforms the thing that makes Unity the best uh and I know this is where a lot of the sort of anger that we've justfully received this week is from our community part of why you you know part of why I would say that you should pick Unity is because we have an extraordinary Community builds extraordinary resources it makes it easy for people to you know work with each other and learn things from each other and um we're going to try to continue to make sure that we build tools that make that continue to be there um and you know be there with you and then again you definitely have choices and it's our job to make sure that you feel like ours is the best choice I feel like every game so he effectively why should someone choose Unity and he cites that's good Community lots of good learning resources lots of good sources I mean I guess for me that that Rings true the only time I ever used Unity I looked up a bunch of stuff is is pretty easy to use it was a good experience I haven't used Godot so I can't really you know I don't have a lot I can say about Godot but you know when I used Unity it was good experience and I mean I think the number of people who use Unity it speaks for itself I mean obviously people like this product and they want to use it if they didn't this would all be over already everyone would just be gone and there'd be no right the only people who would still remain are people who have are too far in development for their games to to pull out so I think people do want to use Unity uh no matter it doesn't it doesn't matter what I think of the engine doesn't matter any of that stuff it just matters do people want this thing and they do so I think his answer is correct that's why people use it unfortunately that means they'll be using it under this really sort of shady Arrangement that they don't know if their partner is really an ethical partner and that's why at least for people like me I'm so kind of invested in this particular controversy is because I I am legitimately worried about that I don't like to see people who just want to develop games getting screwed like this and I'm really worried about that thing so so you know I think his answer is correct but I wish it wasn't necessarily that that way okay that's that's fair that's a fair take right there um let's keep on going actually I hear pirate software he's also here and he is wondering if he wants to join and I say absolutely devices was the kind of pushing point and it's one of the things that also I think keeps a lot of people in unity because unity's got this this wide access to it's right past the line after whatever the hell you wanted to do and for the most part just works and it's pretty straightforward um got 15 minutes left I want to see if I can get through a bunch more of these questions um this one we've kind of talked about it a little bit already but how is Unity going to legally ensure that they can't retroactively change the TOs again is there any I mean you kind of answered this earlier but I don't know if there's any more you want to say about it yeah we're gonna uh to me there's two things we can do I'll just call it uh trust and verify I guess trust do and verify so we're saying it very clearly we're going to put it in our terms and then we're going to make it clear and easy to track by making sure it's in our GitHub so that you can check to see whether there's something that's changed in any of those terms of services you mean like it was originally that's the way we're addressing like how the how we do it uh but okay hold on so I got to put a pause here was it in their terms or was it on their website because those are two it was in the terms it was in the terms on the website and in the GitHub uh prime it was removed in April of this year uh it is literally you can now because they restored the GitHub you can even now go and read the section on the GitHub that was removed but if you'd like I can read it for you now it happens to be up on my screen the term that was in there okay so this is part of the terms of service part of the their actual literal terms of service it said Unity May update these Unity software additional terms at any time for any reason and without notice as you'd expect and those updated terms will apply to the most recent current year version of the unity software provided that if the updated terms adversely affect your rights sorry adversely impact your rights you may elect to continue to use any current year versions of the unity software They removed that they removed it they removed it oh so this is why I'm so stiff that actually shows the diffing of it going from yes it's red it's gone this is why I'm so amazed by this because his comments saying like oh we're going to do all these things we're going to do it look how good we're doing look how much better we're doing as a company you removed this for this problem to happen like you can't just shoot yourself in the foot and be like look I bought a new boot guys my old one was ruined it's fine like it doesn't make any sense dude like this this kind of behavior is very strange to me legitimately you cannot just go and delete that and then be like we're doing better by putting it back in the exact same thing that you remove that caused this problem in the first place that's crazy dude you'll also notice that when asked about this because that question did come up on the stream what he specifically said was he was unaware that GitHub existed and that's all he said he didn't say who had removed it why it was removed why the terms of service were changed or if there were any consequences for the people who did that so in other words he's not aware of it and by the way he's the person who is selected to come out and talk about this instead of the person who was aware of it and did cause this right who would have had to field the questions and would have had to explain why they did that they intentionally have someone talking about this particular thing who can absolve themselves from responsibility saying they weren't aware and then he just moved on no mention of anything else so again extremely untrustworthy I was I was really kind of yeah it's it's the media training response it was very bad What About You video training response but the problem is it's provably false that's the issue yeah I mean yeah Atlanta what about you on all this the TOs is the biggest thing I think because well there's two things okay one is that we um we didn't get an explanation as around the TOs so we have no reason to believe that it won't happen again because we don't know why it happened in the first place and like you guys said the thing that they're saying is is how you can believe that we're not gonna do it by the same thing that just happened but we don't understand why it happened in the first place so that's kind of unresolved I think um the other thing that's unresolved is they keep saying when people say like why did this happen in the first place they keep saying we didn't listen to the community we should have listened to the community but they are not putting in action ways to listen to the community so that this doesn't happen again in the future so I he did like I think he needs to they need to come up with something if that's the reason that that it happened in the first place they need to make sure it doesn't by fixing the problem that that's there I guess yeah I mean because I mean twitch apparently does this as well which I'm not 100 purchased on this one but they have twitch ambassadors which are supposed to be people that are representing they get to go in on the in meetings before any of the upcoming twitch changes happen and so every category has one or two ambassadors if it gets to a certain size and that's just how it works and so they're supposed to be informed about all decisions that are made by twitch and it's a publicly known list so there's a list of people that have it to me that seems like a reasonable kind of situation so that if you want to know what's going on you know that there's Representatives that have the semi in story not the full-in story but the semi-in story and at least that would be nice to have people you could point to and you could ask them did they tell you about this price change and if they say no you go but you're on the Ambassador list you know oh that's me that's you you're you're on that list they have Unity insiders I'm on the list and I'm obviously NDA so I can't say too much about it but even just them saying we have a group of unity insiders and we're going to make sure that we get their feedback on decision making or something like that like I can't say I like I said I can't say too much about what's inside those conversations but if they publicly said we will address the Insiders there's a lot of insiders who are have been really vocal about this um and those insiders have shared some of that stuff like not like any Aid stuff but they're communicating and just saying like we will we will do that in the future I think would have helped a bit okay so I don't know if you're allowed to answer this were you were you informed of this thing that happened before it happened I better not say okay fair that's a fair statement I don't want to put you in a weird spot so we'll just move on from that all right let's keep on going so I'm just curious cat all right we're gonna start I'm right around like 3 10. but yeah I I think that's the answer okay um let me get through I'm reading through all of my questions there's a lot of a lot of good stuff here um oh yeah I wanna I wanna take this one because it's one that's uh I think interesting and controversial and you've talked a little bit about this before they wanted to know if they can get a deep technical explanation of how the install-based tracking will work with the exceptions circling right now yeah when I was talking to Dave earlier on this on the stream saying hey I would really love it if Unity had some magic piracy tracker thing that tells me all of my valid installs and tells me all of the pirated ones didn't just briefly answer that one well our focus is on self-reported and our focus is on first off I'm not the Deep technical expert to give a deep technical answer on anything just you know I wouldn't try to pretend to be because then I would really get uh picked apart but the answer is it's self-reporting and our focus is on making sure that we're clear on um data that works that's easily accessible that you have like store reports and things like that and if you don't want to do that that you have a choice and that you can just do the 2.5 Revenue share and then by the way we are going to enter into like hey yeah let's have a conversation with Rd technical experts and your detectable experts and we'll continue to build you know more ways to make sure that we're all clear there okay yeah uh the the is on the proprietary uh they're proprietary algorithm and they're relying on self-reporting uh how long do you think self-reporting is gonna last I know I keep saying a year that's my guess yeah that's complete not answered from them there's no way to enforce self-reporting there's no way to actually detect piracy in that way effectively um unless you're pulling a lot of analytics from the end user which you're going to run you're gonna run into violations of gdpr with that like they can't they can't do what they're talking about not effectively I have a feeling I'm this is just speculation that what they're doing with this because everyone's confused by this like you said it's difficult you can't really track the things that we're all worried about right I have a feeling that they're they're basically doing both everyone's like why isn't it just a rep split this is just again me trying to make sense of this um if you use their analytic tools if you use their tools that are used to track whatever things um to monetize to put ads in your game then you get numbers I'm assuming you would and will get numbers from that which you can use to report the thing and if it works out to be less than 2.5 percent obviously you're going to continue to use those tools to so I think it's more of like a encouragement for people to use their tools is my guess but do you think that it would be making an immense amount of friction if you don't use their tools then it would be a 2.5 fee which I'm assuming is going to be likely to be less in most cases but who knows okay it sounds like an incentive to use their ads at that point that would make the most sense like we were talking about before I'm also not sure that it it really completely addresses some of people's questions because a lot of the questions were around what actually is the number that we're supposed to be counting here like how does that counting work and so saying well it's going to be self-reported well self-reported again is it which I think I said before isn't a specification that's just saying we're going to trust your numbers until we audit you which is fine I mean that's a thing that you can do in a contract but the question is what numbers are you asking us to report when you say we're supposed to report installs well what are we supposed to report every time the user installs it every time the user purchased a thing they could have installed like what is it so I still think that is it per unique user like they need to clarify and you know they did clarify that I believe it's so what's up I believe it's per distribution platform I believe I'm not 100 but it's like once on Steam if you if you get it on Android um not through like if you get it um on your laptop and your computer through Steam that's still one but if you get it on like if you get like the mobile app version of it that's one and if you get like the desktop version that's one so it's not perfect how about this too how long does it take until that's no longer like valid so like if you have a user that downloads your game they play it they don't like it they leave it alone for an entire year and come back you get charged twice how long do we hold that data for how long do we track the unique user information monthly no not just monthly like what if that person goes and reinstalls your game every month oh yeah that's a good question actually yeah unique or not and I don't know if steam provides like the exact detail hooks for you to be like well user you know Bob gmail.com downloaded it in November so I don't have to I need to dedupe Bob manually from here on out yeah so I have games up on Steam and I can't pull that information I can't actually find out individual installs I can find out individual purchases and how many refunds I get and how many of those purchases are through the steam environment or through the steam key and that's pretty much it man I can know where in the world they are but I don't know how many times they installed that game well again I just like to emphasize too that that really can't be the complete answer because if it was that's just sales if all they're asking for is how many of each of these platforms did users you know click purchase even if that purchase was zero dollars they're just talking about sales numbers that's not an install account an install count has to mean something different than how many times was this thing quote unquote bought in each of these stores because why would you call that an install it's not an install yeah so at that point I as a as a developer that Launches on Steam I would never be able to have the metrics that they require for this to work even to self-report it or they're just naming it weird and they shouldn't have called it installed so that's why I say like you know it's not necessarily a huge deal here but I'm saying the the the confu Fusion has not really been cleared at least not to my mind I I wouldn't really know exactly what they meant yeah I I think you said specifically the the language around the insults before was when the user is installed install the game still like I don't know how much we can take that right I I said on the stream he specifically said oh well if the person how many times the per you know how many people on Steam have bought the thing basically he kind of described it as if it was a sale and I'm like but that's not an install so again I just think because they're trying to spell confusion it's not working I'm even more confused now than I was before yeah no I think the biggest the biggest danger to that for that for me is specifically how long do we store that user data for and what is the legality around storing that user that unique user thumbprint anyway like it's going to be different in every region gdpr is very restrictive about that kind of stuff you can't just do that like on you know doing doing it on your own with no reason it's very anti-gdpr it's not a good idea so like that is pretty dangerous to me and then also the idea that it is self-reported means there's always going to be fudging of the numbers there's always going to be an audit structure that they haven't described yet that audit structure could lead to the collapse of your studio or a massive Bill fine to you if you don't do it correctly and it's not really well explained right now this whole thing feels pretty ham-fisted and like they didn't think it out before throwing it out to the public and making sure that it was like law now and they haven't walked that portion of it back the install structure which makes no sense I I really still think that this should just be a revenue share model it should just be a REV share model throw out all this weird that they've been doing and it it just walk that part back because it's not it's not enforceable it doesn't make sense in a business setting and we can't get the metrics for that anyway and it may not even be legal to get those metrics so I think one thing you're missing is that I think what happened here is that Unity saw the massive success that is the tax code in America and figured that maybe we could they could do the same thing right we provide we self-report until they say no you did it wrong and then they coming out of us they could get a whole IRS division going on it could be pretty good you know because real talk like unironically you have to hire people to audit you actually have to hire Unity IRS to be able to know if that happened which just that just feels I can't wait for the unity cops to show up at my door dude they're gonna break my kneecaps terrifying we're Unity cops yeah they're after me dude we should probably move on because it's just it's minutia anyway and there's many ways like people in the chat are mentioning things and I agree with the people in the chat that the things they're saying are potentially what this could mean but what I'm trying to point out is until we have like really good very explicit explanations of exactly what it means it's not good enough because sure all of those pot are possible right it could be that they're just you know using the term install because they don't want to use sales because they want to capture the fact that something might be zero dollars but like again until we see the actual list of here is exactly how an auditor who comes to your company and audits your books will determine what you owe it's just kind of conjecture as to what it will really mean in practice so and I haven't seen that if you can link to that that'd be great but I haven't seen that yeah because currently from what I've seen it's a lot of we'll have that no I don't I don't want a future we'll have that yeah you need to have it now that should be set up before you roll something like this out but anyway beating a dead horse so all right we're at uh 11 34. like the the self-reporting is the the key thing here that uh people don't didn't know about and I mean I didn't know about either and you know really made it kind of a big mess so I want to go on to another question that just popped up about um they're wondering if you still believe the runtime fee policy Works given all this backlash do you think it's still a good idea I get the sense that you do but I I think the um I think this is a really important critical program for Unity I think what we announced last week and you know made some changes for today it's critical foundation for the company I think the choice is a good thing I personally believe that when people do it you should try the calculator try it in with your number see whether it works for you or not they might find that they're going to just pay less if they do like based on uh initial engagements versus the revenue share and that's awesome that's actually why we wanted to build it that way um we think that it actually tracks well it's a shared success model and um you know gives a way for people to not have to pay as much so yeah I really do believe it's going to be a strong program yeah I feel like for the majority of developers it's probably going to be pretty good like it's it's a lot better than a a big Revenue cut or than a lot of big Revenue cuts um especially if you're doing like a 20 or 50 or 60 game and when you guys were thinking this through like well I guess what was that kind of the ration that the rationale was just like if you're building a 20 game this is a nothing fee to you and if you're building a massive you know massive game where you're not charging very much but you're making millions and millions you're still paying something I guess I'm also curious why was the like revcap not initially considered in there was it just thought that it wasn't even needed that it was never going to go that high or was it just planned like hey we wanted I mean obviously I know that the idea is that okay we want to take 200 were not realistic and I assume that you always probably want it to be under unreal's percentage was was my kind of guess but why was that not kind of in in there from the beginning is there a reason there was kind of left out well listen this is a transformative business model change something that we're really really focused on uh and when we were working on our models we expected that the vast majority of people would pay you know two to three percent and often less and uh so one of the things we heard when we put it out there is that yes even even if that was the case it was hard to plan for it because there are these outlier situations that maybe you couldn't control and for some cases where we were like well if there's a case that's that that doesn't work um and we should have we should have just communicated this better and we should have planned for this better we're it's not our intent to charge someone you know like a crazy percentage or anything we're not going to do that um but you know we needed to fix it so that people can plan and have this 2.5 Revenue share or do this particular so that they have Choice uh but you know the real fundamental idea we always thought that this was going to be somewhere around two to three percent so like you know we're um frankly just building on this transformative business model I'm fine skipping this question it's just about the money I think we kind of talked that one to death right yeah I'm really surprised that he believed that that type of install model would end up being two to three percent that's very strange um because we've shown so many different examples of how that is not the case even other developers have shown them how that is not the case that's really weird um it makes me wonder where like where inside of unity did they determine that value it's probably honestly it's probably an average you know that's the problem about average is that it hides yeah or it hides a lot of outliers and in this case when you are building something that is used by such a wide number of people those outliers you've ruined their business you've ruined their Studio you've ruined potentially their lives they've poured years or like maybe even a decade into a game and now they can't make any money off of it because you've changed your business model like this that's a big deal that's really shitty yeah it is a big deal but they do say that they're going to cap it at the 2.5 so they do say you will never pay more which is why I really do think it's just going to be like if you want to this is my again I'm just guessing here if you want to see what you have to pay 2.5 if you want to know what your alternative payment amount would be install our tracking tools and then it will just show up and it probably won't be perfectly accurate like you said there's a lot of potential for problems with that and whether it's the type of game you're selling or the um fraudulent activity but assuming that that's less then people be like okay great I'll keep using these tools I'll keep so that that's that's all I can I thought I can guess there if they're capping it yeah I think I think the in in freemium models it's always going to cost more always like if a freemium game is going to do that because they have so many installs to total revenue that you're never going to want to do that at all um I I think the other thing that's really weird is he posted as an option it's like oh this could be an option for you but one of those options like for doing the cost per install you have to download their entire tool set and go through that entire process for that just to see like you said to see what the cost would be that's a lot of extra stuff to do that's a whole lot of extra stuff and then on top of it again I don't know how it collects this metrics or for how long right and at that point do you get to choose like there's there's so many different things it's like oh you know what you're a business that wants money this number is larger than that number so I'm just going to go with this number from now on I'm not going to use your tools like how long does that last I'm interested in seeing that I have some questions oh sorry I I also wanted to bring up the trust Point again I hate to be the person who constantly just says the trust is the issue but to me this answer again sort of sidesteps the actual problem here which is that when these install fees were initially rolled out it was very clear why it wasn't a revenue share it was because the revenue has already happened the install fees were clearly designed to be able to recapture money from games that had already been shipped and paid for but we're now going to be installed again in 2024. that's the only reason I can think of why they did it that way because they wanted to capture money from revenue that was already out the door that they can't go Club back in any real way and so again I didn't hear an answer to that question why is the revenue cap or the revenue model only arriving now after the backlash and I think if it hadn't have been for trying to claw back that previous revenue and take it for Unity we would have seen that alternative in the initial package so again in terms of my like trust radar just huge red warning lights about that it's like this is extremely untrustworthy and I didn't hear anything to explain away that seemingly very obvious explanation for why it wasn't in there to begin with yeah it also smells a lot of like the General Corporate stance of punch really hard and then when people are upset then punch a little bit softer but now you get most of the things that you wanted in there and people accept it because it seems a little bit better than it was originally and I I honestly think that most of this monetization model they put together is kind of like I don't think there's anything in there that I would be happy with whatsoever um a REV share only model is the only thing that I could see going forward making any sense at all Fair all right let's let's move on we're at 8 20. yeah it felt to me like one of those things that was probably thought internally and just never put down on paper everybody just kind of assumed that it would be that like I saw all the posts in the calculations and stuff and saw the numbers notes my default reaction was like I went to like watching Mythbusters and like that just doesn't seem plausible like if they did that like everybody would leave and you wouldn't have to so it wouldn't make any sense at all so by the way we didn't help either right because if we had the calculator because as soon as we didn't have the calculator maybe they didn't you know and we didn't communicate the details well enough so then the answers themselves you know the the way they calculated it was it didn't match what we were trying to do we didn't provide any other information that's on us we didn't do a good enough job building out the information to make it clear but even beyond that the plan that I think we have now uh is a better plan because it gives people predictability and it gives them choice yeah I think that the and it gives them a lower rate on well at least it gives the guys that I know a lower rate because they're working on these uh high-end PC games and stuff it makes a makes it much lower there was another question about uh which I think is pretty pretty important one about um going forward um how you plan to kind of work with the community on big decisions maybe not just on like big pricing ones but other big decisions in the future like um are you going to start reaching out for uh because honestly I feel like from the beginning it would have been great if there was some public polling just reaching out to all Unity developers maybe even a little thing that pops up in the unity Hub that says hey go fill out this form how do you feel about this thing um give us your feedback I thought something like that would be would be good do you guys have plans to do anything like going forward with the community to figure out these new you know new decisions especially when they're big ones that are going to piss off a lot of people well listen I've been really focused over last week on getting this particular plans uh updated and make sure we could get back out um I think by the way the idea that you just gave is a really great idea I think pulling putting it in the editor and sort of finding other ways to connect is awesome but yes we will do it I don't have any other kind of key things to talk about there except for one which which I also um I'm really excited about like uh this is our first real in-person unite back this year I think one of the best way that these things happen are in GDC and dice and Gamescom and certainly at unite where we're together having time to talk specifically about where Unity is and where Unity is going we'll be back at unite in Amsterdam uh first time since I think 2019 that we've we did a kind of a hybrid one last year but the first real one of being back in person and I think we miss having that like just as a and you know beyond you know the like hey let me Pitch the unite is coming up the actual thing itself of not having as much of that where devs themselves are all together and all with unity together and we're talking about where we're going um I'm glad we're getting back to that because I think it's really important yeah I'm excited for unite too especially now that I think things are uh mostly better and that most of the the issues that at least at least uh it's about unite and stuff I don't does anyone have any comments on this no in Atlanta have you been to unite yeah they brought me to the last one was it fun what is it like it was a blast yeah I was really looking forward to one in Amsterdam I'm not sure um what's going on with that now okay yeah I wonder how how the tone will change in that event from this few insiders who have publicly said that they won't be going so I think I think the tone will be pretty different I don't know if they're gonna be I mean I assume they're going to be getting feedback from everyone who goes based on his answer and I really like Jason's suggestion like that would be cool to just see like regular polling regular feedback and like asking the community the whole Community not just the Insiders like um what they want to see on the products regularly I think that'd be cool yeah yeah let people feel like they have a little bit more input on the direction what's important to them during development all right I wonder if it was unite anything like twitchcon have you been to twitchcon people smell better I can tell you that much this was in Montreal it they had like a bunch of talks they announced new stuff um networking events um it was cool it was really cool I'm imagined similar to twitchcon okay uh by the way the the joke that people at twitchcon sting it's not entirely untrue there's been a few unsavory smells there all right and put us in one place like I live in my basement I don't leave this room you kidding me put me outside not in the sun even also I don't know what is the notion that a lot of game developers are are going to be better as a as a overall Aroma I mean have you not heard the legendary stories of TIG Jam dude I get the best of both worlds on both of those things awful you don't want me in the room okay maybe maybe you're all right maybe they we should have some sort of competition here said the best of each you saying a stink off the primer can yearly stink off keep going I will just finish this out and then yeah issues that I had and a lot of the people I talked to personally had are pretty much addressed um I mean there's still people talk about trust in the company and stuff but I think we had a discussion about this earlier that like trusting companies is a is a strange thing anyway like you wanted to trust that a company's not going to do bad stuff but yeah it's not what I I don't base any of my personal feelings or emotions on Trust on the company because I feel like every company is a company like they change they morph they merge and you know they sell and all kinds of random stuff happens and yeah it's a it's a tough one but hopefully you're able to kind of rebuild some of that I think it could probably happen with a lot of these changes especially the the retroactive removal thing I think that's gonna that that kind of alleviates most people at least like I said most people I know is concerned obviously not everybody in chat and obviously not not all the unity developers by the way yes we are live for a couple people who seem to be confused about it well um I know we have a hard stop in like four minutes because you've got I'm sure a ton of other stuff to do today but I want to just give you a chance to say any like last words and stuff poor people I think I've gone through all the questions that I had on if you got any final words or you know parting things that you want to tell people before we go yeah I really appreciate the feedback um really tough feedback this week deserved feedback I really appreciate it makes us better um and frankly Unity is what it is because of uh this extraordinary community of game creators building extraordinary games and the if there's anything that the last week shows if you pull Unity out of it is that the extraordinary passion that everybody here has for what they do their livelihood their games um it's I mean it is inspiring um it's inspiring uh so I know we have work to do uh I know that um you know this announcement while I feel very very strong about the set of changes that we announced I feel very passionate about this transformative business model um we have work to do to continue to earn your trust every day to make sure that we build the best version of unity we can um so thank you for the feedback cool yeah and hopefully everybody keeps um just sending their feedback post on Twitter let everybody know what you think about the new changes and hopefully uh everybody is mostly happy with stuff I mean like I said I am but I'm a happy dude and it pisses people off so I totally understand I don't mean to be too happy and make too many people angry but it's hard for me not to anyway thanks again Mark I appreciate it this was um helpful and thank you especially for um well listening to everybody's feedback and not just doubling down and saying hey we're sticking with this screw you all you know whatever like I like that you guys actually made the changes that I think addressed most of the people's problems so thanks again for that and thanks for coming on in and answering these questions I really appreciate it all right thanks I really appreciate the time Jason thank you everybody for for being here all right thank you Mark all right I'm gonna cut it here okay so I I do have one I have to ask Atlanta because Atlanta actively has a game about the drop uh like how overall I know you're Insider and I don't know what the rules are and all those kind of things but overall with all these changes going forward is is Unity still the choice do you still think it's the best choice for you know someone getting started in the game World does it make you wish that you did things in Godot or Unreal Engine or whatever or are those things kind of like because I know people always say that people are very hyperbolic on the Internet is there truth to that or is Unity still a pretty solid option that's a that's a loaded question um I mean I'm I'm stuck with unity until the game's done like that's that's not really um in question right like that's part of the problem is you're so dependent on your game engine because you're so invested and you put so much into learning it and making your game in it like you can't just change near the end of a project if you want to you can't do that so that's why this was an important issue and um is it the right choice moving forward I don't know I I was saying earlier today like that the couple of the reasons I chose Unity one was no matter how much money you make they take a flat rate per month like it was honestly too good to be true like that to me was a huge selling point like you can make as much money as you like and you just pay the monthly fee yeah um yeah there's like tiers but it's still if you pay five percent versus like a couple thousand a year it's so much less if you're successful so like if you're building a company and you want to pick the engine that's going to be like the best monetization option that was easily Unity like glaringly obvious so that's definitely it was a pro for Unity that's no longer there they do have still you know 2.5 is competitive compared to the five percent of unreal and stuff but the other thing that was a big party Unity was the community like there's so many uh accessible tutorials and so many places to ask for help and so many people asking questions and those questions already answered it was so rare that I'd go online if I was stuck on something and someone had not already encountered it and someone else had not already answered it like that was so cool that was a really cool part of unity and to see so many people leaving because of the problems that were caused from this so disheartening like so disheartening so um right now I don't know I'm just kind of I'm just kind of seeing how things go like I'm I'm using it regardless for at least a few more months probably longer with um wrapping up strain yeah um and then I'm gonna kind of take it from there so it's it's hard to say right now but it's definitely a hit to the engine unfortunately even with these changes that they put in place can I have something to that question as well uh we had a question earlier uh before I think it was actually only me and Prime were on and maybe you can speak to this we because we don't really use Unity for game development we were wondering a lot of people have said that in the past few years Unity has not really been making much in terms of advancements to the engine or that people haven't been feeling like the engine has been improving or that it's in fact maybe regressing like there's been more bugs or anything like this people have been saying those sorts of things what's your take on that like like has it been noticeably different or is it basically the same have you been pleased with the improvements they've been making disappointed like do you have any insight into that that's a good question um I have heard people mention that as well I wouldn't say I've noticed it regressing I think that's pretty severe if it was getting worse um they're like they're pretty good at least maintaining it when bugs come up they tend to fix them um I think I think people are comparing it to Unreal a lot and they're seeing things like nanite and Lumen and they're like when do we get that we want that we want this and I think that if you compare to the engine then there's some things like depending how it goes you might be disappointed by it with in that sense but I I don't know I've been really enjoying using Unity up until recently it's been stressful um and uh the tools I use have been great and there's new tools coming in regularly and honestly another part of the community being awesome is there's all kinds of like cool assets being made all the time some of which some of those creators are no longer going to be with uni so again disappointing on that side um but I've I've enjoyed using it I can't I can't comment on that note yeah a lot of people are actually talking about like what engine should I use I saw a couple people talking about it in chat um if you're trying to choose an engine to make a game project there's really only three criteria you have to look at in general and the first one is does this engine provide the features that I need to build the kind of game that I want to build can I build the kind of game I want in this engine that's number one number two is the business model there's this business model actually match with the amount of income that my studio has or the funding that we currently have and the third one is does the workflow work for me and my team those are the three biggest things that you have to ask whenever you're trying to build anything inside of an engine and the problem is is with this current change to Unity it has thrown that monetization like question completely out the window for a lot of people and they're already signed on to that contract so it sends it ends up being really really devastating for them so if you look at the other two options though like the the feature set is still there the feature set's still fine you know the workflow is still good and still fine but you also have Alternatives now and if you go and look at Godot Godot is basically the same in terms of workflow for quite a lot of stuff and it's free at open source so you never have to worry about that monetization side that's one of the questions gone like I I work on my games in game maker Studio because we have 2D games I got that license on a hundred dollars lifetime license no royalty I don't have that problem I don't have to have a problem because there's alternatives to this right and I'm not going to make a 3D game in that because game maker is not good for 3D but for 2D it does everything that I need it to do you could use Godot for that you could use unreal if you need a feature set for it it's kind of overkill for the kind of game that I'm making but for 2D games you can still do it in unreal you can look at octopath Traveler that was made in unreal a lot of people don't realize that amazing 2.5 d game so like these are the types of things you have to think about with an engine and with them changing their business model this way it's gonna be a really rough time for a lot of people man and I I don't like the new business model I don't like the messaging they put out for this I don't like the one-two corporate punch of like they go oh it's really bad and we're gonna walk it back a little bit but you're still paying more money on this I don't like the the paper install model and these are the types of things that I I know are already turning off the next generation of game developers and current industry Titans are being turned off from it as well because you don't want instability in your engine especially not in the business model that's terrifying dude so I guess my big question is is is 2.5 percent enough for people not to just go for the full five and get unreal like is Unreal Engine that much better these features that you speak of are that much better and I mean it's still up to a million dollars so you know I assume most most games don't make a million dollars is my assumption probably fair or odd probably be making games right now and so it you know how many people will get hit by that and will the will the quote unquote better feature set now that it's become more parity of payment are more people gonna just end up bleeding over to something like unreal you'll come over to two different kinds of things if you need the feature set of unreal I feel like people will end up using Unreal if you don't need the feature set of unreal you will probably use unity in this case because the 2.5 percent is just better that being said unity and Godot eventually Godot is going to overtake that is it laced in the trajectory it has right now and then you'd pay nothing so Unity doesn't really have a good you know a good deal there right if you have something that matches it which is free and you have something that is dramatically better than it that costs double what it costs you have this weird Middle Ground that's not really good at every anything and still has a business model that doesn't make sense I'm worried that that would last I don't think it would frankly okay yeah just to add to that um I I agree that if you if you need things that unreal has you're going to use unreal even despite the the royalties um but I think that like each each engine has things that you're gonna be you're going to be prioritizing over the revenue model I guess um in some cases but you make a good point that Godot is Godot is completely free so if that's what you're looking at then but at the same time like there's other stuff too you've got renpai you've got construct you've got all these different things that people use all over the place and like it's it's not just like a three engine Market it's huge but I I think there's another aspect to the unreal thing Prime that might be worth mentioning here which is that to the best of my knowledge unreal has never attempted to shake a developer down post ship for more money and that's what Unity did here they were basically trying to get more money from people who'd already finished their games or have their games in development in to the best of my knowledge when you sign a license agreement to use unreal you sign it for a particular product right for a particular development cycle and so you know what the terms are that you're getting from the Unreal Engine up front so if you ask a studio would they rather pay 2.5 percent or five percent well I can imagine the same 2.5 percent if you ask a studio whether they'd rather pay five percent or any percent that Unity decides to grandfather in on January 1st of a given year well that's a very different question yeah yeah I think I I think that question will only be relevant for the next year or two I do think that that will go away like long as they don't ever sound like they might do it again I think this will be their one goof up you know maybe I think for some people they would agree with you but I think for some people they won't man like this blindsided everyone it seemed planned and intentional with the removal of the GitHub there's going to be a lot of people that are like I'm out like I'm not doing that ever again you've broken the trust to a degree that I I can't do it again I'm gonna be honest with you like I I run a website develop that games where I list out ways that people can make video games because a big part of my community is teaching people to make indie games like get in there and build stuff right even if you don't think you can I removed Unity from my website I won't be putting it back on like that kind of breach of trust is just too immense man there's no reason for me to ever tell people yeah you should totally use this after something like that that's crazy like no no no no but I would also point out even if you think if you want to trust them give them the benefit of the doubt well I would ask the question why did they do it this time the answer is because their financials don't add up so my question is how is 2.5 percent actually gonna fix those financials if you look at how much money they need just to break even it's in the hundreds of millions of dollars that they have shortfall sometimes right now that's to break even prime to become a profitable company that would justify a valuation like the one they have used 2.5 percent from a select few developers going to make up the hundreds of millions of dollars that they need to make for that yeah yeah that that's hard because I mean hey I work at Netflix we've we've raised prices right and so I know people get very upset about that there's levers that people pull to make more money and so what I see is that there's two levers that they have to pull which is time to paying the royalty and how much that royalty cost like that's going to be their two big the two big levers they have for Netflix it's only one it's it's one lever or it's technically two levers more content to make it appealing to get more people to sign on or be make people pay more right and so we used our last lever as a one-time poll which is you can't share accounts that was a one-time poll ever once we did it we could no longer do that ever again and so therefore it's you know that's that's our only level lever left as more people or more payments and so Unity is going to be under the same thing if they're going under by hundreds of millions uh uh a quarter or a year I mean they gotta figure that out a little bit you know that's gonna be that's a lot of Revenue that they have to make up for and so my guess is uh you know Unity itself will probably go through a big downsizing they'll probably shift a lot of the employees because that's one of the you know internal levers if you will you just you don't do you really need seven thousand employees I don't know what Unity does I can't say they do or they don't but that just seems like a high number I mean Netflix has uh 10 000 employees and that involves a lot of studio and a lot of other activities that don't even involve making the actual product I think it's less than 2 000 on just the product uh yeah I mean how many people are going to have to hire for that risk team to start managing all these different connections and checking like the auditing for that like that's all risk team activity and that they're gonna have to hire more people to do that too yeah it seems like it seems like a hard road because even the even themselves charging this requires them to actually pay more to try to charge that it's almost a double risk even for themselves because they just actually incur a higher fixed cost by now having more and more employees too they're sandwiched I mean they are sandwiched in terms of what they can do if this royalty rate creeps up it bumps up against unreal which most people acknowledge is a much more powerful engine and you know it needs more learning resources I think most people also acknowledge that Unity is much easier to pick up so it's not exactly the same but that's looking ugly and unreal doesn't charge per seat licensing so you're looking at something where you're you're creeping up towards someone who seems to be offering a better deal than you and then in terms of like the rest of the stuff like the free and how easy it to get into and all that stuff you've got good coming up from behind right they're basically sandwiching in so I I don't know I I've been warning about this for a while right like I said I was saying this is a dangerous situation something like this would happen over a year ago so I'm still saying the same things this is not a good situation and I I don't think this is gonna hold even this 2.5 thing I'm I'm not I wouldn't I wouldn't trust them well I I mean their danger would be that unreal could literally just take him out completely right unreal could just be like okay we're three percent now now all of a sudden it's just like how compelling is a half percent you've just yeah you know I don't know because obviously unreal all they have to do is they just have foreign they literally have the infinite 15 year old money machine just flying at all times just pouring in billions so I don't know if they have did you see how much money they made off of fortnite last year oh I'm sure I'm sure it's six billion how much yeah six billion unreal isn't trying to compete with unity is the thing right it's like they're a fortnight company not a yeah I'm just pointing out this fact right it's like they they if there's sites were on unity and saying we're going to take away this market then it would I would even be more uh pessimistic on YouTube's future the only reason that they're not having that fight right now is because I don't fundamentally believe epic cares about taking you to these customers it's not their priority right now interesting what's your thoughts on this um I think that there are people who invested a lot of time and have companies employees education um material that took a lot of time and money to create and put together and switching over a percentage of Revenue is going to be in a lot of cases not worth hiring an entirely new team starting from scratch with what you know and I think that I don't know I'm not I'm not sure what's going to happen but I think that that there are people who it just won't be worth it to leave Unity even if the even if they get a revenue um okay undercut by revenue from unreal is is Epica a private company they are okay yeah that's why I can't find anything I was just curious more about it that's cool you know that's also makes it so that they don't have to drive for any of these unrealistic expectations of growing revenue and all that they can just continue to do what they're doing and be happy with what they're doing yeah to be honest with you I like when a business just wants to do well not one that needs to grow infinitely because that's not sustainable you're going to have these types of problems anytime they're trying to build the business for the shareholders rather than building it for the customers and like that's sadly that's the way that I see Unity right now is they're trying to do this unsustainable business model that doesn't make any sense because they need to appease shareholders rather than abusing the people that are actually using their product yeah it's fair to take all right well hey everybody thank you for joining me I can't believe I got all three of you on a tweet okay we just have a little I was in the middle of feeding my ferrets too I was like oh man I don't know how extensive it is to feed ferrets but I have so if you don't know I I run a ferret rescue in Washington so I take in injured and uh sickly ferrets from around the state and I rescue them and then give them the best possible life they can have so I have 17 ferrets it's not a small amount but it takes quite a while and all of them have their own special needs and stuff and I stream them here on Twitch as well they're on ferrets.live it's a thing there's a plug enjoy that wait hold on do you actually have a permanently live ferret Channel oh yeah yeah it's ferrets.live it'll redirect you to the website it's actually um it's ferret software on Twitch they're like some of them are special needs I actually have uh two of them have ordenbergs and are deaf I have a number of elderly ferrets as well that are in there um all of them came from really bad situations or or had injuries or illnesses and things like that parents couldn't take care of them all that kind of stuff yeah here let me let me link it in chat I even I I literally had no idea that was the thing all right well yeah we gotta at least do one or two more plugs here please plug away Casey okay I'm a game developer I use Unity so this is definitely definitely been on my mind this week I stream on Twitch I'm at uh land underscore Lux twitch.tv's underscore um I'm on every day making my game yep I remember this starting it was fun and then Casey quit streaming on Twitch he's a loser sorry guys I didn't quit I just I'm too busy right now to do it I'll be back I'll be back but this is not really a plugable thing for me this is a I have been worried about this for a while and it happened and now I'm worried that people won't I take away some of the important things from this like so I kind of want to like I I just want to make sure that Unity is actually pressed on these things because I don't want to be here in the same situation two years from now talking about this again uh so not really a plugable thing the plug is please really scrutinize what they're saying here because I really don't feel like this was a trustworthy response and I think that there are a lot of possibilities you can go to Unreal you can go to Godot you can think about what that means for the future of your studio please think carefully about it because this is not a good thing to happen it's been coming down the pipe for a while and I don't think this is the end yeah I mean it's it's the same reason that I'm not going to be you know entertaining sending telling telling new developers like you should use this engine I'm going to actively encourage them not to until this whole thing gets resolved until they can prove of the track record that this won't happen again and that's going to take a while that's not like a oh it's a weekend yeah oh yeah we said sorry it'll be fine like no this is this is going to take months if not a year for them to you know prove that their business model is now not unstable that they have enough money enough revenue for them to work properly and that they don't need to change it again and do even more damage they have to prove that and that I I cannot recommend the engine until that happens there's no way that's fair I think that's pretty fair because yeah you definitely want you want an engine that you know is going to be around for tomorrow and the next day because the next day the thing is is like I I tell like hundreds if not thousands of people like hey you can get into Game Dev you can start making things right because I stream every day on here right and there's always some there's always some new guy some new kid that's like hey can I make a game you know I'm I'm 16 and I'm just trying to do this or there's some dude who comes in who's like I'm 50 am I too old to make games I'm like no you're not like you could totally make this stuff like do this right yeah and if if I turn them towards unity and then they're a year two years in the development of their cool thing after they've made a couple of small games and then they get screwed by it I'm gonna feel bad about that dude and I won't put them in that kind of a position I won't do it fair all right well hey I appreciate all of you thanks for joining us I'll uh I'll give you guys all shouts out in the description it was fun times it was fun to watch yeah thanks Prime that was fun yeah thanks guys thanks for having us on Prime no I think it's great and thank you everybody for pushing on Unity I think it's great I think that these little things help uh I you know I know that I'm just one small voice in in many voices but I think that uh being able to push people and seeing something come out positive at least more positive than it was I'm happy about that and yeah I'd like for it to be uh good for everybody because I really hate seeing people just watch their livelihood potentially disappear because that is totally I mean that sucks that's not cool so thanks thanks take it easy bye see you run
