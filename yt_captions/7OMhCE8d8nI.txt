honor has just announced three smartphones and I've partnered with them to get all three devices early we've got the honor 20 light a pretty neat little budget phone the honor 20 a much more distinct flagship and then the honor 20 Pro which in some ways breaks completely new ground first up the light and at 249 pounds it does a few things really well it's one of the cheapest phones in the world with a triple camera setup you get a 24 megapixel main camera an ultra wide and then a depth sensor oh yeah and a 32 megapixels selfie camera which is actually rather good anyways onto the main event first up the standard honor 20 and while the price does jump to 399 where you're actually getting here jumps a lot more it starts to feel like a flagship phone you've got a glass back with this holographic gradient finish you get a punch hole in the display instead of a knotch and this side mounted fingerprint scanner which like the galaxy yestiny I could get used to the phone is powered by the flagship Kirin 980 chip six gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage and oh yeah as a quad camera setup so that's a 48 megapixel main camera with the same sensor as the wampler 7 pro you get an ultra-wide lens a depth sensor and bit of a twist a dedicated camera for taking macro shots so there's a few cool things you can do here you're probably quite familiar with how an ultra wide shot looks but the macro camera now lets you get closer to things than you're used to one of the more curious features is alongside a forty eight megapixel mode the camera has a 48 megapixel AI ultra clarity mode which lets you hold the phone still for a few seconds also gets every detail it can seems to work really well I wouldn't mind seeing this feature on other phones you get a night mode too although this really starts to come into its own when we get to the honor 20 Pro speaking of which this is the big one it comes in a hundred and fifty pounds more than the standard on a 20 and there's a few things here that I was just kind of itching to take a look at beneath the phone you get this insert which has the sim ejector tool on it and just below that you get a USB type-c two headphone jack adapter and as well as of course the cable you get a twenty 2.5 watt on a supercharger alright so the first thing you're going to notice about phone is that finish so the model I have right here is called phantom black I guess derived from how these sides are kind of dark but then there's this mysterious purple that comes through in the middle make no mistake this is their top tier flagship phone but it actually sticks to the same a slightly smaller form factor of the standard on a 20 it works for me I did find that 100 usability actually isn't out of the question here especially because your thumb kind of rests on that side mounted fingerprint scanner so you don't have to do that kind of hand dancing act that you sometimes do within display scanners you're looking at a six point two six inch full HD plus LCD which I wouldn't say is the highlight of the phone but it's no but more important is this camera setup so it's based on the honor 20s but they've added laser autofocus swapped the depth assist to a three times telephoto camera and bolstered the main camera quite significantly he now has optical image stabilization and to me the most curious part a record-breaking F 1.4 aperture you can start with the ultra white go into the main sensor and then all the way into the three times optical zoom and five times hybrid zoom and this is the kind of result you can expect if you're going to be switching between these options the other thing is this F 1.4 aperture it means you can get pretty intense background blur without any need for portrait modes and could mean a game-changing night mode it seems to really come into its own in super low light conditions but I am planning a full camera comparison so do subscribe if you want to see that about that macro camera you can access it by hitting more options and then the super macro camera mode it's interesting it's only got a two megapixel resolution but it does let you get very close to subjects while keeping them in focus the focus distance here is about 4 centimeters aside from that the honor 20 Pro has a big four thousand milliamp hour battery you get that fast on a super charging we talked about and this phone jacks up the RAM and storage to 8 / 2 5 6 gigs there's no headphone jack and the phone has a single speaker but it can virtually recreate 9.1 surround sound if you're using earphones it's running on honors and magic UI which you might already be quite familiar with and with that you get a lot of what Huawei's p30 pro offers with its Mui skin features like wireless TV projection GPU turbo 3.0 which actually now supports more games and saves even more battery when playing them and high vision which can translate text in real time alright so there we have it three devices hitting three different price points with three different sets of features if you want to find out more about them I've drop links in the description below and if you enjoyed this video a sub would be massively appreciated my name is Erin this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
