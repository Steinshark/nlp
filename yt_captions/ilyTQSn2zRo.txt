okay [Music] [Music] all right i always forget what number it is did we just pass 20 really part of me feels like we hit 20. last one was yeah last one was 20. so it's 21. on point q a is now old enough to shrink in the united states hey what is up guys mkbhd here and welcome to ask mkbhd version 21. uh just turned the mic on hey what is up guys mkbhd here and welcome to ask mkbhd version 21. we've done one every month of this year so far this is number 10 of the 12 for 2017. it's october i reached out on twitter asked you guys what you wanted to know and these are your best questions thoughts on the demonetization situation and how has it affected you so i think i've touched on this before but i've been almost completely unaffected by the demonetization problems that a lot of youtubers have been having in the past year or two but just because it's not happening to me doesn't mean it's not happening and just because it's happening to some other people doesn't mean it's happening to everyone a couple days ago casey neistat made a great video kind of outlining the entire situation about the communication from the youtube team and the relationship between youtube itself and the community and the problems people have been having it's worth a watch i agree with a lot of what he says in that video but the main thing to get out of that is that the the biggest problem we have is there's not a lot of communication between youtube and us youtubers about what those problems are and a lot of what casey talks about in his video is about the value of youtubers to youtube about how we will leave at the drop of a hat and go somewhere else if there's a bigger audience or a better monetization solution but i think the problem is youtube is the biggest audience has been for years and will be for a long time so actually don't see youtubers leaving youtube anytime soon no matter how bad this monetization situation gets because it's still the biggest audience so anyway i have a lot of thoughts about that but essentially i've been unaffected i'm just keeping my ear to the ground and keeping a finger on the pulse and trying to figure out what other people think too which dual camera setup do you prefer most one with a secondary monochrome or one with the telephoto lens uh between those two i would definitely pick the telephoto lens or just any additional focal length over the monochrome sensor i've tested a couple phones that have the second monochrome camera to add detail and enhance the photos but a lot of times those aren't good cameras in the first place so uh it doesn't really make much of a difference to me so i'll take that v30 with the wide-angle camera i'll take the iphone or the note or whatever with the second portrait camera that's cool i also really appreciate the way google's done it and i'll talk about it in the full review with a single camera for portrait mode but that's another story if you reach down what would you rather have in your pocket red or iphone 10. well i do have two pockets so if i reach down and i mean why not both at this point [Music] one of the speakers on the bottom of the iphone 7 plus and a plus doesn't actually work uh could apple have put a headphone jack there instead listen the headphone jack is dead headphone jack's not coming back we just kind of have to embrace it and move on quickly but seriously i've definitely mentioned it before yes we're in that like awkward stage in between everyone having headphone jacks and nobody needing them because wireless is so good uh but to keep wishing for it to come back is definitely not a productive exercise just gonna have to move along any updates on your professional ultimate frisbee career what teams are you playing for and where can we see your games so it's the off season right now it's about to be winter the professional ultimate frisbee season is generally during the summer and when the summer rolls around i of course i always tweet uh where you can see our games when you can see our games that's the best place to find that but right now it's the off season it's more of like college ultimate and club ultimate and just other fun stuff la clippers wins set at 42 and a half over under hmm uh i'm gonna go with over yeah you know what i'm optimistic i'm gonna go with the over on this one but i have to mention i will be watching rockets games also now because i'm a chris ball fan that's the original reason i became a clippers fan now he's a houston rocket now i'm watching houston rockets games what do you think of the soon to be announced razer phone so you know what if red can make a smartphone then i guess it's anyone's ball game razer bought next bit now they're aiming to make a smartphone and we'll probably be seeing that pretty soon i'm excited for that too obviously next bit has a little bit of a history but we may or may not see bits of that in the new razer phone but razer is is a gaming peripheral and gaming device maker right now so i kind of expect to see a lot of cues from that sort of stuff in the new smartphone plus combined with maybe some of the next bits past it'll be interesting to see i'll definitely try to cover that when it comes out zte axon m why do you hate it it's kind of a cool concept so yeah i tweeted about this the other day that zte axon m has come out it's a foldable smartphone but not really it's more of a dual screen phone with a hinge in the middle that just kind of unfolds like that i agree it's it's a cool concept a key word being concept but the actual execution when you look at the final result just doesn't look good at all now i can appreciate trying to one-up samsung where you kind of you have a feeling they're going to do some sort of a foldable display in the near future so you try to be first to that uh this just isn't good for anything other than maybe splitting a movie across two screens it doesn't do all that much that's useful i see the demo videos i'll link one below mr mobile did a great one the verge did a great one you can mirror the display across both screens you can extend the screen across both screens but no matter how you use it it's just weird having a big bezel in the middle of your display so it's a cool concept yes but if i told you the price tag you'd probably agree with me that just doesn't seem like a good product did you upgrade to the new monstro 8k vista vision so look uh no i haven't gotten it yet but it's pretty likely that i will end up making that move pretty soon for those of you who don't know the biggest difference between the new monstro 8k sensor and the current helium super 35 sensor besides the cheesy new name is the size of it the super 35 sensor is smaller than full frame and the vistavision 8k sensor is a full frame size sensor that has a lot of implications as far as what glass you can use the type of a look you get with your video and your bokeh and the type of flexibility you get and you having a much wider angle lens in a smaller area it's actually useful for those hands-on areas i could name a ton of reasons why i'm excited for the upgrade right now but long story short yeah that's probably gonna happen what's your go-to everyday object to use as a weapon in a self-defense situation that makes it seem like i have like an answer already like a go-to would it be cheating to say the weapon just because it's already a weapon that's exactly what that would be yeah you could hurt somebody with this it's mostly metal and it's got sharp edges and it has a handle yup that'll do it go to meal after a game of ultimate that's easy chipotle for sure can you solve a rubik's cube oh i don't have one but i i can solve one face of a rubik's cube i have those algorithms memorized and i can get the first row around the face and then i don't know any of the rest whose vision of the future will win google or apple both are focusing on different things google is software versus apple hardware that's an interesting question i kind of think you have to have both obviously there's advantages with going with either way apple's ecosystem built around their super premium hardware is amazing but on the other end of things like google being able to improve things on the fly and add features and have essentially a modular experience with their software also has huge advantages but it's nothing without the hardware and vice versa so you kind of have to have both and i think both are realizing that and trying to build that way apple is trying to build up their ecosystem to compete with google's massive ecosystem of products and google's trying to build their own hardware build their own phones like the pixel to compete with apple's ecosystem hardware where do you find your awesome glitch funk electro intro songs seriously i'm in love with that genre well thank you i don't really have like one source i always go to for music but i can tell you that
