hey guys this is Austin and these are 10 things you need to know about the brand new Galaxy S 20 number one is a big one the price so the brand new Galaxy has 20 starts at $1000 and that's for the base model so the galaxy s 20 starts at that thousand dollar price point you won't go up to the s 20 plus it's $1,200 although higher based on if you want more storage and then to top it all off you have the S 20 ultra at $1400 and it also has a higher end model now to help counteract this they do actually have the standard s 10 es10 S 10 plus from last year still around and they're all getting a $150 price cut but when you put all this together there's certainly nothing wrong with an expensive phone I mean the iPhone 11 Pro is a great example of that but when we're talking about $1000 plus for these new flagships they had better bring some serious features thankfully they do what I mean better prepared to pay number two is actually a legitimate feature that does help to justify the price and that is the 120 Hertz display now by default all throughout the galaxy s 20 s will run at full HD resolution and 60 frames per second and very much like last year however you do have the option of bumping all of them up to that full 120 frames per second after spending a lot of time with the oneplus phones of last year with their 90 Hertz displays it does make a big difference now yes I will completely admit that going from 90 to 120 frames per seconds probably not going to be a big deal but considering that pretty much everyone who's going to be upgrading to these s 20s it's coming from a standard 60 frames per second display it is so much smoother although it's not necessarily that straightforward the issue is that you can't have your resolution and your frame rate at the same time so all three devices have Q HD displays which look great but if you want to run it at full resolution you have to run it at only 60 frames per second 120 option only exists when you're running at full high-definition now 1080p is not bad on say the s 20 which has actually a fairly nice 6.2 inch display once you jump up to the s 20 plus and specifically the Ultra with it's ridiculous 6.9 inch display HD just doesn't quite cut it it is noticeably softer and while I personally love that super smooth 120 frames per second action you're actually making a legitimate you're faced with that now is it something that I will personally do yeah probably but it really shouldn't be the way it is on a $1400 phone now if I can just shamelessly plug something for a second my brand new podcast went live this morning called the test drivers in it we talk a lot more in depth about the Galaxy S 20 as well as a lot of the things such as the screen which are slightly nefarious trade-offs so it's co-hosted by my good friend Mike early and on the test drivers what I really want to do is go much more in-depth than I can in a 10 minute YouTube video right so the podcast is really there so I really talk much more in depth about technology but also about what it means to actually daily drive something right because these s20 seem very interesting as you'll see later in the video there's a lot of really cool features but at the end of the day it's one thing to do a hands-on it's another thing to actually spend time really living with these devices so if that sounds interesting to you or you just want to be a supporter please don't give the test drivers a try it's available at the link of the description Spotify pocket casts Apple podcasts wherever or you can just go check it out at relay dot F n slash the test drivers reason number three is 5g so well this is technically not new this year there was an s10 model with 5g last year however it was very limited and only a few people actually bought it however this time every single galaxy has 20 you can buy has 5g built in well technically so right now there are a couple of competing 5g standards there's one known as sub six as well as there's millimeter-wave so sub six is becoming fairly popular specifically here in the United States thanks to t-mobile so they've actually already turned on their full 5g network and this is essentially an evolution of the 4G speeds that we have today coverage is very similar and the speeds are better but say it's the difference between like forty and eighty megabits per second it's good but it's nothing completely revolutionary other carriers such as AT&T and Verizon here in the states are focusing on their millimeter wave 5g now this is where you get those crazy speed tests of a gigabit per second or more however comes with a major downside the coverage is incredibly limited like literally you could walk around the corner and go from a gigabit down to like nothing with this so really the best case scenario for 5g is that a phone which reports both millimeter wave and sub six sort of the best of all worlds and that is what you get except not on the standard s 20 the way it breaks down is like this the standard Galaxy S 20 only supports sub 6 5g which is fine it's really enough for most people however when you go up to the s 20 plus as well as the ultra they support not only sub 6 but also that millimeter wave which means that you can get way way faster speeds but in very limited situations it's really a future-proof play but that's I think a legitimately really big selling point for that new S 10 s 20 + and s 20 ultra really what you're getting here is something which should look much better into the future but you also have to deal with the fact that uh well you spend a thousand dollars you get 5g but it's not full 5g because that's not confusing right you know with a 120 Hertz display in standard 5g my next favorite point is a really obvious one battery life so while yes the s10 had decent battery life the s20 bumps it up in a big way at least on the battery size of the equation so the s20 has a four thousand milliamp hour battery the s 20 plus us 45 hundred million of hours if you go up to the s 20 ultra it's a thick boy with five thousand milliamp hours of battery capacity and that sounds really impressive it's much better than what we got last year but the issue is is it with that power-hungry screen and a 5g radio inside you're probably gonna need that so while I haven't had enough time to actually do any kind of real battery life tests I would be surprised if the battery life is actually anything all that impressive I really do feel like these bigger batteries are probably purely there just to power all these new features but we'll have to wait and see on that one that said though I'm glad they at least decided to increase the battery size and not just throw all these fancy new things at you and go oh yeah charge it in three hours ah what a beautiful fountain to go onto our number five point the zoom so cameras of course are a huge component of every modern smartphone when it comes to the s20 things get a lot closer a lot more zoomed and we're zooming in on the truth so these standard s20 as well as the s20 plus have a 3 x telephoto zoom which is much better than the two times of last year however what really takes the cake is the s20 ultra with a massive 10 times optical zoom yes ten times it's a lot of times they're funnily enough Samsung actually claims this to be 100 times space oom on the back of the camera now this is a slight exaggeration as to get you 100 times zoom they're making a combination of that 10 times optical zoom as well as a lot of digital zoom it's not exactly as grey as it sounds however you can get some super super tight shots with it now unfortunately I can't actually show you of these shots because the phone I was testing was using pre-release software so I can't actually pull any images off of it the results were good certainly not as good as a full 100 times zoom camera but this is hands-down as far as like standard flagships of today the best-looking zoom lens I've ever seen a big reason for that is actually because they flip the entire thing on its side so when you look at the zoom camera it's actually looking through a prism so the camera lens has actually sideways in the phone this actually has some other sort of effects that I'll talk about a little bit later but essentially what you're getting here is a zoom which is pretty much unmatched by any iPhone or pixel or LG or a soos or right now suicide she has the zenfone zoom it's a really good zoom number six is a big one it is 8k video which is standard across the board for the s20 now there's actually something really impressive about this while yes it is certainly not as good as the 8k video that you would get on say a red camera what it is is a major step up at least in actual real pixels when you consider that 4k is 8 megapixels and 8k is 33 megapixels that is a lot of data to process on a phone video camera now there are some limitations so the a K video only records at a maximum of 24 frames per second which is the correct frame rate anyway but that is a little bit of a downside for some people but I think the bigger downside is the fact that you can only record Unser cameras because you'd have to have enough megapixels to do it in the biggest first place so on the s20 in the s20 plus you have to use the three times optical zoom lens the telephoto camera to actually be able to record since those are the only cameras with more than 33 megapixels that's fine although honestly it's a little bit of a major downside just because when you're trying to record 8k video you were very very zoomed in however when you go up to the s20 ultra the main wide-angle camera has a ridiculous 108 megapixels and I'll talk about that in a second but you can use that main wide-angle camera to record 8k video which personally I think looks a lot better the downside here though is that when it comes to recording 8k video you really have major limitations it's a nice thing to have it looks decent but at the end of the day based on at least my initial first impressions it fell probably not as good as say like the 4k on an iPhone the number-7 might not sound like a big deal but just hear me out here it is the camera sensor size now we all know that at this point when it comes to buying a new smartphone camera is one of if not the top priority not only if it means you're upgrading from your last phone or you need a shopping between like the pixels and the iPhones of the world the camera matters a lot you know while a lot of the advances that we've seen over the last couple years really come down to software at a certain point there's no sort of substitute for just a bigger better camera sensor and that's exactly what Samsung I've done this year so the standard camera on the s 20 and s 20 plus is 1.6 times bigger which to be clear was already pretty big last year go over what really takes the cake is the s20 ultra its main 108 megapixel camera is almost a full one inch sensor or 1.3 3-inch sensor to be specific but it's really approaching something like a compact camera like these sony rx100 now this means that the image quality should not only be better across the board now I know they use a weird like 9 x pixel bending process so either you have 108 megapixels it's taking all that information and putting it into a very sharp-looking 12 megapixel photo so put that aside and what you should have here is what I think is a real candidate for the best phone of the year best camera on a phone of the year number eight is a big one literally the s20 ultra is a thick boy in the truest sense of the word not only is it significantly thicker thanks to that huge battery compared to the standard s 20 but on top of that it is heavy and the care bump is really really tall mostly because of that ten times optical zoom camera now come on we're all we've all been there we've all had a thick boy in our lives but the real issue with the s20 ultra is that all of this thickness is combined with a six point nine inch screen what this is a big phone it's a big phone in every sense of the word it was also a big phone in the sense that it is a very powerful very battery hungry like it's a monster right it's really a step above anything like the s20 or the s20 plus but the downside though is that like for me I can't really handle six point nine inches in my hand mm-hmm number nine is simply the fact that these phones are significantly more powerful than last generation so while we don't actually have as a recording this video the official spec of what's inside beyond a seven nanometer next generation processor but it is almost certainly going to be the snapdragon 865 here in America in North America and these X and O's 990 in other parts of the world so really what you're getting here is not only a very powerful processor but also a lot of RAM these guys all have 12 gigs of ram across the board go over on the ultra you can opt it up to 16 gigabytes of RAM yes that's more than most people's laptops now there are a couple actual legitimately really nice uses for this so even only 12 gig of ram phones you have an option to lock up to three apps and memories so that will not close them off in the background and on the 16 gigabyte a ram option you've got five apps that you can keep open at once which is another she does that a lot or should you have more than five apps that are like permanently open and round I guess it's kind of a nice thing to have anyway I'm gonna charge you $1,000 I think I have find a way to justify it somehow all right meanwhile the iPhone sells four gigs of RAM in Samsung shipping 12 and 16 gigs just saying I shadow I'm saying cuz it's not really relevant Android just eats that memory number 10 we have good and bad news as this time around we still have the micro SD card slot which can support up to an additional one terabyte of storage but sadly the headphone jack is no more can you see it can't get really close to goodbye jack it was nice knowing you know he was on the S 10 last year yeah feels like a long time ago right okay he's moved on to greener pastures like unbox therapy channel and again definitely don't forget to go check out the test drivers at the link in the description if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to the channel because of course this is not the only Samsung news of today maybe it is but I don't I don't think so I think they're saw something else you might be able to talk about this is the universal sign for a flip phone right you
