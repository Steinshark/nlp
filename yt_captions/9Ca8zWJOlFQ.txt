come on hey what's up guys mkbhd here and this is iphone 10 and it's my favorite iphone ever by far and there's no doubt that in the history of iphones this thing is iconic it's more modern it finally feels like a new iphone that's a big part of why i like it so much but that's also the source for a few sore spots there's a learning curve to this phone unlike any other iphone you see every other iphone ever has just been home button rectangle screen rounded corners pretty much the same thing you know what you're getting yourself into you know exactly how to use it and if there's maybe one big new feature every year it takes you two seconds to learn it and you're good iphone 10 is different with this phone there's maybe three or four big fundamental changes to the way you use the phone now it's very clearly still an iphone you still mostly know how to use it but there's a couple things that are different that you'll have to get used to so on the outside it's the shape we're used to the rectangle with rounded corners but this is the first time the display itself actually has curved corners and it's pushed right up to the edges of the phone or at least closer than they've ever been the commercials make it seem a little more dramatic than it actually is but hey it's 2017 phones have small bezels that's just the way they are now so in that way the iphone catches up and it pushes everything to the corners and keeps all the front-facing sensors in the notch that forsaken notch at the top it's actually not that big of a deal but we'll get into that soon just holding the phone though it feels great i think it's an awesome size but if there were a bigger iphone 10 plus i would totally get that right now despite the larger display the 10 is definitely closer to feeling like an iphone 8 than an 8 plus it still feels like a smaller phone compared to the others i've used and also thanks to the stainless steel sides it's definitely slippery and it's definitely going to slide out of your pocket at least once it happens to the best of them and it's crazy the silver it's so shiny and honestly we all know your phone is never going to look as good as it does fresh out the box unlike the more matte finish of the previous iphone i'm not convinced this super shiny finish on the iphone's rails is going to last like this we've seen this before in other products it definitely gets chipped and scratched you probably already know i usually go for a matte black skin here which not gonna lie still looks pretty good but dbrand's got something new for the 10 the grip so like the name implies this thing is supposed to be the best way to grip your phone look for a full review of this bumper later this month but i'll leave a link below if you want to check this one out a lot of people were asking about it when i showed it in my instagram story but overall it's a pretty complete hardware package as you'd expect from a thousand dollar smartphone you know it's the speakers even though they aren't front facing are still pretty good it's water resistant which gives you some nice peace of mind it has wireless charging there's no headphone jack welcome to 2017 but overall it's well considered and well put together uh is it now officially the most breakable iphone ever thanks to having glass on the back yes yes the one part of the hardware of this phone i actually really don't like is the camera bump but not just for the usual reason like rocking on a table i've just kind of accepted that at this point but because of the new orientation a couple times i've noticed it's easy to accidentally get your finger in the photo or video you're taking just because it's all up in the corner it might take a couple days to get used to that and stop getting your finger in the corner of your shots but what's really become the signature feature of the iphone 10 is around the front and it is that notch up at the top of the display and there are two camps with this number one is i hate it it's ugly i wish it wasn't there and number two is i actually don't notice it anymore and just like with the essential phone i tend to fall more in camp number two when you want to make a 2017 phone and you want to shrink the bezels you still have to put all the front-facing sensors all of the cameras and the ir blaster and the depth sensor you have to put that somewhere in 2017 some manufacturers keep a smaller traditional bezel to house it some try to go no top bezel and put everything in the chin some try to minimize all the bezels and use a sort of a cut out notch apple has decided to go with a notch and i don't mind it in fact i literally don't even think about it anymore in everyday use now obviously when you're focusing on it here as i'm talking about it and highlighting it on video it's really obvious you know the unibrow at the top it kind of just becomes a part of this iphone 10s character but you're never really looking at it during normal use like flipping through apps scrolling through twitter instagram whatever it disappears pretty quick now not everybody feels this way clearly like i've seen all the clever like hiding the notch stuff all the apps and the wallpapers and that i get that uh but because this is apple and because they're stubborn and will never admit that any of their solutions are anything other than perfect they've come up with the opposite solution which is embrace the notch so in all their software and all the software they'll promote is apps that wrap right around that notch and fill up the whole display that's what an optimized iphone 10 app looks like and since this is a taller aspect ratio apps will have to get updated to do this developers will have to get on their horse and actually put in the work and update their apps to get them to fill up the display like this and to be fair most of the big name apps are already upgrading and embracing the notch like apple wants but there are still plenty that haven't updated yet and they'll be obvious when you see them because they'll have these big bezels about the top and the bottom kind of like you're using them on an iphone 8 again so slowly over the next couple of weeks and months all the apps you're using will get updated to embrace that notch whether you like it or not it just takes some time probably the biggest change developers have had to make to their apps for a new iphone since the beginning so for the record the only time i really think about that notch is when i'm watching videos yes it gets kind of awkward here because when you're watching videos full screen the notch will cut off some of the display some of what you're trying to watch so if you want to avoid that you can actually double tap and it'll bring in the video you're watching on this oled display now you have some more bezels but at this point now the video you're watching is so small you might as well not be watching it on a bigger screen it feels like the same size as the iphone 8. so this whole thing is the main reason why i would actually want a plus sized iphone 10. anyway as for the rest of the display it's great apple calls it a super retina display i just call it their first oled in a smartphone ever finally and it's it's pretty awesome it's a 5.8 inch panel high pixel density it supports the p3 color gamut hdr it has true tone it doesn't get as bright and saturated as samsung's like note 8 and s8 displays but it is still bright enough not too cartoonish with the colors has a small blue shift when you tilt it off axis but so do many other oleds to varying degrees and it still has 3d touch although i pretty much stopped using that completely except for lock screen controls that i wish i could change so the screen is awesome and it's a big part of why this phone looks so good from so many angles so uh good job samsung now of course when you go to a full screen display like this you lose the home button so that's why iphone 10 replaces that home button with a whole bunch of gestures this is the biggest learning curve of any iphone ever but it's still not that bad you swipe up from that bar at the bottom of the screen at any time to go home now anytime you see that bar it represents the home and whatever app you're in will close itself just like any other iphone hitting the home button swipe down from the top for notifications but now swipe from the right corner for your control center and then for multitasking again you have no home button so you swipe halfway up and then over to get through your recent apps that'll get you to that same card style carousel as before but overall once you get hang of this system once you get used to all this swiping which took me a couple days it felt pretty natural i actually started trying to swipe up on other phones which shows you how weird how much i got used to that the one that took me the longest was multitasking because i started off thinking you had to swipe up then wait and then the cards show up but that always felt so slow but what you really have to do to get this to work is you swipe up and over and that gets you to the cards way faster so that's a pro tip for anyone who is still swiping up halfway and waiting for the cards to show up like i was you're welcome and for those with small hands or who just really liked reachability on the bigger iphone you technically still have it here it's buried in the accessibility settings but you can do the little swipe down on the bottom of the screen to bring the top corners within reach and that makes getting the top gestures easier with one hand i leave that on it's pretty useful sometimes now of course the other big change that comes with ditching the home button on iphone 10 is he also just ditched that fingerprint reader which means as you may have heard they needed to replace that with face id facial recognition face id on the iphone works really well most of the time it's not perfect and i think touch id was closer to perfect as far as fail rate goes but it's still impressively good here i talked about how touch id is like the gold standard for quickly and securely getting into your phone in the previous video i'll link that below the like button of course and i still believe that touch id is definitely still faster but face id can get better with software updates and with time as millions of people begin to use it i think that'll happen and it still also has some physical limitations that you can become aware of and avoid just like touch id had some physical limitations that you could become aware of like when your finger is wet or it doesn't quite work because of stuff on your hands or if you have a glove on stuff like that you just know touch id is not going to work so you put in the passcode face id has some physical limitations too it works by bouncing thousands of little infrared dots off your face and back into the sensor and creating a map of your eyes nose and mouth it doesn't actually use the front-facing camera and it can learn a changing face over time it still recognizes you when you get a haircut or shave a beard or put makeup on none of this stuff has a huge effect on the dot map it made of your face it also won't be tricked by a picture of you because that doesn't have the depth of your face and i can also work through some pairs of sunglasses again the ones where the infrared light can get through but face id has been known to fail when you're backlit or when there's like a ton of extra infrared light coming in basically from the sun it's like how a dim flashlight doesn't work when it's really bright out same thing face id is gonna get blinded by all that extra infrared light just gotta type in your passcode but those times for me were few and far between if touch id's success rate was 99 to me it felt like face id's success rate was like 95 percent now that can add up when you unlock your phone hundreds of times a day but again this can get better as it gets used more there's even some settings as well where you can turn attention on so it won't unlock if you're just holding the phone up to your face not only that but you have to be looking at your phone then it'll unlock and show all your notification data works pretty well for me just please don't do this while driving and even if face id is this workaround to not getting the fingerprint reader underneath the glass in time for this phone i still think that at its best facial recognition on a phone is closer to secure seamless authentication than a separate fingerprint reader ever would be because with this you just pick up the phone and it works you use it you log in you pay for stuff you download apps etc but if someone else picks up your phone it won't work it's that simple and then there is an emoji possibly maybe the most fun feature of iphone 10 but you know it's hilarious these moving facial tracking animoji are iphone 10 exclusive you can't get this on any other iphone so if you get one of these then you know the person that sent it has an iphone 10. and weirdly enough if you send this to someone with an android phone they just get a video message of this animoji but here's the thing animoji is just using the front-facing camera check this out animoji is working and continues to work even when you cover the depth sensors and the extra front-facing sensors all that stuff it'll work when you cover everything except for the front-facing camera which means they totally could have made these available for any other iphone but they didn't man animoji is the classic i have an iphone and you don't feature classic apple iphone x also has some slightly new cameras same exact sensors for both cameras as the iphone 8 plus but slightly better glass and now both are optically stabilized so this is going to get you some meaningfully better performance with the 2x telephoto lens and zoomed in photos and zoomed in videos things like that which is good to see because i avoided using it with previous iphones and as you'd expect photos from the iphone 10 look awesome i'm especially happy with how much dynamic range we're getting hdr on previous iphone cameras used to be a lot less aggressive and i kept asking over and over for a little more a little more and now photos really pop the sky is like always so blue detail is there color accuracy is tight it's not as good as the pixel 2's camera just gonna say that right up front but this is a top five smartphone camera no doubt if you want a video sample check out the tesla rap video i'll link it below that's five minutes of 4k video from the sensor right there if you want to watch that and despite its tendency to overexpose i think it might be the best front-facing camera for video for any smartphone they've also added portrait mode to the front-facing camera for portrait selfies on the 10 but it doesn't work nearly as well edges get blurred super hard almost to a comical amount when you compare it to something like the pixel 2 or even the back facing camera but the thing is pixel 2 does all this so much better because of machine learning and software so in theory iphone 10 can keep learning and get this good too plus it already has better color accuracy so i'll be on the lookout for that software update now you may have noticed we've made it all this way into an iphone review without talking about any of the specs it shows how important that is but iphone 10 is rocking the a11 bionic chip and three gigs of ram and it's awesome in fact it's really really good i would say this is the most powerful mobile chipset in any smartphone right now the benchmarks are insane but this isn't for ios this is for all the things that run on top of ios the augmented reality apps the image processing the super slow motion video all that stuff but ios is still ios as you know i mean it obviously feels more modern because of all the swiping and the gestures now but as far as functionality it has all the same stuff and features you're used to has all the same quirks you're used to like ios notification system is still a mess since they don't group apps together this is still easily fixable but there's plenty of other things i wish would be different about ios too but it's apple they're stubborn you'll get used to it and battery life on the iphone 10 has turned out to be pretty great close to the iphone 8 plus i would say again iphone is a champ of standby time and it always has been so no problems there and it handles the biggest iphone display ever pretty well thanks to it being an oled i haven't had any problems getting to the end of a single day with full use if you want to use that screen on time metric it's usually around six hours so the bottom line and the question that i get the most often about this phone is so what do you think uh and if you made it this far in the video you already know what i think but in case you skip to this part this is my favorite iphone ever by far i really like it uh is it worth a thousand dollars honestly i don't think people spending the money on this phone will be disappointed now that's not to say this thing is perfect it clearly still also has its downsides you know the fact that it's all glass on the back more breakable that's a downside the notch on the front for a lot of people that's a downside no headphone jack still a downside but those are all things that i think people who are buying this phone are already used to or were expecting and for that reason it's not a deal breaker in 2017 so i'm happy to be carrying this phone so if you were thinking about going out and getting this phone go ahead i think you'll like it too until the next one this has been mkbhd thank you for watching talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] you
