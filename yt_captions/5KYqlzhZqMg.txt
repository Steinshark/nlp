I think that your image is is an apocalyptic image I think that it it's appropriate in that sense that it's completely coherent with an image of Revelation which focuses on the summation rather than the judgment and so although it's an image that we've never seen before I think that it fits perfectly well with with our tradition there are versions of that like in the west you have these types of images that try to show the ontological relationship between Christ and the world it's not like aren't there are many precedents I think for for your image it's just that you bring it together in such a such a cohesive way which in some ways is the thing that that we can do right that we can we can stand on the shoulder of giants as we say and yeah kind of say oh well I see these threads coming together you know we can just push it a little further and see how it how it comes together this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic [Applause] World hello everyone it is my great joy to be back with Aiden Hart to discuss a wonderful image at his designings those that have paid attention to my channel have seen many discussions with Aiden uh his insight into iconography also Al his his own Mastery of the skills makes him uh really one of the Modern Masters of of iconography but also of understanding the role and the symbolism and icons and he is working on a beautiful new image of the Heavenly Jerusalem and its relationship to creation and in in some ways it's very akin to uh the images of everything that I've developed you know with the with the with the mountain and the crucifixion or the flood um and it it really goes to show how you show the same universal truth through different prisms and so I really want to to explore this image with him and and see how he came to develop it the way he did um and so Aiden thanks for thanks for talking to me about this Jonathan and so what is the what is the impetus let me show the image first of all and then we can we can we can talk about it and so tell us a bit about what the impetus was for this image like what what prompted it yeah thanks Jonathan um I got an email from an orthodox marine biologist he's a professor at um Point Lis University on the west coast of America and being a marine biologist he was very interested in somehow bringing together um evolutionary theory not obviously in the sense of a of of an atheistic one but the sense of a gradual creation let's say with with Christ with with Orthodox theology so it was quite an exciting project but I studied biology at University myself and um and I wanted to bring together scientific discovery but an emphasis on Christ is the tell us Christ is the beginning and the middle and and the end so it's a real challenge I somehow wanted to you know bring together Heaven and Earth asdw and this movement towards the New Jerusalem um so basically the commission came from Andrew and he wanted it um to be used as a point of discussion and teaching really it's big it's going to be roughly two meters or something like that perhaps traveling around a bit um probably we'll use it in England uh for about six months before we send it over um so it's going to be a a point of discussion really there's already a Orthodox sort of creation group and so already I think they're discussing it there so my main influence has been obviously the New Jerusalem The Book of Revelation but also say maximus the Confessor so in a sense it's it's trying to indicate something of St maximus's teaching in an icon all right so let's look at some of the elements I mean I was really I was I I found it really beautiful because what I see in the image in some ways it's it's taking this image of the cosmos really from from an apocalyptic vision and so the image of the Heavenly Jerusalem is the is the top of the world it's something like the source of reality Christ is in the center he you know he becomes in some ways the Tree of Life the middle of the garden and the waters are flowing down from him um so tell us a bit about some of the choices that you made in the in the image maybe we can start at the top yeah probably the the best place to begin is the end really uh we can only understand the beginning in the light of the end to which God is directing it so um first of all the image itself is actually 3 by two in proportion which means that the bottom half is a square the bottom two3 are is a square um and the top is is a dome and Christ is situated in the middle of the Dome the circle at the top but also is the middle of the top of the square and a foursided squares the symbol of many cultures of the created world the four elements the four points of the compass so Christ is is at the heart of it you he he's the logos God become flesh So It Begins and ends there but of course as you see around him is the New Jerusalem um and it's the New Jerusalem which includes whole of creation what what struck me about maximus's teaching compared say with di with dius theop guide it's as so you're sort of leaving behind matter and you end up just with sort of pure ideas but with Maximus all the material symbols are taken up and and a part of the end they not sort of spat out as temping thing so um so that's why I've got sort of the Divine things the Angelic Realm of the top um the mother of God together with plants manure Kingdom and all that so um so that's a starting point really I wanted it all culminating in Christ and behind Christ himself of course you've got this in in microcosm you often talked about the fral nature so the the whole icon is a square United with a circle um and behind Christ again you've got a circle turned as a diamond combined with a circle his divinity so Christ is fully God fully man um but creation is also created by Nature it's material by nature but it's called to be United to God by Grace so um you all through really got this Square United with the circle or another way to put it is the cross runs through everything the vertical and the horizontal yeah it's amazing I mean because in some ways it's the symbolism of the church itself with the Dome and the square but it's also just an an arch you know like to see how Universal this symbolism you know the arch of a of a of a window H has the same structure as the church itself it's this little it's this beautiful kind of fractal symbolism that comes in um and so I'm curious why did you put the Virgin up at the top of the image or or in the in the top part of of the image what what what was your what was your thinking there yeah um in in in the well whole lot of things really the Virgin um is like the microcosm of the whole church you know God became man and here so in herself she she's like a a symbol uh fruition of the church so Christ in his humility humbles himself to raise us up so Christ is in the center so even though it's not the highest he's he's in the center so he's always the logos the heart of everything um but he wants to sort of exalt um the church and and that's um symbolized in the Virgin actually had a bit smaller originally but the commission has asked if I could make her larger so all along I was sort of trying to balance Christ as God therefore at the top but in the other hand Christ as God and His humility into his creation and wraps wraps it around himself he's happy as it were to himself to to transfigure transfigure us yeah and there's also like an incarnational movement if you follow from the top and the glory of God here at the top and then you have this Descent of of God into the world as a seed you know in the Virgin and then fully revealed in the end you know uh uh of Christ in the center of the whole story so I think it works really well and it also suggests the East uh and the apps of the the church with with the mother of God there and at the you know kind of in the if you were standing in the church that what you would see right you would see her be back there and then above you you would see Christ and so there's this reflection of that structure in the in the image itself and of course the um it'll be S of dark blue at the very top you got the single sphere but with three prongs coming out so that that is the Holy Trinity three yet one so again you we we go through Christ to the father and through the holy spirit so in in a sense that everything comes from the Holy Trinity at the top and moves toward the Holy Trinity at the top um so the the horizontal gradually gets taken up into the vertical so that's why if we go down to the bottom I um I sort of struggling to unite what we call Kronos clock time yeah with Kos which is more sort of divine and vertical so I decided to have the St of creation and bands and at the bottom just slightly curved but as you go up the curve gets steeper until ultimately it comes to a a point toward Christ um so that at the bottom one starts with the flat the sworded I said where U the world is that form and void and then gradually We rise up to to higher order um one thing I no yeah I hadn't thought of that when I saw it at the outside because I was wondering why do you have these kind of Tears going up and these circles but then now I can clearly see that in in some ways it's the Dome of Heaven that is flattening itself out to become the earth and the opposite is true which is Flat Earth is kind of moving into this this this heavenly shape that's amazing yeah and the the um the gradual sense of creation starts from the outside it comes toward the inside so Andrew want told me that the likely phases of the development of the created world so you've got L ex stink creatures on the the left and the right and gradually As you move forward you come to um more recent creatures so you you got this Kronos on the horizontal being consumated in in the Divine time um okay so that's why you have the like dinosaurs on the outside I was like why what are the dinosaurs doing there I guess it makes sense that they would be on the outside for sure so in some ways it's like this movement into uh into the our experience or like you know the world in which we in which we live um and Christ has sort of um overcome uh death not just in the sense of our physical death but death in terms of Separation so that in some Sublime and comprehensible way um in in Christ or the extinct animals sort of gathered together gathered together into the present so um so they they extinct in another sense in Christ they're not um some people ask me why I've got a hedge around Paradise it's initially just because the word Paradise is a Persian word meaning a a walled Park where the emperor would enjoy time with his family and friends so there always a sense of distinction between Paradise which is planted by God initially and the the thickened world wild world around so the way I see it is that that God planted the garden as like an icon of how he wanted us as the prophets priests and kings and queens of the world to gradually expand the Ws of paradise to make the whole universe of paradise so this distinction between paradise and the rest of the world is important not not to create a sense of sacred and profane but the opposite that that that was the beginning as it were and gradually if we acted correctly which of course we didn't um those Hedges as it were would expand the whole world would become a Garden City basically yeah I think I mean I think your Insight also to make a a wall that is V like a vegetable wall like a you know an organic wall and then have the Heavenly Jerusalem being this stone wall I think it's intuitively very right it just feels right like because you feel that that there is a there was a border there was a limit of to the Garden like you said that was meant to be expanded but that that limit would not have you know would not have been the same type of limit that would be found in a city so I really think it's a intuitively it's a it's a very strong idea to have used the Hedge and also because Gardens we're used to seeing Hedges as as limits in gardens it's but I've never seen that ever like I don't think I've ever seen that represented that way so I think it's a great Insight on your part uh tell us a bit about these this vertical down here like so you have the cross and then you have these two trees I imagine is it the tree of life and the tree of knowledge maybe but tell us a bit about how your decisions on on those yeah I'd always been perplexed you know why God should put this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil there um often Protestant wrers have said all this is to sort of test us but it didn't seem to sort of fit with my understanding of God that he put something there to test us so I was really fascinated when um ephra uh wrote that uh the tree of knowledge and good and evil can be understood as the created world so if we Adam and Eve had received it with Thanksgiving um then it would have been knowledge of good in other words we wouldn't just then have just seen it as a nice fruit but would have seen it as an expression of God's love so we would have received it Eucharistic um but if we just grabbed it because it's just nice to taste and turned our back on God then become knowledge of evil um so that that really made sense to me it it you know God in his humility wanted to create something in a sense from which is absent which is our Free Will okay I've given you everything I'm going to stand back now and and I want you to be grown ups to um to live properly you can live improperly if you want that's your feedom so you got the Fe knowledge andil there which which we botched it up with so that's why Adam and Eve then walking downhill um by the side clothed now um um but so Christ becomes a tree of course the word Ross in Greek is stos but also cilo which can be tree and wood of the cross at the same time so above that is the tree of knowledge of life and I made of three um uh this is the tree of life is is God himself the Trinity and the three colors I've used are those used in the ruof pity icon the sort of the pink and the red and and the green um the far on the left s in the middle and the Holy Spirit on the right um and then of course you got the cross and this is a jeweled cross it won't just be a wooden cross it will be a glorious cross um so Christ enters our World um and as the tree of life becomes dead becomes the cross the tree of death and that becomes the tree of life and Christ said that the the sign of the son of man will appear in the heavens before I return so this is often depicted as a jewel cross in early Roman mosaics so so the cross of Death Becomes um the coming of the kingdom in the future so that's why it's going to be a jewel cross and as you mention men earlier the four rivers come from the cross the Tree of Life um and and Christ above because it's not the cross itself it's Christ on the cross who is the source of the river so so you got these four rivers there yeah I like the idea that because we're used to we see this image you know in the it's funny how you can see how at some point the iconographic intuition is just becomes a language because we're used to seeing the in the image of the last judgment we're used to seeing Fire come from under the feet of Christ uh and then here because you're showing the order of creation rather than the Judgment per se it's still an apocalyptic image but it's a it's a powerful insight to have the water which flows from from Christ through the cross through the trees with all the images that we have of you know Christ's side being pierced and the the water flowing that that was the water of paradise all these images um it's I I I really love I really love it because it's completely new I don't think I've ever seen anything like this but it is at the same time completely traditional because all the associations if you know them they come they they appear right away it shows you how there's all this room within the iconographic language if you do it with the right um attention to tradition but also deep understanding of it that's not just wrote uh copying that you can come up with new images that immediately strike us as right even though we've never seen them before um and so I really love that the the image of the water's coming down I am surprised that you don't have four you have like three rivers should have four you should have four well but there are actually Four now there's four how's that I think it's the um how does it work now I think basically you've got um it's been a while since the design I don't think this I think the river at the top is the fourth one okay so this would be the one and then these would be three okay so that's how you see it like the one and then and then three more yeah and and you notice that the water goes uphill on either side you got this funny sort of yeah yeah wondering about that so um Bishop kalistos once said that Christ comes to us out of the future as well as out of the past and in the present um it's one reason why we Face East we're sort of moving toward the Rising Sun but but Christ and I'm fascinated by the Roman abses the early Roman abses a lot of abses I've been asked to fesco been inspired by this so you have an image of Christ there of course in the apps um but behind you have um brightly colored clouds normally um which are Sunrise colored clouds so on the one hand you're looking at Christ's present here as we worship but on the other hand we're looking at Christ coming in the future so time goes forward and backwards in God so I wanted the river to go uphill as it were as well as downhill um just to sort of play with that sense of the elasticity of time in Christ yeah yeah yeah but I mean there's also a way in which you know we know that the water goes up I mean this is a weird thing like we know that there's this cycle of of of of water and there's this relationship between Heavenly water and Earthly water in in Genesis Genesis 1 but visually what's interesting about it is it has this you know that it is we have a structure that's very very Prim Primal and I don't know to what extent we can explain it but there's a structure you see in iconography and you see it you see the the central pillar across and then two things on the side that are that are doing something like that whether it's the two snakes on the kroer you know whether it is sometimes it's sometimes foliage that will be coming back up on the two sides so there's this deep insight about that this being right and so you know even if even even when I looked at it and and I didn't know what your intention was it didn't matter because it feels right even structurally even if I don't totally understand the meaning there's something about it which I recognize as being something like the center and then these two aspects that are you know coming up to praise coming up to react coming up to even attack sometimes like it could be different different versions of it but it does it it really is the center in these two sides so I I yeah I I thought it looked intuitively right and so the other part which is really interesting to me and I love is that in some ways you have the creation of the the the physical Cosmos at the bottom of the image in some ways because it's the most material and so you have the six days of creation here moving up towards um towards uh Eden and then then up towards the final Revelation so you have this idea in some ways of the you know the this relationship of the different Heavens so you have the firmament kind of under under the Garden of Eden which is which is sounds a little weird but maybe you can tell us a little bit about about those decisions yeah so um when I became Orthodox 40 years ago I remember um my Parish priest father Eve duar reminding me that the Sabbath um is actually the Saturday and the Sunday is the eighth day and I got fascinated by this concept of the eighth day which is join to the previous seven days of creation but the eighth day is also called the first day of eternity after which there no other days so at the bottom you've got these different layers gradually getting steeper in the middle so that you come to seven and the seventh day got one two three four five six seven yeah so Adam and Eve are sort of walking down in the sixth day then you got this sort of seventh there but then everything above the top river is the Eighth Day um so I wanted that that sort of movement that that Progressive Movement um upwards and um a bit of an aside but relevant nonetheless um one method I use for painting is to to do a sort of a puddly especially if I'm doing garments and and ground a rather messy puddle and then gradually add more detail so the garments for example might end up with quite crisp highlights so this made me think that creation and movement toward crisis the Telos isn't leaving chaos behind replacing it just to Pure order you up pure order you've got chaos below bubbling bubbling up all sorts of potentiality um so instead of seeing it horizontally moving from chaos to order with no chaos I thought vertically stacking up um and it happens like that of course in nature that you have mutations happening all the time there sort of chaos of mutations and once in a while one mutation helps you adapt better without that chaotic mutation you wouldn't have the opportunity to select the best to adapt better to one situation um so that fascinated me so you got this rather sort of chaotic water there is some order to it they rly moving up but nonetheless the basis is is this sort of I would think of this chaos of the physical world as the freedom that God has given to the inanimate world you and I as human beings have a free choice in a way that water doesn't but God has given water a certain Freedom through this chaos so at every Point God in his humility gives things a certain Freedom according to their nature yeah I think I think the Insight is is quite is is quite right and you know I always say that the the toou boho you know the the primordial Waters of creation they're still there they're not the God didn't remove them he basically pulled creation out of out of them uh but there's still there you know as this potentiality at the bottom of the world out of which like you said possibility emerges and then and then we we cast light on those possibilities and we select them and we choose them and then we we tend them you could say in order to to make them thriving so no I think I think the the basic structure is is intuitively quite quite right I really enjoy it the other thing that surprised me though is that I would have if I had done this I would have put I would have flipped this I would have put the the sun on this side and I would have put the kind of nighttime on the other side just because I'm used to seeing the the sun on the right hand of Christ you know uh like Adam and Eve and then you see the Sun and the Moon that's that's the one thing that that was one of those the very very few things when I looked at I was like I would have flipped that but you know when we look at each other's work you know we look at it you know through the the prism of someone who who who who when he sees a beautiful image like this wishes he I wish I would have been the one to make it you know it's like oh this is so it I wish I would have the one to have made this image well it's still I mean I'm still um taking in in advice so this is um the first draft in a way um um Andrew got people to give feedback but um it's interesting that the Hebrew day begins with sunset not sunrise in Mount Athos I was for a while we would set the clocks by the sunet so there's a movement from Darkness toward light and to read left to right of course so there is that progression from dark to light and on the left you've got sort of the little Speckles there that's like the dust which gradually culate in into the planetary um constellations um so that's a again chotic movement now one thing I'd say that um who do you think is to the left and right of Christ well my understanding you know it took me a while to think about to to realize what it was but then when I looked at the way the image was structured I think I real because I like it well it's clearly not the mother of God and and John the Baptist and then I thought it's Adam and Eve that's it but again why did you you flip them up here so you have them is it because you wanted to have the Virgin and St John The Foreigner structure at the top um yeah um good point really um can't remember why I put them on that way yeah because that because you usually see Adam at the right side and in the in the last judgment so that's what that's the thing that threw me off a little bit I was like oh who are yeah perhaps they ought to change them over then yeah so that people relate that to the resurrection yeah the anastasis has that and then in the often you see in the last judgment you see them kneeling at the altar uh you know beneath the feet of Christ and so they have that order yeah I think it's a great idea you know because it does tell the final story in some ways in a in a manner that I've never seen told because you know we represent this idea often the idea that you're representing here we often represent it as the apostles you know sitting and ruling with Christ that type of of imagery but I think the idea of showing Adam and Eve as a king and a queen in the Kingdom um it it brings it all together in terms of creation right if we're talking about image of creation I think it's a wonderful insight and quite a bit in though in the way that those figures will be dressed it's a bit difficult on this tiny scale but they won't just be king and queen but also be prophets so they'll probably have a prophet hat and also you notice that they're offering Bread and Wine okay yeah I was wondering I didn't I didn't catch that okay yeah yeah so this is a symbol of them using creation properly in other words they've changed from partaking incorrectly of the created world and are taking properly which is to Fashion it well to make good wine and good bread but also then offer it to God with Thanksgiving in other words to see the logos within the logo of all his creation so they're being restored to their role as Prophet priest and king um and and above them of course representatives of the whole of the church um there'll be people of all different races there and different ages male and female so uh as with the mother to God that group behind will be a summation of the church but also in Adam and Eve it's a summation of the the church I I'll fall their because they're being raised that struck me actually when I first saw the resurrection Ancon when I became Orthodox that was wonderful that the very people Adam and Eve through whom the whole of creation fell are actually the first to be saved I thought yeah that that's God's forgiveness the ones who messed it up are the first to be raised yeah and there's already an Insight of the cosmic aspect of what's happening at the resurrection like you can you can feel that this is hinting to this this Cosmic moment that you're showing here which is in some ways I I really love the idea it really just all of it comes together because in the in the Book of Revelation you have this idea that you know the K the kingdoms offer their crowns up you know and also in some ways all their good works are kind of offered up to to Christ um and using the bread and the wine because people who don't know but in the the the the traditional idea of the of the Eucharist was that the people make the bread you know and then they bring it up so that it will then be consecrated so it's like an offering of creation you've talked about this I think even with me before you know the the idea that that it's this offering of all creation ultimately in the Eucharist is what's going on and so having that up here in the Heavenly Jerusalem is a great is a great way to to to create that summation um one of the things too that you went you mentioned about the the the seven days I don't know if you thought about it but if you have the seventh day being here um that's also the Sabbath in the sense of the Cross right because we have this idea that that the holy Sabbath is the day that Christ the day of of Christ death and it's the perfect Sabbath I I was rereading parts of St Maximus the Confessor this this morning and um I was really taken by how um he talks about the cross he says all ible things phenomena in in the Greek need a cross and all intelligible things spiritual things invisible things need a tomb and what do you meant by all visible things need a cross um Maximus is saying that I'm looking at the horizontal part of the Cross go God created great diversity and Embraces that diversity everything doesn't melt down to Big Blob that that you know tree is a tree and a rocks a rock Etc but then the vertical you got to go down first to the logos um at the heart that created all these and then they're raised up to the heights to to return them to the logos without losing their distinction and then he says that the intelligible things our spiritual perception of things needs a tomb in other words we need to go beyond and this is the whole symbol thing isn't it that we God comes to us through symbols but then there's always something beyond the symbol so if we cling to the symbol we we die so we got to receive that Glory but also take it to the tomb and say wow there's another one Beyond even that and one beyond that so um that was one aspect of his teaching I wanted to show that that that the sort of centrality of the Cross not just just the death of Christ but as you've often said it's like a tree isn't it that's rooted in heaven rooted on Earth it spreads out but yet it's one yeah connect conect to to to the sky then it will die definitely definitely so so tell us about the plan for this image you said it's going to be in a in a a church uh and are you going to be document I I imagine you'll be documenting the the making of it it's quite a it's quite an undertaking yeah yes well um probably actually it'll end up in the University um I don't know if it'll be in the chapel but in the University anyway but because it'll be painted an egg tempera and I like to leave egg temper at least six months before I varish um Andrew suggested that uh I have it and use it in England in fact I've been asked to give a talk at the bath orthorx Arts Festival again so hopefully I'll have it ready by then and we can take it there um but you know I quite like to to have it as a as a as a talking point um I mean it is an icon in the sense that it's iconographic but it's so it'll be painted on a panel it won't be painted yeah yeah okay A 2 meter panel uh well we haven't decided entirely but it'll be big anyway yeah between 1 Point six to two6 okay all right wow um so yeah I mean I want to be a talking point and um it's it's more I suppose it's more like an illuminated manuscript in the sense that it's it's not something that you put in the church to venerate though I suppose you could say that if there is one day of the lurgical year where it would be appropriate it would be September the 1st which the previous patriarch um appointed as the day of creation so it is actually part of the Church calendar now and so I suppose but it's also it is I think it's a I think that your image is is an is an apocalyptic image I think that it it's appropriate in the in that sense that it's completely coherent with a an image of Revelation which focuses on the summation rather than the judgment and so although it's an image that we've never seen before I think that it fits perfectly well with with uh with our tradition you know and and uh there are there are versions of that like in the west you have these types of images that try to show the ontological relationship between Christ and the world it's not like there aren't there are many precedents I think for for your image it's just that you bring it together in such a such a cohesive such a cohesive way which in some ways is the thing that that we're that we can do right that we can we can stand on the shoulder of giants as we say and yeah kind of say oh well I see these threads coming together you know we can just push it a little further and see how it how it comes together um that's it the generala for the arrangement came from an icon all creation rejoices a new a Russian icon the idea the arch at the top and that's very different in the bottom half but um that that the the the sort of the white upper area with the Arches that was inspired by that the I wasn't sure how to depict the New Jerusalem which is a square basically with 12 gates um as I came across this image from um it's a fresco um from Italy uh painted in 1090 I think San petro alonte and Cate in Italy um I think the reason why they've done it like that is you want everything to be visible nothing is hidden so this is the only way really you can get all 12 gates visible yeah yeah yeah that sort of it's sort of a square but but it's not and I've wanted all 12 gates visible um that's right okay so I see in in it's a great it's a great solution to to to show an iconographic space space that reveals itself um but that still suggests the the square without hiding the different parts yeah yeah you see A lot's been written recently really from the time of George um s Pinsky um on the different perspective systems used in icons and inverse perspective is sort of stolen the scene but in fact I figured there about seven types of Icon perspective one is multiview perspective like in this one it's just say you're viewing the square or cubic whatever it is New Jerusalem from all different angles at once so all gates are visible um of course in God God is not limited to space so in general and I can't sort of confounds our rational faculty to help us to go from from there which is good but it has limitations into the Noose into the netic faculty which can this is the real Tesseract not not this scientific stuff about four dimensions like this is this is an actual Tess act where you can show everything you know simultaneously in in a in a space but it it's interesting to think about that what you said because in some ways you know if you think of the I would say that this is a a me a meaningful cubism in some ways where the cubists did it in a manner that was aesthetic and not necessarily trying to point to meaning but now you're you're flipping space and you're you're showing all these different facets simultaneously but rather to reveal something about about creation and the the relationship between one and and 12 so that's a I think it's a great it's a great fact probably all of the as it word discoveries which really rediscoveries of 20th century art um color field painting for example saying well the surface is flat so I try to make it threedimensional you know using perspective whatever all these things really have always been in in the sacred um tradition um but as you say cubism for example is always there in the icon that we kept it in the realm of the Sacred just haven't taken that one aesthetic tool and sort of SHP rated it which is really exciting I think a lot a lot of research has been done on a lot of the um uh Orthodox roots of of early modernism um often in a de based way but you know it's it's there it's it's not actually a Discovery at all um yeah and there are ways that we can recapture and I mean I think that's some of the work that you've done father suan many of the of the Romanian artists as well who are trying to kind of say okay well let's get you know we can also take some of the best elements of these traditions and reintegrate them into a vision that that is hierarchical and you know and doesn't doesn't try to just transgress to transgress but rather is able to kind of mold real mold our vision so that we can have a a better Insight yes yeah so tell me a bit about the carving that's back behind you because you know it's like you you're tempting me by putting that up right right put it I put it there for you Donan just for you yeah this has been quite a complex commission it's the three the use and the the furnace and it's commissioned for an Orthodox Church to have a interior door and it's going to be the upper panel of of a door so it's it's carved and this will be in a door yeah set into a door yeah um it's quite quite large you can see quite large nice whatever that is three feet three feet high or something um yeah it's beautiful I mean it's also I'm so jealous I've never had the chance to do uh to do a color uh carving to have to have it painted it's quite it's really amazing wow I found sometimes um it's quite good to polychrome as long as you do justice to the wood carving and have to sort of cake it and uh paint so you can see the coming through um because you don't depend so much from good lighting to show the detail yeah with low relief if the lighting isn't good it just looks a bit like a blob at a distance um and so yeah you've done it with stain instead of painting it um painting it like yeah I used oil paint but put lots and lots of um uh turps in so it's almost for stain really so semi sealed the wood first um and then um used oil um you can't really use any temper in a sit situation like this and then um and then put a a thin coat of varnish and waxed it over the top yeah it's it's really beautiful is that the only are you g to make are there other panels for this this just this one just this one yeah yeah yeah I hadn't seen you carve in a while though have you because it seems like this is it's been a while since I've seen you make such an elaborate carpet yeah well I uh I don't suppose so many people commission carving so I I just do what I'm commissioned to do but yeah um I did two car was about two years ago but yeah there big gaps where I don't get anything stone is more common because it can be part of an icon screen or whatever um actually I don't know about you but I find Stone easier to carve than wood with wood for sure so many chisels and you got to worry about the Grain and yeah Stone you just have flat chisel pretty much you just you know and then this and then wood it's like this whole and you have to keep them super sharp you know with stone you don't have to think about it so much sharpen them a little not too much even you don't want them to be too sharp yeah I prefer I prefer ging Stone by far yeah and it's primarily soap stone isn't it or stype rather yeah the the that's mostly what I'm doing have you ever tried to carve the Ste well you really kindly gave me um a piece but I just I just haven't got around to carve you I'd really like to yeah once you carve that you won't you won't you won't be able you know you you'll start writing me emails saying Jonathan I need more of that stype yeah I have carved Ivory um that that's a bit similar I suppose and that it's got no grain at all and very very dense um and uh when I was at Mount AOS I was commissioned to carve something for the patriarch and there's a wood called flori which I never come across before it's um Bally grainless it's not boxwood but bit like boxwood to look at but not not as hard as boxwood I did an icon of the port icon with it and I really enjoyed that have you ever tried carving boxwood before oh yeah yeah yeah that's really amazing yeah it's it's good stuff yeah all right I wanted to say about the the icon is the challenge was being pedagogic in the sense of of teaching but I just don't like images that are just like um illustrations and are like things you read in one's mind so and that sort of takes away that uh solish of work I think a work of art should always hit you right in the soul of plexus and then you and um unfold the inner meaning so I I just found the only way to get the unity was to really have a reduced color scheme so basically all green and and blue which are very close um and then I started reading um a book um this one actually I've got over here um by um this one here and and she she uses the Greek term inar not not in inar but in in Aria um which is really the the immediate impact of aesthetic um on the soul um and if they're done in the right way then it it it brings us closer to guard rather than just being titilation so um apart from all the content of the icon I really wanted it to have it have it beautiful in its own right and the composition and the color and I was really struggling with that but then I found if I really limited the color palette then um there the details there it sort of becomes one yeah because there are a lot of details and you're right if you had you could get distracted by all the little animals and all the you know all the dinosaurs and all the these things but I like you said you don't have that experience I think I think a lot of it is also because Christ let's let me share this again um and so I think that it's also because the Christ appears very strongly and the you know the the colors here the the kind of orange yellow color and also Adam and Eve so the the characters in this Center uh because the colors are stronger there then all these little details here maybe at first seem ornamental uh and then they and so they kind of they kind of fuse together but if you pay attention to them you can see them but they don't but they don't uh they don't call out you know they don't uh yes I limited those the color palettes of the the trees and animals to the left and right so they're there but they're not different colored you know if I put green leaves everywhere then they're distract from Christ yeah what is this here this little image here yeah that's um the the the um the lion with the kid you know the Prophecies of Isaiah yeah um so you've got them there and on the other side as well so it's the prophecy of Isaiah that the you know the lion shall lay down for lamb and so on okay okay yeah you got on the right there you got the the the wolf and the the wolf and the the and here the lion and this then this is just like a person that's with them like showing them the child shall put a hand in the ASP the in the asps F yeah oh right okay yeah yeah okay a thought of that all right all right and also you've got dinosaurs um uh eating grass there so that you've got there it now yeah on the left there you've got a Tyrannosaurus Rex eating grass on the left there yeah yeah so I have to say that the dinosaurs they weird me out a little bit they because I would have I would have put dragons is what I would have put inste of dinosaurs well I can I can put one in for you just for you John yeah oh if you did that if you put a dragon in there just for me I would be grateful forever I should put that in I'm I'm putting notes down of everything I'm join so I I'll change every Anan and I'll put a dragon it little drag uh and so what tell us a bit about about your your future plans because you're in a new workshop now you're you're focusing on that giving giving some trainings and everything maybe tell people what you're up to besides this this particular image yeah thank you um yes I just moved um to a larger Studio because um my two previous apprentices um uh Blackstone and Martin o um have moved down to chitester now it's approached by them two years ago the Anglican cathedral to help them set up a thetical art center so it has two elements to it one is to train people to much higher standard not just an icon painting but Frisco carving that sort of thing so so Jim and Martin are are heading that um but the second aror of the center is to also educate priests and decision makers and and as much as anything how to help them brief people like Architects like if you're lucky enough to someone like Andrew gold who knows what they're doing it's fine but a lot of Architects haven't done Church work so a we're trying to get involved with seminaries Catholic an and Orthodox to um I suppose equip uh the decision makers just with the main principles of commissioning work um priest can't tell an architect for example or or an iconographer how to do things but at least they can say this is the atmosphere this is the state of Soul this is how the lit operates so what you do is got to work liturgically and spiritually um you know basically how to give a brief um uh so anyway Martin and Jim have have gone down there so that meant that I had space for more es so I have a lovely young man 25y old man from New Zealand um who's joined me a few months ago and then another is coming from New Zealand um for short of pain intership so yeah and wonderful and for those who don't know like that been following kind the whole story the the the Snow White book that we published with Heather pollington uh you know beautiful beautiful book and now Heather is studying with Aiden he's been studying now with you for a few months now um and I'm already seeing we're doing Rapunzel now we're doing the second book and and now the all the the stylistic choices that she's making and I can see that she's mastering folds and she's mastering certain elements of iconography that you know take a take some time to to uh to dive in and she's creating these beautiful bridges between kind of secular illustration and iconography and so I know that I have I have you to thank in in in large part for that so I appreciate that that's been real Joy having here are so pleased that she began working with you because it had been a vision of hers to be a full-time legal artist and um yeah it can be really hard to find an opening but things opened up very very quickly for her and I I do go on about garments quite a lot I tell to my students but I've run this threeyear part-time icon course um you faces they're not easy but at least all faces and mor the same yeah in the sense that they got two eyes and nose on the mouth but garments Draper is so much more complex so much a lot of work um so I really sort of hammer it's got to be a certain logic to it that um that uh we transfigure the world we don't distort it and I think a lot of iconography distorts FS you know doesn't show understanding so I think I really really labor that so I'm pleased that uh she's coming along well yeah I think that's definitely in your work it's something that I really appreciate because you can see that in late iconography Russian iconography especially at some point the the Garment just become abstract shapes uh which which is beautiful to some extent but at some point becomes almost disincarnate and I think in some ways even the fact that that you started as a Carver you you and and me also as a as an icon Carver the the vestments have to make sense because or else you can't you can't carve it if it it's complete if it's just like lines and just abstract things it looks horrible and so this desire to kind of come back to a something which like you said is both make sense but has a transfigured element to that I think it's a it's definitely definitely the way forward because you can't at some point the abstraction just falls apart and you it's just disconnects with reality so I think it's a general principle with life isn't it that um I know father Barnabas my my spiritual father in Wales a blessed memory he said that if you want to know God you must know the soil from which you came first you if we try to LEAP to higher things then we'll crash down very quickly so I think just understanding the the laws in creation like how a branch comes out from a a trunk for example just basic things like that all those should be embodied in in in the icon yes I'm doing that some interesting Fresco work well silica paint probably rather than real Fresco for abses so things seem to go through different phases with be a lot of apsidal commissions at the moment which is great I love because it LS wraps around you of course um and because there abses in churches which probably won't have scope for other work you've got to say a lot orbe it with hopefully Elegance in that one space so that's why I go back to these Roman abses where you got Christ and a few Saints um but also the New Jerusalem indicated by Bethlehem and Jerusalem um and often sheep moving toward the center so that's like all of all of the faithful and time moving toward Christ yeah and these I think your your intuition about abses is one that I caught right away when I started looking at your work and I I thought was was the right way to go because you see a lot of Orthodox Churches end up in either Catholic buildings or Anglican buildings and so they don't have a dome uh and so then they they want to kind of maintain the iconography of the Church of the Dome with the apps so they'll end up putting the virgin in the apps but then they don't know where to put Christ and so they'll they'll sometimes like like stick a like a a flat disc you know at the at the ceiling and there's it's like there's a there's a like a perfectly Orthodox solution to this problem which is to understand the apps as a little microcosm of the whole church and to have Christ at the top sometimes you can even have the Virgin underneath him you know you see images of that where you have Christ in glory and then the Virgin with child and the apostles like there are different ways to do it where you can capture all the same symbolism not in the same scope but at least the essence of the same symbolism in the apps without without distorting your architecture you know well this is something this is exactly what I'm talking about the need to educate priests seminarians anyone who makes these sort of decisions what you said it's just the most basic thing work with what you've got and don't try to make it something you to doent if it's a basilica treat it as a basilica not a dome church I I don't think it would require much time in a seminary to get these things across you know to three days you could even in a day the very basic principles could be communicated so I hope that anyone's listening to this podcast who can have influence in seminaries please please have of you you know just just have it as not not optional but mandatory for everyone in a seminary to have at least a day or two not in how to pain icons at all but just principles of and you know and ask Jonathan and and Andrew myself you know put down on two sides of A4 the principles to have in mind I'm beg of you whoever's out there we we'll make a video for you and you can just show it to the students like we'll do that yeah so all of you listening at St Vlad stons you know all these American seminaries and the European seminaries yeah I think that's a great that's a great Insight a great Insight oh well Aiden thank you so much you know I I always love talking to you and I cannot wait to see this image come to fruition um you know I'll I'll once you have pictures of you working on it please send them to me and I'll also share them because I think it's going to be a wonderful work lovely good yeah I'm I'm starting a patreon site in hopefully a few days might because of your advice so I'll be I'll be putting up dates on on that as well but I'll I'll let you know all right this is a way to support Aiden's work you know the iconographers they they give their life to to Sacred art and give their life to the church and so we need to we definitely need to help them be able to do that and so I will definitely be checking out your patreon as soon as it's up and uh and I encourage everybody to go there thank you love you s show Jonathan thanks a inspiration bye
