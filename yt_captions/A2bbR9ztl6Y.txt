I'm not really exactly sure how or where this came about but someone pinged me about this and the thing is is that I think my number one thing that I get with a lot of you a lot of you degenerates okay I'm talking to you degenerate is that you guys are always just like so freaked out about the future and Ai and then this guy comes in here dropping the no code dropping the AI dropping the Ai No code then also has this man which clearly looks like a scientist okay maybe not the best posture you know his ear is definitely not below his shoulder okay that's not how you that this is not a firm erection you know and I I know plenty of people as they get older they're not able to you know perform as well but still we gotta work on this okay we gotta work on this and so here's what the Tweet says right supervised a project two week two week ago two programmers were hired to create an MVP I have worked with both before Alex from Germany 100 code 19 years experience uh Hamid from Pakistan a code plus copilot plus Jeopardy four plus no code four years of experience what do you think happened now this is for me this feels like one of those articles that I'm I because of an article like this I'm gonna get 9 000 messages being like should I not go into programming should I not go into programming because clearly we're all screwed okay so first off always good thing to do make sure you know what's going on here okay no notice that we we might have we might have like potentially some conflict of interest here you know what I mean uh we we might we might have some some things going on here and if you you go you go look around make sure you understand who the person is that we're talking about okay just so that way you don't get upset uh anyways so this happened and then he goes on and says all right um well okay hey come on where's the where where where's where's the Tweet thread is his own tweet thread not showing up okay there it is funny both programmers received figma screens and detailed specs a designer was a LSA was available to assist them with uh the assets they needed and there was also existing code that needed to be integrated uh Hamid finished the first version in one week with 100 test coverage and end-to-end testing of no code Parts ninety percent of uh of the work seems to be finished and appears to work at first glance so I forgot so so I forgot so I forgot again to turn off alerts okay is this what kind of Life do you want from me huh what kind of Life do you want for me what do you want from me what do you want what do you what do you want what do you want you don't even know what you want all right so let's I'll deal with you here in a second whoever did such a just such a naughty thing I'll be right back hold on we gotta finish this uh let's see Hamid built uh the UI front end or workflows and bubble generated cloudflare workers using Jeopardy 4 integrated existing code using copilot and generated tests using Jeopardy 4 playwright Java I don't know Ava I don't know that one what's Ava is that a new one I thought we already had Cyprus I thought we already had playwright I already thought we had Puppeteer do we need another one damn is that another one Ava's jest oh that's just a runner oh I clearly am not keeping up with the new stuff all right uh let's see new cost 211 dollars copilot 20 bucks cloudflare five bubble 134 compensation bam look at that Costa host slash run 139 a month that seems so high what the hell is going on how are you spending that much money to host whatever you're doing I have many questions right here about just this number but anyways we won't we'll don't get focused let's see Alex finished uh just around seven percent of the tasks cost versus 20 bucks compensation 3500 estimated to develop everything 45k and expects 11k for adding tests costs to run 20 a month serverless all right so first off let's okay hold on let's keep on going actually I do want to see what he has to say here uh this was a project I supervised for a friend of mine with an agency now that's a key word there I only did it because I was really curious about how it turned out we both thought that Hamad would finish her in eight to ten weeks while Alice would take one or two uh extra but the results amazed us he uh see he had a talk with Alex about this his response but it will be so much cheaper to run this app and you'll have everything under control not understanding the opportunity cost of shipping 13 times slower and 25 times more expensive to develop Alex was let go because he wants to code and doesn't trust no code slash AI the development agency of my friend has a hundred developers like Alex now he is going to retrain or replace them with developers like Hamid I think people like ComEd will uh still have work from five years from now while people like Alex will have to find other job slash professions so I do have a lot of opinions about this so first off I'd like to say that my belief that this is or is not fake is already fairly uh fairly questionable okay this this seems like the greatest trick Terminator ever played right obviously getting people to buy in that the Terminator is not real when really the Terminator is trying to fool you this whole time right okay I can already feel that happening but the thing that first off we have no idea so there's a lot of there's a lot of things going on here right so like what I want you to look at is that this this happens a lot whenever you read articles especially involving statistics or time frames right there's a lot of things that people may not you you may not realize right so like first off Alex from Germany 100 code 19 years experience how old is figma how old is whatever he's building right is it 19 years of experience building this one thing what a what are the difference right uh second off we don't really know how much this Hamid guy actually used Jeopardy for versus not versus uh using his his own knowledge right there's a lot of things we don't understand about the situation right these are very vague terms and there's nothing in here that really gives you like a great idea what these people are experts in what they aren't experts in uh has admit to nothing but build this like exact project it's like an agency project is this like his specialty area where is the where Alex may not be especially like we don't know anything about it right so there's like a lot of questions options I have for this second off I'm also I I'm just the reason why this bothers me is that we have no details about it and this idea that someone's able to integrate and have all these tests like first off this just right here this this metric is just like super suspicious whenever I see this I think okay that doesn't matter right it doesn't matter it has never mattered 100 code coverage has no guarantee or even authority to say that you have less or more bugs right uh there is no security vulnerabilities mentioned right uh we have no idea what any of these things are so it just feels something about it feels really really weird you know what I mean um and so we don't know another thing we don't like ours worked 41 I have no idea we don't do hours worked here which also feels really odd right you see you see a large difference in Pay right there's just some things that I'm very curious about even if this this guy costs a lot more they only put in 10 hours right wasn't able to really focus on it we don't know any of the details we know nothing uh second off I actually did take some time and I really have been trying chat Jeopardy you know what I mean I've really been trying Chad Jeopardy uh at my job to try to become like to really understand this and so what I've been doing is anytime I have to use python I use chat Jeopardy to generate all the stuff and at this point I already know that I could have done it faster I could have done it better if I would have just taken instead of the two hours to get Jeopardy to do it right just taking the two hours to just read I would have already been faster at this and I'm just using it to graph stuff with matplotlibs and pandas or or an Umpire or whatever the hell it is right and so it's just I sit there and I think what am I getting out of this and then second off I also noticed something that is really unique about using chat Jeopardy yeah chat Jeopardy four I use four I don't use I don't I'm not not some 3.5 club uh but something else I noticed about it code that I've been generating with Jeopardy I have like a hesitancy to change because I understand none of it and I've taken absolutely no attempts or affordances to try to learn it instead I'm just letting it make it and I I feel like there's something really bizarre about that where I there's just like when I need to change something I get it to kind of like like I just copy paste it in and be like can you change this right and so it changes it it works like I've been able to get through my tasks but I can but I but I've noticed a lot of things about it that are very unscalable like uh when I asked it to be like all right I need some environment arguments I need to be able to pass in a file and all this it gave me like some of the worst patterns ever it gave me a lot of really just poorly thought through designs that even me with very little python understanding can completely tell that what it's writing is not just technical debt it's a full rewrite right if I have to upgrade this this is a full rewrite to make it useful right and what I noticed is that you really have to you really have to have a lot of understanding to guide the AIS into the right place and when there's a bug sometimes the AIS cannot proceed you know what I mean they just can't you can generate Legacy code extremely fast it's essentially a script key it's a script Kitty that doesn't understand if it's programming something correct or incorrect cheap to start yeah so that's that's what my worry is when I see all this like I get it I wrote something that made nice graphs that I could display the point I wanted to make cheap cost me nothing cost me an hour of my time I kept finding myself getting distracted and going on Twitter or doing something because chat Jeopardy 4 takes so long to generate stuff but if I had to maintain that code like the cost was definitely larger like it definitely was a step up than if I were to write it myself so I really do think that there's something here that is just not being properly captured we're missing a lot of the details about the setup a lot of the details about this and and the reason why I wanted to kind of go over this is not because I'm really interested in AI code stuff I think it's mildly nice right like I think it uh I think it's nice to just like have a little right um you know I mean it's nice to have a just some quick things here and there but what worries me about this is a people get freaked out they think their jobs are gonna end your job's not gonna end but B people also think this is like a good or a good replacement of people like the the damage this is going to do to our current ecosystem is insane like it's gonna require things to get so much better right it's going to require so much more like goodness and so I don't know I I it just feels it just feels strange what do you think I actually am curious like for those that actually have used chat Jeopardy what do you think how much have you used do you do does anyone in here feel like ai's taking their job in the next three years does anyone actually feel that way no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no scared of it yeah I feel like a lot of new people have a scared of it maybe in five interesting as a beginner I think it it looks magical I think as a beginner it looks manager yeah so this is I think this is this is the take right is that you will waste a lot of time I think the thing is is that I think chat Jeopardy is much better in English approximation yeah you can use the concepts I I hear it's graded like finding documentation I haven't used it as a documentation only tool yet yeah yeah I think so too I think that there's all there's a huge amount of that that will definitely happen finally got to watch you live streaming versus watching your streams on YouTube nice nice well welcome uh no it takes too much damn uh hallucinous yeah dude this is so this is true this is right on so my my general the the thing that I worry a huge amount about is that it can look 95 correct and to get it to 96 is going to be a huge effort to get it to 97 is going to be a huger effort right like each one of these little bits better is gonna be just an enormous amount of like we have to vastly change how we're doing things for this to actually become something amazing uh I have almost no trust in it after uh after all the time it lied to me yeah yeah I use it daily with Pro let's see proper prompts it's very powerful but you have to learn uh proper prompting so I mean I let's get we're positive I'm just uh we're we're going all in on the positive uh it only made me lazy and I couldn't understand the code I meant so this is actually a really interesting take which is another thing I've been kind of thinking about which is as you get spoon fed more and more what happens to experience and so my big worry with AI is experience because here's the deal is that to become experienced as an engineer you have to fail right the only truest way to become experienced is failing and learning how to unfail you have to be able to see something and learn how to do it differently and this could be done via someone else helping you this could be done by like a mentor this could be done by you just reading documentation you got to kind of do a lot of it um it's but it's gonna rob you a lot of that right like chat Jeopardy is gonna rob you a lot of your experience and so I'm very curious what the next Generations of programmers are going to be are they going to be incapable right it'll be interesting it'll be interesting nonetheless uh we'll see I don't know I actually have no idea um I think I mean co-pilot and chat Jeopardy are the same thing at this point aren't they aren't they the same AI running in the back end at this point uh it's also great for debugging uh as a replacement yeah yeah I mean I could I could see debugging being pretty cool if it could if it can have sufficient I mean because sometimes it's too hard like sometimes bugs are just too vast for to be able to to find stuff but I'm curious if it's any good fine for documentation plus one okay copilot is fine-tuned it is fine-tuned co-pilot's nice for certain items right like I like copilot if I'm getting it to generate things that I don't want to type but getting co-pilot to do the right thing before I've done it like I don't let co-pilot lead me I lead co-pilot and then it works really well but anything else it's just like you are just just in a terrible position you know what I mean uh I read it's good at finding and exploiting security holes interesting that I mean that to me that might make more sense right and the reason why I say it might make more sense is that is that security holes one could argue are more of like a a like mathematical problem in some sense like hey you've allowed yourself to do these things wrong right like there's a series of things you have to do and then there's a then there's like the art side of it and so I'm curious I'm curious if that would do it low-level learning saying absolutely not have you used it low level learning have you used it as a means to do that on it that it's not good okay interesting okay so he doesn't think it's good ah okay designed for regex yeah so yeah but I would never use a regex so there you go there's the problem have you uh let's say have you used the API for actual product work so I haven't used the API yet I I really do want to try playing around with the API part this is kind of interesting yeah yeah I could see that it's good for reverse engineering bad for uh bug finding interesting okay okay I like that anyways I just wanted to talk a minute about this because I see so many people always freaked out it's like the number one thing you see is people getting just totally freaked out about uh uh what's it called about the AI especially new people you knew people don't worry about it trust me you got time become good at what you're doing take the effort it takes to like learn things and honestly even if we start going into this AI future where we all just program with AI you will be so much more capable like you're just gonna you're gonna be able to move much faster just knowing how things work right uh and so even if I could fully use chat Jeopardy and Chad Jeopardy was able to give me really great answers then yeah I would still have a leg up because I understand how things were you know work underneath underneath it and yeah I think AI is AI is effectively in crypto hype cycle nft right it's like at three weeks into the nft side right yeah I'm not worried about uh general intelligence at all I'm not worried about any of that I know I I have I mean I I got part of a masters in Ai and I I'm not like I'm not like completely worried about it like I I don't think it's I don't think I think people are overestimating what it does and so just thought all right um I'd like this keep on going I think it'd be fun to go back and get my masters but I would want to find I'd have to think about what I would want to do anyways yeah autopilot's great um anyways yeah I mean air traffic control is still purely manual very interesting right uh all right let's uh let's call this one right here okay you know why because the names the name's the prime gen okay the name is the primogen
