- This is $70,000.
(cash register dings) And whichever one of you
I find last keeps it. (participants cheering) This is a rundown amusement
park with countless buildings, and literally infinite places to hide. There's a timer counting
down from 20 minutes. Good luck.
(participants screaming) $70,000. Don't forget. (intense music)
- Let's go! - We're doing it. This is my first time in
the Mr. Beast challenge. - We're not going out first. That's my only goal. - I am extremely nervous. - Why is everyone walking? Is there a speed limit?
(car zooming) - In about 19 and a half minutes, we're gonna go looking for them. And as I said, whoever we
find last gets $70,000. Chandler, don't hide in the bathroom. - I'm not hiding in the bathroom. I already pooped twice today. - I think this will be my spot for now. - We got 15 minutes. I'm not gonna run. - Can we fix it, Karl?
- Yes, we can. - I think I'm gonna go
under this game, you guys. (strains) Oh my God. Really cozy. - It's a little dangerous,
but I think it's worth it. (upbeat music)
I'm gonna hide in here. Don't know how long I can stay in here. I'd rather lose my legs
than lose this game. - Right behind this couch. I got nothing. This is a bad idea. - Hey, Yes Theory, what's
your theory on winning? - Not much of a theory right now. (Mr. Beast laughing)
Trying to figure it out. This is terrifying. - Just a quick reminder
that $70,000 is on the line. There's just a lot of things
you could do with this. - That would buy a lot of bananas. - You can buy a lot of bananas. Three, two, one.
(clock beeping) (Chris cheering)
$70,000 On the line. Karl, were coming for you. - Why me?
- I'm with Karl. The game has officially started. (intense music)
- Let's do this. - And so the hunt begins.
- I smell 'em. - [Mr. Beast] There are so many places they could be hiding right now. I guess it makes sense to just
start off with this building. Oh, is someone under here? Ah. Okay. Chris, you search the chairs, I'll search behind the counter. Someone's in here. Nope. We gotta check all these cabinets. Nope. Okay. What'd you find? - There's a trash can with a box. - [Mr. Beast] Lift it. - [Chris] Ah. It would've
been a good spot though. - All right. This building's clear. Let's go do the next one.
- Let's go, go, go. - You go first. I'm scared. Breach.
- Whoa. - [Mr. Beast] Is this like a musical? - [Chris] This is gonna attract people. - Chris, be careful. There's an ice maker and... Nope. Okay, I'll let that slide for now. It's so scary. Why is this broken? This place is massive and this is just one of 50 buildings. Any luck over there?
- Nope. - We've almost cleared two buildings. Haven't found anyone yet. We're coming for you guys. Don't worry. They're in here.
- They're in here. - [Mr. Beast] Radar's going off. - [Chris] Oh, I do see some
disturbage on the leafs. - [Mr. Beast] Hey Chris, you wanna search behind the counter? - [Chris] Nothing in here.
That's such a good spot, bro. - [Mr. Beast] Did you
search in this cooler? - Yeah.
- I know where someone is. Back here.
(wooden box grinding) Yippee ki-yay... (intense music) (banging on door) Oh, wait. I found someone.
- What? No. What are you doing?
- Why are you on the toilet? (hip hop music)
- There's no toilet paper. I've been here for like 30 minutes. - Cody, you are the first one out. - That was my only goal. Not to be first. - We're not going out
first. That's my only goal. - Now you have to spend
the entire day in prison. Welcome to jail. Come on in, the door's right there. And I'm gonna have to
close the door behind you. Enjoy your stay.
- Good job. - We promise to bring other people. - Get Karl.
- We will. Attention. Attention. Cody is out (glass shattering)
and he is in jail. - I'm sorry for you, Cody, but I'm also kind of happy about it. - He probably farted again. - That means I'm not the first one out. And that's all I care about. - One down, nine more to go. We're coming for you.
None of you are safe. If someone hid in this trashcan, I'm sorry for what I'm about to do. (piercing high pitch tone)
Dud. There's footprints back here. - [Chris] Somebody might
have tried to hide there. - We've searched most of
the buildings in this town. (hip hop music)
Now the crazy part is this town isn't the only place. There's two other towns. So this game is literally
gonna take an entire day. All right. Here's the second town. Hey, Chris.
- Yeah. - [Mr. Beast] Quick,
there's a room over here. - [Chris] There's gotta
be someone in here. - [Mr. Beast] Wait, I
heard a noise back here. I swear. I heard a noise back there. (suspenseful music)
- You can go under. Oh, this is sketchy.
- This is terrifying. Wait, is someone in here? I feel like someone's in here.
- Breach it. And breach.
(piercing high pitch tone) - Nope. - Perhaps they went round back. - [Kelly] They walked right past me. - It's been snowing for
three hours straight. (intense music)
Now the final town is up here. We're gonna go check it out. (caddy engine rumbling)
Yeet! Let's find some more people.
- Go! - Jimmy?
- What is that? - What is this?
- What? - How about under there?
(wood clatters) - [Chris] There's a worm, but we're good. (ominous music)
- Not under that. (wood clattering)
- I hope not. - [Mr. Beast] These
Pac-Man machines open up. They have enough room in
'em for someone to hide. (intense music)
No, one's in this one. - [Chris] I don't see anybody in this one. That's a book bag.
- It feels like a Chandler. - I see a leg, Chris. - Who is it?
- Let's find out who it is. - No!
(soft music) - You were the second one found. - Whoever is gonna be last
is gonna be so freezing. - But I don't know if jail's
that warm either, to be honest. - Really?
- Yeah. Cody, you have a friend.
- No. - A real one.
- Oh my- - Now we must make the announcement. Attention, everyone. We have found a second person. Matt is now out.
(glass shattering) - No, they found Matt. - [Mr. Beast] All right, Matt, enjoy jail. We'll be right back.
- Thanks, Jimmy. (suspenseful music)
- Two down. Eight more to go. I'm still in this. - What is this?
- They're old. - Footprints.
- Oh, those are fresh. - [Mr. Beast] That's kinda new. They lead up to that building. - It's creepy.
- It's so ominous. - [Chris] We know you're in here. Get back rooms. I'll check the stage.
- Okay. - [Chris] We don't want 'em to bolt on us. - [Mr. Beast] Wait, Chris,
did you open a door? (loud footsteps) - That door just slammed. I left it open. - Chris was literally standing
right on top of this stage. - [Mr. Beast] There's someone
in there, I heard movement. I know someone's in here. Heard it.
(muffled footsteps) (indistinct) keep hearing stuff. - [Chris] Oh, they blocked
off the path real hard. - Someone's up here, Chris?
(wooden plank grinding) - Oh no.
- What? - Oh no.
- Who'd you find? - [Chris] No. - [Mr. Beast] Chandler! - Bro, I literally hate you so much. - Why, (indistinct)?
- You always keep finding me. They just found Chandler and Karl. - We found Chandler up
there eating pretzels. We bring you guys a new friend. - Friend.
- Chandler, head on in. (upbeat music)
Sorry. Welcome to jail. (helmet thuds) (distorted melody)
Hear ye, hear ye. Three people are now out. We have found Chandler.
(glass shattering) Chandler, say something
so they know it's real. - Oh baby.
- There you go. - I can't believe I survived. And Tyler, what do you got? - [Tyler] I got a lobster. - Tyler got us the lobster.
- Shout out to Chandler. Chandler was supposed to
be in this dinner with us. That was the plan. - And now it's time
things get interesting. As I told you, there's three towns. We're gonna close off one of them. (walkie-talkie thuds) We're gonna drop our walkie-talkies
is what we're gonna do. Zone three will be closed in 15 minutes. And then we will find all of you. - I've been hiding in zone
three this entire time. They've just decided to shut it down. - [Ben] This is the worst. - Shout out to everybody in zone three, I hope you get caught
moving like I did last time. - [Ben] I am underneath
the ski ball machine now. - I found a little hole
inside of the restroom. We could be in the same
room and they wouldn't know. - (indistinct) hide in this fluffy stuff. I think I'm laying in asbestos. Getting a little itchy. - You know how we had you guys
all carry on the book bag? (intense music)
- Yes. - In this book bag was a sleeping bag, under this sleeping bag was
an alarm clock glued shut. That goes off in
approximately four minutes. - Oh my God.
- (laughs) Yep. And they can't turn it off. Everyone, a surprise is about to happen... Now.
(alarm clock beeping) - What is that? (alarm clock beeping)
- What is that sound? - There's a freaking alarm in here. Very useful when you're
trying to play hide and seek. Thanks, Jimmy. - All right. Let's go search. Come on, Chris. Let's go find 'em. (alarm clock beeping) Oh Chris, come here. Run.
(Chris panting) Who's in here? - So when you heard it, was it like more of back over that way or somewhere around here, maybe? - [Mr. Beast] Yeah. Maybe right there. - Maybe I should just... So, what's up, Ben?
(Mr. Beast cheering) - No!
- Look at that. You were done in by the alarm? - I just started pulling
everything out of that backpack. I was just like something's in here. - So let's take you to
jail while we chit-chat. - I've never been that bored-
- Oh, wow. - Yeah! (Mr. Beast laughing)
- We're so excited it's you. - Yeah! - The alarm clock scheme
worked and we found someone. (glass shattering)
Ben was found. Ben's reign is over. That means one of you guys left actually has a chance
of winning $70,000 now. But we're coming for you. - I was about to follow Ben. It's a good thing I didn't. - Ben just got out and that's massive. He was the only person that was between me and $60,000 last time. - Ben, the reigning champion is out, which means there's a new
hide and seek champion. - Best news I've gotten all day. - All right, we're searching again. We're gonna go hot and quick. - [Chris] We are about to find somebody. I'm feeling it. I have a strong pull
to this area right now. I feel like Karl's here. I know Karl's here. You might as well give up. I know you're in here, Karl. (paper rustling)
Oh. So here we are with Mary
Lisa who just got found. How you feeling, Mary Lisa?
- I hate you. - They just found someone else. It means we're done to five, halfway through the game. - You always ruined my chances to win. - I'm so excited to ruin 'em. (indistinct chattering) - How do you feel, now
that you've been found? - This is the real walk of shame. - All right. Welcome to prison, Mary. - Welcome.
- Welcome. (rock music)
- One of us, one of us. (door thuds)
- Five people are out (upbeat music)
and five people remain. Mary Lisa has been found.
(glass shattering) - No, not my other minion. - Thomas, other Thomas, Tyler, Karl and Kelly, you guys are all that remain. - Chris?
- Yeah. - Got speed. Someone's in here. Come out, come out wherever you are. (loud footsteps) (muffled footsteps) Huh, this tarp is looking
mighty suspicious. Nothing. Yo, I don't think we've
checked this room yet. It's a little convenient that
this is on top of the dryer. (loud grinding) No one. No. Who is it?
- Kelly, no. - Oh no. I might have found somebody. - What's your location. Over. Come to the jail, meet me there. - Oh. They just found another person. That means there's four people left (upbeat music)
and I'm one of them. - Kelly is out. Four of you remain. Thomas, Thomas,
(glass shattering) Tyler and that Karl kid. Currently there are
still two quadrants left. We're thinking about
closing the second one. How many of you think that's a good idea? - Shut it down. Woo!
- Shut it down! - Shut it down!
- We had the prisoners vote. And they voted in agreeance to
shut off quadrant number two. In 20 minutes, it'll be
do or die in the town. (intense music)
Four of you. - And now because of that,
I'm screwed. Dang it. (wind blowing)
- I'm in a terrible spot. Hopefully he doesn't look over here because if he does I'm out. - I'm trying to look for ways that Karl's little
squirrely body could climb. - I can hear them searching for Karl. Jimmy's really close by right now. - [Chris] That was so bold. Tyler Conklin, no. You're trying to get that good shot. - No! Did you get me 'cause
I was taking a video. (hip hop music)
- Yes. I saw your camera lens. Hey Jimmy, I caught a little sneaky snake. - Tyler.
- He was trying to film me. - [Karl] They just found another person. That means there's only two
people between me and $70,000. - A person has been caught. I'm hoping it's not Tom. Tyler was the seventh person out. Three remain. Karl, it's you versus the two Thomases. Are you really gonna let
the Thomases outdo you? - [Karl] My middle name is Thomas. So I feel like that's good enough. Tell me where he is and I'll
tell you what the pay is. Karl, Cody is telling us that you're kind of close to the jail. Is that correct?
- Uh-uh. (everyone laughing) (intense music)
- Hey, Karl. Anybody in here. - [Mr. Beast] Karl? I bet Karl's hiding in the (indistinct) somewhere. Where are you?
(cabinet thuds) Thomas? Karl? - I don't see anybody in here. - No one's in here.
- No. - So I'm grabbing Ben outta
jail to help me find people. Where do you think
someone would be hiding? - I think someone would
probably be this way. - I see some fresh footprints here. - These are definitely new.
- Wait, what about over here? - They don't come back this way at all. - Ooh. This is why this guy gets dubs. Dude, it is blizzarding. I'm determined to search over here. I think someone's in here. I came back here looking earlier. (wooden plank scraping)
- Hey, buddy. - You traitor.
- (laughs) Sorry, buddy. - You're a traitor.
(Ben laughing) I've been here for so long.
- Really? Were you here when I walked by earlier? - Yeah.
- Really? (laughs) There's footprints back here. - [Chris] Somebody might
have tried to hide there. - [Cameraman] That's a
really good spot, dude. - (indistinct) I didn't think anybody would come looking over here. - Are you you cold?
- I'm freezing. - Guys, guess who we found? (participants cheering)
(Chandler banging on desk) - [Mary Lisa] I didn't
notice (indistinct). - Mr. Thomas...
(door creaking) Welcome to jail.
(glass shattering) so there is one Thomas left and a Karl. Karl, how do you feel now
that you are in the final two? - [Karl] I'm used to being in the top two, let's see if I can win now.
(Mr. Beast laughing) - Thomas, what's running
through your mind? - I'm terrified.
(Mr. Beast laughing) - You took 60 grand from Karl. Are you gonna do that again?
- I would never do that again. 'Cause I'm gonna take
70 grand from you, Karl. (air horn blowing)
Yeah! - There's two people left,
but this town is massive. It's gonna be very hard to find them. - I think the winner is
probably really close to where you found Thomas. - No one's in here.
- No. (hip hop music)
- No! (laughs) I definitely
thought somebody was in here. This is too good of a spot.
- Oh boy. Ooh. A secret room. No one in there? You sure?
- Yeah. - (screams) Where are they? Karl! Karl and Thomas, we cannot find you. So you guys have 10 minutes
to move to a hiding spot in a different building. - We're given 10 minutes
to go find another place. Just me and Karl. - Okay. I'm in a different spot now, as you can see, I'm
sitting literally in snow. - So as you guys know, Chris has been helping me
search and then I recruited Ben, and now we're recruiting
a fourth person, Tyler. We are the Search Squad.
- Search Squad. - Hey Karl and Thomas, just so you know, we sent Tyler
and Ben out looking as well. There's currently four
people looking for you. Good luck.
- Good thing I moved because Tyler knew where
my last hiding spot was. I think I'm safe. It's just a matter of time
before one of us gets found. - I'm right next to
the jail, in this room. I'ma hide in here. It's
kinda like in plain sight. I tried to pick the building
the furthest away from them. - Where are they? Karl, Thomas, it is freezing! Where are you? (intense music)
We cannot find these guys. You two wanna help us find people. - I'm down.
- Come on. - We now have two more people searching. That is six total. You two team up. Try to find 'em. Got it.
(dramatic music) - [Chris] Karl! Karl! Karl! - Like how could they
have such a great spot and then move and then
have another great spot. Both of them.
- What if they swapped spots? - Where are they? - I don't understand how
they could hide this- - I don't think I've
ever been this frustrated in my entire life.
- At least it stopped snowing. - Come in, Jimmy.
- What's up? - I think I found somebody.
- Cody, you found somebody. Everyone, to the church,
- To the church. Cody found somebody. - No way.
- No way. - [Chris] We literally
tried to get in there. - I hate you all.
(everyone cheering) (uplifting music) - No! Karl. - Again! - We found Karl,
(glass shattering) which means Thomas is the
only one that remains. Thomas, you just won $70,000. Karl say, hi.
- I hate you. (Mr Beast laughing)
- Oh my God. Yes! (Thomas and Tom cheering) - I feel like we need to
be better friends, boys. Look how happy they are.
(Tom and Thomas shouting) - [Chandler] You guys
wanna hang out tonight? - Ah, I'm kind of busy, sorry. - After a very long game in
the middle of a blizzard. Thomas, you won.
(participants cheering) (intense music)
This is your $70,000. - Am I in a dream? - That's it. Subscribe
and I'll see you later.
