everybody knows about sinclair and the zx80 there's the lovely zx80 and a lot of people know that his story followed in the next year the zx81 but there was a machine that went before it wasn't from sinclair as a company wasn't from sinclair research from a company called science of cambridge um and it's the mk14 and it looks exactly like that pretty basic stuff not even case on this one so this came out in 1977. i mean 1977 you've got to realize this is a couple of years before the zx80 two or three years before this was launched so computing home computing um personal computing was very much in its infancy um as you can see and this isn't a great deal more than a calculator in some ways but it's the beginning of everything in terms of uh sinclair and what they would do later on um and there's a nice little story that goes along with it so as with um many things sometimes the story is not quite what you'd expect it to be if we take this magazine here computing today computing today number one was actually part of eti electronics today international november 1978 this one's dated so very very early on but in there is an advert for the mk 14. this thing was 39 pound 95 to buy plus eight percent v80 250 pound in today's money approximately taking into account inflation so it sounds really cheap but really it wasn't um and i can put that into context so 39.95 for one of these um we have over here a very early copy of personal computer world 78 same kind of era at the back we have a machine for example the exedy sorcerer brilliant machine but this guy's very happy as you can see z80 base 32k computer i want you to spend less than a thousand pound my sorcerer cost me 950. yeah 950 pound is about five and a half grand in today's money um you know and yeah if you had that kind of money you would be doing that kind of uh thing on the picture seed one there does it say a price there 1 674 for that machine that's then money not today's money so that's even more expensive they were used in education uh they were used for research um you know these we see we do have to realize these were the micro computers so mainframes and minis they were they were hundreds of thousands of hours to buy back then you know millions of pounds in today's money so these were you know relatively cheap relative being the op the operative word there um but very very expensive most people couldn't afford these these kind of things um so sinclair has always wanted to bring machines out that broke that price barrier and not just by a bit by a lot the mk-14 was obviously vastly cut down from any of those other machines that are out there you had this very very simple touch keyboard there an led display so basically a calculator display you can only do sort of seven segment digits with that it had 256 bytes of ram because there's not even a kilobyte it's a quarter of a kilobyte um so very very limited ram but then you know with a keyboard like that how much data are you really going to type into these things how much did you need um it was an 8-bit processor um had 12 bits of address space then you could take a bit further with an extra four bits as well but you'd have to software program that but it was pretty limited but it was a machine that you could buy for 39.95 you could own this thing and you could write the code that you wanted to write so how did sinclair and i would say chris curry at the time how did they come about with actually making this as a product there was a guy called ian williamson um and uh he came up with an idea for a micro computer kit um and he saw the scamp design so we have to look at the main chip the main chip in there there is the processor this is the scamp processor it's actually written sc slash mp and it stands for simple cost effective or one word microprocessor two words microprocessor is only one word these days anyway um scmp but it got known as the scamp um and it was a you know an impressive little processor made by national semiconductor it williamson has seen the various designs out there and this is a development system for the scmp and we also have quite a rare intro kit that you could buy the this kit and make your own scmp based system national semiconductor to produce this so that people in the industry could make their designs around it and they had something called a reference design so they had a circuit diagram in williamson produced this board again based on that original design um took it to uh clive and chris and said i've got an idea for a product that you might be interested in making but as the story goes we do have a video on our youtube channel which is an interview with ian williamson so you can get this from the horse's mouth but he showed this to the guys and they were interested very much interested sinclair was probably more interested in the future of this what it could become because it was very very basic but chris thought yes this could be a product um so they said yeah this is we're interested in that that's an interesting thing that we might be able to market um but when they went to national semiconductor and said okay we want to buy a load of your scamp chips um national assembly said oh well what you what do you do with those and they explained it and they said well actually you know we've already got the reference design you know we could supply you with those chips in the reference design you basically just make that as a kit and sell it so uh chris had to sort of go back with um you know tell him to his legs and say to ian well actually you know really sorry i know we've shook on it but um we're actually going to go with national semiconductor because they've given us a fantastic deal um so we don't need your design thank you very much um jog on this guy's invented a design for computer but there's one already existing um yeah it was only based on the the reference designs that national semiconductor but what what it had done is it foreseen this idea that actually you know the design is basically there you can build upon this and actually there's a lot of people that might like to make this kit so you know the it's the idea the initial idea um um came from ian that this could be a product so that didn't kind of work out um free and sadly um however you know he would then go on to write the manual along with rodney dale there was money to be made in creating the manual and writing other books for it as well so other books were produced about programming the machine and that kind of thing i think we've got there you go understanding the microprocessors with the mk 14 ian williamson and rodney dale both of who are trustees of the museum i should say so yeah from the original design and that's the kit that you can buy you can see that there are quite big similarities you've got the same chip the original ceramic chip there whereas these ones got the plastic dips same kind of memory and then you have a display here an led display with a keyboard well that looks pretty similar to me so you can see that um progression on from the development kits through to the board that was finally produced and sold so this doesn't have the processor in it the process is there you have this prototyping area so what you can do is you can put any components you like there and wire them up and then to program it you would put your board into there you could have different boards with different expansions ram or various other io that kind of thing and you could program it and make it do what you want so this is the development system and they gave you all the supporting material yeah so the programming manuals um there so you would have your manual and you would learn about the entire instruction set so again what needs to be remembered here is that we are programming uh in assembly language in a machine code so you are typing in hexadecimal numbers here that represent those commands so at this time chris curry was at um science cambridge and was really in charge of this product project um so later on when chris was at acorn interestingly we have an acorn system one doesn't look that dissimilar same kind of calculator display there hex keypad different chip this one uses a 6502 which would be the processor that their next machines would use the bbc micro the atom and that kind of thing but you know it just shows how everything starts somewhere um so the system one again a very rare machine starting very very basic typing um you know assembly language code in and and even that you know you think that assembly language would be a very high low level language that a lot of people wouldn't do however if we take a look at home computing games programs on page 68 to life for the mk14 so here we have a program listing for the mk14 and you can see it's the assembly language code but that's the hex that you would type in so a memory location of 20 you would type in c4 oe and that would be effectively ldx conway's game of life yeah so but it's not really a game it's more of a simulation but there you know the machine could play this kind of this basic game and you could play other games on it you know the simple number games that you could do trying to work out what date this is oh there's summer 81. so 1981 and people were still writing code for the mk14 that was released in 77. so these things had a reasonable life i'm not sure if anybody did type that in but who knows somebody probably did a lot of people were buying these things as the kit so i have another thing over here to show you this is extremely rare let's move that out there so if you'd ordered one of these things this is what you get so this is an unboxing of mk14 this probably doesn't happen very much online this is a completely unmade kit as it would have been delivered so part of this was the construction process in the first place getting the manual getting the circuit diagram understanding what all the components do soldering them into their place on the board soldering all of these connections i don't know how many there are a good couple of hundred there so you'd sort all your components in place and if you've done it well you've got resistors there capacitors and things uh crystal um if you've done it well it will work um and you could then start to program it really good manual with it that had um what you've got greatest common divisor software pulse delay digital alarm clock random noise decimal to hex so you know there were lots of things you could get it to do there's even a monitor listing there and interestingly the chip had an inbuilt uart so it had serial communications actually built onto the chip so it was possible then to connect it up to a another device then see the output rather than just needing to rely on that very very small calculator display so there's lots of things you could do a lot of this is just demo software just to show you the ideas between behind programming how you can use memory locations so machine code what you're doing is you're saying take this memory location move it into the processor add something to it move it back to a memory location very very simple step language so that was defined as kind of programming at the bare metal you know you were talking directly to the chips um nothing in between so you knew every single instruction and what it was for and why it was there um talking to those ships directly so that gives you a really good understanding of programming computers and if you understood how to do this you can apply that to pretty much to any processor the the commands might change um but ultimately it's the same logical thinking process so you know you could type in those things those programs and get them to run but also it has to be remembered that on the output here you've got a port exposing the address and data bus and various control lines and things and you could then have it controlling other things this was kind of the raspberry pi of its day you know you had address lines there you would put on an address decoder um create yourself some io space and that could be sort of an address latch or a data bus slash that you could then store data in and have eight outputs or 16 hours i mean you wanted same way input you could have a latch that then red inputs so you've got some i o control so from that these things were then used for a number of purposes one we have in the collection is a machine over here vaguely looks a little bit like an mk14 we've got the same calculator display there same kind of hex pad but this is used for medical research so this is just an mk14 in a big wooden box you can see the mk14 down there you can see the expansion chip we have a tape interface there and then we have some other malarkey going on there not quite sure what that is power supply you can just plug it into the mains the power supply drops it down to about eight volts for the board itself and this was used for medical research controlling inputs and outputs monitoring um and then analyzing those results it'd be quite feasible that you could find out what some of these reaction times is depending on how much they're drunk um yeah that would be a good use of this uh this machine um i have no idea if that's what it was useful but hey i might use that now so i was going to say we don't we need to do some research i think yeah absolutely we'll do that later um but some but yeah so so these had genuine real world uses it might seem that one of these things is pretty much unusable but really not you know it was ultimately usable if you wanted to control something this could have done it there's a real world used for it they've made the box made it portable and very usable but then other people were just using it for their own fun learnings how to code controlling their hornby railway i know people that had done exactly that with it um so yeah loads of different things and yeah this was sort of 77 this was before most people were into some microcomputers as they were then um so ahead of the curve so sometimes if floppies would die so you often would make backup copies let's try this one sounds more hopeful and so there's this game called lander
