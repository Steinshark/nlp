today i want to talk to you about failure one of the biggest ugliest most painful and ultimately necessary failures of my filmmaking career and even though this happened years ago it still stings today in my entire career it's probably the single biggest disappointment i've ever had it was a story about violence corruption and love in the hills of southern mexico and honestly it should have been an amazing project except that i didn't do enough prep work and it ended up costing us everything i spent months filming and editing the story and i traveled to new york twice on my own expense trying to find a home for this project but in the end nothing happened and it just like lives behind a vimeo link somewhere and no one sees it the story deserved better than that and i failed it here's why and how you can make sure that doesn't happen to you [Music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth documentary cinematographer and filmmaker and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working in the documentary industry today i'm going to tell you how i learned the hard way about the dangers of not doing enough pre-production and how those lessons have helped me come up with a three-step process that i go through for all my new projects i think of these as the foundational pillars that the rest of the project will stand on and since i've started taking them seriously i've become a much more intentional filmmaker first let me give you some background here if you don't know me i used to live in mexico city for a few years and during that time i worked on a lot of projects relating to the drug cartels and the violence that's spread across mexico while working on a show called the trade i met a guy named mario who was the subject of one of the episodes um i only spent about two days with him but that was enough i knew right away that i wanted to get to know him and tell his story i'll give you the basic version here and that's that mario's brother was kidnapped one day on his way home from work and he never came back mario wanted answers obviously and so every day before he went to work he would search the hills outside of his village looking for evidence he still hasn't found his brother but since then he's been involved in locating over 200 bodies and is flown all over the country to help others in their own searches for missing loved ones it's an extremely powerful story and mario was such a sweet guy i really wanted to help spread awareness of what he'd been through and what he was doing but just having an idea for a documentary isn't enough you actually have to go out and make the thing so how do you take an idea and turn it into something real when i started working on mario's story my filmmaking partner and i had a lot of coffee meetings and talked about big picture ideals for hours but after months we still hadn't actually found the time to go out and shoot with mario and the problem starts with the very concept of finding time if you want a documentary to actually happen you don't find time you make time and that leads me to the first pillar of my pre-production process make a schedule making a schedule helps in a bunch of ways firstly it makes the project official and creates a sense of commitment the difference between hey let's go make this documentary sometime next month and we're shooting this documentary for 5 days from the 5th to the 11th next month is huge commit things to your calendar and you will have a much higher chance of seeing them through a good schedule shouldn't just cover shoot days but delivery dates as well productions follow parkinson's law which is the one that says tasks expand to fill the time you give them so if you just say we'll finish it when it's done you're asking for a project to drag on and on and never see the light of day setting deadlines helps everyone stay focused and on pace and it will increase the probability that you actually finish what you started by a lot trust me but a great schedule is meaningless unless you have the money to pull it off production is expensive and there is no point in scheduling a shoot in paris if you don't have the cash for it and that's another way schedules help you out they allow you to see the pieces of the shoot laid out in terms of total days and distances so that you know what it's going to cost once you have a schedule in place you might find that suddenly your underwater scene in costa rica doesn't seem as important even more important than scheduling your shoot days and setting deadlines is deciding on what you're gonna shoot when i heard mario's story i was so caught up with the emotion and the power of his story that i thought the story would tell itself when jordy and i actually made it down to guerrero to shoot with him we just rolled cameras on everything that we did for three days without really thinking over what we needed in order to tell his story we left mario's place thinking we'd gotten amazing stuff and the visuals were great but as soon as we started editing we realized that we were missing important information that the story didn't really make sense and that's the second pillar of documentary pre-production write a script it might sound weird to think of scripting a documentary because after all aren't we supposed to be documenting real life i mean how can you script that but a script and documentary isn't the same as it is in hollywood where the dialogue is written in advance a doc script is your take on what an ideal version of the script could look like based on the research you've done to that point if you start filming and realize that you misunderstood something important or that things play out differently than you wrote in the script then you should absolutely allow things to unfold naturally the script isn't to set the narrative it's to give you something to fall back on when you don't know what else to do a good script will also help you to see if you have a story or just a topic a story has a beginning a middle and an end and a topic doesn't frodo being called away from the shire traveling across middle earth and finally destroying the ring is a story frodo went on a journey he faced some obstacles he overcame them and he returned home a changed little man now the flip side of that is a movie about a powerful and dangerous ring that exists in middle earth might sound like an interesting topic but just that in itself it isn't a story now if the movie didn't follow frodo on this journey and just kind of said that a dangerous and powerful ring existed in middle-earth it's kind of an interesting topic but that's not a story this was our mistake when we started working with mario we had an extremely interesting topic but since we didn't write a script we had no sense of where the story was supposed to begin or end and so we really didn't know what moments we needed to capture in order to make it work we ended up with a lot of powerful moments but we weren't really able to show what it is that mario wanted from all this or how he changed as a result when i took our edit to new york to show editors and producers who had all expressed an interest before they all said the same thing which is this is really interesting but it's not a story unsurprisingly no one bought it if we just taken the time to write a rough script we would have seen the structural problems from the beginning now there's so much descripting that i'm not going to go into it too deeply here but comment down below if you'd like to see me do a full video on how to make a documentary script nowadays i always write a script for every new documentary project and it has helped me so much i can't overstate this write a script even if you don't think you'll follow it you'll be surprised how often it helps you stay on track so once you've got your ideal story points down you actually need to film the thing there are so many ways to shoot a documentary from super rough verite shoulder style shooting like in cartel land to really stylized recreations like the art of killing that you need to be intentional from the outset about what you want your film to look like when jordy and i went to shoot with mario we never really discussed the general aesthetic we were going for and i think we both just kind of assumed that we were on the same page but later when we combined the footage we realized that we actually hadn't been shooting exactly the same way and some of the scenes were tough to edit together so for example sometimes i'd be shooting for a dark and moody look while jordy imagined something much brighter or i was getting tripod shots and he was doing almost all hand-held um whatever the reason the result was that the shoot didn't really match and it was hard to make scenes out of it all of this could have been avoided if we'd taken the time to establish some visual references and agree on a unified shooting style before we started and that's the third and final pillar of my documentary pre-production process make a mood board a mood board or a deck or whatever you want to call it is basically a bunch of different visuals that you gather together in one place to give you an idea of a project's overall style and look you can take them from anywhere from movies commercials still photos anything that fits what your vision is for the final project can go in your mood board you might think it's enough to have all these ideas in your head but trust me it's so much better to have them physically gathered in one place that you can then go back to and consult and look at anytime you get stuck if you run into any doubts on how to film a scene just open up your mood board and remember the master plan there are a ton of ways to make a mood board and any of them will work you could dump a bunch of photos into evernote or like even create a pinterest board or cut out actual photos from magazines and pin them on the wall if you want to go old school there is no perfect method i'm currently using an app called millinote that i heard through danny giverts's channel danny i'm sorry if i'm saying your last name wrong i love your videos great job and thanks for tuning me on to this millinote is a great way to make a mood board so millinote is really just an elegant way of making a board by allowing you to gather references in one place with a really nice design and some well thought out features you can use things like columns and arrows to connect thoughts together and you can group a bunch of ideas together to help you organize it all in your brain miller note allows you to use things like columns and arrows to link things together and gather them all in one place so if i decided that all my night shots on this shoot are going to be really dark and moody and all my day scenes will be really hot and overexposed i can put them into two different columns or if i want to show how this shoot is connected to a particular subject i could drop a link to it and then connect it with an arrow it's a really intuitive and visually attractive way to organize information and for me it's one of the best new tools out there there's a ton of features on millino and this video is not sponsored i just think it works really well and i've been loving it so far but you totally do not need a fancy app to do this so please don't get so caught up in the tools that you skipped this step altogether so there you have it those are my three foundational pillars for planning a documentary with all of those things i want to mention that you should only use them as guiding principles they're not ironclad rules that you have to follow to the letter the story is king and documentary and if you need to change your plans on the fly you totally should i also didn't really touch on budgeting mostly because people's budgets can vary so much and i wanted to keep this video to a reasonable length but budgets are really important and i will be working on a separate video about that soon i do these three things for every documentary project i start before i shoot a single frame and honestly it has helped me so much in avoiding the mistakes i made with mario's film i still feel bad that my lack of preparation meant we didn't do his story justice but if i'd just taken the time to do better pre-production i don't think any of that would have happened and since then i've always made it a priority if you want to hear more about mario's story and what i learned from it as a filmmaker check out this other video i made about the whole experience it's about how that project made me feel like a big failure but also how i grew from it as much as it hurt at the time i am much better off today because of it see ya
