welcome to Wally's just announced 2020 foldable smartphone the meat excess and actually got the chance to spend a full day alone with it so I'm gonna tell you everything you need to know and what actually happened so I started the day at 11 a.m. with a hundred percent battery and from this point I was allowed to do whatever I wanted with the phone as long as I was back by night because well it was still highly confidential so I decided to take it to three London locations each so I could test a different feature the traffic light tree the Natural History Museum and finally a place called God's own junkyard which was just spectacular but I'll get to this for starters as we were heading to location one a few things became very clear about the mate access this is a smartphone first foldable second and that's a good thing compared to say Samsung's Galaxy fold where when you're not actively using the main insight display you kind of inhibited you're stuck on this tiny little screen on the front while Waze design means that even when it's folded up it's still pretty much just a normal looking modern flagship phone albeit a chunky one at 11 millimeters thick the display on it is good it's an 8 inch 24 80 by 2200 OLED panel and compared to last year's mate X one of the more obvious changes is how it opens you're still pressing a release catch on the back but you'll notice straight away that the display kind of flies out because it's got a more powerful spring-loaded mechanism and even more importantly there are now over 150 parts in the hinge alone to make it feel firmer and snap together more convincingly for both the closing and the opening anyways time to jump into the London Underground but of course the reviewing never stops there is still a crease in the display where the fold is and how obvious it is depends massively on the lighting around you but I would say most the time it's less noticeable then for its foldable peers but the more impressive feat though is just how razor thin it is when you unfold it the body is just five point four millimeters thick that's the equivalent of taking a really slim smartphone and chopping an extra thirty percent off it Huawei has also added these little oval shaped pieces at the pivot points to stop any dirt getting under the screen now while on the rail it was also a pretty good chance to start testing the cameras at earth main camera has a 14 megapixel sensor which actually has no optical image stabilization but uses the company's most advanced AI stabilization now I'm not gonna lie to you having both would be better but at the same time the AI alone can handle situations like this the software is essentially an open-source version of Android 10 paired with hallways Mui 10 so it's the same general look the same customization and the same dark mode that you're used to it took a while but we eventually reached location number one the traffic light tree and I don't really know what to tell you there is no reason an abomination like this should exist but I'm kind of glad it does because it's a great opportunity to play around with what I think is one of the coolest features of the phone before that though it's worth pointing out that as well as the main 40 megapixel camera the phone has both an ultra-wide and a three times optical zoom lens so that just means you can go from being really far from your subject to appearing rather close and as an example this shot was taken with six times magnification this in itself isn't anything new though but the very nature of this being a foldable phone lets you do something that is tapping on this icon at the corner turns on mirror mode so that when you take a photo of someone they can at the same time that see how they look sort out that hair potentially position themselves the way they would want to be positioned when I describe it it sounds obvious and simple but in my opinion that solves one of the biggest pain points of asking someone else to take a photo of you because most of the time they don't know how you want it add to that the I'm a massive fan of efficiency so I love the fact that instead of having one set of cameras for the front of your phone and another set of cameras for the back you can just flip the phone around and use its main rear camera to take selfies the obvious upside is that these selfies are the same quality then as images from the rear camera even in portrait mode which is actually aided by the fourth camera which is this little 3d depth sensor at the bottom anyways time to head to location number two as curious as I was about how an ornament like this in the middle of a very real roundabout is anything but a serious hazard if by the way you're enjoying this video asad to the mister who's the boss channel would be incredible now was a pretty good time to register my fingerprint and see how that works unfold ball because bear mind the trade-off of having cameras on the back of your phone only means that there's no face unlocking it works well though the fingerprint scanner is actually bundled in with the power button so by the time you've pressed the power button to turn your screen on it's already checked for your fingerprint and you're in nothing in London is as close as it seems so for a quick pit stop on the way we head up of coffee shop using it as a base camp to try a few more things I've been meaning to if it starters though you might have noticed already by how light reflects on this front display that it's actually not entirely flat it's a plastic display with actually more layers than ever for even better shatter resistance but that just means that it's ever so slightly domed you do stop noticing it after a bit though and now is also a good time to mention that the chipset in the phone is the Kirin 995 G which has two implications most obviously well of 5g you might know that we can broadly split 5g waves into two categories you've got the ultra-high speed mm waves with only a narrow range and medium speed sub six waves which aren't as quick but can travel much further well this Kirin chip supports sub six only so I tried downloading a game on 5g it didn't have that kind of snappy instantaneousness of mm wave but it was still fast and I guess more importantly the 5g worked in almost every area of London we visited which I was not expecting the other side to this caring chip is the fact that it's a real solid performer it's around at 25% speed bump from the company's last gen and that means that games fly plus something I'm not used to on a fault of all is having app adaptability the idea that when you open your display your content will adjust to fill the entire 8 inch panel with some apps this is an amazing feature with others you might lose some important info but just the fact that you don't need to restart the app from scratch is in itself an improvement from what I'm used to off we went again and as we neared the Natural History Museum we found well ok it's just a road really but I liked it and it kind of shows the contrast between the older London architecture and the newer buildings I already can't stress enough how much we benefit to have your rear cameras on your face like what I said you've got the same 4k quality video at the same stabilization as would have on your normal primary camera on your face this is like cinematic quality vlog footage so right now we're off to see the Natural History Museum and okay I'm quite excited to see some dinosaurs one quick London Underground trip I'm totally ready for the babies start handing out loyalty cards with this and 20 minutes of steering a suitcase through crowds of people trying not to knock kids over we arrived and actually at this point something I'd forgotten to show you earlier is that the other cool thing about having just one set of cameras is that even on the front you can use your ultra wide lens for let's say group selfies you can even use the zoom camera if you're really confident about the quality of your skin alright so we have just arrived at the Natural History Museum take a look at this building is literally it is so immense that I think before I even realize what I was doing my hands were already out taking a photo and it's almost like this building was built to take a patent around myself not a fan of blowing my own trumpet but pretty happy with how this turned out and it seems like I wasn't the only one inside we went and I forgotten just how stunning the place is the scale of this building and the fossils inside of it is just colossal and so you might have guessed it was time to find a high point for an ultra-wide camera shots on the way though a couple more things to point out about the phone the mate excess has a zero gap design ie when it's folded up the screen is at a complete 180 degree angle and you can't see in between the other thing that I thought was really interesting is that the only way we always managed to make the main body so slim is that it pretty much just contains the battery almost every other actual smartphone component is fitted into this narrow bar on the side so that battery is 4,500 milliamp hours in total split between two cells that sit on either side of the fold and in terms of the battery life that gives you well that's part of what we're figuring out today but so far at least we're on about 65% battery after three and a half hours of heavy usage now because of how Huawei is crammed literally everything the cameras the chipset the antenna into this little block on the side it needs better cooling so compared to last gen they're now using a triple cooling system a flexible graphite layer that spans both sides to keep the batteries call and a vapor chamber inside the main block and finally before we leave here's that ultra wide shot that come to think of it we actually came for oh yeah and of course there's one thing you can't leave a museum without visiting yeah it's the gift shop [Music] and we were off to our third final and hopefully most impressive location and by this point I'd become quite familiar with the phone especially how intuitive the multitasking is you open one app in this case let's say the Sun newspaper you then swipe in from the side to get a multitasking bar and whatever you drag from there immediately becomes a second window that's pretty normal smartphone multitasking but the coolest part is that you can get a third app involved that'll just by default become a floating window on top of the two apps you're already running I wouldn't hesitate to call this the best Android multitasking experience out there and even if you don't want to use the big screen for doing lots of things at once you can still just scale single applications and they generally work well final destination it's a place God's own junkyard and I've never been I just saw some Google Image results of it and I was like that is the perfect place to test the phone's low-light capabilities because in theory that is something that we always good at it turns out that this location I've been planning to visit was not particularly close so far out that it only just classes as being in London and see the closer we came to it the dodgy are the area got oh yeah and it was incredibly windy by some miracle though we found it I was giggling like a school child when I saw the sign confirmation that we hadn't just traveled for an hour and risked our lives to hang out in an empty industrial estate it describes itself as heavenly junk in a hell of a location and I can vouch for the accuracy of that description we headed inside and it was neon paradise this whole place is so Erie's there's like it's in the middle of nowhere there's like nobody here oh we had some amazing footage and that we did literally anywhere you turn there is a new photo to capture so I use the phone's night mode which in this lighting takes 5 seconds per shot to draw out as much detail as possible and these are the results completely unedited I would have taken more but it turns out someone had privately hired the location and to put it nicely they told us to pay up or find the exit anyways time to head back I'd got most of what I wanted anyways so we parked up in a coffee shop just to take my sim card out and transfer footage to my laptop before handing the phone back to hallway while I was out there some final observations when unfolded the mate excess functions largely as a full-size tablet you get tabbed browsing like you would on a laptop and decent quality audio thanks to it using both the bottom firing speaker and an earpiece on the front I would say though well the main 8 inch display is fantastic for reading if you're just going to be watching a video you're probably better off with the smaller front display because the wide aspect ratio suits content better as well as your 5g SIM the phone also supports a Huawei nm card to expand storage and comes pre baked with 512 gigs out the box anyways as well as 8 gigabytes of RAM interesting to note that the battery in the end really pulled through I did burn the first 30% quite quickly in the early afternoon but as I spent less time recording videos in the second half of the day we made it quite easily they were still about 40% left as I finally handed it back at 6:30 p.m. after seven and a half hours of usage was actually not bad at all if you enjoyed this video there is a whole playlist of day in the lives on my channel so I'll leave that linked somewhere from here and a sub would be amazing stuff like this takes an absolute age to put together but I think is worth it let me know if you do - my name is Aaron that this is mr. who's the boss I'll catch you in it [Music]
