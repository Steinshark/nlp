about watching a DVD! You get to enjoy every pixel individually. Wow! We've got Chapter Selection. Ah! Look at all those options! My favourite is the pi-endulum down here, where I try to calculate pi. Steve actually wanted this selector
to be a tau symbol — terrible idea! Helen was very keen it should be a banana, because she does stuff
about bananas in the show. My good... The argument! It was just...
It went on and on. I really hate it when those two fight. If we go back to the main menu,
