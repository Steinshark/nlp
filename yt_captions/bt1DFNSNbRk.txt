[Music] few can say that they've beaten mike tyson before he's topped many lists of the hardest video game bosses of all time for good reason the combination of lightning-fast reflexes and thorough knowledge of his patents make him extremely difficult for a casual gamer to beat but there's a few of us who take this fight to another level if you get so good at the fight that you can land frame perfect punches that have a 1 60th of a second window of landing and you can beat tyson in the first round this feat hasn't been accomplished by many probably by only a few dozen people but anybody who has done it can certainly consider themselves to be a true master of mike tyson's punch-out naturally the record for the fastest round one tko of mike tyson has dropped significantly over time down to where it is today today i'm going to show you that progression and explain what changed for each fight to slowly lower the time to get a really good round one tyson fight it takes a lot for the first minute and a half tyson throws uppercuts you must punch him on the same side that he punches you on then delay or second punch the last 60th of a second before you would walk it do that correctly for nine of the first 10 punches and you'll have done a perfectly executed phase one of course tyson can try to stop you by doing any number of random delays or even the dreaded eight second delay which will immediately kill any attempt if all goes well you'd have him down by under a minute for phase two you just keep doing what you did in phase one if he gives a fast enough pattern you'll throw six uppercuts and if you hit at least five of them you'll have a perfectly executed phase two and you should be down in the early 130s or upper 120s phase three is the most difficult phase of them all he throws hooks until the end of the round normally you'd hit him twice after each one with each punch doing two damage instead though the fastest way to do it is to wait until the last frame before you block then throw a single punch that will deal 5 damage execute eight of these in a row without being too early or too late and you'll have a perfect phase three if you miss one earlier late you're guaranteed to lose at least five seconds so as you can see there's an extreme amount of both rng and skill involved to get one of these fights the first one that we're going to look at is matt turks 213 which he achieved on december 13th 2007. matt turk is somewhat of a legend in the punch-out community he came up with so many strategies and had so many world records and stood for over a decade but he never recorded any of his fights generally his times are regarded as being legitimate as the amount of knowledge he provided the community backed up his claims despite the lack of video evidence the only record we have of this fight was a game facts post that he made in early 2008 based on that we were able to piece together approximately what the fight looked like and you could watch mpap's task recreation of it here his description of the fight sounded incredible a 54 first knockdown a 128 second knockdown and hitting 6 out of 8 frame perfect hooks in phase 3. for years nobody is able to match either of those first two knock down times let alone hit 6 frame perfect hooks after getting them for a while the best footage that we had of a tyson fight was a 219 which single segment world record holder sinister one achieved back in august to 2012 the execution in his fight matched turks through the first two phases but he got a few more delays than turk did his first knock down was a 56 the second was at 132 and four frame perfect hooks in the third phase let him be the second person to beat tyson under two minutes and 20 seconds a couple years later in april of 2014 future single segment world record holder zallard 1 joined that club 2 and recorded a 217 fight which at the time was the fastest recorded tyson fight but turks 213 still eluded everyone we all knew it was possible to achieve but as time went by people began to doubt that it would ever be broken the two top punched out players in the world at the time zordon and sinister one seemed to be mainly focusing their efforts on single segment and even their best tyson attempts landed them several seconds away from the 213. finally though in july of 2014 sinister one decided enough was enough he knew that he had the skill to top turks 213 and if he put the attempts in he could pull it off he would need a very fast phase one and phase two and then he needed to hit at least six hooks at phase three as well as get a good phase three pattern better than the one that turk got in his record so he stopped playing single segment and just grinded tyson nails for months and slowly his time got lower and lower [Music] whoa 218. i got a pv yay [Music] cool all right i can live with that [Music] wow 216 dude holy i just beat zaler [Music] holy [Music] yes yes dude oh my god pb all right at least i got a pv holy crap man 214. [Music] wow and he gave me that awkward delay again that was basically almost yes tie turk at least baby i tied him i tied him i tied him i tired of my time 213 baby we in there the world record has been tied uh man i can't believe it that was my fifth attempt after countless weeks of grinding sinister was so close he had tied the mysterious 213 and knew that with a slightly faster pattern he would be able to beat it he kept pushing forward and forward it seemed inevitable that he was about to break through but not if zallard one had something to say about it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] people were hardly even aware that salad was doing enticed nail attempts but he was quietly doing them in the background he said himself that he really didn't expect to get it but in september of the same year he beat it by an entire three seconds phase one and two were similar to turk but he got a slower pattern however phase three is executed perfectly he hit eight frame perfect punches off of the eight hooks that tyson threw a phase three like this had only been executed a handful of times in history by anybody so the fact that zalar did it off of a phase one and two that good was unbelievable a fight like this is called a perfect tyson fight even though better luck could theoretically bring it lower so that seemed like that could be it for the mike tyson fight zalard achieved the first ever perfect fight and what seemed like could be the only one the only way that a sub 210 would be accomplished would be if someone matched salar's insane execution and got luckier with tyson's delays but practically nobody thought that it could happen turk's time had been cut and tyson had finally been beaten perfectly wow [Music] here we go [Applause] [Music] thirty-one [Applause] that actually ties my pb for second knockdown [Music] holy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i can't believe that just happened seemingly out of nowhere in july of 2015 10 months after zalar's perfect fight luigi lowers the time by two seconds at this time luigi was relatively unknown this fight not only proved his skills but also showed how the tyson record could still be lowered it surprised everybody zalar decided to try to get the record back from ouija right after and it took him a week before he was able to get it he matched not only matt turk's legendary 54 knockdown get get tyson and his 128 second knockdown oh son oh i proceeded to hit all eight frame perfect hooks after as well and finished with the 207. get you gotta be kidding dude well this for sure seemed like it would probably be the fastest anybody would ever beat tyson a 128 second knockdown was as fast as it could go as even if you got a lower 128 a 127 even a 126 tyson would wait until 1 30 before he started throwing hooks a high 128 or 129 would be slower as the clock ticks a bit before tyson does his next move regardless the only way to lower the time from a 207 would be to match the luck in the first two phases or get extremely close to it match the execution in all three phases and then get better luck in phase three months passed and the speed running scene for mike tyson's punch out changed zalard got the first ever sub 16 single segment time which had a 218 tyson fight at the end and then i took the single segment record with a 220 for tyson these lower times were becoming increasingly more common the question was once again asked could the tyson fight be lowered even more for a while it seemed like the answer would be no as salad won was speedrunning hiatus in mid-2016 but then out of nowhere he managed to get the first ever 53 knock down on tyson followed shortly after by the first ever 52 knockdown unsurprisingly zard was able to lower the record by another second in july followed shortly after by lowering it again on the same day at this point it was clear what the ultimate tyson time was going to be 205 that would involve getting a second knock down at 128 or before and then getting a nearly perfect phase three pattern as well as hitting every single hook frame perfectly for months zard and i went back and forth trying to get a 205. in the process i managed to get more than 60 of these so-called perfect tyson fights but none of them were a 205 zauer managed to get about 40 of them himself i also managed to get a lower 206 eight times including four of them on the same day finally in october of 2016 i pulled it off i got a 54 first knockdown which had become relatively common by this point and a 128 which both mirrored matt turk's legendary 213 fight in phase 3 i got a nearly perfect pattern he only delayed once at the very end and i hit every frame perfect punch and that was that in 2012 the best recorded tyson time was 219 and the unofficial world record was 213. since then the record's gone all the way down to 205 and over 100 perfect fights have been recorded by various players it seems like 205 should be the end of the line for tyson but it's not remember before how i was saying that it doesn't matter if you knocked tyson down before 128 as you'd have to wait for the hooks to start anyway well while that's true if you knock tyson down early enough you can actually get him to throw an uppercut in phase 3 before 1 30. if you get this to happen and execute the rest of the fight perfectly and your time will be somewhere between 2 minutes flat and 203 the only issue to get tyson to throw this extra uppercut your second knockdown has to be by a mid-125 getting this to happen not only requires perfect execution on landing the frame perfect punches and not only the literal best passenger impossible from tyson which would have about a 1 in 100 chance of occurring but you also need to cut your dodges extremely tightly to the point at which you're nearly dodging into every uppercut he throws the closest anybody has gotten to having text and throw this uppercut was a high 125 that i got and tyson was somewhere between one and four frames away from throwing it if somebody ever gets this uppercut and then lands every single frame perfect hit after it then it will go down as the most legendary fight in mike dyson's bunch of history by far until then though 205 is as low as it's going that's all i got for today thank you for watching you
