any new merch oh uh well yeah funny you ask hey what is up guys mkbhd here and it's june which means it's another month which means it's time for another questions and answer session and yes there is new merch and this time it is actually a limited edition but for good reason so our good friends over at cotton bureau who run the store and who run a bunch of other stores are celebrating their fifth birthday this week and in honor of that they're going to be doing giveaways the way this works is basically as much stuff as they sell on all of their sites including the mkbhd shop the more and more extravagant apple related giveaways they will be doing so we're going to start with stuff like airpods and apple tvs but with more sales they'll work up to stuff like ipad pros and imac so basically you can place an order of the new merch this week which is of course a nice little apple inspired colored drawing although on the site we're going to be calling it the mkbhd special edition six colors shirt apple please don't sue me and just for good measure we'll also toss in the clean original best-selling logo tee so it's these two shirts in the drop this week only shop away and good luck all right on your questions so it turns out a lot of the questions are about hot ones yes i was on hot ones one of my favorite youtube shows ever uh it is live i'll link it below you can check it out it was kind of amazing some of the most common questions were one are the wings really all that hot yes of course they were actually that hot do you see these tears in my eyes these are real tears they don't just happen by eating chicken wings and number two would be just how was the interview itself and i mean of course it was awesome shawn's a great interviewer the show is awesome but just like the amount of research they do and the quality of questions i don't think i've seen an episode in the last like entire season where the guest doesn't go oh that's a that's a really good question you know and then number three is just like how long did it take you to feel normal again which i would say if you're asking about my face it would probably be like half an hour before my face stopped burning and if you're asking about the rest of me i i was fine overall though it's a really awesome format and i think maybe in the future we'll be able to actually i mean since it's a youtube show collaborate with sean and maybe do a sort of a like a behind the scenes of hot ones i think that would be a cool idea but let me know what you guys think sam wants to know got any new bangers you just want to share or still listen to primadonna well first of all sam yes i am still listening to primadonna because it's a great song but i just want to toss out there i've been like rediscovering or re-listening to a bunch of overwork great artists he's from canada reps it well just overall awesome style and staff has some thoughts on instagram tv or ig tv as do a lot of people uh thoughts on people repurposing the same youtube videos for igtv and it's it's kind of like in this weird place where that's sort of all people know how to do i mean igtv is brand new so it's a platform where people are figuring out how figuring out content strategy at this point and it's a boring thing to talk about but you got to think about if you want to make your own original content just for igtv or if you don't really have the resources to do that yet in which case you just sort of put your youtube videos on igtv i'm not the biggest fan of that but i can see why people do it because it's so easy what i'm not a fan of is what i tweeted what gopro did which is literally you don't have to do this but they feel obligated to use igtv so they just re-uploaded a regular sideways video with massive borders in vertical no point in doing that absolutely no point in doing that so while igtv is this young we're just kind of figuring out what we want to do with it the latest video i just uploaded is a sort of a behind the scenes look some never before seen clips behind the scenes of auto focus episode two so when we shot that aventador down in palm beach none of the clips you see on igtv are anywhere else so i think that's a fun way to share stuff artie says do you actually think igtv will be a serious youtube competitor or was that first video like a sponsored thing oh what no i guess the first reaction to like if i like something and they don't like it then it must be sponsored it's that was just me just talking about how i feel as a matter of fact for the sake of transparency here is a list of all of the sponsored videos i've done on the channel in the last 12 months so the last year those the only two ones dbrand is a channel sponsor so shout out to them for being a long-term supporter of the videos we're able to make and then red it's probably not the video you're thinking of but about 10 months ago there was a sponsored video as we disclosed about the the red raven kit when it came out and was first available for shooting on youtube so that's it it's not like having sponsors is a bad thing but just for the sake of transparency there it is jason says do you think youtube should add a vertical video section for mobile only to compete with igtv huh actually well no i don't think they have to do that as a matter of fact a lot of people don't know youtube actually supports and has supported for a while native vertical video a lot of people don't know if you watch a native vertical video on youtube and you full screen it it full screens the same way it does on instagram so igtv native support isn't anything special or something youtube doesn't have but it's something worth noting so i don't even really think that vertical video support is a feature of instagram tv as much as it's sort of a focus of what they're driving people to make face it igtv is not nearly a competitor to youtube not even to vimeo or dailymotion at least not until they implement horizontal video all right hot take ready for this i don't think vertical video is that bad and hear me out i think people are hating on vertical video because that's all they know how to do at this point like obviously the logic makes sense every camera shoots in widescreen every tv every screen you look at behind me in front of you it's all widescreen our eyes are sideways this is how we watch video but it's sort of like a chicken and egg thing we watch video this way because we make video this way and we make video this way because we watch video this way but the rise of things like snapchat and instagram stories and all of us holding our phones up like this has kind of started this new thing as much as you might hate seeing someone make a vertical video and then upload it to youtube where it has those sideways bars a lot of people are just sharing it with other people watching on their phones and that's sort of a native organic experience where you're just watching it as if you captured it on your phone so vertical video on phones specifically is a thing that i'm not mad at there's no black bars there's no inefficiencies it fills up your whole screen and the challenge now is just to get creative about how to actually use vertical video on your phone so i think hating on vertical video just because it's vertical is getting a little stale it's getting a little old i think you just got to start thinking a little bit forward and getting creative and if you're too bored to shoot vertical then don't but we'll be on that train all right thoughts on the rise of gaming smartphones and it's kind of hard to say a rise of gaming smartphones when there's not that many i mean the prominent ones are the razer phone and we just got that new asus gaming phone and there's some new ones coming up but i like the genre i like the idea especially in this world where we're getting all these these fronts of phones that are all these like featureless fully screen no bezel no notch if they all look the same on the front you kind of lose some character that way so the one thing i see these gaming phones preserving is front-facing speakers like big thick batteries like things that make it a good media experience that you kind of lose out on have you met viewers or subscribers wearing your fire merch ps i got some of course and love the shirts thank you robert i'm glad you do and yeah actually i have seen that um lately or the most recently was actually in toronto playing an ultimate game uh which i tweet out every time we have a game by the way a couple people were wearing the shirt in the stands after the game came down took some photos it was fun so i have actually seen people in the wild with the shirts on where will lebron go um i don't know if i does lebron even know where lebron's gonna go what happened to the video with stephen curry oh yeah that also was pretty recent so i posted this photo not too long ago uh i did a little bit of a shoot uh commercial shoot actually with steph curry steph's coming out with a new shoe the curry five and we made like a sort of a commercial under armour reached out and they're like hey do you want to be in this commercial with steph playing yourself i was like yeah that sounds awesome so we were out there for a day with that uh the commercial i'll link that below as well but yeah it's just kind of a sort of a fun thing it's not a youtube collab really it's just kind of a fun opportunity that i happen to meet steph at hey marquez tell them what's under the hood for version five we studied all the previous iterations are you and victor oladipo related because y'all look just alike do we though like do we really actually though like are you are you just saying that or do you really think we look alike really have you considered podcasting as well uh yeah i've i've considered i've tossed around the idea of podcasting actually but as far as like formats go i think podcasting is a very different skill like that's something not a lot of people consider about these different platforms people who can be really good at youtube videos you know four or five minute videos doing live stuff on twitch like that is a completely separate different entertainment skill being good in an hour-long podcast just talking about random stuff rambling maybe that's a totally separate different skill even making igtv videos or instagram videos just short form comedy stuff that's another different skill so i've thought about podcasting but i don't actually think i'd be that good at it but i still play with the idea i think it could be fun to have like an experimental format to just talk about tech and give opinions when i might not put that all in videos would you guys be into a mkbhd podcast of some sort audio only video and audio something like that guess let me know and captain shadow says if you had a chance to interview elon musk what are the questions that you would definitely ask you know what i'm actually gonna i'm gonna flip that one right back around at you let's let's say uh let's say i have an opportunity to do that let's say i might tweet at him and he gets back at me what questions should i or would i ask elon we could talk tech we could talk cars we could probably talk whatever but i'm curious what you would say i'll be hanging out in the comments below probably taking notes either way that's been it for the june q a thanks for watching that also rhymed talk to you in the next one peace
