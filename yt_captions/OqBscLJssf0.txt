ladies and gentlemen at the time of recording this video it is August 2023 and the entire world has been captivated by the movie Oppenheimer and also Barbie Oppenheimer has grossed over 1 billion dollars at the box office it is an international sensation and in this video I'm going to share a secret about Oppenheimer that you may or may not have known also if you are new to my channel hi welcome to the world of Chess I am currently traveling I don't usually record all my videos in a hotel room and returning viewers know that as well I sound like I'm speaking from a quote airport control tower as somebody said in the comments uh Robert Oppenheimer versus Albert Einstein a chess game that apparently was played in 1933 which has a lot of different secrets about it a lot of different story lines about it and really people don't even know if this game happens at all but if you know anything about Oppenheimer then it's good that you know this chess game the game of chess captivates everybody and it doesn't matter if you're an extremely accomplished scientist like both of these men were the game of just humbles everybody as well and uh let's see how the two some of the two greatest scientists of all time battle it out on an eight by eight endless Board of possibilities those of you that are curious by the way there are uh more chest positions possible on a chessboard than there are atoms in the universe just think about that for a second when you consider the gravity of the accomplishments of both of these individuals Albert Einstein played white apparently and played the move Pawn to E4 this is a book move according to chess.com because it has been played many times in the past and Oppenheimer played E5 this is the most common chest position uh reached probably some 50 million times not in 1933 obviously because you know we didn't have the Queen's Gambit yet so not many people were playing chess most of you watching this video right now probably got into chess or are now getting into chess between the years 2020 and 2023 that's just sort of how it goes uh Einstein played Knight to F3 very reasonable second move and he's uh trying to put pressure on this Pawn now black has many responses but Oppenheimer plays the most common response which is developing the Queen's Knight to the C6 square and defending the pawn in the center of the board now white has many choices white can play Pawn to D4 which is called the scotch white can play Bishop to C4 which is called the Italian and there are others as well like the ponziani or the Four Knights or the a bite I don't know other stuff um but he plays Bishop to B5 Bishop to B5 is called the rule Opus or the Spanish opening and the idea is to put pressure on the Knight because the night guard's the center and the Knight hits here right very logical game chess is Bishop B5 also a move that has been played countless numbers of times and as you can see there it still has a little book symbol because on chess.com all that means is that it has been played in the past and we know what it is it has been studied before but both of these men obviously went into places that have not really been explored Pawn to A6 was the response hitting the bishop and basically saying if you take I'm gonna open up my bishop and I'm gonna open up my queen and I'm gonna be in good shape which is why actually white ghost here keeping options flexible if taking and also rerouting and then targeting the pawn on F7 all of this has happened many many times but very quickly the game goes off the beaten path as Oppenheimer plays B5 trying to chase the bishop completely out of his territory a slight over extension nothing crazy just yet we all know what White's next move is going to be which is putting the bishop right here but the bishop now reroutes to a comfortable diagonal targeting a pawn that's only protected by the black king and that's good you should really try to Target things that are only protected by Kings because you really Kings aren't really The Defenders that they're made out to be like the king is very very delicate in chess um and this could potentially be an over extension but for now it does kind of stand out as a spiky thorn in the position now black plays Knight F6 and that hits the pawn in the center which white has multiple ways of Defending first of all white can counter-attack hitting that pawn and defending the pawn in the center white can defend the pawn in the center with a pawn white can defend the pawn in the center with a knight or the queen but instead of doing any of that Albert Einstein in this position actually just ignores the pawn and plays castles in chess sometimes you just forget that things are capturable okay and some people would just forget that that pawn can be taken but right now what what Einstein is doing is he is developing right everything he's doing every move that he's made with the exception of moving his Bishop out of danger has been to make progress in his position he is getting out pieces that haven't had a chance to move now the king is also safe and The Rook can go over here and black meanwhile has made multiple moves kind of with pawns and has not really gotten the king to safety and has not brought the Bishops out and now if black wastes even more time right it's all about Tempo if you're going to waste even more time to grab material but you're not getting fully developed you know what I'm saying it's like you got to get in the car you got to start driving you gotta get to the destination but you run back into the house for something or you you want to get on the Metro and you run back into the house for something you're just delaying yourself right it's only going to lead to bad things same thing here if you're gonna go here and try to be greedy bad things might happen and and and and they do because now all of this is soft you see this Pawn actually blocked White's rook's Vision The Rook was only going to play defense but now Einstein's Rook is playing offense there is no Pawn there anymore and being down upon in chess is not it it it's really significant in certain situations it's not exactly significant in other situations particularly when you have meaningful pressure on the opponent right now what black should probably do is go back with the Knight and try to get castled but it's already it's already bordering on too late because at this point black wants to Castle and white is going to probably play something like Queen to E2 and continue to apply pressure so we have Rook to E1 and uh Oppenheimer in this position played the move Pawn to D5 defending the knight in the center now here Einstein actually makes a mistake he should probably take a center approach he should probably Target the the the Knight with a pawn he should probably Target the night with the Knight just get it out of the way to soften that up but instead uh Einstein strikes on the flank and we can see the computer giving that a big fat orange question mark like chess.com does um in reality it would have probably been better to play the move Knight to C3 which would have put some pressure here and after something like Knight takes white can take with the d-pawn opening up the bishop and the Queen and now the queen and the bishop pressure this the Knight and the Rogue pressure this and if you're newer to chess you have to understand every single move you make in chess it doesn't just stop where you think every single move you make in chess particularly captures they open things up they open up possibilities for the other pieces every trade has a winner and a loser and in this case white would be opening up the vision of the queen and the bishop uh and the bishop the bishop does not teleport in the way that I that I showed there Pawn to A4 however is the move that is played and the computer here is showing that actually putting the Knight on C3 would have been advantageous but Oppenheimer uh still not respecting the necessities of his position not understanding uh that he needs to um act now he needs to Castle his King he plays Pawn to B4 and as we can see that has given a big red X and the advantage is back to White why is the advantage back to White because black has overextended a lot of Pawns black has put a lot of soft pawns into the center of the board that can all be targets also black has not found a way to develop this bishop and black has not found a way to Castle the king I have drawn many many colors on the board and now Einstein plays D3 and this is going to be a problem as we can see from this evaluation bar on the left hand side it is still an equal position it's very close to zero zero zero which indicates equality equality is great it's great in society it's not great in chess if you're trying to win a game it's also not great in any competitive setting if you're trying to win a game so Knight to C5 is played which is a mistake um Oppenheimer might have been a successful scientist and a very influential scientist first time and a destroyer of worlds he wasn't no destroyer of the chessboard let's put it this way Knight C5 he had to go back he had to get a little bit closer to his king and the Knight had to stay with the King because when the Knight wanders over here now suddenly Knight takes E5 comes in and black is faced with a very unfortunate decision do I take the Knight and invite the white Rook into what's called a forking situation hitting the king of course then I can maybe move my Bishop here but then white continues the attack and brings the queen and maybe the bishop and maybe the Knight and I can't draw arrows so or well I'm not really sure what else you can do Oppenheimer here breaks a rule that I I tell beginners never to break now I haven't had a chance to have a conversation with Oppenheimer at the time um my uh my grandparents weren't even born but uh in this position Oppenheimer plays Knight to E7 Knight t7 is not a bad move but what I tell you know what I what I like to tell beginner and intermediate players is that going backwards most of the time is going to be the wrong decision like there's going to be a better option than retreating a piece and probably trading here and trying to continue to make progress in your position was the way to go now I obviously can't go back and give him a pep talk he played Knight to E7 now we are seeing the problem black has made 10 moves in the game one two three have been with that Knight and one and two have been with that Knight the Knight now blocks the queen and the bishop so black is still multiple moves away from castling and now Oppenheimer is going to face what we call an initiative in chess Queen to F3 an initiative in chess is a series of moves that create threats but they're not just silly one move threads like me attack Queen oh you moved it me attack Pawn oh you defend me attack Bishop that's not really how it works and chesson initiative is a sustained pressure it's an improvement of the position by the creation of threats think in tennis when you make an opponent uh I don't know many of you might not go outside go outside it's really nice out there for legal reasons if you go outside and get injured I am not liable that is your responsibility um so tennis right in tennis if you're hitting the ball to the left corner of the court and yeah and the opponent's sprinting over there and hits it back and now you get it back so you hit it to the opposite corner to make it more difficult for them to run that's what an initiative is you are poking into people's positions and trying to get them into uncomfortable spots and trying to get a competitive Advantage so you know with Knight takes E5 and queen F3 these are improving moves that Force reactions that are black and now Oppenheimer has to play Pawn to F6 which as we can see he could have developed a bishop and defended against Checkmate but he went for the more aggressive option which quadrupled White's Advantage from one to four and the point is that the move F6 looks like the Knight should move right the night's gotta go because it's under attack so the night you know would go here and and white loses all of his advantage but Einstein Einstein was a Gotham chess subscriber and uh and one of the things that Gotham chess says one of my favorite chess YouTubers he says when there was a a moment when you are in danger you don't always need to address the danger if you can find equal or exceeding danger for your opponent and in chess the most important thing you have to look for every single move just if it exists checks captures attacks many of you would see this move and go my knight is hanging damn well you know maybe I could go there maybe I could go there what you're not thinking about in the back of your mind like a like a like a running mechanism do I have a check and the only check in this position is Queen to H5 and it is lethal Queen to H5 threatens the king all of this is blocked so black has to play Pawn to G6 and now you see the point Knight takes that is a bomb being detonated on oppenheimer's position the Knight is pinned to the king so it cannot capture the pawn is pinned to The Rook it can capture but now Queen takes h8 Oppenheimer has suffered a devastating loss of material and in chess the two most important things are material and King safety you can be down material as long as your opponent's king is not as safe as yours this king is living in a beach house right on the edge of Costa Rica remember that T-Pain song Queen is pinning the bishop To The King The Rook is pinning the Knight to the king the bishop is about to come into H6 black has played nearly 15 moves of Chess in this game and he might be one of the most accomplished scientists who has ever lived but he only has a horse out and that's what I meant when chess humbles us all Oppenheimer has not developed his pieces in a successful way here and it doesn't get any better because he doesn't actually speed up his development right now black has a very important thing that he needs to do he needs to go here and if white continues he's got to run with the king that's what he's got to do he's got to get his King to safety and you know hope that the pieces are traded to a point where it doesn't really matter that he's down a rook for the night but instead of that he trades his only active piece the only piece in this position that has any activity whatsoever he takes the bishop and Einstein actually could have even played Bishop H6 here but he decides to take black has absolutely no development black has no pieces on the board so here black now is scrambling he's got to find a way to defend himself but he's got no forces to do it and Einstein is going to to try to get in there he's gonna try to get in there and absolutely brutalize the position now here again Bishop to F5 getting the King off of the back rank escaping two pins at the same time would be the way to go Queen to D6 played by Oppenheimer but Einstein just bulldozes Bishop to H6 putting pressure PP on the pp put pressure on the pinned piece now there is a monstrous threat of Queen takes Bishop which is only currently defended by the King which I told you at the beginning of the video is important to Target things that are only protected by the king because the king's not a very good Defender and now Oppenheimer can't even move his Knight to enable the defense of the queen of the bishop because the Knight the Knight is pinned so all of a sudden Oppenheimer is down a rook instead of being down a rook for a night and uh now is what we call the cleanup process Einstein in this position plays Queen to G7 applying even more pressure now on this night with the Rook with the bishop and chess there are two ways to win a chess game when you are already winning of course your opponent can run out of time but there are two ways simplify everything down to an end game right now why does upper Rook mathematically both of these guys were good at math they could do the math here what's gonna happen is if we trade everything here it's going to be a bishop versus a knight in a rook that's pretty easy to win another way is to just give a mate you have a massive amount of material go in just execute your opponent's king black plays defense here Rook 28 and now by far the simplest thing to do in my opinion Rook takes or Bishop takes take take take take take black has nothing black has this goofy Bishop just keep all your pieces on dark squares and you'll probably win and even if you don't keep your pieces on dark squares promote a pawn and go deliver mate but instead of that Einstein knew that apps are playing this game 90 years later in August of 2023 in a crappy little hotel room in Los Angeles that Gotham is staying at to uh no it's great it's actually fantastic Hotel thank you for uh providing it for us I'm currently staying here for the POG Champs 5 chess tournament um watch box Champs 5 by the way uh that Gotham would be featuring this game and it's actually not even clear if Einstein and Oppenheimer played this game but if you look up Oppenheimer Einstein chess this is what appears so you know everything on the internet is true um that I would be showing this game and Einstein knew that which is why he kept more pieces on the board the thing is he doesn't have to rush that's the incredible thing about this position Black's not going anywhere so he just develops a knight Oppenheimer doesn't resign plays Pawn to C5 it's the only Pawn he hasn't moved by the way take a look at his position he's actually moved every single piece except the pawn which is a nice you know little thing to fulfill he's just pushing his pawns forward doesn't really know what to do and now Einstein is known for E equals MC squared right or he's known for E equals nc4 n C4 now you may wonder why Knight is n even though it's spelled with a K which is silent that's because the king is K and for some reason we say Knight we right and I don't really I don't know why we do I just make chess YouTube videos Knight C4 and that move looks like it shouldn't work because it's simply capturable but the queen now has to relinquish the defense of the Knight and for the second time in this game a horse detonates a bomb on Oppenheimer you will you will remember there was Knight takes G6 well after Knight to D2 he plays Knight to C4 removing the Queen's defense of the Knight because if you take I open this up and I told you already in the beginning of this video every single time there is a capture in chess or a move is played things open up and this opens up this is a uh a brutal position the Rooks and the queen and the bishop absolutely brutally obliterates the black position here Oppenheimer goes here and apparently resigned after the night was taken it was just a few moves until Checkmate you see M7 on the board that is not a style of BMW that is the fact that with best play in seven moves white should deliver a Checkmate by swarming the black king and delivering a mate probably on the dark squares apparently how Albert Einstein defeated Robert Oppenheimer in a uh in a chess game in 1933 in Princeton now they actually both live the end of their lives in Princeton New Jersey so this is not an outlandish claim but there are uh various reports that say that this game actually never happened which makes me wonder how it ended up all over the Internet anyways and and it was even published somewhere in 1959 that this was a game between Oppenheimer and Einstein so maybe it happened maybe it didn't we are not able to actually interview the players unfortunately maybe they played many many more games against each other but seems like Einstein was a better chess player than Oppenheimer at least that's what this game showed that's all that's all I have for you um if you're new to the channel check out chess on YouTube it's great I'm hoping this video is somewhere in the algorithm somewhere and if you're a returning viewer thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video get out of here
