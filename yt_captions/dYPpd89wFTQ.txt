ladies and gentlemen it's currently January 2024 and it's Magnus Carlson month on chess.com I know that sounds like a fake holiday or a fake celebration but chess.com always has fun and interesting Bots and this month there are many different types of Magnus Carlson ones now I tried to play the Magnus Carlson bot the boss 2882 rated and I couldn't beat him no matter what I did so in this video I decided to do what I did with mittens bot a year ago I would play the bot and stockfish the most powerful chess computer in the world would help but a year ago I alternated moves with stockfish when I went to beat mittens in this video I did something completely different stockfish would only help me like a Lifeline in a video game I was only allowed to ask stockfish for help once in the first game if I lost it would be twice then it would be three times and I would see how many hints I would need to actually take down magnus' top AI this made for some really interesting chest because I had to read stock fish's mind for a bunch of its suggestions and it made it really really difficult as always a friend friend L disclaimer you cannot and should not do this in Real rated games I was playing against a bot this is all for content and with all that said let's get into the games but first I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video surf shark surf shark is a VPN or virtual private Network

the video thank you sponsored Gotham my friends it's time for game number number one in this game I am only allowed to talk to stockfish Once one time and that's it now the Magnus bot opened with a queen's Pawn I played a Queen's Gambit decline my idea was this if I play a solid opening I don't play an opening that requires a lot of tactics and a lot of calculation at some point I will consult with the best computer in the world and maybe it'll help me in a pivotal Moment In the late middle game or an end game if we get into a big tactical battle I might just die so like stockfish can help me once but it's not going to be very useful I thought this was going to be a very interesting experiment because I thought you know what stockfish is going to come in right it it it's you obviously shouldn't do this in real games but but it's it's interesting to learn like it's kind of it's kind of fascinating to see whether you see things or not in certain positions by the way I obviously did not have this either so I played the game blind I'm giving this here for you this is a standard Queen's Gambit declined uh White plays The Exchange variation cuz the pawns are getting exchanged in the center of the board you did not need me to tell you that and now black just develops pieces as follows there's a lot of lines here uh black and castle by lines I mean not things you have to memorize but rather approaches that black can take to the position some are here some involve putting a bishop on F5 I decided to play this Knight maneuver first which tries to Target the bishop and then I castled and then I traded off this the H3 is is not a particularly good move uh White should really consider castling in this position but H3 is fine it stops anything from going to G4 it also stops Knight H5 so if like my opponent castled you know I can play this and I can get the bishop without giving away my bishop and so the Magnus bot prevents Knight H5 by creating a space for the bishop at which point you know white could even consider moves like G4 to try to attack me so the Magnus bot played H3 I traded the dark squ Bishop like this and I thought well I'm off to a great start you know I'm going to put my rook in the center life is good Magnus bot played Queen C2 I thought it was a little silly to consult the bot because it's a Queen's Gambit declined a lot of my different plans in this position could be correct but I decided to get aggressive I decided to make a stand here I'm going to play B5 I know the bot is going to come open the center of the board but I feel like after the exchanges that is when I will get to consult with the overlord and uh this is what I did we traded a bunch of pieces and I thought you know what that Pawn's weak and and maybe I have a chance now again my goal is to beat the Magnus bot it's not to draw the Magnus bot so it's very difficult to play for a win in a queen's gam declined exchange variation like if you're playing a really strong grandmas the chance of black winning is low if you're playing a really strong AI the chance of winning is even lower because it's just such a like the computer's not going to blunder it's not like a human so I brought my Rook it went Rook C1 and I kind of thought okay I'm in a lot of trouble because this is what we call a backwards Pawn backwards Pawn is a pawn whose neighbors have gone forward and left it behind so it's only protected by pieces it's no longer protected by pawns but what makes it backwards is it can't actually move forward right if I could go here life would be good like if I could get this position oh black is like chilling was great play C4 take more space but I can't move the pawn and so since I can't move the pawn white is also at all moments threatening to play Queen C5 and this move will just stink up my positions not going to going be good to deal with it would be a mistake for white to take with the D Pawn uh because although that's under pressure you block all of your pressure now you do remove the isolated Pawn so there might be some Merit to that move but overall it's better to keep the pressure on the black pawn rather than closing the file now here I thought I was making good improvements to my position but the problem is you're playing a bot right and so since you're playing a bot at some point you just assume you're going to blunder because that's that's life the psychology of playing a human and a robot very very different so I just thought you know what I'm going to go King h8 King King G8 I'm just going to bounce my king back and forth cuz I don't think white can make any progress now as it turns out this is one of the top computer moves in the position did not consult here and here to my shock Magnus went for this endgame he traded off a pair of Rooks and a pair of Knight versus bishop and we went here and I thought wait a minute I can't lose like so what if he takes my Pawn I'm going to going to take his Pawn on E3 so I brought my king back into the game and he took us into a rook end game and I thought wait a minute I can't lose I'm actually holding even with the Magnus bot I mean he applied pressure he grabbed the pawn but he lost one on the way out and my idea was like after King G8 if he goes to guard this Pawn I would go here and so I thought Knight C6 doesn't make sense because Rook C7 wins because I pinned the the Knight to the queen that was my plan but then we went here and I thought okay well it's a bot right so it's obviously trying to trade into a winning Pawn end game when you're in a rook end game you really want to avoid trading into an end game where you might lose like this pass Pawn is very powerful so I didn't trade Rooks I played Rook E4 bot went D5 and um around here I decided Well there there's no way I can lose this because what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring my king he's going to push I'm going to get back in time I have to get back in time I have to leave two squares to advance and then I played F6 and I'm going to bring my king and my Rook I thought oh that's it I mean I can't believe this I'm actually going to draw the Magnus bot in a rook end game and then I realized this is not so easy because he has an outside pass Pawn he has an a pawn which is the worst kind of Pawn that he can have here I thought I can give up my G pawn and win his a pawn that was my plan and even if I lose my Pawn completely this is an issue he could defend himself but he's going to advance I did all this myself I'm very proud to saying I thought I made it to a drawn end game to draw a two versus one end game you just have to know the filad or position but then it got a little dicey then all of a sudden his bot started pushing and pushing and I was like okay wait a minute did I mess up and right here I thought uhoh this was mistake was very silly of me to go up I should have went back if I just hang back I can't lose it's un losable cuz I'm cutting off his King and and uh and even though I'm cut off I mean I'm I'm walking up to the pond so I made a I made a little bit of a boo boo and here I decided to use my stockfish privilege and stockfish right here told me I can play F4 trading off the pawns now if Magnus were to take me I would stop the pawn easily but he didn't he gave me several checks and all of a sudden I'm sitting there going okay I know if I go back and I take and he takes two versus one two versus nothing hnf is a drawn Rook end game if you don't know that you don't know that all good but I thought wait a minute what about this maneuver where I get to G5 and Rook H4 well as it turns out this is a draw but I thought I was losing you see stockfish played F4 seeing all of this it suggested that I lose two Pawns in a rook end game and I just checked Magnus until I can't check him anymore apparently because white is so Frozen he can't move so if I just hang out on the sixth rank I can't lose this end game King E4 I mean I can even check I can check I can take take and take right so if I had just realized I actually have a defensive Fortress and he can't make any progress It's a drawn rook and pawn endgame but I didn't realize that and I blundered and Magnus can win the game by playing h what's crazy is that the bot didn't play H6 and it went here but I still could not find the right drawing setup and I and I played very passively and now I'm losing which is fascinating that stockfish just knew that this was a draw it knew this was a draw because I just have to protect the promotion so H6 and I can give a bunch of checks and the King even though the king could try to run to E6 and F7 it never works because Rook e six here now I take no I don't take I play Rook King G8 it's mate it's m I didn't even realize that yeah I mean this was crazy game one I uh I I did my best but I lost in a in a ridiculous Rook end game one stockfish suggestion was not good enough I am not good enough to beat Magnus but uh equal terms with one stock for suggestion so I played game two and this one uh this one was a VI I got white in this game and I played a two nights Vienna he went after my Bishop I played actually what's in my course I played the uh the the course my my E4 course on on Chesley and I got a very nice setup I put a bunch of Pawns on light squares because I traded my light squared Bishop then I went here and here I was shocked that Magnus allowed this and this and in this position I was like wait a minute really like he has a horrible structure he has doubled pawns on the f file a pawn Island on the H file and I'm just going to play Knight D5 and if he ever goes here this becomes a weakness now here I consulted stockfish for the first time in the game and it was to decide whether to Castle king or Queens side I wanted to go here I wanted to play Rook D1 and I wanted to play F4 stockfish didn't like allowing F5 and so what it recommended is I Castle Queen side now of course both looked very nice and also wanted to go G4 but I didn't know if overc committing a pawn you never know right in chess if you're if you're stopping a plan or overextending right so it it suggested that I go here and play G4 and black cannot play F5 here because I have take take Knight D5 that's the difference is that I attack this and this if I Castle short F5 then after takes he apparently can in between move me and attack my Rook that's the difference the difference is is that F5 take there is no in between move because my Rook is not hanging apparently apparently that's the big idea although I don't get it and then I guess I don't know I I that that that's but that's why it is that's what stockfish is and so I got this massive clamp on the position I got all my pawns on light squares I traded off my light squar Bishop my opponent has no Mobility I thought oh this is the game right here it's only going to take me one more stockfish suggestion and I'm going to beat Magnus just easily all right me with two suggestions boom easy he went here I went here I thought and he's trying to do all of this's trying to break upart my pawns give me double sets of isolated pawns I was like easy peasy Knight D5 he defended himself and then I thought game's over like I did all of this on my own I'm I'm improving my position F4 was a nice idea I also can slow play it with Knight I thought F4 take I'm going to put my knight here Knight H5 I'm going to win the game he went went B5 that move scared me so I decided you know what I'm going to use my second privilege I really don't like counterplay when my opponent is an AI and it and and stockfish found a nice idea here which actually in retrospect I I probably could have found myself the idea is quite nice the idea is C5 and the point of this idea is on display because if he goes here he opens up the line to his Bishop and Knight E7 is actually not the move Knight E3 is the move and the idea of Knight E3 is to attack the bishop and when the bishop moves you trap the other one that is pretty gangster I did not see that C5 is I thought for Knight E7 and then maybe you sack and then you play Knight F5 check and this is good but it's even better better to go whoop whoop that is that's badass I mean backwards KN moves in chess some of the hardest to see but then I did see this I am now out of stockfish moves and I thought oh this is so easy now I go here he takes I take he's completely locked down I'm going to take his queenside pawns his Bishop can't get into the game easy and I played F5 and lost all my advantage apparently what I should have done instead instead of rushing is I should have just stepped out and I should have and I should have just said both your Bishops are terrible and I'm trying to play F5 and you know when I saw this I was like damn it that's so obvious you ever analyze your chess games just period and realize oh obviously the bishop is stupid and if he goes here I play F5 and then his Bishop has to go oh I'm completely winning duh why would I trade his Bishop for my night you know I just thought oh but of course I should go back because this bishop is terrible but I thought oh I just get my rook in oh no no no now I didn't know that in the game I still thought I was winning he went here and then I thought oh but this is simple I take and I get the pass outside Pawn like his position is so terrible there is no chance he has here Rook easy trade everything and then just start pushing the A and B pawns I thought this is so simple what an easy end game I'm going to get my knight back to these squares I'm going to play Bam Bam Bam get my Rook out A4 A5 easy piece he's going to bring his Bishop I'm play A4 he's going to go back you know I thought this game is going to play itself he's going to run his King I'm going to play Knight D5 like I thought look at my light squared control I'm totally dominating and then I forgot something I forgot I was playing a bot so we just went here and it's creating counterplay very quickly and at this point I panicked I panicked um I I I I really panicked because I thought this was coming and I thought after something like take take this is going to be a runaway Pawn like Rook C4 I can stop it but it looks very scary as always the computer is not concerned uh and after Rook B6 Rook C8 it wants to play D5 but actually white is still better if I play Just A4 if I just relax play D5 bring my king sack this pawn and play Rook B4 I'm fine but I got really scared here I really panicked because I thought I threw away my advance which I did which I did I had a feeling around here I mean this looks like a great position and it was until I traded a little too quickly which is a lesson and then immediately here comes stockfish and it takes and the pawn just gets through and I I I I mean this absolute becomes a hero I allowed Magnus bot's complete idiot Bishop who just sat on the like this bishop just sat on the edge edge of the board for the entire game doing literally nothing nothing at all it was standing around and it wasn't even looking good and it was just like and then when the dust settled and I got all of this somehow I allowed this complete imbecile Pawn structure to become a total hero and it's just interesting you know that that that's just how chess goes sometimes you allow a little bit of mobility and free room to your opponent and they punish you for it actually my original idea here was to do this which is genius it's a really nice blockade except that it loses the game I forgot about that and after something like B4 he takes I can't take because my Rook is hanging and I lose I just lose cuz the pawn gets through like King C2 E3 you know King D3 rook d8 and and suddenly these pieces that were not doing a thing become Heroes they become right and and and that was really frustrating cuz I really thought that was going to be the game I really did not want to rely more on more moves cuz I thought I I did a really good job on my own so now we have to play a game where damn it I got to rely on on on Mr stockfish for three moves this game I played a Scandinavian I played a Scandinavian because I thought it's going to be a little bit more Dynamic and with three references to stockfish maybe I'll be all right take take Queen A5 Knight F6 I thought all right we're good C6 normal stuff we're playing playing a Scandinavian here let's play Bishop B4 let's trade okay we get out normal stuff Knight f six normal stuff and here I was like oh God oh God what is this I didn't need stockfish here he was trying to trap my Bishop so I played H6 Knight D5 take take and I thought okay that's easy right this is relatively straightforward this position I mean I got here I thought I still got all three up my sleeve he went H5 I went Bishop H7 and here I use my first one I Ed my first one because this is the complete opposite of what I wanted you see if I was in a dynamic battle against an AI and I knew I had three references to check stockfish I would want a bit more of a tactical position because it could actually do something definitive the more time that I have in an equal game with many pieces on the board remember I'm trying to win so like how do I win this well I thought let me let me see what comes up with and stockfish came up with an interesting idea rather than playing C5 which is fine and trying to make a little bit of of middle game progress here it opted for this and the idea of Queen F5 was it wants a queen trade and and I and I understood it wants a queen tra oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry Knight E3 hangs the bishop let's say Bishop G3 Queen C2 it wants a queen trade because white has Pawn weaknesses you see white overextended and so if we get into into an end game let's just say like like this two pawns on light squares that's pretty bad that's pretty bad the computer is already saying that the bishop pair and two pawns stuck on light squares like this is pretty bad for white so I played Queen F5 and my intention was to trade the queen and I was immediately punished for my intention because I'm now getting mated okay stockfish clearly saw all of this and thought well just they're stupid and that I realized that but it's really diff it's actually incredibly hard to take guidance from an AI because it doesn't explain itself it made me wander my queen into the territory and now I'm thinking oh God like do I go out here that looks stupid why would I leave my king you know he's going to go here here here here like I'm going to get mated I'm a human being I don't want to put my queen on the outside of the board and yet it's better for black it's minus .15 so it's fascinating right and and and that actually goes to show you how stupid stupid y'all look when you cheat what people don't realize when they cheat at chess is how hard it is to hide it that's why y'all get caught that's why y'all shouldn't cheat because if you see I'm playing Magnus bot right in this game and I'm using stockfish a tiny amount and it's not helping at all at all and if I do it anymore well then then that's basically stockfish playing right so I went here and then a couple moves later I was like you know what I don't know why it made me do this because I'm going to get mated now it doesn't think I'm going to get mated the computer's best move is B6 okay Bishop Knight here it wants to take then it has this idea F5 and then there's even a draw a force draw here and King h8 doesn't help because that I I can't take right it was it would have taken it would have played here this would have been a Perpetual yeah but I went for a queen trade because that's what I thought what I had to do now I'm worse now I'm worse now I am uh in a worse position F3 C5 and I'm like trying to do my best I accidentally allow the pawn to come through should not have done that in this position I should have kicked out the bishop with F6 like here and then I should have taken creating an isolated pawn and I should have put pressure on the isolated Pawn that's the way I should play this position I didn't do that I allowed D5 and then I allowed D6 and at this point I thought oh my God I'm going to lose with three stock for suggestions cuz it it it suggested a plan that I completely didn't understand now at this point I I I asked stockfish for help cuz I just thought I was going to lose it's not going to help me much it really isn't what it gave me was to trade the rook and the idea was G5 like I could play G5 now or I could play it so it did this and then I was like why did it make me do that I'm going to lose my seon so I didn't even understand its suggestion was like what so I played here and then I started bringing my king and I realized here's what I realized this is the 38th move of the game stockfish asked me 7even moves ago in this position to play this G5 idea but I was like why that's because it saw it saw Rook E2 King E2 G G5 on passant here Rook D4 King F7 Rook C4 G5 Bishop B5 King E6 attacking the bishop in this bishop goes to D4 targeting the pawn I can take the pawn he can't take on A7 because Pawn to B5 attacks the rook and attacks the bishop Rook E2 King E2 G5 on pant FG Rook D4 G5 Bishop B5 King F7 Rook C4 King E6 Bishop D4 attacking my pawn and stop stockfish saw he can't take because B5 discovered attack and attacks The Rook this is what we're dealing with here when you try to use stockfish but then he Magnus bot played Rook C8 so I was on my own again I was on my own again and I went Rook H7 thinking if Bishop here I can play B5 and then I got here and I thought oh I can't lose because it's it's an equal end game right I'm just going to push my pawns like I'm going to push the pawns that's what I'm going to do so he went here and I thought oh this is easy now this is easy I mean I'm passive I'm passive but I but I I got pawns right here here come my pawns I'm going to start pushing my pawns just H4 and this was my moment I had one more reference to stockfish but you will remember the plan is to beat Magnus the plan is not to draw so I I already Drew Magnus on my own I I I don't need stock fish's help to draw him Rook H4 check just as an in between move trading all the pawns now I just have to not blunder anything stupid and I was very proud of my defensive idea actually um I think I referenced stockfish just one more time somewhere here it was uh it was it was how to how to deal with the incoming pressure just but it's a draw already and I found a nice idea here which is which is this bishop B3 he can't take because I'm going to take his Rook he can't grow he he also by the way just for the record in case anybody's confused he cannot take my Pawn cuz if he takes my Pawn I give a check he has to stay guarding this and actually he would lose because after this I would just push and he can't get back to G7 that is the reason he cannot take on G7 on B7 rather he he can't come back and stop the pawn so the lesson there is make sure your Rook can get behind a pawn like that and is not stopped by a king which is defended right now but I would take the bishop and that would be that so King D5 and I found this nice idea Bishop C5 if he takes I take the bishop and he tried to M me but then I found Rook E5 this was this was the nice Final Touch Rook E5 and this is a defensive Fortress my Bishop protects both my pawns and he can't mate me I mean he can mate me if I like allow it but he didn't bribe me enough so I'm not going to do that uh so Bishop F2 and it's a draw it's a defensive Fortress CU he can't win both of my pawns he goes to win this one this one will promote he goes to win this one I will get to that one so I think we played a few more moves and uh I my king got out and I mean if anybody's playing for a win it's black by the way way because you know you could be careless with white and all of a sudden uh black is going to win your B Pawn so be very careful I mean it's probably still a draw but no need for any of this so I drew but I didn't win so we go to this game I need four potentially stockfish suggestions to help me to beat Magnus bot I played a trompowsky I took on F6 and then I played a normal setup and he attacked me right away I was was really annoyed I was just going to play a trompowsky trade my Bishop put pawns on dark squares Bishop E2 Knight E2 Knight no this dude Magnus started harassing my king immediately played Queen A5 track I was like leave me alone bro what do you then he played this I was like what the I was so mad I was so mad I was so annoyed cuz I was like he's trying to go Bishop B2 and like if I Castle he's trying to go here here here like that's so St apparently he's not by the way apparently that's not the idea at all I castled and then he went here and and I thought I'm going to lose my Pawn but it's actually not that simple because after Queen A2 I can play Rook A1 and the queen is trapped so I can play like Queen D3 and win the queen right not that simple he went here and I thought okay I have four stockfish suggestions let me use one now it came up with a very interesting idea came up with this I didn't even think of that like and the idea of that move is actually very fascinating it's the fact that he can't take he can't take because if he takes I trap his Bishop his Queen has to guard the bishop and I'm going to go Queen D3 or queen C2 or Rook C1 Rook C1 Bishop B2 actually B4 so H6 the best move is Queen D3 or B4 and then if this I have a fork and I'm winning and I played C3 and he took and I was like oh my God oh my God oh my God I'm going to win A3 and then he went C5 and I was like oh my God that is a huge nuisance Queen D3 Pawn takes C5 what do I play because again I don't look at stockfish every move what I should have done here is I should have used my one of my second my second move but I get three left and I thought this is really simple he's going to take I'm going to take right he can't take because I go here so he's going to take like this and then I'm going to play B4 that's easy so then I thought well then what's he going to play right so oh he's going to get out that's so what then I play like B whatever nope nope no this is the wrong move C5 I played the wrong move all my advantage is gone because his Bishop gets I didn't know that again I thought oh look at me stockfish Magnus blundered Magnus blundered and and then for some reason I just I don't know I didn't play Queen D3 I don't know why I maybe I I thought his Bishop is getting saved somehow but it's just not like the bishop is trapped maybe G6 I thought Bishop F5 I don't know I panicked I panicked it's ridiculous I should have just played Queen D3 instead I forgot his Bishop can get out and I went here he took my pawn and I went B4 I thought okay I'm a pawn down but maybe I'm doing all right now here I was surprised because he took and then he played A5 which I thought was a bad move because it allowed Knight B5 now that's accurate it's a bad move because it's allowing me to get way too much activity for the cost of a pawn black has a lot of weaknesses and very passive pieces and a very weak queen I'm using the queen as a pinata to get into the black position now A5 is a mistake because of Knight B5 but not because of my next move which is garbage um I played Knight C7 which is not the best move and now I have a problem now I can't take because both pawns become weak immediately I can't play B5 because I hang C5 so what the hell do I do if I take this that's fine but okay he's not going to hang the pawn he's going to play F5 so I thought all right now it's time to use our second reference to stockfish and it did not disappoint in this position it found a gangster move a move I did not even begin to think of f4 and the idea of f4 is so dank it's not even to trap the bishop it's to also play Rook F2 to try to trap the queen I didn't see that like this I could have seen F5 I could have seen But then G4 and F5 like you try to stop this and now I got Rook F2 trapping the Queen the queen goes here I played Knight B5 and the queen is stuck Queen E3 Rook B3 yo the queen is trapped that's crazy I didn't see that I didn't see f four with the idea of playing Bonk trapping the queen in the center of the board did not see that stockfish did he took and I realized that he's letting me trap the bishop so that he saves his Queen and we got to this position I I'm panicking here man I'm panicking all right um I realized here the move Rook takes B4 is not free because of a fork that I at least saw apparently I can like sack and get out but you know so I went here first then I here and then I thought okay I have three pawns for a I have a bishop Magnus bot has three pawns let's try to play this for a win I can still reference stockfish twice I got to be very careful there's a lot of pieces on the board which is good for me because I'm up a bishop so if I can I can secure this win he played Queen E2 I protected my Pawn he got out with the queen I thought that was a weird move I didn't understand it I got out with my knight because I thought I need to bring the Knight back but Black's position's still solid so the question is do we try to win this game like this with all the we have or do we try to get into an end game what are we trying to do right what are we trying to do he went here I went King H1 I didn't know what to do so I I I move my king off the center line he went into my position man all right let me attack Queen C4 now here I thought about taking then I realized I hang a piece thankfully I did not blunder that so Rook C1 he went here and in this position I had a very big moment where I was like okay what do do I play right like do I go for an attack Queen [Music] G4 he played F5 now I thought okay I want to trade the queen that's the human in me I want to trade the queen or do I want to keep the queen for my own attack I decided I'm going to keep the queen for my own attack I I I don't know I can play Queen E2 I can play Queen H it's all the same right maybe maybe it's I don't know he went here suddenly I realized wait a minute I could play Rook e one but hold on hold on a second let me consult stockfish this is my third move I got one left stockfish said come back that was not what I was going to do so it pointed me in the right direction I I was going to go rookie one Knight D3 rookie two which loses so instead of rookie two I probably would have had to play something else so told me to come back right Rook A8 and then I was like what about this this how about G4 here's the idea I'm trying to rip apart his defense if he takes I take with the queen get my queen in the game if he takes my Pawn I have Rook e one so I'm going to win the E6 Pawn I thought that actually looks good if I could get rid of these bozos I might get into an end game where I have a bishop versus one Pawn Max so I played G4 a lot of that happened and then here Magnus played this and I did not need stockfish to find this tactic if I take the queen he takes my queen so I sacked my queen first on G7 and I was like Desperado tactic but when it all was said and done I thought wait a minute I'm still only up a bishop for three pawns I'm still not winning this is nuts I'm G to have to play five stockfish recommendations so I went here and I was like wait a minute what is M why is he playing that I have Rook F1 it's over he's gonna have to give me the pawn no he went here he sacked his Rook here I panicked cuz despite being up a full Rook he's got three pass pawns and I thought there is absolutely no way the AI did that without knowing it's going to make a comeback but lucky for me I had one last stockfish recommendation up my sleeve I I budgeted it well it went the exact way it should have this is not easy to win at all at all but the winning idea is to go Rook B1 and Bishop F1 and I I played Rook B1 but to undevelop the bishop protect that diagonal and try to get an outside pass Pawn that is how you win Bishop F1 this was terrifying but the bot lost the pawn and I think this is lost for black even though black has three pass pawns my Pawn is faster over here and Magnus went all in he he just went here and now I can give him this check which apparently is a terrible move apparently it's a terrible move apparently it was better for me to bring my king first I went here thinking oh this is easy I take the I take here but apparently if he keeps his Rook on the board this is actually really hard to win like how do I win this end game he's going to play King D4 if I play Rook E1 I'm going to lose by the way like I'm going to find a way to like all these pawns are going to get through so but he traded with me and I thought oh this is winnable I don't have any more moves left but I'm going to bring my king I'm going to play Rook B4 Rook B4 is intended to cut off his King so he could play D2 and I go here and the rest I managed to figure out on my own use my outside pass Pawn tactical situation the second he goes here my Bishop will cover so I push my Pawn the whole length he can't take my Pawn because I play Rook takes F6 and I manage to win because his position is completely stopped I stop him I win the pawn yes he can Fork me but he can't stop my Pawn if he does that and this was a nice easy conversion and uh thankfully I managed to win I managed to beat the Magnus bot with four recommendations of stock that was not easy at all I had to keep a lot of pieces on the board for this game and even when it got tactical oops even when it got tactical I was not able to find the best continuation so the stockfish recommendations were pretty useless because I I kept getting myself into bad situations but this was probably the most important move like once I got the extra piece I had hope but yeah the the critical idea probably was it preventing me from just you know like me me keeping my nerves and not trading all the pieces but also coming back finding this nice idea with G4 uh was good and then here actually yeah the Magnus bot just sort of panicked and did some crazy stuff so um it took four it took four like I said you shouldn't do this against humans this is clearly not the way you're supposed to play but I wanted to have a little fun I wanted to challenge myself and uh it's like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire when you got those lifelines this was my lifeline hopefully you enjoyed hopefully the games were instructive shows you how difficult it is to actually beat AI also shows you how stupid people look when they actually try to cheat and get away with it because they can't they don't know how um that's all get out of here
