all right what's up mkbhd here and today was google's i o their annual developer conference and usually we don't see a ton of hardware at events like this but this one for whatever reason we got a ton of hardware or at least hardware announcements so there's kind of three levels of announcements going on here so first of all there's the right around the corner coming up next stuff that's two things and they're going to be going on sale in the next month or so then there's the later this year section so we did get a bit of a sneak preview at some more fall hardware some stuff that we're actually going to get fully unveiled later this year and then there's the on the horizon section which is they went ahead and pre-announced a piece of 2023 hardware for some reason but we'll get to that but first of all in the next up section pixel 6a and pixel buds pro these are both things that we kind of knew were coming but now we're finally getting all the details of these announcements so for the pixel 6a it is essentially a slightly smaller slightly bumped down pixel six and it will retail for 449. so honestly from what we can tell here the 6a will be very similar to the pixel 6. you can see the design same camera bar same glass same software with all the material you and live captions and speech recognition and camera features and it's powered by the same exact tensor chip from the flagship pixel six and six pro but you know those phones are going on past six months old now so you can imagine the price of manufacturing some of those parts is starting to go down but the real main difference between the pixel 6a and the pixel 6 which is 599 is the display and cameras which is really interesting so for the display it is smaller a little bit the more premium pixels are both pretty big this will have a 6.1 inch 1080p 60 hertz g-o-led display which is still big but it's now the smallest pixel so then cameras are the other interesting thing so now google telling us that cameras are one of the areas where they saved cost from the pixel 6 means that yeah okay this a is going to have cheaper cameras than the pixel 6 which worried me at first so it is still a standard and an ultra wide and you can kind of see a slightly new visual design in the camera bar which i'll touch on more in a second but on the spec sheet it actually tells us it is the sony imx 363 that's the sensor for the main camera which is actually the same 12 megapixel sensor that we've seen in some of those older pixels pixel 4 pixel 3 pixel 2 this is a tried and true older sensor so cheaper yes but also probably not bad but other things like materials and battery appear to be about the same although do definitely have to test that stuff i i would suggest getting subscribed to see that review video when it comes out here battery could be an interesting one because this is the smallest lowest refresh rate display in any pixel but it still has the same tensor chip so we'll see how that gets handled could be amazing but the other specs i can confirm are six gigs of ram and 128 gigs of storage ip67 water resistance it does have an in display fingerprint reader there's a 4400 milliamp hour battery with 18 watt charging but there is no mention of wireless charging and then sub 6 5g and millimeter wave 5g with specific models and five years of android security updates so that's the pixel 6a and that's the new budget smartphone but it's launching alongside a new high-end set of earbuds from google pixel buds pro so if we have pixel buds a series i looked on google store that's actually the only one they're selling right now so the a series for 100 bucks is like regular airpods basically and then pixel buds pro for 200 bucks would be sort of equivalent to airpods pro so this is a 199 dollar noise canceling pair of wireless earbuds they do have a transparency mode they'll have multi-device connectivity compatible with android ios and computers google assistants built-in they have ipx4 sweat resistance and overall the design i'm going to say it looks pretty tame you know you can see the mics each earbud has three microphones you got the silicon tips in front of an 11 millimeter driver and the case looks basically the same as the original pixel buds with the black and white design and the magnet and wireless charging the quoted battery life is 11 hours of listening or seven hours with active noise cancellation turned on basically i feel like the differentiating factor with these especially when we get them and listen to how they sound is gonna come from the six core audio chip on board which also apparently will have a lot to do with the noise cancellation the transparency mode and just overall the way they sound now i've been waiting a long time for a pair of earbuds with noise cancellation and a transparency mode that rivals airpods airpods still to this day have far and away the best transparency mode i've ever heard in any pair of headphones so i'm looking forward to maybe pixel buds stepping their game up in that dimension it's just one part of headphones um but yeah the competition has a lot of other things going for them so we'll see how the pixel buds stack up but yeah that's what's up next that's the stuff that'll be on sale this summer but then google went ahead and gave us a little bit of a preview of some stuff that's coming up this fall including a full design reveal of the pixel 7 and 7 pro and a new pixel watch finally so this is our limited first look at the pixel 7 and 7 pro so the details of course are way more confined with this stuff but you can see the new colors here and you can also see a bit more of that camera design and super bold big camera circles and the camera bar and an extra detail is we also know that that glass is soft touch which i am very excited about so they've sort of gone back and forth on soft touch but if you remember the pixel threes with the soft touch glass i remember i really liked that back of a phone finish if it's anything like that i'm very excited about it and seeing as there is a black 7 pro at the bottom i'm thinking that's probably going to end up being the one i prefer although matt white typically does a great job hiding fingerprints so we'll see this phone will have the next generation tensor chip and it will launch with android 13 but that's pretty much all we know at this point so yeah new phone coming out this fall pixel 7 and 7 pro new chip new colors new matte finish and then yeah i guess we can also technically see it still has a port at the bottom and it definitely has speakers all the classic stuff some new colors i'm not sure how i feel about this gray with the green undertone but it does contrast well with the gold but probably the more interesting preview we got is the one of the new pixel watch they're finally doing it this fall we're going to have i mean theoretically maybe a competitor to the apple watch but sort of in the android world i've been waiting for this for a long time it's a sort of a result of their collaboration or i guess purchase of fitbit and this is it this is the pixel watch so okay it's a circular stainless steel design and it is a very simple silhouette as you can see not a whole lot to set it apart on the outside but i do like that it is simple and it has what they're calling a tactile crown for input though it's also a touch screen and it has interchangeable bands and it runs wear os this is the pixel watch that we've been i mean hearing so much about for so long and waiting for it's clearly got some solid bezels all the way around i mean that's the first thing i notice when the screen is on and i guess i'm judging just by eyeballing these lifestyle photos but it looks like it's about the same size as the smaller apple watch i'm thinking maybe around 40 millimeters there isn't any mention of two different sizes like a small and a large i think it would make sense but they didn't say but basically that's all we really know know about the new pixel watch again this is something that we're gonna get way more details on when it actually does get fully unveiled in october whenever their event is but there are a bunch of things that i'm also hoping for like i'm hoping it has a bright efficient crispy oled display you know this ui they're showing has a lot of black and the black bezel clearly goes all the way around so i'm hoping that it's an oled so it can sort of seamlessly blend into the bezel instead of being really obvious and ugly like a cheaper lcd i'm also of course hoping for good battery life at least a full day and if it's going to be a premium price i'm also hoping it has things like good haptics and good performance these animations of the ui showing smart home controls and checking notifications like it's cool but again i definitely want to play with it myself one thing to note though is this is basically going to act like a fitbit like it seems like most of the the fitness tracking and sleep tracking and stuff like that you need the fitbit app to work for so it's going to act just like a fitbit in that way and then wear os is going to work the way you typically expect it to paired with an android phone and then they've said there will be a cellular option so the watch can work without the phone and it'll do activity and sleep tracking and stuff like that through fitbit and also it appears this will just be working specifically with android phones probably best with the pixel but with android phones and not the iphone because in classic apple fashion lots of the stuff that the apple watch can do no other smartwatch has access to so this this is very much an android smartwatch so yeah stay tuned for more details on that later but yeah then last but not least this was the announcement we got basically zero information on but google did officially say that they're going to be dropping a pixel tablet in 2023 that's what they've told us that's kind of all we know like we don't know any of the specs we don't know what time of year it'll come out we don't know what it'll even really be called technically we do know it will be on the larger side and on the premium side so i'm thinking like ipad air to ipad pro type price range and equivalent but it feels like they're not really committing to anything else yet as far as a tablet goes i guess visually basically we just have this shot of the pixel portfolio where we can see that there is a tablet and it'll definitely have a camera and speakers and presumably a screen on the other side but yeah that's it it's really interesting that they're deciding to show off some of this stuff so early it kind of reminds me on one hand of sony who will announce a phone early in the year and then six months later it'll finally come out and all the hype is gone and everybody forgot about it but on the other hand this is google we're talking about and they've always been leaking things constantly i mean they try to get ahead of the leaks this feels like them just going hey you know what instead of the phone leaking for the next six months we'll just tell people about it and take advantage of that because otherwise you just lose the hype and your own messaging so yeah let me know what you think is the most exciting or what you're looking forward to the most of this new google stuff i'm definitely interested in in the watch actually i want to see what that's like on the wrist and to actually use but let me know in the comments section below we'll talk about it but yeah that's been it thanks for watching also random shout out but the ipod was officially discontinued this week probably one of the products everyone watching this video has at some point owned some version of so rip press f and in the chat to pay respects all right catch you guys the next one peace
