so I've been using the huawei mate 20 pro as my main phone for just over a week now and there's a lot of cool stuff here you've got the in display fingerprint scanner you've got a speaker built behind the USBC port you've got that Twilight gradient you don't get that on many phones but that's all kind of on the surface stuff and now having used it for a little longer there are 10 things that are particularly surprised me or impress me so let's get into that number one is easy projection a feature that is now built into emui 9 and to be honest it's a bit of an understatement with literally three taps you can wirelessly mirror your phone's display onto your TV or what I think is even cooler create an Android desktop where you could pull up Netflix YouTube or just browse photos in most cases to do something like this you'd either need a dedicated phone station a cable or at least a wireless HDMI adapter but not with this phone number two is the frame so I've actually been using the Galaxy Note 9 for quite a few months before I switched over to this phone and I've been surprised at how compact it feels it's not mini but compared to that phone the display is similar in size yet the body is smaller in every dimension and lighter number three is speed and to be honest Android has been pretty fast for a while now with smooth animations and silky scrolling but what I switched over to the mate 20 Pro there's a certain instantaneousness that you get used to especially with first party apps and a lot of other Android devices that previously seemed fine now start to seem a little sluggish magazine unlock every time you unlock the phone you have a different wallpaper and the phone pulls them from a whole bunch of different sources but they are consistently high quality it's a really simple way of keeping a phone feeling fresh and if you have a particularly like a wallpaper you just swipe it from the bottom and lock it until you fancy a change again number five is the ultra wide camera and I've never used a phone with an ultra wide lens as my main device before but even after such a short period of time I can safely say that it's not a gimmick because it's genuinely useful I couldn't say now that ultra white is how I'm going to shoot my street view shots tall buildings and pretty much every landmark I see on holiday but it's also useful in an everyday situation if I wanted to show you guys my room set up this ultra-wide will capture it much better than the camera gear I use for filming videos leading on from this is the camera modes of a sense while we partnered with liker they've really changed things and this time around especially in terms of flexibility something I've been really enjoying is finding myself in a new situation and then finding a camera mode that does it justice for example finding a really peaceful quiet setting and getting some native 21 to 9 cinematic video of it or something I found really cool is this splash collar mode where you tap on a color in a shot and only this is highlighted making the rest of the image monochrome number 7 is something called a block say you have an application that you want to stay logged in for for convenience but at the same time is important to protect well up lock lets you lock that app so for me when someone taps on Instagram it'll only open the app if it detects either my face or my fingerprint and it's not really an inconvenience because you're looking at a screen anyway so you barely notice the face scan happening Wireless reverse charging and you've probably heard about this before it's one of the flagship features of the phone and basically it makes you a hero in any group situation and in some cases has made me more comfortable leaving the house without a power bank because I know that if one device runs out I stole Gotham 820 Pro as a backup number 9 is charging speed and in terms of milliamp hours per minute this is pretty much the fastest charging phone on the planet if you've seen my battery charging test that might reinforce just how fast it is we're talking like a 60% charge in 30 minutes time and then in fact to render 60% on this battery is enough for a pretty heavy day and that leads me on to the last thing which is battery life which has surprised me because I was already expecting it to be good but as it turns out it is completely nuts a combination of the four thousand two hundred million power capacity the latest Android Pi a more efficient seven nanometer chip and the optimizations in m√πi 9 give it more endurance than I've ever had on a phone I regularly go to bed with the device still on at 40% charge in fact if you let it the device will even dynamically you change its resolution on the goat save even more battery but personally I just keep it locked at 1080p so yeah so far really enjoying the phone but as you can probably imagine it's gonna be a bit more time before it can get out a full review just because there is so much going on here in fact there's probably more to this device than any other phone I've ever used in the past front and back anyway guys thank you so much for watching I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
