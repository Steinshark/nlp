hello welcome to broke versus pro where today we're building the ultimate laptop gaming setups oh yeah we are cuz I have a present from the sponsor today's video LG with their new 17-inch LG gram wait wait wait wait when you say gaming laptops the first thing that comes to your mind is the LG gram well it wasn't the first thing that came to mind but they were certainly the first message in my inbox that offered money for this set up let me just say that the 17-inch LG gram is wonderful not only because it's super light and very thin but also this is the 2020 17 inch gram so it has the 10th gen core i7 which most importantly has a Thunderbolt port Thunderbolt 3 port which will come in handy for this thing oh that we did a video on that yes 28 gaming box yes it is of course I don't have to rely on the 20 80 TI gaming box to use the gram on a daily basis this thing again is super light and portable and the battery lasts forever for most tasks actually the battery life is really good it's an 80 watt hour battery that lasts up to 17 hours it's legitimately a really really cool laptop to take on the go when you're spending all this money on your laptop and your accessories and all the other stuff which I'm sure you have around the corner here I is the broke gamer have something much more reasonable in mind this is my Denis and only 330 dollars this is all I need wait look this is all I need I literally don't need any of the stuff that you LG the sponsor of this video said we can't show any other brands but that's my laptop well so am I gonna use I mean I need a laptop are you serious reading huh yeah I think your team is a little too far aren't you know don't worry about that don't worry about that what the processor I can't talk about my processor don't don't ruin I didn't sabotage you wait I can't even say the word boo no you can't read team rank I say that yeah yeah yeah sure what kind of challenge is this look I don't write the checks I'm just saying cache them yeah so I do have one additional thing so while my budget was broke I did get a knock off third party power a controller it's not knockoff I guess but it's a tiny third party Xbox controller I had $15 left in my budget but it's fine it is very green is this little where's the rest of your stuff I knew you have like you had like boxes and stuff you're bringing in earlier yeah so what pro setup would it be without some Razer products specifically I saw this on Twitter the other day so I put in an order for it it is the Kraken kiddie Edition razor head said yeah I just started playing Final Fantasy 14 so I got myself an MMO Mouse how much money did was you know I can't be met you cuz you're spending LG's money not mine wait I also got a razor speaker the monitor was a bit of an oversight but you forgot to get a monitor we just so happen to have a former sponsor of the channel another LG branded product called the lg ultra what is this ultra kick you want right yeah it is ultra gear huh ken where are your and where's your integrity where are your journalistic ethics I'm not a journalist you're just a pro gamer I'm a pro spender so what do you got so with my come up with a code name for it my my stealth book okay look it's not great but for 300 bucks I've got eight gigs of RAM and on top of that I'm happy to tell you that this wonderful laptop from the stealth book company which is also known as hood has hey keep talking cause he can't come you out it also has a spill-proof keyboard if you're hard quitting me it has a spill-proof keyboard I will say that there was a slight oversight when I was building my setup and then I spent the last of my money on this controller and then we decided that we're playing cs:go so uh yeah look very far Oh it'll be fine this is really awesome are you like I love that just tell me some bathwater or something maybe I am that side hustle though gamer boy bathwater oh yeah I love that yes so much so I also got the Companions stand as well of course you did of course I got a color match right oh look at that it has all of the buttons I need Wow many buttons we have the games you play to need that many buttons so I remember you saying something earlier about your keyboard be like waterproof the Frazee's with spill-proof so I can spill any man you can't touch my setup what happens if it dies that's so you might have noticed that I have you are not gonna do this hair you're not look look you can't just do it you got to surprise me with it you can't just like look where the narrative steaks can we all know you lack narrative steaks you can't just pour cook on my my laptop you gotta like while I'm working on your stuff yes Nikki let's Nikoli do it or something this is not entertaining look think about what make a good video don't just do it right now I'm not saying this because I'm panic that you're about to kill my laptop because I don't have a back-up plan put that away bring that out later it'll be a hilarious mo in the video and everyone be like haha ken is so funny okay what are these speakers um that is a good question what do you need speakers when you have a headset um I like options expensive options oh look at that looks like a hair dryer what kind of hair dryer do you use liquid eye someone how do you even get this that seems like a lot of work right there ladies test your hair it's actually not a lot of work I just kind of wake up go and take a shower and they dry every year excuse me every quarter my hair goes really fast it is going there might be one too many things in myself don't play well together so I think there's some weird handshake going on with the i/o on the e GPU side because initially USB was freaking out so like I was getting weird inputs from my mouse like the eg if you would like constantly cut in and out so I'm trying to chase the problem and we're kind of on a time limit I think as much as I hate to admit it I will probably just use the headset use the mouse know and the GPU it's the only thing you're not using are the speakers there's a lot of things happening right now so there's you got it you got it you got it just just stick with wait wait are you are you know I'm just no really make no your self is fine okay son what do you go King no no there's us beat me we're doing it so plugged in what's wrong with you oh it's pouring on the power cable to test my speakers so I wanted to test your keyboard where's paper towels if my laptops dead at the end of the video you know exactly why I think I reacted fast enough and like dump it all out I mean you would react like a normal person person would react if a random stranger just came in and threw coke all over their laptop you're missing the part where I would beat your ass okay hopefully this will actually turn on now oh I see caps lock on screens happening there you go spill-proof keyboard off $300 laptop I'll say I'm pretty impressed yeah look great wait I think oh I don't know oh well it uh I have no mouse get all moisture off the screen oh oh oh it came back excellent that's good the the trackpad is working now so we're fine yeah definitely coke on my screen oh you can see as I wipe it it looks like it's doing it okay all right oh yeah look at that it just baked input it seems to be okay I'm just getting a lot of random inputs but as it dries out hopeful that goes like it stopped oh yeah yeah we're fine we're fine all right oh there's definitely definitely coke on the speakers that's great is there a power button or something I feel there is not that was my initial problem so they just don't do anything I think USB should show it you didn't hit you pressed the volume in and that turns them on wait it's a button  oh it's a button oh I thought it was just a knob thanks for the speakers Ken I love how your $300 setup became a $450 setup in like 10 seconds see that's the broke gamer way of life take advantage of the rich idiots in the world it's actually pretty accurate whoo let's go boys let's go so after some troubleshooting I finally got my setup mostly where I wanted to be so we got the chroma going on with the stand and the headphones themselves and again the headphone stand is a USB hub and I can plug it all in via one cable to the computer I was having some slight USB problems so I went from playing it into the box straight to the computer itself just no problem at all just a little it's more reliable dogs you have the ports on the grammar fine we run through Thunderbolt I've had issues where things get a little bit flaky yeah so now that I'm a working set up it's totally fine my speakers alright they're over on my set up look how nice that looks I mean look at that frame rate it is so smooth 100 Hertz action okay well it's a cursor let me let me move a window move a window look at that so smooth everyone's watching this video 24 frames and cannot see a difference at all you are very very right no I still think this is all really cool though because the fact that the 28 ETI all works with the Graham via Thunderbolt 3 is again a way to make this a gaming setup when I'm here at a desk when I want to go on the go I can very easily unplug everything and just take the ground with me it again it is very light ok ok we heard we heard the selling points we know the Graham is great why don't we see what it actually can do before you give you another 30 minute pitch on why you should buy an LG Graham well with its tension core i7 I'm sure it'll play video games fine so I am here in Final Fantasy 14 and I'm getting roughly 60 frames per second just by doing maximum on all the settings I can probably fine tune it and get something a little quicker to take advantage of this 144 Hertz display that is at 1440p but for what I have here I'm liking it this looks riveting I can't believe how amazing this gameplay is right now who is so exciting here let me actually go somewhere that actions happening at no I'd really like watching you walk around the city really shows off the pro set up nicely oh don't worry about it this one also for those of you that are asking why I am using the LG gram keyboard it is because LG probably thinks that that's a good idea are you sucking up to the sponsor now oh absolutely they're the ones paying for this video I mean it's working pretty well I will it the keyboard is actually not really doing too much for me if I actually had time I would set up the proper macros on this Mouse but otherwise I'm digging this so now might be a good time to mention that I have not actually tested this game running on my setup however black mesa has finally been properly released oh look at this oh Jesus come on the mic good okay those speakers are good 74 85 frames per second look how excellent my performance is on this game which definitely came out this year and is in no way based on something that's like as old as most of our viewers mm-hmm look how smooth it is wait a minute no I'll just show you what it looks like to play g-force now did stadia not cut you big enough check or [Laughter] analogy force now but also stadia you know very unbiased there's no nuts all too well the audience definitely lets us know that's for sure like us smoothness is texture really smooth look it's a solid lock 60 sorry I'm wah what that's okay I mean I'm telling you right like with g-force now with streaming services it's a perfect example of why you should use low end hardware right if this is the only laptop and the only power that I've got it's a perfectly reasonable way of playing some games I spawn out but you know what this is not important because while yes I've given you a small taste of the kind of performance the rob power you can get from a broke setup the real test is who is better is it me with my broke gaming setup or is it mr. Ken bolito with his pro setup let's find out also it's raining very heavily do you hear that I feel like as I was getting into my like my passionate like explanation of gaming the heavens opened up and made me sound more dramatic it's um Thunder now I think that's just a job crying all right team deathmatch does two first how many kills I think just whoever wins whoever wins all right whoever wins and gets the most kills wait no no those are two different things who gets the most kills sure I have two options here I can either use my xbox controller which does technically work or I can use my keyboard my trackpad oh this is the worst oh so bad dude this is so bad no I'm never using I'm using controller okay that's an easy choice oh that's Austin hey this is not good I'm getting destroyed right now there we go Oh killed Austin word I can't do anything all right okay I feel a little bad please give me a mouse no that's too nice so don't show the bottom of it but this actually goes with your laptop it is it is branded look I'll take anything get the playing with the I feel like I've tried this in the past but it is so bad oh yeah I think it's very clear the game wasn't met never ever was it meant to be play like that oh okay let's start again let's look that was practice around let's do this time for real now that I have mouths and I have to use a controller and let's see who can win who between you and me okay for the record I got 15 kills that round I think I got three you can do to get three yeah why - oh that was Austin yeah I get Jeff good job we're in here are you though yeah are you really in here aren't you there we go ah nicely done you got it yeah look my my laptop screen does not look good from literally almost any angle you have to accept that but it's fine as long as you're looking at directly head-on it's fine if you go directly over my head there yeah yeah sure here I'll duck down so you can see my beautiful viewing angles one time got you Oh Austin Evans just killed you with a broke setup there we go well I came back and killed you too so we're all good right beside where you Carolina sponsor everywhere oh boy oh that's not good he's gonna turn around isn't he no trying to get me in the back or something I know hello headshot that you not like that that was me oh what's up there you got Austin I said I said uh nicely done guys I'll just call you this is games not over yet one that was Austin Oh 13 seconds come on come on come on I gotta catch up I gotta catch up jump in 13 seconds I'm over by like 10 kills all right so what do we learn today we've learned that while broke gamers can truly rise up in many situations this is not one of them if you'd like to see a real wedding set up you can check out the link in the description for the LG Graham until next time I'm going to go get a better setup Thank You LG for sponsoring this video and for again sponsoring a winner
