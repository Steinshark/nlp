coming from a cinematography background I have a weird relationship to audio as a documentary filmmaker on one hand as much as it hurts to say I recognize that audio is probably more important to telling a documentary story than video is but on the other hand it just adds an extra layer of complexity to a job that's already complicated enough the easy solution is just to hire a sound person and if you have a budget of any kind sound recordist is probably the first person I'd hire right after a DP but for a lot of Indie projects especially personal projects there is just no way I can pay a professional's day rate out of my own pocket I'm guessing a lot of you don't have the budget either so what can we do when we're working with small teams in limited budgets but still need really good sound to form the backbone of the story that's exactly what we're going to get into in today's video I'm going to cover the setups I'd use for covering a shoot with only one character shoots with multiple characters how to keep multiple cameras in sync at the same time and at the end I'll talk about the new system I used while shooting a feature documentary this Summer that saved my life on normal wireless mics work audio can be tricky but it's not rocket science and if you do it well it can be your most powerful storytelling tool let's get into it hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is Luke Forsyth and on this channel I teach the skills and tricks I've learned over 10 years of working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to hit the Subscribe button because I've got new videos coming out every week talking about sound isn't always as fun as talking about new cameras or lenses or drones or whatever but I can't stress enough how important sound is to your documentary with good sound you can cover up edit points and all sorts of flaws in the camera work but with bad sound you're really going to suffer in post so right off the bat I want to say that when you're just getting started in documentary filmmaking there are a few pieces of audio gear that you'd want to bring into your kit right away like I'm talking about right after you get the camera and lens before you get a drone before you get a gimbal before you get any of the fun fancy toys almost as though they were part of the kit to begin with [Music] the first one of those is the best shotgun mic you can afford a shotgun mic basically just means that the sound is being recorded directionally and not omnidirectionally basically that it records a kind of cone of sound in the direction it's pointing instead of everything in 360 Degrees that means assuming you mount it to your camera pointing forward you should get decent sound of whatever the camera is looking at the better the shotgun the more likely you are to pick things up at a distance the better it's going to be at blocking out sound coming from behind or off to the side of your frame it might seem obvious but without good sound of whatever is in front of the lens it's going to be pretty hard to tell a story no matter how nice your framing is if you don't know the sound person the shotgun mic which is sometimes also called the top mic is going to be recording almost a hundred percent of the ambient audio for your story so while you can get a cheap shotgun for under 100 bucks that might be tempting I think this is one place where you're probably going to want to spend money straight away I'm not saying get a two thousand dollar Chef's mic for your first camera but if you're working with a limited budget consider spending Less on other accessories and more on your mic rather than buy all Sony G Master lenses maybe get Sigma art lenses instead and sync the savings into a better mic or maybe even skip that gimbal that you've had in your Amazon card for ages a good shotgun is going to last you across multiple camera systems and the technology doesn't go out of date every few years like cameras do so get the best one possible early and you'll keep it for a very long time for a budget mic my first mic was a rode videomic Pro which is still a pretty decent mic for mirrorless cameras it may be a good place to start though I've heard really really good things about the Sennheiser MKE 400 and it's even a bit cheaper I think for a lower mid-range Mike maybe look at this one which is the Sennheiser MKE 600 and for a higher end mid-range mic maybe the rode ntg3 getting towards the high end is something like the Sennheiser 416 which is used all over the professional industry and what I'm recording on today and it's just under a thousand dollars the cream of the crop of dock mics in my opinion is the chef's cmit series but I think it's over 2500 bucks gives you insane sound quality in this tiny little compact package though for most people though including me right now the ships isn't very realistic so don't worry if it sounds like an insane price for a mic you don't have to buy the most expensive mic in the world right away but you do need to get the best one you possibly can the point is that the top mic shouldn't be seen as some sort of optional accessory you need to budget for a decent one in the overall cost of your new camera shooting a dock with the built-in mics is not a great idea in my opinion so keep that in mind I'll link to all the different mics I've just mentioned in the description below in order of the cost once the top mic is taken care of you'll probably want to get a wireless lav mic next to make sure you can get audio on the main characters in your movie even if they're not facing you or if they're in another room if you haven't used a set of labs before they're basically a system where you plug a microphone into a transmitter that you put on the character and then there's a receiver that plugs into the back of your camera so you can hear the character's voice as though they were standing right beside you even if they're inside a car with a door shut or really far away from you a good set of lives like these Sennheiser g3s that I've been using since 2014 I think are gonna last you ages and never go out of date if you want to spice them up even more replace the microphone that comes with it with something like the sanken COS 11d which is going to dramatically boost your sound quality the good shotgun and lav combination you're going to be able to cover a single character story with good sound and I included both of these things in the video I made about the only five things a documentary filmmaker really needs to get started I'll link to that somewhere up here in my opinion if your story involves a main character you'll need both a shotgun and a lav to get decent sound which is where things start to get a little complicated if you're using a mirrorless camera with only a single 3.5 millimeter audio jack if that's your situation right now you're probably going to need to look into something like an external recorder like one of the zoom H series or maybe a mixer that you screw into the bottom of your camera like something like the mix pre it's obviously not ideal to have a separate recorder to have a big bulky mixer on your camera but without a shotgun and lav running at the same time it can be really really hard to follow someone around and tell their story that's why I got so excited about the Sony fx3 and now the fx30 it's not because of the crazy ISO or dynamic range or the Glamorous Tech inside just because it had two audio XLR ports in the top handle which meant I could finally use a camera with the form factor of a mirrorless while still running a professional audio setup now once you have these Basics dialed in one piece of advice that I can't stress enough is that you need to get a good pair of headphones and listen while you shoot to make sure the levels are good there is nothing worse than getting back from a shoot and downloading the footage only to realize that your lav mic was clipping all day because the volume was too high or that the shotgun wasn't loud enough so you can barely hear the Ambient sound they can be any kind of headphones really just make sure that since you're spending so much time and money on recording gear that you're actually monitoring what they're getting in real time I actually made another video that included this in a list of audio mistakes to avoid as a new filmmaker and I'll link to that up there somewhere too okay so that's a solid foundation and once you've got a shotgun and a set of lavs and some headphones to monitor it all you're good to go for following a single character in your story but what happens if you have more than one main character this is where things start to get a little more tricky some companies like Sony make Wireless sets that have two channels built in and run through the hot shoe on your camera and people I know who use them seem to like them a lot I'll link to them in the description as well but it's probably the simplest solution to getting two people miked up at the same time through just one camera without any additional accessories if you can afford it it might be a good idea just to go with something like this right off the bat instead of going with one channel sennheisers but the drawback is that it's pretty expensive up front I think it's over 1200 bucks for the whole package and you need to run it through the camera's hot shoe which means you can't replace the camera's top handle with something more rugged you can swing it though a set of lads like the Sony's will be super useful in situations where you've got two people interacting each other or having a conversation and you want to have good sound from both regardless of who your camera is pointed at when it starts to get really complicated is when you either need to keep track of more than two characters or if it's impractical to use Wireless Systems like maybe if your characters are really far away from you or if there's Wireless interference around I've run into both of these situations in different ways so it's not as uncommon as you might think this summer while I was directing my first feature doc we were in an environment where a lot of our main characters were wearing radio chest harnesses and somehow they were interfering with the audio coming through my laps every few seconds a burst of static would just shoot through the channel and it made the audio totally unusable a little over a year ago I went to Northern Mexico to film a Red Bull rock climbing Expedition and for that the main characters were scaling a big wall that took five days to get up so there was no way the cameras could be close enough all the time for a wireless system to be reliable that's where recorders come in [Music] internally recording live mics have been around for a while and I think they were first made mainstream in the professional World by a company called zaxcomp as far as I know anyways basically instead of sending a wireless signal back to your camera where the camera records it onto an audio track these recorders have a SD slot in them and they record everything internally that means you can get one of these packs on your subjects let it run all day and be sure you're not missing anything a system like this is really really handy in a bunch of ways but it also has some drawbacks that I'll get into in a minute the most obvious way the recorder packs can help out small teams is the fact that they're just set and forget systems that don't require much work once they're up and running you can literally just throw one of these into pockets of as many people as you think you might want audio for and then forget about them for most of the day the ones that I'm using are from a company called tentacle and the packs record up for 10 hours I think on a single battery so when I was filming my feature I got four of them and I just put them on anyone I think might possibly talk in a scene you can scale this up as much as you wanted and theoretically have an limited amount of people might at the same time that once you start getting more than four to five people talking at once I'm not really sure you'd want to cover that on a single camera anyways these things really were huge Lifesavers for me because like I said there was Wireless interference everywhere on that shoot and I regularly needed to have two or more people mic'd up at once just turn on the recorder make sure there's face on the SD card and let them roll all day if you want beyond just opening up possibilities for having a lot of people miked up at once another huge advantage of these packs is that you don't have to be rolling on the camera to get the sound imagine that you're sitting around with a few characters who haven't been doing much for a while so maybe you put the camera down for a minute then all of a sudden they launch into a conversation or make some random throwaway comment that is perfect for your story and with normal lav mics you'd only get the sound when the camera is on and recording which means you'd be out of luck with internally recording packs like these you can miss the start of a sentence and still capture the audio then use b-roll or a wide shot with the audio in the background and still come a good scene it's like a buffer on your reflexive and there are more than one conversations that I would have missed this summer without Labs that were running all the time you can also use these things to cover big rooms or spaces with a single camera by hiding them somewhere in an area where you think you might want sound and then just having them record even when the camera isn't nearby or even turned on like imagine you're covering a 20-person dinner for example you can't possibly hope to be in the right place every time something interesting is being said by having these mics taped to overhead lights or hidden in the flowers or something you'll have constant sound from the whole space as far as an easy way to get sound as a single operator I think these things are probably at the top but like I said it's not perfect and the biggest problem is that unless you get some really expensive ones you can't record and monitor the sound at the same time this means that you can't hear what people are saying through headphones behind closed doors you'll have no way of knowing if the audio levels are set right luckily most of these systems like the tentacles here have a 32-bit flow which means there's a ton of room for volume changes so really no matter how quietly someone is talking or how loudly they're yelling you should have good sound but the monitoring thing is a real problem and there's no way to get around it without buying really expensive gear that can record and transmit at the same time if it weren't for the fact that you can't monitor the sound live which can be really useful for knowing what people are saying when they're not in the same room as you I'd pretty much say these are the perfect situation for small teams but only you're going to know if that's a deal breaker for you or not obviously it wasn't a deal breaker for me and the benefits of being able to capture so many people mic'd up at once without worrying about them clipping is well worth it in my opinion beware though if you invest in a system like this you're gonna need some way to sync the recorded tracks to your camera after and unless you want to drive yourself insane by manually syncing it with audio weighing forms in post that probably means you're going to need some sort of time Code system timecode is basically an internal clock that's dialed into the exact frame rate you're shooting which you then feed to all your audio recorders and whatever cameras are recording that means everything is really easy to sync up in post because all the internal times are exactly the same down to the millisecond it's a really simple concept but making it all work can be a bit confusing first of all you're going to need a Time code generator to act as the Master Clock and you'll Jam everything from that to make sure it's consistent I also use time code generators from tentacle and they attach to the back of the camera with these little velcro hook and Loops the battery in them lasts about 40 hours or so so it's never going to die in the middle of a shoot and as I turn on each of the quarter packs I basically just Jam them to the same clock so that they're all synced professional cameras like the fx9 and even the fx6 and now the fx3 with the new dongle Sony released can all accept time code by plugging a generator straight into the camera but without a Time code import like on a Sony A7 or Canon r or GH whatever it's a little harder luckily timecode can also be recorded by the cameras and audio signal so with 3.5 millimeter plug attachment like this I can feed time code to a mirrorless camera through the mic Port audio time code sounds terrible it's like a screeching dying digital cat and you do not want to listen to it if you can avoid it but it will keep your camera and your recorders running on the same time just make sure to mute that track when you play back to footage or you're going to lose your mind once all the devices are running off the same time code you just need to use the software of your choice to sync them all up and you should have all your different audio tracks and video lined up and ready to edit the tentacles come with free software that works really well and integrates with all the editing programs out there so it's not bad even if you're doing the editing yourself final warning though if you record a ton of external sources without timecode your post-production self is gonna hate you I hey yeah okay so there it is sound gear for small teams that will cover you in a bunch of different situations a good shotgun with the single lav set will be enough for all Single Character shooting and that's probably all you need for your first few years of your career then you can think about upgrading to a two-channel system like Sony Max or if you think you might need even more voices than that or if your characters are going to be in places where Wireless transmission doesn't make sense start adding recorders like the tentacle track ease I'll link to everything I mentioned here in the description but if I didn't mention something that you really like yourself let me know down in the comments not many filmmakers really enjoy dealing with audio but trust me you need it as much if not more than your video if you want to tell a good story the best case scenario is still to hire professional sound recordist but for those other times when the crew is small these systems are going to get you most of the way there on your own that's it for today I hope it gave you some ideas on how to level up your sound game without hiring extra crew if it did help think about giving the channel a like or subscribing to the channel because it really does help and if you did like that one maybe try check out this other video I made on the five audio mistakes you should avoid as a new filmmaker see ya [Music]
