here we go uh doing it live today um this saw lightning talks um let me quickly start with the conference uh we will be hybrid this year we have on-site attendees have access to the online part the main track will be streamed to online we will have an online track but i also plan to have a pre-recorded track so if you don't want to speak like or can't speak life um then that is also an option also it's gonna be like probably a very good option to get on to the speaking rosters this year um and of course yeah so already set uh submit until june 12th but submit early as you can edit your submission and uh when when you're through the submission process you probably you know want to change things and that's a good option to submit early then um [Music] which brings me to tonight tonight this lightning talks um so the goal is like five to ten minutes but if the speaker goes over time i'm not gonna intervene i just you know want people to finish their talks rather than being stopped because they're running over time we have nine speakers and probably need around 90 minutes and that brings me to tonight's speakers there has been a last minute change as andre alexandrescu will have to get his kids from school in about an hour so i will put him just in front of my own talk so that we make sure that you know he is speaking in a time frame that he still can get his kids and um not under too much pressure there and um so you'll see first tina then we have involved hendrick must have uh oh no wait no then andre then myself claire chandler patricia and kate and with that let's get started um let me bring tina online so and you're ready to go okay um welcome everyone um when you talk about giving conference talks to other people most people say that they don't have anything to talk about and i said the same in the past as well and now i have given several talks already i still consider myself a beginner speaker but i realized that i do have something to talk about and in this talk i'm going to share some possible talk ideas and i hope you will get inspired so first ask yourself what do you do what do you do at work what is your daily job how do you work which technologies are you using which ones are you writing or expanding me very easily fall into the thinking that we don't do anything interesting or that everyone already knows what we know but that's not true i can guarantee that you have a unique knowledge in lots of different areas and talking about it will benefit others the same applies to any project like private projects you're working on or open source projects like anything you're working on or using or think about which questions problems or challenges have you or someone in your team encountered there's a high probability that many people have the same questions are and are in need of getting them answered so why not turn those discussions and solutions into conference talks so next maybe ask yourself what do you want to learn more about have you ever read an article or watched a conference talk but you wanted to learn more about the subject giving a talk is the perfect opportunity for you to get the topic to get to know the topic in depth you will always learn a lot in the process of writing a talk way more than just using some library feature or maybe you learned about some interesting concept or language feature and you want to figure out how you can use it in your code i always love to learn about real life examples of the new features so that's why i personally also like to give talks that are more practice oriented but don't think you need to be cutting edge to be giving a talk the basics are very underrepresented at conferences and most people don't use the new standards right away anyways so consider talking about the basics and as i said not everyone has this knowledge and many people will benefit from it and tell us what excites you um do you like the theory over examples then do a talk about theory do you like examples and life coding um more than theory then do that um do you want a discussion rather than a one-hour monologue that's also fine um a talk you're excited about will always be better than a talk that you don't care about and there is an audience for every style of talk also you can play around with those elements and find out what presentation style you prefer it doesn't have to be perfect in the beginning in fact you shouldn't strive for perfection at all just give it your best and everything will be fine and this i think is very important talk about your ideas i can't tell you how often i had an idea and i talked myself out of it it's only once i started talking about my ideas that i got some great feedback and encouragement others might also have a different viewpoint you can include in your talk or they might know if there's already something similar out there so talk about your ideas and gather some feedback and don't chalk yourself out of it and lastly relax speaking might look intimidating and speakers might look like they know everything but they are just normal people like you and me speaking is a skill and you learn and improve by doing it so here's a summary of everything i just said i hope you find something useful in it and you can take a screenshot here at this point if you want to so just to summarize what are you working on which libraries are you using or writing which open source project are you using or working on which questions problems or challenges have you or someone in your team encountered consider talking about the basics don't assume everyone knows what you know talk about the things that you are excited about take your time to find your presentation style talk about your ideas and get some feedback and in the end relax and have fun so all i can say is you can do it try it out you might like it and i'm looking forward to see a lot of new speakers thank you yeah thank you tina um and next is invalidi let's quickly bring her online thank you thank you tina for the great talk it's actually made me feel more confident since i'm also feeling i'm relatively new in giving talks and and yes this is always uh stressful and exciting and fun so my talk is i think maybe the next step after you pick the topic and this is something that i learned from my experience which is not very broad but still i have some of it so i think it's very important to be able to uh distilling your message in the talk so let me let me explain so let's say i want to explain to you about a vector and please excuse my very simple example so this code is actually coming from a website explaining about stood vector but as you can see this code is not fitting for the slide you can't give a talk about vector fill in the slide like that so for example the creation of the vector we could basically use initialization list the part of printing you could use a print function and have a comment explain your intention here for the pushback you can do the same notice the comment again and for the pop-up back etc etc so what i'm trying to say in short is that visualization is very important when you try to express an idea on a presentation another example let's say i want to explain the vector more deeply i could use images i could also show just with a simple image what happens when i add an element so please excuse my very very simple and not not well designed photos but i hope you get the idea here so i want to talk about data visualization um generally in a world people don't have a lot of um enough time to capture a lot of uh complex ideas and but when they do come to your talk that means that they're actually very anxious to learn so i think giving them good uh explanation visual uh visualized explanations would be very helpful and help them get more connected with the ideas you're trying to express so here on the right you can see it's a meta picture it's a picture talks about a good visualization and this is actually coming from a very cool book called information is beautiful so there's two of them as far as i know and i would highly recommend them i'm not connected to the author in any way but those are really awesome books one is called information is beautiful the second is knowledge is beautiful and in general they talk about how do you express information in a visual way so i think what i'm trying to say is create an experience for your audience also communicate with them and most important care about your audience you want to have them enjoy your talk so to summarize i would say that creating a good talk will include having a good structure usually visualization and minimization in your talk get some perspectives uh have other people that known know this topic see your talk give you feedback and even just you know have have more broad perspective of the topics that you have decide what are the takeaways that you want your audience to to take from your talk and of course what tina have said and i think is very important present your own views the talk would not be great unless you put what you feel that is important and what you want to express and also just make sure you bring all the equipment you need this is very important because it's never fun to find out too late but to summarize a good talk is about what you bring thank you and of course i just want to say if you want to reach out i i will be happy to help with talks and presentations thank you thank you that was very good very nice um so let's see what hendrick has to say hi everybody hi everybody my name is hendrick and today i want to talk about doing research for talks today and also some other huge useful tools which can help you along the way to your presentation so my my point here is you already have a topic you want to talk about and we already learned from tina about how to get to a topic and this is a complicated task on its own but now you have your idea and you need to do some research on it to to get the ideas of the stuff you want to talk about it's more fleshed out and of course there's a lot of resources where you can look at for for doing your talk there's a lot of books blogs and articles on cpr plus out there there's cpp reference there's a lot of other talks and written material and of course you can go through off through all of that and this makes totally sense to go through a lot of material but what my takeaway here is it is impossible to remember what is written where without note taking and writing stuff down and if you don't do that you might get confused along the way and i want to share a little bit about the system i use for that for note-taking and knowledge management because usually if you don't have a system you have something like this desk on the right here and this could be a picture of my desk in the past yeah so i like to have lots of paper lying around with stuff written on it and since doing research means reading a lot of things and taking notes this can happen pretty fast but i think notes on their own have less value if they are not organized or connected so you will never find the things you are looking for in which you need right now at the moment to for example work on a certain slide and you can easily lose yourself in unorganized nodes and there are several systems for knowledge management and today i want to talk about one of them which is called a zettel custom settle custom which is a slip box and it's a method for organizing notes and the idea is that you have notes which are short and contain mostly a single piece of information and the value from this notes comes from tags like on on twitter with the hashtag and hyperlinks between these notes and with that you can organize and interconnect your knowledge and usual people have also folders like for example you have literature notes where you have a short summary of of the piece of literature like a book or a chapter or a blog post which then contains hyperlinks to notes which contain the actual knowledge from the literature um these are then the knowledge based notes where they contain then mostly one piece of information or knowledge and again hyperlinks to each other or to literature notes and something like fleeting notes where we have short-lived temporal notes with like you can write down what you need to do or where to look for new stuff to research and this stuff might be reworked or deleted later and you see here on the right hand side an analogous version of that but we have more in the digital world and i really like software which is called obsidian which is a note taking software based on markdown and it supports this settle custom method but also other methods and as well you can download it for free it has a graph view for showing you all the links it has templates and a lot of plugins and maybe i just show you a little bit how that can look like so here you might see this for example this system of notes i do from for the stuff from my personal stuff which contains a lot of different stuff about linux programming languages kubernetes and you have all these interconnections here and you have notes with markdown syntax where you can put up text and code and links and tags and all of that and for me this is a really cool system to to organize knowledge it also supports uh cps plus code yeah because markdown supports the plus plus code so here i did a little example of how something could look like if you're doing research for sdps plus talk you have literature from cppreference.org which then has links to an actual note containing the knowledge about for example concepts or enable if and this is a really cool system to organize your knowledge yeah and if you're interested in doing that here are a lot of resources for the settle custom method which the first one is a youtube video which introduced me to the system and the others are more like if you're into reading yeah and now i will talk about uh like one or two minutes about other tools i like because uh writing slides can be hard as well so these are things i really really enjoy so i'm not a english native speaker so i really love the title capitalization tool so you can put up text here and it will capitalize it to the right way for english so yeah both i slide and this is from me a life saver because i don't know capitalization words in english and also other stuff you have for highlighting code there's a slight slight coat highlighter where you can get nice highlights or with carbon you can get images we have some sites for getting free image resources which is also pretty cool and if you're doing talk which also contains mods there are online lattes editors and you can use might will put up the slides after the event so you can have a look there for these tools and yeah last but not least if you're already using markdown or your notes you can do also your slides and markdown if you're interested in that because markdown supports syntax highlighting and equations and one framework which i really like is called map and if you want to do something like that visual studio super visual studio code supports that and you can write really nice slides and markdown just by using markdown with a few additions and can get something like these things here on the right with a nice theme a footer a header some syntax highlighting for c plus some math and the typical lists you need for bringing down for your items and yeah and this is the end of my tool heavy lightning talk and i hope maybe some things of this can be useful for you for doing research and then materializing this research into some nice slides thank you thank you [Music] hendrick that's really great um i gotta look at some of those styles and tools but next isn't me but andrei and let me bring andre up that we can start with this talk go andre thanks and sorry for jumping the line a bit um to you and claire so um i just wanted to share a few uh things that a couple of people in this uh you know among the other speakers have done already and have i'm very happy to uh to be after after them in particular like hendrick did a great job about how to prepare a good talk i'm going to give you advice on how to not prepare not to insist on the slides too much because they are only 20 of the talk most of your talk should be the delivery consider this yeah i haven't been at the long long concert the the great rendering of apacionata but i have the sheet music so i'm okay you shouldn't be okay with just the sheet music okay think your your slides are your sheet music or a play script it's the rendering that makes the difference right you shouldn't be you shouldn't not go to a concert on account that you have the sheet music okay or the broadway uh whatever right so don't forget us your slides are not the talk i am continuously baffled by folks who say oh i missed your talk can you send me the slides sure i'll send the slides like you know approximately nothing of the value of the the talk right so um don't forget that the slides are not the essence of your talk it's uh it's what you what you will contribute outside the slides so i'm going to talk a few things uh here real quick i don't have time to motivate everything that i've said for a long time that the most difficult talks to prepare the short talks which is uh paradoxical so on to uh the philosophy of tech talks there are two there are three uh levels of nirvana that i have identified um first competence and second confidence and show machine would be the third each has a long ramp leading up to it and each counts for a very big difference in your effectiveness as a speaker the competence is the one thing that you cannot fake in any way the rest you can uh so on on when you work on your competence focus on understanding your material uh when we talk about confidence focus on teaching and so much you focus on doing the performance part of the of your talk so the the competence you cannot buy still fake inherit you cannot there's no easy way to get knee and that's what makes you that that's what makes you you know be there in the pulpit or whatever on this on the on the stage make sure you have the competence no companies no talk i'm not i'm very i'm not kidding very serious if you can't if you don't have the competence decline they invite no matter how highly they think of you if you don't feel you have the competence you can't you can't do it study related work be able to defend in a claim in a court of law everything every single word you say be able to talk to someone whose life is that topic all right who sleeps eats and showers and you know everything is that one topic that you touch in in passing okay so you should be able to have a conversation with them be always one level about what you talk about don't forget that reputation is everything you have as a public speaker and that's how you build it with competence what you teach should be only so a small fraction of what you know never teach everything you can't teach everything you know you teach a little what you know and then the questions are going to take you to the other eighty percent of things that you know confidence don't confuse it with self-esteem of arrogance i'm sure every people in you know that every listener here has a good level of self-esteem and is not arrogant so that's not about confidence confidence is how you relate to others uh it's you must be convinced that you are in the right relationship with your audience which means what you say is right what you say is interesting what you say is worth saying and your right person to sit to stand in front of in this case sit by the way to stand in front of everybody and you know talk about it truly believe every single guardian work you say truly believe every once word you say if you don't believe it don't say it okay i noticed by the way there's also a matter of of energy if you wish uh people tend to fade out towards the end of the talk make sure the second half is better than the first half make sure the second half is as strong at least as your first half the best like the best like musical players the best actors the best whatever performance they're going to give it through the end with belief they're going to believe everything they do to the last second so um onto showmanship each performance performance must be unique you don't you shouldn't have one talk that you can if i'm giving my talk on x right no you oh my my memorable token that in oslo was about you know this stuff and it was great because i don't know i fell off the stage or whatever happened right so make sure you get into the character make sure you think visualize for weeks before mike tyson had a word he said for a month before a fight i could think of nothing but of hurting that guy right you shouldn't be there to hurt people but you definitely should be thinking for for a long time before the actual performance you should be thinking about you should visualize it you should get into the character of doing it um by the way like i have no idea i can't fathom how people like were doing chitchat just before this i could think of nothing i was drenching sweat i had to change my shirt i was drenching sweat for half an hour before this very 10 minutes talk which to you may be nothing but to me is like oh my god i gotta give a talk i gotta be there like totally 100 i gotta be there like in the moment right so the top must take something out of you if you're good for anything after the talk you're not doing it right you should be half dead after the talk if you if you're dead on the stage then that was almost good okay if you're done on the stage after that was almost almost good almost adequate okay so make sure you should you can't do like uh golly you can't do it like glibly can say yeah i give my talk and then i kind of i don't know i scratched my my button and then i was fine and no nothing happened no i gave my talk and then i was like dead then and i was like i lied on the floor i had no idea what was going on for like two days after okay strategy make sure you prepare material again competence define a small number of messages strong take away everything that doesn't doesn't support the point don't use the slide fancy slide transition effects animations all that crap that's not good for anybody like those transitions that take one second each how funny is it going to be when somebody tells you to go like 50 slides before the current slide right oh let me let's wait for 50 seconds until each transition takes it takes it does its job right the rule of three everything should be in threes three parts in a talk three subsections in a part three examples four principles three three bullets on a slide that kind of stuff this slide actually you know doesn't do that but that's fine yet comfortable comfort is is everything so people like to be comfortable and comfort and discomfort trans men like any like nothing else in talk so make sure you are you are comfortable and fake it pretend you're comfortable and you're gonna be comfortable i know it's weird but it's just what happens like there's any number of like pop science articles about that and that kind of stuff display that's why i'm emphasizing display ultimate comfort with every situation not not only in talk but that's actually a good tip for him and when i say display and that's why it's emphasized i mean fake it do you think i'm comfortable right now i hate it i hate i would die right now instead of being here okay but i got a display that i'm comfortable and i'm just like yeah yeah you can just talk about stuff no problem people are empathetic news flash right this is not high school like people don't like to be feel shame like bad like the speakers feel i'm going to be ashamed for saying the wrong things and stuff but your audience doesn't like to shame you like this again this is not like a situation like one of those weird like movie situations no people want to feel good and they want you to feel good so then you start with a good position you're in a position of authority or they on the screen you have the microphone right you have the microphone you have everything it takes you have good karma you have credit you have an attitude from everybody that they they want you to succeed essentially so don't forget that the situation when you start the talk is rigged in your favor it works for you the opening is disproportionately important people decide within 30 seconds if they like someone if they want to develop a relationship with them if they want to do anything that's unspeakable with them you know anything with is within 30 seconds okay you should have a clear notion of that there's many experiments about that people can predict students predicted their final grade after 30 seconds of video with the professor okay so they could predict with 80 accuracy within 30 seconds you can't have 2 times 30 seconds first 30 seconds everything that matters so establish contact immediately ask people like don't introduce yourself your name your name is on the slide don't say oh hi i'm john doe no you're not john doe i don't care right establish contact ask people a question tell them a story say joke do something that is going to establish a some sort of a human contact with your audience make people feel like they oh my god i gotta be there because otherwise i'm gonna miss all of this great stuff that's happening in the store right i hate it when people are close with uh and i guess that that was it and kind of just stopped there and kind of the there's a kind of uh uh perdendo see as they say in italians like you know this kind of the fade out you know right it's like oh yeah look no you get it closed for applause like you know make sure practice your closing and when you close everybody and their cat is gonna know oh there's the closing so i'm supposed to give applause and all that all that great things that people do when when the talk is done so practice it make sure you uh you you are there in you you're doing your closing properly any post-close message can wait you don't end your closing is not i'll be around for a few more minutes that's post-closing your closing is thank you very much right and now go shoot me okay or do something that's your closing your closing is not oh you know and uh i guess that's it and i'll be around and by the way my name was john doe right no don't don't do that ever a few tactical issues again i don't have much time to explain things in detail but please take my word for it attire i'm the last person to give you to give you advice on how to dress yourself make sure you're you know first of all like kate uh gave me that great tip make sure your uh your attire has pockets if needed if you need to have like a microphone and that kind of stuff on you you gotta have pockets so you can put your the you know the lavalier and that kind of installation in your pocket so uh beyond that clarify make sure that you're congruent with your attire your message is congruent with your time no matter how you dress it's gonna send some sort of a message if you don't want a message just like bill gates because nobody ever remembers how bill gates was dressed like not one person in the world dream i don't remember if if you guys if you shoot me right now if you tell me your life depends on remembering the color of bill gates sweater in in the last like talk you saw any talk you saw you would have to kill me because i have no idea i have no idea gates is like a floating head that's all i remember it's a floating there's no there's no it has absolutely no clothing and that's because he wears this grandpa i have there's a special factory that makes these grandpa sweaters of billiards that convey absolutely no message so if you have no message to send dress like big guess if you think your old dirty t-shirt with a crappy joke on it and with that kind of stuff like like dirty and kind of you with with a bad color and that kind of stuff that if you think that's i don't care about you know you don't it means i actually care about showing you that i don't want to dress nicely for you that's what the message really is right so don't be way too casual because that's not time so casual it's like actually i'm slimer slob right and don't be a corporate drone with the you know with the the tightest shirt and the you know the most fitted uh suit ever invented because then they're gonna send the wrong message on the other side of the the spectrum right make sure you handle your audience again you must assume that at least one person in the audience is gonna have dedicated their life on the one thing that you have to a little knowledge about right make sure you're gonna be able to make a conversation with the contact with that person validate befriend inspire them avoid a few people just hogging the entire interaction unfortunately it does happen you can never demean a person that's the worst thing any any speaker can do just uh make sure you address uh any questions they have extra you know in like in excess of what's uh what's expected uh take it offline with them don't forget you're in a position of authority don't exercise it it's just very easy to implicitly just acknowledge it and use it uh always scan for raise hands i hate it when somebody speaks for an hour and they look at the slides and i have my hand in the back of the room for like half an hour straight i'm like that guy was like my hand is going to get tired and stuff don't don't do that always scan for raised hands spray the audience with with the gaze never say good question say thanks for the question don't put judgment on the goddamn question okay just say thank you for asking that it's the question i'm i'm it's it's very much to we appreciate that somebody asked the question don't judge the question oh that was maybe i'll say oh that was a crappy question no i didn't like that question no that's a terrible question never ask that anymore you're stupid okay don't do that okay always repeat the question for good form always and for many reasons it's not only for the camera or whatever and for the microphone that kind of stuff even if they have a microphone it's good to repeat that question in your own words so there's a clear contact between people mirroring is a thing very important in psychology so when you repeat that question when your words back to them there's going to be a very good acknowledgement of the of the understand your understanding of that question always reply don't reply to the person don't look them in the eye and kind of like like an obsessed guy with a with an axe don't look at the guy and say oh yeah i'm going to answer you right now right no don't do that reply to look at the other half of the audience look at the entire audience and read and reply the question respond so everyone at the end of your talk everybody in the audience must feel that they have had an opportunity to shine to say something smart to understand something great to ask a question to make a point to kind of be in the moment everybody must have had the opportunity nobody should be just in their seat and say you know what i'm bored to death i'd rather be anywhere else i'd rather have my root canal done right now instead of being in the stock your posture it's amazing how many people just slouch like they slouch more than like if you have a normal conversation you get just gonna stand straight but when you're talking the pressure of the tension of the moment is so huge on it that people tend to sludge slouch stand straight speak loudly with dynamics my wife always says like when i'm uh when i give me a talk like from home she says you're yelling yes i'm that's how i am i'm sorry i can't do it any make sure you you speak loudly dynamics clearly use your enunciation whatever don't my accent is my worst part of me so don't imitate my accent at all right so never talk to the slides talk to the audience don't speak to the slides slides are not never gonna reciprocate okay it's all your audience look at it don't make me hear your drinking of the water please don't make me hear any any of that those gouts and everything no i don't want to hear that right drink while while being asked a question don't take a pause to drink and make sure it's not audible in the microphone record your rehearsals you will be amazed at how much stuff is going on you'll be amazed that when you thought you're giving a talk that was so engaging so awesome you're like a boring like uh drone there just yeah you know whatever so people think usually the per the self perception of energy they give is a lot more than the energy to actually convey so if i have one tip for you and the one thing that you should remember is put more energy in your talks put more energy in your talks give more of you what you have nobody is going to enjoy a talk that is given half-hearted everybody is going to be at least is going to be sympathetic even even if they don't like you as a person because that's impossible to be liked by everybody even if they have something with the material they don't enjoy the material even you know in any circumstance people are going to appreciate that the speaker gave everything they got and died on that stage right time management this brings me to uh so otherwise speakers make this mistake of uh not managing their time very properly and that's a that's a big social contract make sure to finish on time thank you very much thank you andre and let me yeah i'm next that was very good um so there are my thoughts all right so i'm speaking about presenting code and let's go so this lightning talk has been inspired um by the keynote from scott myers which he did at university crossbars 2014 which was about preparing material for the modern age and um also kind of you know seeing lots of talks being given at various conferences in various settings so um let's talk a bit about like you know how to present code how to uh think about things um but first you know i i want to point out like where's your audience today and this has been true like prior to the pandemic that a lot of your audience will be in the recording and have in mind that the slides are recorded separately but also of course pay attention as andrey just said um to the audience in the room even if a lot of people will just be sitting there and reading email doing social media following your talk along but the other half will listen and be you know uh engaging with you for questions and that's if you're presenting on site this audience will be the source of the questions about your talk right so you better be engaging to them um but actually i'm talking about presenting code so um there are various forms of how you can put code on slides um text is probably one of the best um screenshots some people do a live demo so you're just streaming your editor and also like the the common programs used for slides are not like coming with a slide for code there's no template for it you can just there's various ways to do it and um i would like to just go quickly through them um first please remember that fonts matter um they bring readability and for code make sure it's a mono space form and of course also as your slides will go through a projection and some encoding uh things nowadays probably uh the code for your phone should not be too thin um highlighting less is in my opinion better and some people do like bold keywords and other people do other things that's like you know express yourself there feel comfortable with that at some point um also colors um your slides should have a good contrast uh stick with one theme dark or light theme for example uh should not be too colorful um and of course please be aware about colorblindness avoid for example red green text is one of the easiest things but also be aware that if your contrast is getting bad then like uh the one of the classics is like having blue text on black background or gray background that can be in a lighting on on the stage where you present suddenly a lot less readable than it was at your screen where you wrote the slides and all of that also applies to code highlighting right um here's an example which i used a couple of years ago where i just put the code into how it was and um i skipped the things which were not important with ellipses but didn't like cut out everything which makes this you know kind of showing the code which is important and then when i talk about something in my talk i highlight the part of the code which i'm talking about though people know actually what i'm doing on stage and that way i don't need to think around with a laser pointer another very nice way i have seen this by michael cass um at cppcon he did a way that basically most of the code is grayed out and when [Music] he continues in his talk more and more code the code he's just talking about it's just the next thing coming up and then he's like this is not now what we're implementing and talks about that works very well and works fantastically and this presentation and you already kind of kind of see what's next and you can also like see what's in the past uh what you know has been added to the sweat prior um very nice way to do this and also um be aware and be not afraid to ask to change the lightning if the lightning runes ruins your slides please check for that always and you see here that there's basically uh the code and then there's like comments which they or things they want to say about their code and put into little uh speaking boxes that's also very nice to do um just to to give people and what you're talking about and that's that's that's also a great innovation um but of course you know that's like also the question like what do you do when people have a question which isn't about something which is not highlighted or you want to highlight something which you didn't think about um there are for example ways to draw on a slide um but also um there are virtual laser pointers and laser quantities i think the next thing i want to talk about um laser pointers are often used i've seen them um there are some problems with them for starters um did you see the laser pointer that's that's my my up which i often observe when i sit in a talk and people highlight things with laser pointers i get confused okay and of course most importantly it's like one point i i didn't have a site for that but please we're online now we're talking online this is a new default think about that part of your online audience will never seen laser pointer even if like the slide is being streamed via via the camera which hopefully it is not um also what do you do with a double projection as cppcon loves double predictions and then you know you you come to meeting c plus and in the big room we had this setup right so you're never gonna be able to to or maybe you're running in the back and showing the those people too with a later point so there's alternatives there's a various methods to have a virtual laser pointer and there's various methods to do this on screen but it's best to prior highlight the things you want to talk about um so conclusions laser pointers are hard to see but also they're not recorded and that is then missing a lot of the audience which will see your talk actually most of the audience like 10 of your audiences in the room at best um and look into virtual laser pointers know your tool if you want to write or draw on slides uh highlight what you're talking about um and with code there's something called slide plus plus you don't have to show code which is like a hundred percent compilable and has all the keywords that is needed to be in production uh focus on uh the code that is important for your example for your slide um live demos can be great but need to be prepared which we'll see soon and of course if you want to watch the keynote that's online too and then we should go to player thank you very much hints thank you very much gents now welcome to this demonstration of how to make better code samples for your programming talks it follows on very well from jensen's talk about the importance of drawing people's attention to the right parts of your slide a quick summary of the basics that have been talked about very well in the earlier talks today a particular thing i do want to point out though is the importance of being able to export your slides as pdfs we've already had a request from yentz to submit our slides from today's talk so if you can do your highlighting in a way that fits well with saving as a pdf for people to read offline then that's a bonus i'm going to be focusing today on showing you a few techniques in powerpoint to help with i'm talking about highlighting details in code but it doesn't have to be it can be animating and drawing attention to different parts of images that you've got on the screen just so but just for context let's talk about showing code so i believe that it's important to check that your code compiles before you paste it in so i have here some code that i checked before that it compiles and it'd be really nice if we could just copy it from our favorite ide and paste it into okay so i'm going to switch to editing at this point now so we're going to try the first method we're going to paste our code in yeah but we've lost all of the highlighting that's really annoying well never fear if i undo that powerpoint has paste in and keep the source formatting well that's not too bad we've got the color coding which is important for people to be able to quickly glance at your code and see context but i want the um fixed space fonts as well well there's this weird trick one weird trick that if you first paste your code into microsoft word now if you're using different editors you can experiment and try similar sorts of tricks i think that if i show hidden characters why this might work is because of the different kind of line endings anyway let's select that you may you experiment you may want to not get that last end of line and so now i'm going to paste it in but i want to show you that i've actually customized uh using this um customized quick access toolbar so that one i think is paste and keep source formatting that's what happens if you get the line break wrong it's not consistent i don't understand why but so i'm using shift and left arrow so now i'm not getting that last character this is fiddly but once you get used to it you'll get into a stride and get into a pattern and it will be quite quick and i definitely recommend when you find your workflow write it down and save the notes so let's try that hooray okay now we've got to get rid of this annoying bullet point and maybe i could with more time uh if i was going to keep on using this style i might create a new layout so i can easily create a new slide that's ready to paste in right so now we've done some of the first bits that yent's recommended and yeah it looks like code but i want to be able to tell people about particular areas of interest and one easy way to do that is because we've pasted it in this text getting good quality images and we can just do the highlighting and i won't i won't select more um examples here but you get the idea so that works and that's this is actually how i did my first very first c plus plus talk did the highlighting for it and then i used a laser pointer um to point at the different highlights and i failed there so it doesn't work having multiple highlights on one slide so the next logical thing to do is to say all right well i'll create three copies of the code i've done this in the interest of time saving so if you look at this number at the bottom i'm on slide five and then slide six and then slide seven i did that for a while and it works quite well but you can't rely on your slide numbers to judge your progress through the talk you can't say i'm halfway through the time i'm halfway through the page the slides because it's probably not proportional and and i've also fallen for the fact that if you discover a typo in a comment or a string or something and a slide that's got six highlights you've got to go and fix it six times and you're bound to miss one so that's kind of annoying so that's kind of like level two it's nice for the audience but we can do better so i'm going to focus on what i ended up using and settling on just it's a bit fiddly to explain but at the end i'm going to show you how you don't have to memorize the steps you only have to do this once and then you can recycle so i need i want to get the details recorded in a talk and actually when i started doing this in 2019 i did write down the notes and i had to go and find them in order to write this talk i couldn't remember the details so i'm happy that there's going to be a video of this so right i'm going to go to insert and i'm going to insert a shape you could do a rectangle but i quite like the rounded corners it's just a bit easier on the eyes so i'll start by drawing my first highlight and of course it's solid so that's no use to anybody i would be if i'm not doing a demo i'd be using all the keyboard shortcuts so i'm going to say shape options and fill the shape and let's make it a pale-ish yellow and i'm going to make it semi-opaque partly because i want to be able to see the text underneath and whilst i'm building up the animations and partly because it ends up just looking better so it's not too bad but i really like having a slightly different colored border around the end so maybe i might choose a darker yellow it doesn't it's not critical for this but you want it to be consistent so choose something you like now i've created that i don't want to be having to repeat those steps so i will experiment with different keyboard shortcuts and find that on a mac in powerpoint if i hold down the control key and click and drag something i get a copy of it so that's good if i hold down the shift key it keeps the and move it vertically it keeps the left alignment and let's oops and do another copy so obviously i'm not going to waste your time perfecting the alignment but just to give you the sort of idea so now i've got the bits that i want to highlight and uh as an aside i think it's worth saying this might seem like quite a lot of work but once you've got it set up it actually turns out to be a brilliant reminder of things that you intend to talk about because you don't have to remember which of the three lines or the four lines i want to talk about you go through your highlights and you say very calmly very confidently explain the line so it's kind of like your auto cue and i found that really useful if i pick up and a talk and repeat it sometime later obviously if we start the slide there that is not interesting so the animations are our friend and in particular the animation pane so what we're going to do is select one rectangle at a time this is slow because it's doing some kind of preview and i'm sure there's a way to turn that off anyway so there we go so we've got four things appearing so we're going to be spending a lot of time testing what this looks like okay the first thing is i actually really want that first highlight to be shown as soon as i go into this slide so instead of making this one appear i'm going to make it disappear so i start and then i click oh that did not work ah so many times before i selected it via the object here and then said disappear and you see how we've got another animation so let's delete that what i actually want to do is select the animation there and change it to disappear this is why you want to be able to visualize the animation steps this pane on the right is really important so now let's test it great hooray huh but there's a horrible gap what can we do about that well if i click on one of these and expand i never memorize the order of these things they're really non-obvious i think but this second one we don't want it to be on the next click we want it appear to appear with the previous one and so now rather than one two three four we've got one one two three so let's see what this looks like first one is visible next click okay hooray we've got that right but we carry on ah i want to get rid of that using namespace thing okay so the trick for that is to select all of the middle rectangles so not the first and not the last and i'm going to say after animation hide on next click and i'm very intentionally not doing that on the last one and i'll show you why so let's start the slideshow again yes yep yep yep now the reason i'm not hiding the last one on click is because at this point i just want to go on to the next slide so that is the mildly tedious but really quite effective way in powerpoint of achieving a series of animations like this now hendrick mentioned obsidian in an earlier talk and actually my last technical talk i did i used obsidian to generate slides and it's advanced slides um plugin uh you can just paste code in and with a little comment you can say i want to highlight lines one then two to three then five then seven and it just does it all for you so pick your tool and get to know how to use it now there's one more thing i want to do and then i'm done with this slide and that is that the text is washed out because it's in front of my code and i've done that deliberately because it's easy to select things and move them around but once i'm happy with it then i'll click on the border for the box that's got the code and say send all the way to back no that's wrong send all the way to front okay and now we haven't got the wishy-washy so that's it if we had more time i'd run through the steps a second time but you'll be able to watch it on the video later now a little bit of a tip you really don't want to be doing all of that for every single slide you're going to make mistakes and it's really easy to get the animation steps wrong so what i have at the end of my slide decks when i'm preparing them is a slide like this right at the end and let's say that the most number of highlights i want is seven i doubt i'd ever use that many but here i've got the animation set up and i've named all of the rectangles so i can see the order so let's say i want to quickly highlight four things in this slide go back to here i'll click outside of the slide so i'm not risking dragging stuff so i want four so i'm going to select first three and then command and click or i can control and click on a pc i've got four things selected and copy those go to the next slide paste them in and then start moving them around now i'm not going to align them up it's not going to be worth your time but just to demonstrate one two three four and onto the next slide so all the time i'm looking for time saving ways so that i can as andre said get the slides done and then focus on practicing one last thing to mention in terms of tips you can in powerpoint customize the icons the actions that are across the top of the screen there's a whole load of things like paste with source formatting and stuff like that that i don't use all the time and they're buried in sub menus or sub sub sub menus or whatever and if i find i'm using something quite a lot then i'll click on this three dots and select customize quick access toolbar and you have access to all of the commands in the program there so they're grayed out from the screenshot but this one here was paste with source formatting and that is how you get to have better code samples in your programming talks thank you very much indeed thank you andrei already had his turn thank you again and now we will see let me let's bring him on stage and we're ready thank you so much hence uh so we we saw a nice lightning talk about having good code samples and slides and we saw a live demo of how to actually build those slides now it's time to have a live demo about live demos uh i like i like meta and so i figured this would be a fun way to do this uh so here we're we're gonna kind of go through and do a little bit of a live demo so what are we actually talking about what are live demos even good for doing so the first thing that i think about with the live demo is it's really good for zooming in on some topic right this isn't this is a way to engage the audience find something you can show practical real tools that you want people to use it's really great for showing very specific code or specific details of something that's fairly complex it's good at focusing on how much more than why that means that there's also something that live demos are not really good at and this is kind of zooming out right you don't want to try and step back or really get to the bigger picture with the live demo kind of it doesn't make sense it doesn't engage the audience very well it's hard to get people to focus on what or or especially why you're saying something when you're doing a live demo they're reading the demo right and so if you want to kind of you know highlight your perspective or focus on an interpretation a live demo doesn't tend to be the best thing um all right so let's also let's look at how we actually want to do a live demo first thing you have to do is you have to plan every single step this is this is hard to do but it's really really really important right how do you actually get into the live demo how do you move from one step to the next step um how does everything work while you're doing this you want a good plan from the beginning uh another thing to think about is how do you wrap up the live demo and go back to your slides this is super super important if you know you have a live demo that you're mixing into the rest of the talk and and if you i'm curious uh everybody should think about how many pages of notes they think i prepared in order to be able to do you know a seven minute uh lightning talk on this uh i think i think this is going to be kind of interesting to see we'll actually look at the notes i have later if you have your plan what are the kind of key components of making your live demo a success the first thing to think about is you've got to work within the projector and the audience view you can't you can't be trying to to make the projector of the audience look at at your live demo uh the way you would while you're working at a desk with a big monitor you have to go the other direction right put yourself into the shoes of having a low resolution terrible projector with bad lighting right and so i've zoomed all the way in and this is actually the view that i'm looking at right i'm looking at the same thing you're seeing here and it's important that you kind of learn how to work in that environment and feel comfortable working in that environment you also have to learn the tools you're going to be presenting you're going to know them really really well much better than you need to actually just use them day-to-day you've got to know how to make them work for the demo if you're going to use visual studio code or an ide you need to be able to just jump right into it pull things up move around right if you want to show a preview you have to know where it's going to come up when it doesn't fit easily on the screen you got to know how to fix that how to rearrange everything so that you get the view that you want to show the audience right i'm a big fan of virtual desktops for live demos it lets you kind of move between different tools in a way that's pretty smooth you always have the same layout the exact thing you're expecting each time you look at it you want to find this tooling workflow that's going to be effective when you're demoing it live next you have to make this feel real to the audience right you don't want to do something that's just going to oversimplify it right it's tempting to oversimplify you know in in slide code you don't have to make it uh uh compile but when you're actually uh doing a live demo you need stuff to compile you needed to work with the real tools and that's really hard and so you know actually use stuff here and so i'm actually using uh i have my my editor set up it does automatic formatting of my markdown here you want to try and make it real so that people actually see how things work the next thing is you do want to make this live in the moment so you you'll see me make mistakes here right um that's fine it's good to actually have some mistakes that you have to correct live right and then people can kind of see that now this is this is actually real it's actually happening live and it keeps them engaged the other thing is to never ever stop talking and this is i think the hardest thing about a live demo it's especially hard when you're gonna actually talk about something that you're not currently typing and when you're trying to do this it's very hard to uh keep keep it in your head what you're trying to say and what you're trying to type and you'll notice a technique i'm using here which is on alternating and so i'll type a word and i'll say a word and i'll type a word and i'll say a word it's really hard for your brain to handle text in two different streams and so have a plan for how to do that and how to make it through it this is also one of the weird times when uh things like um and uh hesitations that's actually fine when you're live demoing because what you want to do is keep the audience engaged while you have time to make it through your live demo uh next make it fast and comfortable one thing you'll notice that i move fast in a live demo i move really really fast and that's because people can easily get get bogged down in the live demo and so you've got to rush just a little bit but of course you can't go too fast or it'll lose people it's a hard balance to strike and so i i don't i don't have a perfect advice here but it's something you've just gotta do all right next up okay i said i said to plan uh scratch all of that it's not actually about planning it's it's about practice i mean you need some plan so you know without a plan you can do a great live demo with a minimal plan but you have to practice right you have to make it comfortable and fast and you don't move this like a lot of people have talked to me after a live demo and they're like how do you type that fast by typing the same thing over and over and over again i don't normally type this fast but you got to practice it until you're comfortable and you're fast and you can keep the audience moving and you have to practice things going wrong and so you don't get locked into this rigid script so let things go wrong mess up intentionally accents happen that's fine you want to kind of get that full experience when you're practicing all right the last thing is you've got to cheat sometimes you're going to be like i forgot what i'm supposed to type that's fine just have something prepared ahead of time right just pull out a prepared selection of things really fast this is not a big deal right people actually are fine with it they know things are going to go wrong the key for you as the presenter is to just roll with it right have those candids catch back up you can even use a pre-filled framework kind of like what i'm using here to move yourself through each step of what you want to things present go wrong last but not least you should really be honest and provide your source this is actually one of my my big mistakes that i've made in a lot of talks is that i don't always kind of upload the source provide people access to it this hurts two things both the credibility it's really hard for people to believe live demo if they can't reproduce it but it also hurts accessibility like it's it's nice that i have a decent contrast and a big font but even better is to actually have a git repository that people can go and check out and correct whatever they've misread uh i understand like uploading could be hard this is actually my problem is that you know if you work for a company you have to like sort out licenses or something but i really encourage everyone try to do this i'm actually going to try and get this uploaded on my github page just so that i actually have done this yet but i couldn't get it ready before before the talk but try and actually provide a link to things it's so helpful if you're doing a live demo to then kind of show all of the inputs so that people can see them and so with that i do want to just show you what kind of notes went into the planning for this right and so these are all of the notes that i was taking to myself in my initial run through trying to plan out every step of what i want to do okay hundreds of lines of notes went into a seven eight minute talk and so with that i've done a live demo and and i hope this helps you all do your next live demo because i think it's a really fun way to engage audiences thank you chandra that was awesome and yeah great frustration now we know how to life demo um which brings me to patricia let's bring her slides online there we go um so this is very meta and it has to be for this type of format because we're talking about talking so i i have a very small point uh but to make it uh i kind of had to do what i'm trying to tell you to do so the difference between having a point and telling a story so you have something that you want to say uh but you have to convey it to the audience in some way and this can be very difficult um so i have three examples from talks uh that i've done and and and i'll try to deconstruct the technique that i used in each one uh so the first one we're going to look at is a talk i did a few years ago and here i'm using a metaphor to create the language that i'm going to use in the talk um so the talk is is called trying to learn c sharp uh it's it's a very weird talk because i didn't know c sharp when i submitted the talk so i had to learn c sharp to do the talk and so i i talked about that process it's it's a it's a very strange thing it was an extremely hard talk to do uh for me and in it i i i used words from learning a natural language so so i went and i i i i found how do we talk about learning languages in general like learning natural languages and then i use those kinds of words to describe learning as c sharp and so i'll show you some examples from that talk so there's a word in norwegian called frucost um and there's also a word in danish called frucos but said with a danish accent and and in norwegian it means breakfast and in danish it means lunch which which makes it extremely confusing uh all the time basically either way you go you don't know what meal you're talking about and it's clear and what really hurts it is that it is very clear from the context that you're talking about a meal but but it's very easy to get confused about which meal we're actually discussing at this point um and and this is because it's kind of coming from the same kind of language background but the meaning of it has drifted and and this can mean that you think you understand what the the person is saying but it actually means something totally different than you think and this happens in programming languages as well so i'll show you two examples so here we have a list in java and in java it's called list but there's also a thing in c sharp called list uh unfortunately in java this is some kind of abstract thing it could actually mean some kind of linked list and then c sharp this is what we would call a vector or what you in java would call an array list right uh which is confusing when you read it the first time because you don't know what it is what is a list like what it what is the underlying implementation and so here we have like a drifting meaning it means different things in different languages and you have to figure out what does it mean in this context and and here it is the same word because it came from the same place uh um but it doesn't mean the same thing and you kind of have to figure that out in learning a programming language and so you had one that was fun is that they have something that they call namespaces so in my talk i have this little thing in the in the corner and that is like the language i was thinking of when i was learning this thing in c sharp so how did i try to understand it so so here's an example from c sharp where they have something that that kind of looks like a namespace right but it's actually not like namespace at all and so now i have to figure out how it what it actually means and then and so this this is all i'm going to show you from this talk it's on youtube but the point is here i i used the metaphor of learning a natural language and mapped it to learning a programming language okay so then i have a different talk that i did recently at aku and here i tried to illustrate time by using popular culture uh and so the the talk was called classic vulnerabilities and i i used popular culture because i wanted to remind people how long ago something was and so so i wanted to oh yeah i remember that song or you know so to give people a feel for how long ago something was because that was a big point in the talk to to illustrate that a lot of time has passed since something um so i had so i had these two ecosystems that i was talking about so you had systems programming and binary exploitation and then i had these timelines and so so you know we're going back to 2000 and then all the way up to 2022 but this is very abstract like you people have 22 years okay i don't know and so then i go like okay so boomer said you know 2000 that was y2k and for zoomers taylor swift was 11 which makes everybody feel old but anyway um and then i had this weird transition and the transition was because it's old school like okay i tried many transitions here to make it like old school and one of them was like the the cube rotating i i couldn't do it it was it was too hard uh but this is from a screenshot from the song dilemma uh which nelly uh uh did with kelly rowland who was from destiny's childhood zoomers don't know who is but it has this wonderful like scene in it so if you were you know a teenager or adultish at the time you might remember that she is writing a text message in an excel spreadsheet on our fabulous nokia phone and this is something that people who were you know in techish things might remember from that time they got like oh that's a long time ago this is way before the iphone so then you get a feeling for when was 2002. right um then i have another talk and here i wanted to to change people's minds about something and and and and to do that i i needed to to to put them in a frame of mind where they had or what i was trying to do at least put them in a frame of mind where they remembered or they they uh they they've like experienced internally a certain situation and then i would flip it on them and so this talk is called the constructing privilege and and then the first two slides i'm going to show you are the first two slides that i show in that talk and and and what i'm trying to do in those slides is evoke memories in each person in the audience of their own experience and then show them how the same situation could be experienced totally differently from by somebody else so the first one is going to the hairdresser and so i i asked people to try to remember last time they went to the hairdresser uh how they experienced it how sometimes they might be nervous uh they don't know how this is going to look in the end can they kind of maintain this hairstyle things like that and then i say for some people going to the hairdresser can be very traumatic and then i and and then i i bring up okay so imagine that you are you are transgender and you go to the hairdresser as a child and you are presenting as something that you it's not you so let's say that you were assigned a female at birth and you're coming in and people all want to do the long hair and the everything and all you want to do is be yourself and you just want to cut it all off um so that's one experience that could be very hard for people to be enforced to go into that situation and reaffirm something they feel is totally wrong for them but at the same time also you have uh especially for for for trans men uh you've had several situations where trans men have been assaulted by the hairdresser because people think that they are going there and and trying to cheat the hairdresser because haircuts for men are cheaper than haircuts for women so both of these situations have caused many many trans people to cut each other's hair because they don't want to go into that situation because for them it is very scary and traumatic and so this is trying to contrast how do you as a as a cis person or a cis presenting kind of person or passing person how do you experience a quite ordinary situation and then contrast that to how it is experienced by somebody else uh in a different situation another example that i have then is is planning a vacation uh where where i i asked the audience to imagine you know how how you what you think about when you plan a vacation like do you like to go to the beach or do you travel to a place that has interesting food or or things like that and then i i flip it on them and i say okay imagine that you are in a same-sex relationship lots of places in the world it's actually illegal for you to go they can put you in jail for just traveling with your spouse and suddenly a whole whole sections of the world are not not possible for you to travel to not for for for a vacation and not for business either and so so what i'm what i'm trying to to tell you here is that the difference between having a point and having a point is you having all of you have an idea you will have something you want to say you have something you want to communicate but there's a difference between having a point and telling a story and and and the difference there is trying to figure out how do i tell you what i'm trying to say and that means i need you to understand me to understand what i'm trying to say to get it to internalize it in your own mind and and that is is the the struggle i have every time like what is the thing like i need i have the stuff i want to say but i also have to have some kind of medium and that medium is is trying to reach the audience and and you kind of have to and and sometimes it's really hard and it's super super stressful because sometimes i just can't get it until like i've been working on the talk i'll have all of the slides i have everything but i'm just missing that one thing too like i it's it it bothers me and i can get like oh my god what if i never i never get there but the the point is that you you are trying to communicate to people and so it's it's not enough to just talk because language is is just putting words into the air you need you need to make sure it is parsed on the other end you can't just like push it into the air so so this is basically the entire point of my entire thing the difference between having a point and telling a story is trying to figure out how to tell you what i'm trying to say um and thank you very much thank you patricia that was very interesting we go to kate thank you you know i had occasion to be reminded yesterday because ndc tech town posted a sizzle video to get people to attend ndc tech town where i will be speaking again this year uh and they posted a clip from me that i only speak at places where i would like to attend the talks and uh i've been taking notes these are these are great talks and great big picture talks i'm super happy i'm going to talk about one tiny tiny little thing but i think it's an important thing and i'll tell you why i think it's important and it's about ending your talk you know as i said i go to uh a lot of talks i like going to talks and uh i'm enjoying them they're they're fantastic you know someone has got diagrams and explanations of something uh this is a why rotate is great um or they have code and they're zipping along they're talking about the future stuff that's gonna happen and then they bump into this slide and they stop talking or even worse they bump into this slide i've seen this on more than one occasion this this isn't better right and what happens when this slide comes up is the speaker kind of stops talking and then sometimes they seem like it really caught them by surprise they were in a great mood they were cranking along everything was fine and then up comes the slide that says questions or the whatever and they go ah uh well i guess i guess uh i guess that's all i have uh that that that seems to be it uh and like the audience doesn't get their cue to clap a couple people you know kind of try it but other people don't pick it up because the speaker's still talking and saying i seem to have time for a few questions and so people like i guess we'll clap when the questions are over it's like who wrote this deck you wrote this deck on purpose you should know this deck and you should have an ending that is not just well i don't seem to have any more content to say to you a couple of people have alluded to these moments that you get in a talk they're not you can't count on them but there are these moments so one of them is the opening there's probably another whole talk about how to start a talk a lot of people do it badly um i like to start with the conclusion that this isn't this isn't a scientific paper where we're going to lay out all the evidence and then on the very last slide we're going to reveal the exciting conclusion i like to actually start with the conclusion but somehow you've got to get their attention to pay mind to what you are saying for the next however many minutes you're going to do it and so you deliberately structure a great moment in there uh and patricia just gave us a repraise of a really life-changing talk for a lot of people where she opened with these questions have you ever and wow that got people's attention that got people thinking about the problem a strong opening is amazing if you are lucky if the stars align you may get a moment during a talk shawn famously you know this is a rotate and the first time he said he said this is obviously a rotate and it was so not obvious to me that i literally looked around the room at the other people with me to make sure that i was not the only one who didn't think that was obviously a rotate at all at meeting c plus i had a series of bullets on a slide and the last bullet spoke to me so much that i repeated it on a slide of its own and when i did i saw all the phones come up to take a picture is it important to your ego that you're good at a complicated language you may have an amazing code example you may have this really brilliant point that people are going to share on twitter that people are going to talk to that one sentence out of your talk over and over you can't be sure you will have a moment like that in your talk you can try but you can't be sure even in a great talk there might not be one but you get your closing right you're guaranteed you're closing so you want to structure that closing to be one of those moments and the most important thing about that is to end on purpose to not just trail off to not just say well i guess i must stop talking now to have a deliberate ending i believe that every talk should have a call to action you don't have to label it call to action it's not wrong if you do but lately i've i've been putting what do i want you to do the top of the slide you know if you're if you've written a great library and you're coming to give a talk about my library is a great library then your call to action is probably use my library it's great but it could be join the team to help maintain this library you know what it is right or if you've discovered a lovely technique like like claire's code highlighting technique then the call to action is hey you should highlight your code make your code easier to read on slides and i've shown you how to do it sometimes uh someone especially if the talk has like disaster or fiasco or whatever in the title uh their their their call to action is the opposite they want you to stop doing something and like you don't need to hide this this is the point this is why you came to talk for five minutes or 15 minutes or 60 or 90 minutes so that people would start doing a thing so take some time and figure out what that is that you want but then you should also have a closing sentence you're going to signal that you're done and there's several parts to this one is your actual sentence which i'll talk about in a minute but there's also a particular inflection a particular rhythm of your words that says i've reached the end of the sentence i've reached the end of the paragraph i've reached the end of the chapter you know and they all lived happily ever after that rhythm we recognize it immediately it's a little more pauses between the words and a little kind of down drop everybody knows that's the end thing so after you say your closing sentence you pause for a couple of beats and then you say thank you believe me they will applaud that is everybody knows the cue there's a script when you do that and then you say thank you they all go yay even if you weren't really that good they're still going to do that okay for sure because they now know they're done now you can put the resources up behind you or you can put the questions up you know slide q a whatever something like that for them uh to look at while you're answering questions because you don't necessarily want to be sitting on your call to action slide don't read it out don't say so i i have a blog it's here and you can see that i'm sometimes on twitter and i just just leave it there maybe say here's some resources that you might find helpful but let's come back to that closing sentence and that is why everybody should whatever it is you think everybody should so please join me in doing something or another more often or no longer doing something or whatever you know you you you want them to do something so please join me in doing that right so you see you really can uh whatever it is but one of my tricks which is working uh pretty well for me is to have a talk that has a title who that the title itself makes a good closing sentence then what i can do when i get to the end is i can press home we'll go back to the screen where the title is in great big letters along with my contact information and everyone will know we're done and that my friends is how you end a talk thank you thank you kate um yep thanks everyone and yeah so thank you everyone um that's been really great um we actually now like right on point to get started with the panel and um so we're gonna go over to hubido and go there into the room uh that will be also already red dot and um yeah i think everyone to be that has been part today about uh this writing talks and speaking about c plus plus thank you thank you jans this has been my first lightning talk thank you i
