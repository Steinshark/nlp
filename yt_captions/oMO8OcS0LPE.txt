(swooshing sound) - Whoa. Wow! You almost knocked me out with that one. Hello and welcome to Mystery Tech. (serene music plays) Wrapping paper? (papers rustle)
(serene music continues) This is a tree. Is this the Christmas episode? (upbeat serene music continues) (laughs) I'm actually happy. I've always wanted a Santa costume. - [Matt] What size is that costume? - This is a small. - [Matt] How does a Santa costume come in anything other
than an extra large? As a fat guy, I am so offended by this. ( Austin laughs) - You bring up a good point. You bring up a good point. No one wants a skinny Santa. (bell rings) Matt, have you ever
dressed up as Santa before? - [Matt] Wow, I take offense to that. As a fat guy... Yeah, I have. (Austin laughs) (zips costume up) (upbeat music plays) - Ho, ho, ho and welcome
to Christmas Tech. Is my beard in my mouth right now? Absolutely! But why don't we build
a little bit of holiday (spits)
cheer? (spitting continues) (gags) (serene lo-fi music) Its all in my mouth. (lo-fi beats playing) So does this stand up by itself? It feel like it needs to
come with some type of base. Oh, yeah. There it is. (lo-fi beats continue) All right. - Santa, I thought I would
help you out by giving you what the kids that you are
servicing really, really want. - Please don't say
servicing kids ever again. (Matt laughs) And so... (bell rings) Is that? That's just a PlayStation. - [Ken] It wouldn't fit in the sack. - Did you put the PlayStation in my sack? - [Ken] I did. Well, I tried. Don't. Oh, no, no. Okay, then base it on the floor. (Austin groans) - So, as the hottest gift of 2020... - That's, that's for resale. - Wow! We don't even get to un-box the PS5. Did you already sell that one? - [Ken] Yes. (serene music) - All right. Sonny tech. Some kind of bright technology for your holiday gift giving needs. Okay. A lot of packaging. - [Matt] What is going on with this? - [Austin] There's a lot of layers. Somethings needs to be kept safe. (sniffs) - [Matt] Wait, is that just tin foil? - I think this is tin foil. (Matt laughs) This is just tin foil. What have you gotten? - [Ken] So this is one of
those education science toys. - Oh, I like these. Okay. I'm about to learn something? - [Matt] Probably not. - [Ken] So the whole idea behind this is that it is a levitating motor. - Oh, that's cool. All right. All right. How's it powered? - [Ken] It might actually
be solar, which I know is... - You mean all the natural light in here. I'll just put it in front
of the very real window and then, you know,
it'll be powered, right? - [Ken] Yeah. (swooshing sound) - Okay. So how do I arrange this? Could basically be it's to
change the float, right? Oh, like that? Nope. Oh, Oh, wait. It might be working. - [Ken] Way to go. Oh yeah. - [Austin] Oh, look at that. - [Ken] Oh, just.Yeah.
- [Austin] Wow. That's pretty cool. I'm afraid of it falling off. So essentially the solar
panels are, actually, what's happening there. So it's got solar panels and a bunch of copper
wire wound on the inside. So, I'm guessing that's creating like an electric magnetic field. I mean, that's, these are
actually moving pretty fast. Dude, I love these science toys though. That is so cool. Science is great. (upbeat lo-fi music) (swooshing sound) This episode of mystery
tech is sponsored by LG and their brand new XBOOM PL Series of Bluetooth party speakers. (upbeat lo-fi music) So this is the PL2, the
smallest and cheapest in the range and it kicks some serious, serious sound out of a very small and lightweight package. But when we jump up to
the PL5 as well as PL7, not only do you get
that full LED lighting, but importantly you also
get a ton of battery life. Not only do you get that dual
action bass with the speakers which vibrate along with your music and you get those LED's, but it's also been
custom-tuned by Meridian for that excellent quality sound. So, if you want to up your audio game definitely be sure to go check
out the LG XBOOM PL series speakers at the link in the description. And again, huge shout out to LG for sponsoring this
episode of Mystery Tech. (swooshing sound) (bell rings) (box drops) Whoo! Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Well that's a lot of things. All right. So these are- How many of these do you have? (whirring sound) - [Ken] Oh! Oh, this is the thing
that they try to sell you at the mall. And is overpriced as hell. (toy buzzes around) - [Matt] Oh, Jesus Christ. (Austin laughs) (toy buzzes around) - [Ken] That seems to be bouncing up. (toys buzz) Well, that one's flying. (toy continues to buzz) Yeah. Oh! - Well, they're going
straight into Santa's sack. Ho ho, ho. Whoosh! (box flies then drops) (swooshing sound) (box drops) Mutrics! Smart gaming glasses. - [Ken] By the way, this
is another P.O. Box item. We did not buy this. - Yeah, I could tell 'cause it's getting- The items are getting questionable. So with our smart gaming glasses, we have blue light reduction lenses Bluetooth 5.0 with Google and Siri, hands-free calls. They're Bluetooth. - [Ken] I guess. - Ooh, this is actually a very
nice little carrying case. Oh, wow! They're Gameboys theme. Look at that. - Oh, I like that. - [Austin] Whoo! Am I Santa from 1989? - [Ken] They make you look older. - [Matt] You look like the FTC Chair. (Austin chuckles) - [Ken] Pai? - [Matt] Pai, yeah. - [Ken] He's leaving. - [Matt] I know! - [Ken] Oh, the top of the
glasses light up. Look at that. Yo! - Do they?
- [Ken] Look at that. Wow, in a straight line too. - This is really quiet. Can you hear this? (music blares quietely) - [Matt] Yes. (music continues) - How much? How much can you hear this? - [Ken] Barely. And I don't have the headphones
to hear your mic, so. - [Austin] So they sound decent, right? And it's certainly not as good as a pair of headphones, but I guess if you wanna,
like, take a call or something you'd be able to hear it all right. I think I'd still prefer
to wear headphones. I think it's more of a gimmick. It's more so about the look of these glasses than anything else. Do we know how much these are? I mean, they look kinda expensive. - [Matt] Whoa! - It's a kickstarter. - [Matt] $200. - [Ken] Wow. - [Austin] So the whole thing is, it's about the audio and the audio is fine. - [Ken] I mean, designer
glasses cost the same. - [Austin] Yeah.
- [Ken] But like.. - [Austin] But are these.. Look, if you're about this style, and you want a pair of
glasses that will give you like that blue light
protection and looks cool and we'll give you some audio that's fine. - [Matt] I just, I like
it more for the look. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Ken] These are the nicest
looking like, quote unquote, like geek wear that I think I've seen. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Ken] Like for the gimmick. - [Austin] Yeah, yeah, yeah. And again if I could see
through non-prescription lenses, I'm sure it would look great. - [Ken] You're nearsighted. You can just use your phone
really up-close to your face and you'll be good.
- Yeah. It's great. (upbeat electric music) Glasses look so good. (swooshing effect) - [Ken] Santa, close your eyes. - Okay. Santa Claus has been
informed to close his eyes. (lighthearted music) I wanna peek right now. (lighthearted music continues) - [Matt] Good choice of words. - That sounded big. Can I open my eyes yet? - [Matt] Yes. (lighthearted music) - Pop! Pikachu! I mean, I see you did
forget to take off the tag from GameStop. It says 99.99. - [Ken] Oh, don't worry. We used your Pro-Rewards. We got like $10 off. - Oh, thanks. Appreciate it. - [Ken] I actually hate Funko pops. Their quality control is God awful. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Ken] But, in big size, I don't think I'd mind. And most importantly,
you put it on the set. - [Austin] Yes. - [Ken] Don't cut your... - I'm not cutting my hand. I appreciate though that you immediately went for the camera. So if I do cut myself, at
least we get it on camera. - [Ken] Oh, I mean, it's for the content. - [Austin] It's for the content Behold! Wow! Wow, wow! - [Ken] That's not what
I was expecting at all. - [Austin] What are you? Wait, is it just a head? (Austin laughs) What do I do with this? What do I say about this? It actually does look cuter
in person, I will say. Once you get rid of the
horrible looking box. So, if you know a Pokemon fan in your life and you want to give them
an obnoxiously large Pikachu and make a GameStop
employee really hate you, then the giant Funko Pikachu... Wait, do I look like Santa Ash? - [Ken] That's actually kinda
adorable, not gonna lie. For once in his life,
Austin made a friend. (lighthearted music) - But I paid for him. - [Ken] Oh. Well, I mean, you do that for us too, so. - [Matt] Yeah, but we don't
even consider him friends. - [Ken] Yeah, fair enough. (lighthearted music continues) - Come. Come Pikachu into my sack. (laughter in background) . They can't hurt you here. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. - [Matt] That's not what the sack is for. - [Ken] Man, I thought PETA
hated Pokemon but like- (laughs) Oh, man, wait until
they watch Austin Evans. They came up with the most
humane way to capture Pokemon. It's with Pokeballs not
with a (bleep) sack dude. (Austin and Ken laugh) - [Ken] That's some Team Rocket (bleep). (Austin laughs harder) - I finally caught Pikachu. I guarantee you Team Rocket has dressed up as Santa before. - [Ken] They definitely have! (laughs heartily) - [Matt] They have not
dressed up as Santa, but they did kidnap him. - [Austin] Jesse and
James kidnapped Santa? - [Matt] Correct. - [Austin] Okay. Got it. Well, Mystery Tech is going
great today, isn't it? - [Ken] Are you gonna
take him out of the stack? - No, he lives there now. I'll pick him up when he's big enough. (swooshing sound) (bell rings) - [Matt] This is from all of us. 'Cause, you know, it's Christmas. - Polar pen! What's a polar pen? Why do I need a polar pen? - [Ken] Well, you're
from the North Pole, so. - Oh, clever! A bunch of... - [Ken] The box has been
shifted around a fair bit. But the idea is that it is a pen that you can play with
'cause it is all magnets and comes apart. We know you like your pens. - I do like my pens. - [Ken] So, there's- There's some pens and balls. - Oh, wow. It like, actually- Oh, okay. That's, yeah, you're not kidding. That's a pen that comes apart. (fumbles with pen)
(lighthearted music) - [Ken] And you can make them disappear. - [Matt] Remember how I
said it was from all of us? - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] It's actually just P.O. Box. - [Ken] That was just P.O. Box. (Matt laughs) - Matt, I'm about to put you in my sack. (Matt laughs) - [Matt] Aww, with Pikachu. (fast paced lighthearted music) - Magnets. - [Matt] How do they work? - It's a mystery. Unknown by human minds. (swooshing sound) (lighthearted serene music) Is that? (lighthearted music continues) That's an original Xbox. - [Ken] Why, yes it is. - Okay, well, it's been opened. But is this like a complete original Xbox? - [Ken] Yes! - Dude, this is like
straight up everything that came with the original Xbox. Wow. - [Matt] And a couple extras. - Look at that. That's control right there. - [Ken] So, we have like
one or two original Xboxes but they're all scuffed up. - We do.
- [Ken] I just wanna see. - How clean this thing is? - [Ken] Yeah, 'cause I
haven't taken a peek yet, so. - All right. (upbeat music continues)
(removes the Xbox) - [Matt] Christmas is over. - [Austin] Fine. Look at this. They tell you how to connect it to a TV via your VCR. (upbeat lo-fi music) - [Ken] Remember, this was a media player. - Yeah. This is in pretty good shape. I do think it has been used but it's been nicely repackaged. It is, yeah, I'd say it's in good shape. - [Ken] That is cleaner than our... - [Austin] It's very clean.
- [Ken] Yeah. - It's very clean. So why don't we fire up the original Xbox and see if it matches
up to the Xbox Series X. Oh, sorry, not now. Let's not make a comparison video. We've already done enough of those. (swishing sound) Let's just play some
Xbox games, shall we? (swooshing sound) Here goes nothing. Ooh! As it whirrs to life. - [Ken] It sounds like disc grinding. - Also we're not getting
any signal though. - [Ken] Like all relics of this time. (Ken stumps hand) - [Austin] Wow! What is wrong with you? - It's of the early 2000's. It should just work now. (lighthearted music) - [Austin] I don't think
it's just gonna work. - [Matt] That was the late 90's. (lighthearted music continues) - [Austin] Anything? - [Matt] Yeap. - [Austin] What, really? - [Ken] I don't know. Look at that. - Oh, so yeah. That was totally... (chuckles nervously) - [Matt] So you just didn't plug it in. - Yes, yes, yes. (lighthearted music) Can't recognize this disc. Oh, well that... I guess that's also a problem. The disc is 100% fine. Ken! (blows air out) Stop, stop! That's... (blows air out) Wrong console. (beats console rhythmically) I'm gonna walk back in with this. (continues to tap console)
(upbeat lo-fi music) (Ken laughs) - It worked! (continues to laugh) I was just petting it. It was...
(laughs happily) Well, I brought all my
Xbox games but okay. All right. All right, I mean, I
definitely wanna play Sega. Okay. Quick battle? Yeah. I wanna do quick battle. (upbeat guitar music) That does not sound good. (upbeat guitar music) (taps on console) There we go. - [Ken] Ooh, I'm telling you, man. Like it's... - You're nursing it through right now. - [Ken] Yeah. - It is not happy. - Have you ever used the
defibrillator before? That's the same preview? - [Austin] Have you?
- [Ken] No. (upbeat string music continues) - Okay, good chat. - [Ken] Okay, maybe it's broken. Oh no, no, no. It's not broken. Oh, nevermind. Oh, you just took it out. Oh, your project Gotham. - [Austin] Yeah. Let's just try a different game. - [Ken] That's my favorite Xbox game. - [Austin] We just try a different game. (lighthearted music) Think at this point. While it has been a
Merry Christmas for many, for us, I don't know if
it's gonna work today. You know what though? We could put this disc in a Series X... (lighthearted music continues) You're trying to tell me that the only solution to
Christmas this year is a PS5? - [Ken] Well not, no, not this one. That one's still resale dude. - Thank you very much
for watching this episode of Mystery Tech. Is this an anticlimactic end to what was a very mediocre video? Well, yeah, I do think it is. But thank you for subscribing nonetheless. And most importantly, thank you for ringing
that notification bell. So you'll always be kept up to date when shenanigans like this occur. I'm gotta fix that Xbox now. - [Ken] Let's put a PC inside of it. (upbeat lighthearted
music plays then ends)
