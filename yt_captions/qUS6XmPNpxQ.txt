as documentary filmmakers most of us spend the majority of our time outside the studio in traveling is almost a requirement for the job we also need to shoot a lot of interviews and just because we're not working with big Hollywood grip departments we still want our stuff to look good that means lights modifiers Flags stands all sorts of grip equipment none of which are known for being very portable I mean the average c-stand weighs over 20 pounds I think and instead of three like the ones Matthew sells is way over the limit for normal Airline baggage restrictions so for those of us working with small teams in tight budgets but who still want high-end cinematic results we need to get creative with the gear we travel with and that's what I want to talk about in today's video five pieces of grip equipment that I travel with on almost every Run and Gun documentary shoot that really helped me shape and control Lighting on the road my entire setup will fit into a single large duffel bag that's Airline friendly and while it might be a little bit more stripped down than you'd find on a big set you'll still get some great results and as an added bonus at the end I'll tell you what this thing is and how it saved my butt on shoots across three different continents all right let's get into it [Music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is Luke Forsyth and on this channel I teach the skills I've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to hit the Subscribe button because I've got new videos coming out every Wednesday okay so if you're getting into documentary filmmaking you're probably never gonna have the kind of control that a Hollywood DP mic with a small army of people working for them on a Sound Stage you're gonna have to go out into the real world and for the most part you'll be trying to capture real life moments as they happen rather than creating scenes like they do in the movies that's one of my favorite parts of the job and I wouldn't change it for anything but at the same time I still want to be able to control light from time to time to augment what the real world offers especially when you're shooting interviews and for that you need grip gear for anyone who isn't familiar with the term grip equipment basically means all the tools that support the camera and lights this means stands frames for diffusion overhead rigs dollies tracks jibs a bunch of other things that aren't really the camera or the lights themselves on a big film set there are dedicated people called surprise surprise grips who handle all this stuff and they often have dedicated trucks just to get everything to set as documentary Shooters we're not going to have all this stuff at our disposal and we're probably gonna have to carry it most of it ourselves so we'll need to make trade-offs if we want to keep the space and way to a manageable level but that doesn't mean you can't still get some really solid results so let's not waste any time and get right into my personal favorite grip stuff to travel with before you get into any of the other things the first thing you'll have to figure out is what kind of stand you're going to use to support everything on a set the standard stand is the c-stand and for good reason c-stands are super versatile they can hold a lot of weight and they're really stable if you set them up right the problem is that they're made of solid metal and weigh a ton I've worked on a few really big budget shoots where we've had multiple Vans to carry gear and it's been possible to bring heavy cases of c-stands but that's pretty unusual most of the time I have to make do with much smaller stands which are way lighter but can't hold as much weight it's always going to be a trade-off between load limit and weight but for me the stand that provides the best are the math use reverse stance these things weigh about three pounds each but they hold up to 11 pounds meaning I can get a large key light like a joker or an aperture 300D or something similar with the softbox with no problem and that's about the heaviest light I've ever really likely to travel with they're called reverse stands because they fall back on themselves like this which makes them shorter and easier to transport I have four of them I think and they come with me on almost every shoot and in most of my interview setups I end up using them all they're about eighty dollars each and no matter what abuse I seem to put on them they just don't seem to break the folding leg design also means that these legs here at the bottom are a lot longer than the average stand which makes them a lot more stable so you don't have to worry about them tipping over as much you can definitely find cheaper ones out there but they can't hold nearly as much weight and they tend to have tiny little legs that'll fall over in a light Breeze and I really just don't feel comfortable putting like big light fixtures on them for me these stands are the best value to Quality ratio out there when it comes to travel gear and they should last you a really long time but one thing that makes c-stands so useful are those grip heads that come with them These Arm and head combos allow you to do so many more things than Mount to light and they're one of the main reasons why c-stands are so useful there are so many different ways you can use a c-stand and it would take an entire video just to scratch the surface so rather than half-ass it I'll just link to a video for the grip tips YouTube channel in the description like I already mentioned these things are way too heavy for most of my shoots and so I had to find an alternative luckily the same company that makes those reverse stands Matthews is probably the industry leader for c-stands and they also make a super lightweight version of those grip heads that they call the mini grip mounting kit the kit comes with two of these mini grip heads two of these clamps and two of these lightweight arms they save a lot of weight by making everything out of a lightweight plastic rather than solid metal which would normally make me a little bit nervous about build quality but I've had this kit for about five years now and not a single piece is broken the total weight of everything in this kit is just under four pounds which makes it really easy to shove in a bag there are so many ways to put this kit to use like gripping onto Flags or hanging China balls from this part or latching onto boom poles pretty much anything you can do with a normal grip head just in a smaller package the c47 YouTube channel has a pretty good in-depth overview of this kit and some of the things you can do with it so instead of making this video way too long I'll just link to that video in the description as well so you can check it out the bottom line is that even though this isn't quite as beefy as a normal metal set of grip heads and clamps the weight savings mean you can actually bring this stuff with you which in dock shooting makes all the difference the clamps are especially useful and allow you to mount to unusual places like clamping onto the bottom of desks or walls and the Base Kit only comes with two of them I probably recommend adding two more clamps to that because I use them all the time for things like mics and boom poles and all sorts of stuff they're incredibly useful so Matthews if anyone's watching maybe consider adding two more of these to the stock kit thank you the one problem you have to watch out for when you start extending off of your lightweight stands using the grip kit is that when you change the center of balance you do run the risk of the stands tipping over and breaking your light or even falling on your interview subject on a normal film set you'd probably just drop a sandbag on the leg of your sand to keep everything stable but it's not really practical to be checking 20 pound bags of sand on an international flight you could always just put backpacks or pelican cases and legs to keep it weighted down and that works okay most of the time but they can slip off and it's just kind of a janky solution then a few years ago I heard about a solution that seemed way too simple for me not to have heard of it before water bags I've mentioned these water bags on the channel before but I can't stress how fantastic these things are and I'm really surprised they're not more common it's really just a heavy duty water bladder inside of this really tough bag with a couple straps on it so you can hang it off your stands you just fill the bag up from a river or lake or tap or whatever and when you're done with it you just dump it out when these are empty they really weigh almost nothing and you can roll them or fold them or just cram them into another bag for transport and 45 dollars each they're not super cheap but they solve a very real problem for me and the build quality is tough Top Notch so I'd say they're worth it mine just usually lay flat at the bottom of a big duffel bag and they don't take up much space and on the occasions I've needed them they've been a real Lifesaver okay so your stands are stable you've got grip heads and clamps to hold whatever you need but other than lights and mics what else would you maybe want to make an interview set up look great Hollywood DPS use a crazy assortment of light modifiers to soften diffuse and block light on set and even though us dock filmmakers need to Pare down the kit a little we can still use some of the same techniques to get great results but carrying bulky frames and huge pieces of cloth really isn't practical when you're on the road and yet again it's going to be Matthews with the best solution these are called Road rags and inside this folding bag there are two frames which work pretty much like tent poles there's two scrims for cutting light one solid flag and a silk when you set them up they're about two feet by three feet wide which is quite a bit smaller than you'd normally see on a big set but you can still do a lot with them I use the Silk a lot as a ounce or to soften over a headlight or as a diffuser for bigger lights and I use the flag all the time to get a little bit of negative fill on someone's face or block out a window or whatever it's not the same as having a 12 by 12 or 20 by 20 frame flying over your set but as always you need to make these compromises if you want to take this stuff on the road and considering the whole thing folds down into this pretty small package it's a great solution that can really help to bump up your production value I personally added a second silk to the kit and I've been thinking about getting a third frame as well but the standard set will go a long way with the mini grip kit you can get these things into a ton of different positions and really start shaping light instead of just dealing with whatever's there there's not a lot out there on YouTube about this kit but I'll link to an older review video from YouTube OG Dave dugdale if you want to learn a little bit more about them if you need something to cover a bigger Source then the road Rags can handle I also carry a cheap Amazon shower curtain and a big sheet of duvetine duvetine is basically fancy light absorbing cloth but you can also just get a piece of felt from your local fabric store if you save money with the shower curtain and a piece of duveteen you can either soften or block out big windows that the smaller Road Rags can't and I keep a piece of each in my grip bag the only challenge with these things is that you have to figure out how to secure them in place and sometimes gaffer tape just isn't strong enough and that brings me to the last piece of travel grip gear I'd recommend most dock Shooters keep in their kit and those are our clamps or a-clamps or spring clamps these are a different type of clamp than come with the Matthews mini grip kit and they use Springs instead of a screw down system to keep pressure on whatever you're clamping these clamps aren't anything special and you can get them off the internet or for most hardware stores but it's amazing how useful they can be I keep a few different sizes in my kit bag from these big heavy duty ones to much smaller ones and I've used them all the time Beyond just hanging big pieces of cloth they can also help keep cables off the ground or hold gels in front of lights or even put small lights in weird places they're really cheap and so throwing a few different kinds in your bag is a no-brainer trust me you'll find a way to use them and that's it with those five items you can get some amazing results and go from having to deal with whatever natural light you find to shaping and controlling light to get a more intentional and specific look on your next shoot I use this stuff most often when doing interviews which is a huge part of filming documentaries but they can also be super handy for just sneaking in an extra mic or small light into a verite scene as well plus you'll look like a pro when you're pulling all these things out of your bag and in the end isn't that the most important thing of all of course of course oh and I almost forgot about my possibly favorite piece of travel gear of all time this thing now imagine you've spent two hours setting up all this stuff and you have your interview location looking great you're almost ready to go when you realize there's nowhere for the director or whoever else is doing the interview to sit or maybe you're in a remote location and there are no chairs for your subject to sit on that's when you whip out this guy and Save the Day this is a collapsible and adjustable stool that holds up to 260 pounds the adjustable height means you can match the eye line with your interview subject pretty easily and then when you're done you can just collapse the whole thing throw it into a bag it might seem silly but finding a seat without a big back in a remote location can be a real Challenge and I've come out looking like a hero on more than one occasion for having this thing around toss one of these into your grip bag and you'll be truly prepared to set up any interview no matter how little stuff you have on hand when you get to the location super nerdy I know but I absolutely love this thing getting some basic grip equipment in your kit will help you level up your game and every doc shooter can benefit from having these basic tools I take all of these things on pretty much every shoot and it's rare that I don't use them even better grip gear doesn't go out of date like most cameras do so once you have a good setup you can keep it for a long time to come hope you guys found that video helpful and if you did think about subscribing it helps the channel a lot and if you did like that one maybe check out this other video I made about gear I used to film in harsh environments see ya [Music]
