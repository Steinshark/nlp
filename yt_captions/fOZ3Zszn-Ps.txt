I am standing here in the midst of Medora are the most amazing places in the world really is a testimony to what the human the human desire to come close to God will lead to so in this place there used to be over 20 monasteries up on these mountainous Stellas now there's six left after the different uh attacks by the Turks by the Nazis people tried to destroy that but despite that we still have these monasteries up in the hills they used to go up in baskets people used to to to be taken up into these monasteries and the monks wanted to come up to be closer to God and you know we can think this is a superstitious thing you know what is this silly idea of moving up uh a little higher to be closer to God but there's something about ascending the mountain there's something about going up on the hill standing up in the these monasteries and looking out over the horizon gives you this amazing perspective you know this this this High perspective where you can see everything lay itself out in front of you and in some ways you do feel like you have a little glimpse of the perception that God has over us and so these monasteries were built starting in the 13th century beautiful Fresco amazing uh amazing architecture and it's still alive today the monks are still there all the the the monasteries are inhabited by monks and they still have Services still have liturgies uh it's a it's really astounding I was very fortunate to be here uh through rson college we're a little team here amazing people during Peterson is here Stephen Blackwood is here some of you have seen us talk on The Exodus seminar and had this chance to go through the history and the relationship between the spiritual tradition of the West and Greece so we started in the the Pagan sites we went to see where the Oracle of Deli was we're able to see the temple to Apollo and now we're moving into these Christian sight and seeing these high places dedicated to the one true God as both a break from the Pagan past but at the same time very mysterious continuity of the the human mind coming closer and closer to understanding its place in relationship to the infinite um and so the discussions have been just astounding and meeting the students from ralson college has also been to me very touching ralson is doing something in this moment is doing something amazing which is rekindling the love of our ancient Traditions rekindling the love the life of language of culture of history and bringing it to young people and to just see their exuberance in discovering these Treasures it is something that is has gives me hope uh for the future so it's been it's been amazing amazing to be part of this why do we need monasteries so this is difficult for minor people to understand that the world exists through sacrifice this is something that the Ancients understood kind of grasping at it trying to understand what it is why is it that we get the sense that we can give certain things up and we give them up a bu and life comes back down and there was always an unease about that about that practice at the same time all the cultures did it but you can feel as you look at the thinkers and you look at the philosophers they become more and more une easy about this practice but there's something fundamentally true about it what we discover in Christianity is this capacity to give ourselves up and when we give ourselves up it has the very same result in a in even a more powerful way as the ancient sacrifice so these monks give themselves up to God to prayer you know to a life of aestheticism to a life that gives us an example of what is possible someone gives all their attention to God and so on the one hand they're saving their soul but on the other hand they are also acting as living sacrifices for us examples lights at the top of these Hills that people can look to and see what is possible and in their little way make the right sacrifices not necessarily ever coming to being an aesthetic and to living celibate but in those little moments when we have to give up our time for our children or or give some time to help the church to the local community it can have these little lights showing us uh you a direction to take and so monasteries acted like fulcrums for society they acted like these pillars for the rest of of reality and so there's this weird intuition that even here you know uh being in minora you can see that the monasteries literally go up on these pillars and and are at the top of the world so that people that come by can look up and see that Living Sacrifice and happening in front of them what does it mean to you to be here I've been I wanted to come here for 20 years and I I I mean I am ecstatic I I just feel so much gratitude to have the chance to be here to have have the S to stand here and watch the sun go down and see these monasteries you know struck by light it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen and also as an artist some of these frescos and these churches are are painted by famous iconographers the only place where you can see these images and this you know you can look at the pictures of churches and pictures of Fresco in books but it's nothing like standing in the space and being surrounded by the space so standing there in those Chapel surrounded by the frescos you know is to me it's really one of the closest things I can imagine to being in heaven and so yeah it's it's bit astounding and you know and also being with friends and and discovering this Wonder together you know my wife is here with me like I said Jordan is here Steven and I met some amazing new people that I'm that I'm coming close to and so there there is this sense of that being together and participating in something that is unquestionably one of the most beautiful things we've ever seen you know it also brings us closer together strangely uh because we can share that wonder and that Jo together in what sense people watching this around the world on the internet can and are participating in the life of the monasteries here so you know it's a there's a hierarchy of of participation you know and so when when I saw these pictures in books there's something about even these videos online they're like little scenes right they're like little scene men are planted out into the world that can pull us in a little war and hopefully you know seeing even online seeing hearing my story seeing these images in books or on the internet can give you that little glimmer of hope so that you can yourself move into those beautiful spaces not necessarily here it could be here but there are many places where this beauty is given up to God churches all over the world that have that have this this this like insane exumer of energy and time and people dedicating their lives to something which for a secular person looks like a waste of time how eff is this why would you build a silly thing at the top of a hill and you have to pull up rocks and pull up things but that's people will understand the power of Bey and up putting our attention to the highest you know it's uh it it can be a little thing to pull us in into those spaces and and then appreciate our church and even those that we have in America and in Europe appreciate our public spaces and and and work into making our lives even in the comet as beautiest said it is pro these were partly built in defense against the the opman the occupying forces now today as we think about what it might mean to live them Astic tradition in today's world how can we how can we live that how can we create these moments of defense that will become those beacons you're talking about and so I would say what's interesting about this space these spaces is that they are fortresses right they are definitely high places that to protect ourselves from the en kingom but they are not only defend place they are not only places to defend they are are also celebrations of all that is most precious to the people built them so in defending themselves and not just doing it out of a reactionary desire to stop this or stop that but the real highest aspect of what they're doing is the celebration of all that is true and beautiful and I think that that can help us understand what it is we have to do now which is that if we complain about The Madness of culture that has very little effect what we can do and what we should is rather enter into it enter into the memory of our ancestors into a memory of our own cultures and the beauty that has brought us where we are now and now make it alive again not as something that's just seen in a museum but that's something that participates in life and that's something one of the things of Ron is to like these Classics these old texts this dity this Homer it is not just something to be memorized know like like an anthropologist or some cold uh desire to break it down in its elements but it's rather something that's it's food for the future it's something that you can take that you can bring into yourself digest and then produce new things new beautiful things that are deeply connected to that whole stream that is brought us to where we are now any final thoughts you want to share thank you this is what I want to say thank you for letting me participate in this
