Happy Pi Day everybody this year we're 
going to calculate pi experimentally   with a vehicle losing control we are at a testing track at an undisclosed 
location in North America because a viewer   reached out to say that they work in incident 
reconstruction so they show up after there's   been some kind of traffic collision and they look 
at the markings on the road and any other evidence   and try and reverse engineer how fast the vehicles 
must have been going and in doing that they use   Pi so instead of starting from the beginning 
knowing pi and then calculating the speed a   vehicle was going if we already know the speed 
of the vehicle we can work backwards and get pi   this can't go wrong so yeah I'm a trained 
Reconstructionist for three years now so   we specialize in training and math formulas 
for Collision reconstruction so when you have   a construction you have the before during and 
after When we arrive at the sea and The Afters   there so you have the vehicles in place based on 
the physical evidence on the scene and the actual   damage on the vehicles you can do the during 
what happened during the collision and what   we do is use formulas to try and bring it back 
to the before to find out where people were and   how fast they were going so I was watching one of 
your pi videos and I was thinking to myself as a   collision Reconstructionist surely somewhere there 
is pi in these formulas and lo and behold there is   before we do find pi let's have a look at 
the map that Eric actually uses so you've   got a car it's getting out of control while it's 
turning and the tires leave like an art skid mark   as the car continues to turn while skidding 
and by measuring that skid it's possible to   work backwards calculate the initial speed 
and that is where the map comes in and you   know what this feels like a perfect time for 
some calculations calculation time all right   so we need to derive the equation which takes 
a cast getting out of control and gives us   the speed at which it must have been going 
originally and then later on we'll squeeze pi   out of that don't worry so here's what we know 
if we've got a car that started to slide as it   goes around a corner so I'm going to draw my car 
I'm just that's the car that's the ground I know   that's going to make car people very angry I'm 
simplifying things a lot in fact this car is on   a single tire so I'm going to draw one tire 
right in the middle of the car there you are   classic classic car with one tile because it's 
mathematically equivalent to what we're trying to   do here now if that car is going around a corner 
it needs a force to like push it like there's got   to be a turn turning force and if the car is 
skidding the only turning Force available to   keep it going in a corner is the friction between 
the tire and the road so our centripetal force   to keep it going in this way that's the well 
it's the velocity of the car squared times its   mass divided by the radius of the corner it's 
curling around and the friction you're getting   out at the other side here that's whatever 
the the weight whatever the mass of the car   times gravity pushing it down into the road times 
whatever the coefficient of friction is that's   that situation car is sliding that's the force 
from the skidding tires which I've approximated   as one tire and that's the force we know it must 
have been experiencing because we know the radius   it was curling around we're just going to put all 
this together we can already get rid of the mass   and the mass we can move the radius over there 
and so we end up with an equation which is the   velocity the car was originally going equals the 
square root of gravity times radius times friction   and that that is the number one equation for what 
we're doing here if you know what gravity is which   you should you know the radius that the car was 
following as it was spinning out of control you   know the coefficient of friction on the asphalt 
multiply them together take the square root and   you get the original velocity however Collision 
reconstruction let's go one step further they   make this even more user-friendly by messing 
around with the value of G allow me to explain   let's say instead of velocity which at the 
moment we're going to have in feet per second   you want speed in miles per hour well there are 
5 280 feet per mile and there are 3 600 seconds   per hour so that conversion will go from feet per 
second into miles per hour so we need to get our   original formula from before instead of G being 
in meters per second per second it's going to be 32.185 feet per second per second I know I'm 
upset as everyone else okay and then there we   now got the radius and the coefficient friction 
so we can do is take all of this Chuck it inside   the square root here by squaring it cancel 
it all down and that actually comes out to be 14.962 it's so close to 15 it's ridiculous 
so what we can actually do is say say that   the speed in miles per hour is just the square 
root of 15 times the radius in feet times the   coefficient of friction you just plug the numbers 
in and everything drops out neat and tidy because   we've messed around with this value in here so 
that is exactly what we're doing today we have   a professional driver in the car and they are 
going to Skid the car out of control in this   exact way inside the car we have a camera filming 
the speedo so we can let it go back look at the   footage and calculate the exact speed the car was 
going when it lost control and the point where it   loses control is defined as when the skid marks 
from the back tires cross the front tires and   so that's the point we're looking for in the 
markings on the tarmac once we've found one of   these skids we can then get down to work and up 
until now this is what Eric would normally do in   one of these situations here however we're going 
to deviate slightly because we're kind of avoiding   accidentally either using or going past pi along 
the way let's say you've got this nice skidding   out of control tire mark like that and you want to 
work out what's the radius of the curvature what   Eric would normally do is take a cord back over 
here like this measure that distance also measure   this little distance here and using those two 
distances it's a reasonably simple bit of geometry   to go back to whatever the radius must be if you 
completed that entire curvature and Eric was kind   enough to show me how they would normally do this 
the marks they look for the measurements they take   however we don't want to do any of that no no no 
no no what we're gonna do instead is complete the   circle so we're going to fill in the rest of the 
circle as if this I know the car did a full donut   we're going to measure that complete circumference 
which did involve putting a string into the ground   and then measuring around but we're avoiding 
that the point is we now have the circumference   we can then use the speed and work backwards 
to get whatever that radius was purely from   the calculation not from measuring it we divide 
one by the other give us some pi we use one of   those wheelie measuring out things that they would 
normally use to measure the cord to go all the way   around the circumference once we had that value 
we could now take the speed of the car which we   can get from the footage and use that to calculate 
what the radius must have been oh as long as we   know what the coefficient of friction was we've 
extended the skid marks into the full circle   measure the circumference although you wouldn't 
normally do that would you no no no no no that's   like the worst way of doing it what we're trying 
to do is avoid accidentally getting the radius   along the way because we wouldn't we don't want 
to accidentally use pi and traditionally you just   calculate the radius and then carry on with your 
life correct right so we and and we could have   just measured this accomplishment already 
so that big circle but that's not the point   we're using the cast skid marks and the speed to 
get Pi now the other factors we have to include   uh first of all is the coefficient of friction 
where the car lost control so here we've got a   40 pound test mass and what are we going to do 
with this so you put it down on the pavement and   the direction that the vehicle was going you put 
the scale on there attach it right and we want the   kinetic coefficient of friction correct so 
there's actually a little I remember oh on   that yeah and do I have to go like perfectly so 
you want to get it as level with the ground as you   possibly can like this you don't want sine and 
cosine getting in the way exactly story energy   takes more energy to get going than just once we 
get it going I get into a steady state yeah and   you read it off and you try to get it as close 
to the ground once I get into it there you go   so it's about looks like 26 26 ah and it weighs 
40. so 40 pound weight 26 so it's 26 over 40.   52 65. it should be about 0.7 okay point so 
0.65.7 dry asphalt like this is about 0.7 oh   okay but it's kind of an angle so sometimes 
it'll the ground we're going down the grid   okay right sometimes in the great the grade you 
actually use in the equation sometimes right but   if you're doing the drag or sometimes we'll 
actually get the vehicle itself and skid it   out and find out how much you know if you got the 
vehicle why not just use the vehicle to find out   you know at 30 miles an hour breaks how far yep 
reverse back if you have that option but if we've   done that measurement like going down the slope 
and everything that sort of kind of factored in   the gradient and this correct assuming the tires 
are this you know there's little variables because   that tire may not be the same tire that was on 
the car stuff like that but it's an approximation   that we use yeah I don't allow me but for the 
uh historical level of precision calculations   we good we good right and do we need to worry 
about the gradient this way so normally you   would but it's such a it's it's not as bad like 
you do the super elevations what it's called   yeah really banked curves right for his it's not 
terrible because it's a test track we kind of try   to keep it controlled well I tell you what let's 
just don't worry about it that's fine with me okay   so we got our coefficient of friction we're going 
to ignore the gradient yep let's calculate pi   we now have all of the results we ran out of time 
to do this properly on the day but it's okay I'm   joined uh by Eric through the magic there we go 
uh the magic of East telecommuting in to this pi   day okay so Eric I've got here the uh the classic 
equation yes sir you've now got all the values for   this yep we're going to fill them in we're going 
to get a pi okay right so uh what was the speed   in miles per hour that we had at the at the moment 
of skidding so the speed at the moment of skirting   was uh calculated to be 25 miles an hour okay 
so we've got 25 I'm gonna put the units in even   though they make me a little sad uh 15 is 15. now 
now radius we're not doing anymore correct because   we want to get pi and we've got the circumference 
so what did we get for the total circumference if   you continue if you like expanded that skid all 
the way around correct so yeah when the when the   car continues to Skid around the circumference of 
the whole circle was 382 feet 382 feet all the way   around okay now ah friction so the coefficient 
of friction we dragged that heavy thing what   were our units oh what were our values for that so 
the dragster good mass weight 38 pounds and then   the force that the force it took to drag it across 
the asphalt was 26 pounds so 26 over 38 will give   you 0.68 26 over 38 0.5 68 yeah which is unitless 
I will yeah because the codependent of friction   is just what you multiply the downfalls by to 
get the sideways force so we're just dividing   one by the other right give us our coefficient 
of friction okay so you know what I'm going to   rewrite uh everyone's favorite equation in a 
way that's going to spit Pi out for us a bit   easier so we're going to do now is put our values 
in there and we get this Pi days value of pi okay   uh Moment of Truth we've got 15 times 382 times 
.6 I don't know it doesn't matter how many times   I do this I get nervous every time yeah I know 
divided by you know what scientific mode there   you can do it all at once in Brackets 2 times 25 
squared close brackets equals 3.117 that is way I'm glad I resisted working it out between now 
because I love it I was like if it's between   two and four right very very happy 
3.12 I think that might even drag my   um my average track record closer 
to Pi uh there we go that's amazing   everyone also shows that just how useful these 
equations are for calculating the speeds of   vehicles because they're really Just Energy 
equations which conserving energy is all we're   doing so yeah exactly and I mean obviously we had 
to dance a lot to avoid accidentally getting or   using pi along the way right so it's include 
physical this is ridiculous yeah exactly right   so if we just done your process of measuring that 
chord and getting the radius straight away then   this drops out and what I like actually is having 
that 15 I know I'm very disparaging about this   but having that 15 with all the unit conversions 
like neatly packed up in one number right yeah all   you got to do is measure the chord to get the 
radius drag a heavy thing yeah take the square   root and it drops out already in miles per hour I 
think that's right which is very disappointed as   possible yeah exactly that is absolutely amazing 
I can't believe in what arguably sounded like   the most ridiculous way I've ever attempted to 
calculate pi that we got that close that's so   good all right we're gonna uh let Eric get back to 
their real job which is a bit more useful um than   whatever my real job counts has Eric thank you so 
much you can go back to reconstructing collisions 3.12 everyone please use that for the remainder 
of the year and those of you who keep track of   how good or bad my Pi Day calculations are 
you can put 3.12 into the mix and rounding   up to two two decimal places there you go 
excellent huge thanks to Eric and all the   other undisclosed people at the undisclosed 
location they were so accommodating absolutely   amazing they can get us in on their test 
track and thank you to you I'm talking   to the people who are going to volunteer 
to help me out next year little heads up   it's going to be doing pi by hand year and I 
might be over ambitious which will require a   lot of volunteers people who want to come and hang 
out with me and do a lot of tedious calculations   possibly for several days if that sounds like you 
there is a link to the volunteering form below in   all honesty thank you very much to my patreon 
supporters they are the reason why I could   travel to undisclosed location via undisclosed 
means of transportation at undisclosed cost but   I can disclose it was thanks to my patreon 
supporters that this was able to happen and   indeed next year will happen so thank you so 
much to them um here's some of their names
