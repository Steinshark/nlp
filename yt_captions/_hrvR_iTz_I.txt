asml and his partners had to overcome many challenges in order to make uv lithography a reality for instance in a previous video i talked about the euv light source and its double shot technique but while challenging that had not been considered one of euv's deal-breaking issues a greater struggle was how to achieve a zero defect rate for the euv photo mask or reticle i will use the two terms interchangeably here the uv reticle contains the chip design any defects on the reticle larger than a certain size will show up on the printed wafers themselves so in order for it to work it must be truly perfect in this video we look at how asml managed to overcome this ultra-critical aspect of the technology but first the asian armature patreon early access members get to watch new videos and selected references for them before their release of the public it helps supports the videos and i appreciate every pledge thanks and on with the show the euv reticle or mask is a mirror on its surface is a protective capping layer and a mirror layer a multi-layer brag reflector made of 40 to 50 alternating layer pairs of molybdenum and silicon the mirror layer sits on top of a substrate of low thermal expansion glass the essential point for this substrate is that must be extremely clean and stable over a wide range of temperatures the chip design data pattern is applied onto the mirror layer using two to three layers of an absorber chemical perhaps a metal compound of tantalum titanium or nickel so uv light reflects off the reticle like a patterned mirror and creates a cool reflection onto the wafer during use the reticle is loaded into the uv machine and secured using an electrostatic clamp the sensitivities are so high that a particle several microns high can negatively affect the reticle's flatness as it turned out the biggest technical challenge wasn't making a reticle mirror that reflects enough uv light there are a number of other mirrors inside the machine's optical system and they have to be just as reflective but the reticle mirror needs to be more than just a regular euv mirror it has to be a mirror beyond all uv mirrors incredibly smooth and flat so that it can properly reflect the data layered on its surface defects print defects that print ruin wafers no such defects can be allowed there are four general types of mask defects particle process absorber and multi-layer defects particle and process defects are issues that can occur in the fab as the name implies these occur either because of stray particles invading the mask or flaws occurring in the fab process absorber defects are issues relating to the absorber layer of the reticle these are actually kind of interesting but out of the scope of this video fabs and technicians are familiar with these first three categories of errors not to say that they aren't hard or present new issues but people know how to deal with them but the fourth class of defect well this is new multi-layer defects relate to the mirror layer and how it reflects uv light there are two sub-categories of multi-layer defects amplitude defects and phase defects amplitude defects are particles or pits on or near the mirror layer surface these can be created during any of the mask cleaning or polishing steps during the exposure step amplitude defects absorb uv light causing contrast issues between itself and the surrounding mirror areas phase defects are more nefarious these are bumps and defects on the surface of the mirror layer many of these come from particles or pits on the substrate surface which then get layered over during the deposition steps phase defects are arguably more sucky because they are very pronounced and as a result are very printable a phase defect as small as one nanometer in height or depth can print onto the wafer there are two overarching processes involved in making an euv mask first you produce an euv reticle blank that is free of information after that you pattern it with the chip design applying that uv absorber layer we mentioned earlier this second patterning step is done largely the same way as with traditional 193 nanometer photo masks e-beams and all i talked about this in a previous video while still challenging most experts agree that the secret sauce isn't making the blank accordingly you can break these processes down into about 30 named process steps applying the absorber layer comes late in the sequence right before blank protection and packaging and shipping the rest are related to making and processing the blank or its substrate cleaning steps alone make up some 20 of the whole sequence the most ideal situation is that the euv mask blank is made without any defects but while mask makers are getting better at making blanks there is a reason why zero defect blanks are still referred to as champions if you only accepted champions then your mask yield rate the percentage of usable mask blanks would be abysmal and that would further raise the already absurd cost of euv for euv to work we need to be able to find and mitigate blank defects in the early days we inspected for euv mask defects using dov light but the mirror layer is so reflective that such tools cannot detect defects if they are located deeper than 2 to 13 layer pairs within the mirror layer so the only light capable of penetrating enough of those multi layers is the very euv light used by the system itself this is called actinic light the system's active wavelength using actinic light means having an actual euv light source available to inspect a blank or mask there are many issues associated with this method but actinic blank inspection is logically the most credible way to inspect the mask blanks it took many years to develop these inspection tools the most notable of which was developed by an alliance of two japanese companies laser tech and idec based on a concept advanced by japan's national institute of advanced industrial science and technology this is a large tool over 4 meters wide and 5 meters long it is like a little euv lithography machine all by itself there is an euv light source that reflects off a set of euv mirrors and illuminates onto a small portion of the blank about a square micrometer large the blank naturally reflects the light back if there is no defect then all of the reflected light stays in what is called the bright field but if there is a defect then that defect scatters a light causing it to enter what is called the dark field if your dark field scanners pick up any uv photons then you know your blank has a defect laser lasertech's pioneering academic blank inspection tool the abics e120 caps 20-plus years of research and development the tool received various awards throughout 2017 and 2018 for its breakthrough nature they aren't perfect notably they can't inspect the substrate surface where many phase defects originate nevertheless these tools are a critical reason why the industry has been able to drive down the number of mass blank defects over the years once you find a small defect the ideal outcome would be to fix it but how do you do that unfortunately there remains a lot to do here in this field different defects require different repair methods let's go back to our original definitions amplitude defects are bumps on the surface due to particles embedded near the mirror layer surface so repairing the defect means taking out the particle thereby restoring the mirror layer's reflectivity studies have found that you can take out up to 20 mirror pairs and only lose an acceptable amount of reflectivity this can be done with either a focused ion beam which is a real thing and not something out of star wars or e-beams phase defects start on the substrate at the bottom of the mirror layer stack these are far more challenging to fix and they haven't really come across a good method yet i read a study published in 2002 where they tried banging a face defects bump back down it sounds like something out of a saturday morning cartoon and as expected it did not really work with euv you have a great deal of smaller defects so finding a tool that can fix even the smaller ones is essential probably the current industry standard tool for doing this is carl zeiss's photo mask repair tool merit which uses a low voltage electron beam to fix lines and finally one last thing you can try is mitigation defects on the blank interfere with reflectivity so why not make it so that reflection does not matter reposition the chip design in such a way that you put the absorber layer right on top of the defect this is called pattern shift and it works but special eda software is needed to pull it off as well as knowledge of the defect's exact shape and nature but again that is possible thanks to actinic blank inspection older lithography employs the use of something called a pellicle it is a thin organic film that physically stretches over a metal frame about 2.5 millimeters on top of the pattern mask to protect it from stray particles ibm invented the concept back in 1977 and the industry quickly adopted it a few years later traditional duv pellicles were made of thin polymers 99 transparent to radiation but for euv pellicles engineers had to reckon not only with the fact that most materials strongly absorb euv light but also that the light has to go through the pedicle twice once before it hits the mirror and a second after it reflects off of it this doubly reduces the uv light intensity by 81 percent or 90 squared the weaker the uv light the less throughput the uv machine will have that in turn raises the amount of capital expenditure depreciation per wafer making them more expensive starting in 2006 asml led a widespread search kind of like a britain's got talent for a suitable uv pellicle finding that pellicle turned out to be one of the more difficult technically challenging aspects of achieving uv the first serious candidate for the task was again silicon some silicon compounds abilities to absorb uv light the fancy term to use is extinction coefficient is relatively low scientists were able to fabricate silicon-based honeycomb mesh membranes about 10 nanometers thick a remarkable achievement by itself at those thicknesses it would be theoretically possible to reach the 90 uv light transmission threshold however researchers discovered that silicon measures become fragile after they get exposed to high powered amounts of euv light and heat when that happens they start to wrinkle research was eventually halted people then looked at graphene a carbon-based nanomaterial that can do everything except leave the laboratory 100 times stronger than steel it has high thermal tolerances and is very transparent to euv light but asml could not grow enough of it without serious defects when asml first demoed its alpha demo tool in 2008 no suitable pellicle had yet been discovered that met all the requirements so asml decided to take a dual approach with their next few scanners a more traditional system with a pellicle and a quote-unquote clean system without one the latter required extensive work tracing through the entire supply chain to make sure no particles were added during assembly and shipment additional engineering work would be needed to prevent uv plasma particles from reaching the mask and we need to do a great deal more inspections which means less time for making wafers super mafan the best pellicle at the time was from the aforementioned silicon approach a thin film made up of polysilicon and silicon nitride that ranges from 25 to 55 nanometers thick it kind of met asml's needs but in a 2016 paper asml was still encouraging industry partners to find a better solution than what they had luckily however imek and others eventually hit upon a suitable solution carbon nanotubes first investigated in 2015 these are carbon atoms rolled into a tube they are 96.5 percent transmissible to euv light and are 10 times stronger than traditional fibers the pellicle is made up of several nanotube layers you mix them together into an ink and spray them onto a surface because of this they can be used to tune the properties of other materials for instance adding carbon nanotubes the aforementioned silicon nitride pellicle gives it increased strength and thermal conductivity or just use a freestanding solution made up purely of carbon nanotubes they are extremely customizable which is exactly what asml was looking for uv stretched the very limits of what many thought was possible what asml and the rest of the global semiconductor industry managed to achieve here i am reminded of the elon musk quote during an everyday astronaut video at spacex we specialize at converting things from impossible to late euv was late up to 15 to 20 years late but the amazing thing to me was just how much transparency they gave throughout the whole process during their presentations asml explains their technical challenge their final goals and presents their expected milestones towards it in the lithography and semiconductor world today there is no aha moment instead it is a long slow trudge but that is what makes the final achievement so special all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel
