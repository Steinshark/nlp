ladies and gentlemen it is my pleasure to provide to you yet another video where Magnus Carlson absolutely obliterates every single individual in his path and we all relish and enjoy the Brilliance throw me up on your iPad smart phone whatever it might be put me on the ledge in the shower so you listen to my voice as you wash your hair for the first time in a week folks it's the last day of the super bet rapping in Blitz being held in Poland and Magnus Carlson yesterday got back to amazing form by absolutely Buzz sawing his way through his opponents and today we will watch him do it once again sit back relax and enjoy your brief flight to Norway Magnus begins with the Karo Khan defense a man after my own heart I am the Magnus Carlson spokesperson so much so that the pinned comment in yesterday's video accused me of being a brown noser which for the adults watching you understand what that means and for the kids watching it just means that I colored my nose with a crayon that's what that means but this was Sensational stuff thank you Magnus for playing a car on defense against Mexico one of the best players in the world E5 Advanced Cairo we have an H4 H5 system this is the advanced variation tal looking for G4 and so on Magnus doesn't let White have any fun Bishop D3 and Magnus plays this in a way where he gives a check and then he trades the Queens right away this is a very uh normal way to play the system uh the critical move here that tells Black's entire position is to move Pawn to E6 and the point is that if black were to capture it's not just that you are doubling your pawns it's also the fact that your king is wide open so what usually happens is black takes the queen first and then after white recaptures then black will play Pawn takes E6 however in this case white plays Pawn takes Pawn check first and then doubles normally doubled pawns are bad against Magnus Carlson they are especially bad and now here come the knights but white has a lot of activity white has good squares that they can explode in their opponent's position but you know for a human being these positions are actually surprisingly difficult to play yes the king is on G8 yes extremely passive definitely looks a little bit weird 96 Pawn to G6 and Magnus plays Bishop G7 with some pressure over here he liked to play Knight f8 King F7 so what does mvl do he just takes his Bishop puts his rook in the center and plays the move Pawn to G3 Pawn to G3 is is a good move because you are enabling the movement of your knight but it could be a little bit weakening then I don't have three could be uh could be under Fire um but after rookie won here here the computer really wanted white to play Bishop D2 and Bishop B4 which is okay more on that later King to G2 A5 and Magnus is not in any way shape or form in this position equipped to call the shots uh so far it has been a very nice positional game from Maxime I mean he hasn't done anything revolutionary but Maxine now plays Pawn to B3 and this move gives Magnus the the tiniest of ideas so this is the position Magnus is playing Black his opponent doesn't really want to allow A4 and also maybe wants to put his Bishop on his diagonal so he plays one pawn move this one pawn move without exaggeration seals White's fate one bone move you say Levy what are you talking about that is not possible well K8 you see this is still going to happen that's still going to happen mvl really doesn't want that to happen so he plays A4 but he already played B3 so by committing the pawn to A4 now that square is weak now this is a backwards Pawn Magnus plays rookie 8 Rook A6 and Rook B6 one pawn move seal the Fate One pawn move just one pawn move gave Magnus a Target and now white is trying to you know there's a little bit of shuffling here he brings his King back Knight G5 Knight comes here you try to trade the Knight off this is White's best piece knight says no King slides forward defending the structure and now one pawn move decided the game B5 Here Comes Magnus white only has 40 seconds on the clock you get tangled in this web it's like being in a grappling match with Habib nurmagomedov UFC fans know what that means if you're not a UFC fan it's like being absolutely dominated by the king of the Savannah rookie five I just plays Rook B8 just building behind that pawn just building to fight on the queen side take take Rook to B3 a square that was only weakened because White made a little bit of progress on that side of the board Rook A3 mvl tries to break out with G4 Magnus consolidates mvl continues to try to break in look at magnus's King being protected by the horses the horses will not let anything bad happen to the king now Rook A7 defending the infiltration the seventh ranked defense you are still up upon Rook A3 is on the way Rook A2 possible in the future Knight F6 check and a fork Maxime plays Rook B6 Knight F6 check and the Knight jumps from the edges of the castle to Fork the two invading Rooks mvl loses his Rook mvl resigns the game amazing defense Magnus was under pressure for 20 moves and all he needed was the tiniest window the tiniest window to instigate on the queen side once B5 happened you knew that you it was a wrap it was a wrap just move you knew great game but he doesn't always need to win positional grinds here he is playing the number two ranked player in Poland rather slavitashek this is in English Bishop G2 very complicated game very tense game but Magnus gets the two Bishops he has a very nice and comfortable position he unpins himself he's gonna play B3 Bishop G2 laser beaming down to that side of the board all right B3 Bishop G5 look at this look at all of his pieces beautifully positioned in the center of the board maybe he's gonna play E4 F4 bring the Rook F5 G4 G5 H for H5 hick G6 take everything H6 he comes back Pawn to F3 rookie one and I told you the pawns are gonna come all right E4 A4 taking as much space as possible all of this to say that he is building up this gigantic wall of Pawns he doesn't trade pieces all right sometime we have a little bit of shuffling he's finding his moment the Knight has rerouted to the center of the board this game will likely end when the pawns come down and when the Pieces come down and Black's King will disintegrate the Knight has centralized and targets the bishop Rook is centralized Knight comes back A5 knocking on the door you take now I take the Knight you take Knight F6 check hits the king hits the queen peekaboo and when it's all said and done the king side has absolutely disintegrated but the queen cannot do battle on her own so we have Knight two uh we have Rook to D6 Queen H4 here come the pawns and it is the pawns that are going to prove to be the difference makers because the more pieces you trade Knight E1 takes Knight G2 all of this good stuff the pawns will seal the fate of Black's King E5 rookie two good defense here by the way you may ask rookie too well if Rook takes then Queen G4 would have been a fork and this Pawn wall still repels the black forces King F2 Knight D4 he rotates away Queen H6 and I told you a long time ago folks it would be the Pawns F5 doesn't just attack the Knight F5 also opens an attack to The Rook and on top of that there is F6 if the Knight moves there is F6 and queen G7 made to come in the future black is losing a devastating amount of material and Magnus took a position where he had a dominant Central clamp he had the two Bishops he had far more mobile pawns and he used this to his advantage to absolutely disintegrate the black position from all sides I mean the move Pawn to A5 affects the King on G8 magnus's ability to combine these two squares together is just Sensational A5 matters because if black plays Knight takes there's a fork which means black has to play Pawn takes the move Pawn takes completely destabilizes this Knight and now Knight F6 check hits The King and I mean that's just oh my goodness is ridiculous a clean win now there were some games Magnus was challenged this is not going to be the first time that Magnus is challenged in this video he had games where he was sitting down to play the Sicilian Defense and his opponent his opponent wanted to take him out of the comfort zone he wanted to take him into an elephant Sicilian not just any alapan Sicilian and alepin Sicilian were as early as move 12 and 13 Bishop B5 is played you can't take because of this let me take the Knight let me take the bishop let me take the queen this is the position folks I woke up right around here it was like early morning here it was like nine not too early actually I'm just a lazy piece of garbage uh this was the position I looked at this position and I said Magnus is gonna win isn't that an incredible feeling like just to know Magnus will find a way he just will it's ridiculous completely and utterly ridiculous it's a 0.1 position if anybody's better it's white because there's three on two I mean that's not true it's equal but I'm saying like if this is not played correctly white is going to be better because white is going to create an outside pass Pawn Magnus plays F6 he plays this move to enable the movement of his Bishop otherwise Bishop G7 would have been possible also maybe he wants to play E5 white brings the king apparently an inaccuracy by the way apparently it was better for uh kiril shivchenko to Castle and put his Rooks in the center rather than the king Rook C8 Magnus brings his Rook to the center Rook do when he brings his Rook to the center both Bishops slide out of the way Rook C7 why yes potentially to offer a trade but also to protect the seventh rank from invasion A4 a very interesting committal Pawn decision now Magnus does not want to rush with B5 or A5 because he doesn't like making pawn moves unnecessarily and shivchenko plays A5 now that one pawn move completely controls magnus's Queen side in fact if Magnus plays a move like Rook C8 white is threatening to win the game here how this why infiltration why I will remove your Defender and even if I don't do that white is completely winning black is completely paralyzed so Magnus knows that and after A5 goes back he just goes back Rook A4 shovchenko is calling the shots in this end game Bishop B6 take take now it's Rooks and Bishops dead equal position Magnus down 20 seconds on the clock what you are about to witness is pure magic and as I said in yesterday's video you cannot spell magic without m a g King D7 E5 kicking out the Rook the king is centralized but it's dead equal King D3 Magnus pushes kiril protects against the advancement of the pawn the king is centralized but the Rook slides out of the way enabling the move C4 check the Rook slides out of the way enabling C4 check Here Comes Here Comes Magnus now a very big decision which of the white pawns should you move forward here to protect the invasion of the black pawns maybe none maybe just goes back Magnus plays H4 taking a little bit of space now we boot the king out of the position and we play the move H3 covering against any advancement Rook H6 rookie one The Rook goes back The Bishop's dance now chefchenko here makes a very committal decision he does not need to play this next move he could play the move Pawn to B4 for example but he sacrifices his bishop and he correctly evaluates that after this F4 he is winning back the bishop Rook D4 rookie five check King slides out of the way and Magnus is gonna win upon for his trouble but here comes Rook back to E2 now chefchenko here had to be brave he had to threaten the infiltration to the other side and after Rook F2 he needed to be cerebral enough to realize he ain't going back you ain't going back and playing a king and pawn end game you might lose you gotta be four you gotta be forward thinking you got to be brave you got to be brave excuse me you have to give a check first and then you have to be brave Rook D7 you need to deflect the king from the defense of the g-pawn and then you need to go here but chefchenko backs up and what you never want to do against Magnus is set off the smell of blood chefchenko was not bleeding at the board as far as I know I didn't ask I didn't see any images Magnus is a shark the second that you go backwards against Magnus Carlson it's over G5 I'm not trying to do a gara of the sand impression from Naruto King B4 Here Comes Magnus again chefchenko in this position needed to understand the concept of time he does understand the concept of time what you don't understand is having 20 seconds on the clock against Magnus Carlson and he's just won 12 of his last 14 games Pawn to B4 is what was necessary and even then it's still a complete headache defending this position he goes with his King his King Ventures out onto the Scenic Overlook on the highway G4 take take King C5 G3 rookie 8 infiltrating Rook F2 hunting down the remaining pawns those pawns are going to collapse but it doesn't matter the pawn is coming according to the computer Magnus could have played Rook H2 and there was a cleaner way to convert this end game it wanted him to do it in a slightly different way like after the move Rook h8 the computer wanted him to just go Rook G2 Rook H4 and King F3 very difficult to understand all of these subtle details but I think it's because you're winning the pawn Magnus misses that because he has 29 seconds of the clocks trying to hunt them down again stockfish kind of kills the Mystique of Magnus it just says they're like um 3700 for a human these positions are extremely difficult to defend the pawn is going to Queen and chefchenko resigned he resigned because after the move Rook to G8 there is Rook to G4 and magnus's queening I told you in this position I knew that Magnus was going to win this game what I did not know is how he was going to do it the way he wins this game is completely utter it's nonsensical it just doesn't make any sense nonsensical doesn't make any sense yes terrific terrific explanations oh my oh my oh my next game they weren't all like that though Ricard report plays the trumpowski folks the next two games are Sensational don't go anywhere we'll be right back it'd be really funny if an ad ran when I said that but it it I mean that would be very funny frompowski opening from Rickard report good development for both sides this is the early starting position report played this in a very provocative way he refused the trait of Bishops by giving black the more powerful Bishop like this I don't know if I agree with that but report has a very deviant style of Chess he kind of does what he wants so what he does it he might win games then it'll be brilliant sometimes the opposite Knight E2 Knight E4 we have a trade and Bishop takes E7 sets off one of the strangest tactical combinations I think I've ever seen in my life Bishop takes Bishop Knight takes D2 for sure the best move in this position is King takes why because after this your king is safe You're Gonna Go rook ae1 and you're gonna castle and it's like you just Castle there's nothing but Rapport is a deviant man and in this position with both Queens hanging report plays Queen takes F7 which looks like a over the board Mouse slip but he sacrifices his Queen to win the queen back here's the problem though Magnus does not need to take the bishop it ain't Checkers bro he just gets out now report has to move his bishop and in that time Magnus takes the pawn and not just the pawn the Integrity of the entire Pawn structure is now compromised Pawn to H4 Knight back to C4 and it goes from bad to worse as in this position report plays the move Bishop to F4 and loses the game on the spot he had to put his Bishop on E5 but he puts the bishop Here and Now with tactical sequence finishes the game Knight A3 Rook B2 take take the Avalanche comes down Knight to B4 resigned he resigned because if he takes he loses his Rook he resigned because of this or this it's a fork and the move Rook to D2 looks like it solves your problems but after Knight to D3 you lose anyway because if you play King to F1 Knight takes F4 there is a pin and you could not take me back if Knight to D3 and King D1 you will play Knight takes F2 and winner Rook for free and a Frog D2 Knight D3 and you take of course you lose 20 moves headshot dead and it all came down to the final game of this tournament Magnus Carlsen with the white pieces young shishtov doodle with the black pieces if JKD wins this game he might win the tournament he's a point behind Magnus he needs to beat Magnus with the black pieces what do you do if you have to defeat Magnus Carlson with the black pieces step one play a completely terrible opening why because terrible openings give advantages to your opponent but they make them play on their own so your opponent cannot force a draw if you hand your opponent in an advantage they can't just force a draw that's exactly what happens A6 it's looking like a five-year-old is playing this opening but it's a necessity because if Duda played a main line Magnus would have killed the game and he would have won the tournament step two get your queen trapped in the center of the board Magnus is now completely winning on move nine not only is he completely winning Magnus is going to win a rook in the corner of the board it's plus two Queen D4 looking for a queen trade the game must be over Duda plays B5 now in this position if Magnus had just played Queen C5 check followed by Queen C7 and something like this and just castled he would win this game within 25 moves the game would be over weird openings make you do stings let's play day five but all of a sudden Duda was back in the game Duda with G5 on the board is suddenly not even worse wait a minute is Magnus gonna lose the last game of the tournament and potentially the entire tournament Rook a 2 Rook B8 Duda is fighting back like a madman we have an endgame it's Rooks and Bishops one guy has two Rooks one guy has two Bishops remember though Duda has to win Bishop F3 by Magnus compromising his Pawn structure and now Duda plays B3 look at magnus's pawns tripled b-pawns doubled f-pawns and a loner H Pawn and he's down nearly two minutes on the clock this is one of the worst Pawn structures ever seen in human history and it belongs to Magnus Carlson normally Magnus Carlson is doing this to other people Rook B6 the pawns are traded Magnus is left with two bozos all right two folded up bicycles that cannot be unfolded this is utterly ridiculous meanwhile the man on the other side has an armada he has a spaceship of Pawns they're all gonna fall down the board one Pawn Has Fallen Bishop to B6 Magnus is not playing this for a win I just hope we are all on the same page now of course he has a mobile b-pawn but right now it's being well protected but does Duda have it in his Arsenal to simultaneously defend the end game and now play it for a win as Magnus gets it down to Bishop and four versus rook and two the only man that can win this game is named yankova and he is playing with the black pieces and if he is able to win this game he is going to win the tournament let's turn off the eval we know that the evaluation is equal here we go King F4 E5 Bishop D4 Bishop C5 here come the Pawns Bishop D4 Magnus is down to his final Pawn the three pawns have arrived now you will notice I will turn this on just for a brief second it's equal King F4 E4 down to your final two pawns that's it can the bishop and the two pawns defeat Magnus Magnus looking to defend as black is making forward progress Bishop B4 the king is cut off but the pawns and you'll notice that white is threatening the sack he's threatening to sacrifice Rook A3 King B4 uh oh oh oh Magnus has lost the game ladies and gentlemen Pawn to D3 the pawns have made it through youngster of dude is winning the game the pawns have crossed the third rank Bishop to G3 the wrong direction apparently Duda needed to go this way he needed to get the bishop that way and play E3 as fast as possible why because the move Bishop G3 allowed this move and now you can't push the pawns as fast as possible and after this Rook G4 and I am pinning you just in time okay Rook d8 you got the king in but that's not that's not what you need we keep shuffling is there going to be another chance for Duda King E3 E5 right we're we're nearing 100 moves magnus's King is feeling bold Bishop F4 Bishop D4 is there anything Magnus might screw up we've crossed 100 moves we've crossed 100 moves we're shuffling back and forth 110 moves we go due to looking for a break oh wait was it right here B6 was winning because after Rook E7 apparently Bishop C5 and deflecting the king Back The Rook back and help onto E3 and apparently this is the winning setup why because white has to make a king move if the Rook goes away it's E2 check so because white has to make a king move after E3 like King to C1 you can get in here with the king and the pawn as fast as possible one move on move 116 duda's final chance he misses it the players Shuffle Rook H6 one Pawn Has Fallen that's it Magnus Carlson wins this tournament he did not lose a single game in the blitz portion at some point he won eight games in a row the goat is back now get out of here
