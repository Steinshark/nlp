hello everyone and welcome in this video we are checking out the 2021 ford mustang mach e now this is the premium version all-wheel drive with the extended battery so it's got about 270 miles of range and about 350 horsepower and in this video we're going to be focusing on 10 different features that i think are pretty cool so the first thing we're going to start out with is the exterior as a whole and so as i get into these features um you'll find out that while i think they're cool there are still some drawbacks and so we'll get into some of the drawbacks that go along with some of these features but starting out with the exterior uh you know i think it actually looks good and it's functional so they've done a couple things to kind of give this a neat looking profile and they've used paint you know where they've got this black coming in here as well as on the rocker panels and it gives it a bit of a slimmer profile when you're looking at the vehicle which is cool i think it makes it look good now here's where a small disadvantage comes in and so if you open this up and you look here you know from the outside you can't really tell there's a giant battery in there about six inch thick battery and then you open it up and then you can obviously see where that battery is sitting now what's the problem here well the challenge is you know i don't care aesthetically about this it's only when the doors open that you're gonna see that no big deal the challenge is their ground clearance so this thing only has 5.8 inches of ground clearance which you know it's a crossover it's an suv except it doesn't have crossover or suv ground clearance so if you're watching a review and someone is saying you know it doesn't drive like a crossover doesn't drive like an suv well there's two big reasons that are causing that first of all it has that massive battery that's very low so that lowers the center of gravity you don't have quite as much body roll the second thing is it doesn't have that much ground clearance it's pretty close to the ground so that also reduces body roll by not having all that much ground clearance for example i used to own a 2014 subaru sti you would probably classify that as some form of a sports car and it had 5.9 inches of ground clearance now yes that was a lot for a sports car but a sports car nonetheless 5.9 inches of ground clearance 0.1 inch greater than what this mustang maki is so yes it will drive and behave more similarly to a car which is nice the driving dynamics are actually pretty good you will definitely though still feel the heft this is a very heavy vehicle now as i mentioned there is function along with this form so it is actually a pretty sleek design it has you know a bunch of curves and things uh features to the exterior and yet a drag coefficient of just .285 another clever thing they've done is actually they have exterior shutters so this is pretty unique here often you know you'll see shutters on modern cars but they're recessed in and this is actually a leading edge of the vehicle you know it's got a design element to it and these are shutters that'll open and close for cooling and can change your drag by opening or closing open them up you get better cooling close them and you reduce your drag on the vehicle feature number two is something that i wish absolutely every vehicle came with and that is this keypad on the exterior i love that ford is still doing this in fact the car that i learned to drive on was a 1995 ford taurus and it had that keypad 25 years ago in fact ford introduced this feature in 1980. 40 years ago they had keypads to enter the vehicle and yes you can use your phone to get in you can use the keyed again if the you know the phone or key is in your pocket you can just come right up and it will automatically unlock you don't have to worry about it but you know there are a couple advantages to it for me personally often i'll come into my garage because i forgot something in my car and i'll go look in the car uh oh crap what did i leave you know i left something in there and then i can't get in because i don't have my phone or my key on me and if i had the keypad i could get in easy now that's kind of a rare use case because i'm dumb and i don't bring my phone with me to go into a car but one of the things that i think is real let's say you're going to the beach going to a lake going you know outside you want to do something and the ability to leave your phone in the car instead of leaving it on the beach while you go swimming leave everything in your car lock it inside the keys everything like that lock it all inside not have to worry about it sitting out somewhere or hiding your key somewhere i think that feature is absolutely incredible and i wish everything came with one of these keypads so that you could get in or you know to lock or unlock the vehicle right there just using the exterior and just remembering a simple code just don't forget that code okay now while we're over here feature number three we're going to talk about how you open and close these doors because of course since it's a new electric vehicle it has to be something unique and a bit confusing for people who have never gotten in it and have to figure it out for the first time i think in this case it's actually fairly easy you can push that button it pushes the door out for you there's a handle right there and you can open it and get inside in fact my wife thought that this was nicer and easier to use than the tesla model 3. she's like oh i like that it's simple there's a handle right there it's a decent handle even though you know they've kind of made it real small again going with that functional aerodynamic exterior now for the rear passengers to me it's a bit sketchy so here's her downside there isn't anything i mean you're this is literally what you're supposed to do like put your hand between these two spots which feels uncomfortable because it's like that's a pinch point right if someone bumps into this while you are grabbing it then you're gonna slam your finger into that door right there so i don't like the way they've done the rear here also once you've moved it and then you let go then it's kind of in this weird spot where you know there's not a handle to pull it out you have to push it back in then get that button again and open it so i'm not really stoked about the rear here also another thing with these you know this is an exterior thing you actually have to push it in order for it to open the door and if you can't push it let's say we get a sheet of ice over this well then it's not going to work out one thing i do like about it though is that they've incorporated locking the vehicle by just waving over that you don't actually have to touch it you can just kind of go over it there and of course it doesn't work when i'm showing you hey hey do that thing so okay there we go and i promise you it does work on the rear as well because it was just doing it this whole time hello hello hello all right let's give this one last try oh there finally it did it so you can lock it with absolutely any of these around it you can see that little lock symbol right there above it which is cool that it's built into all of them number four is cold weather capability so a wonderful thing about this maki is that ford treated it just like any other vehicle that they develop as far as the testing that goes into it so you know testing at minus 40 degrees celsius same as minus 40 degrees fahrenheit all the way up to 120 degrees fahrenheit and so this has been tested in the temperature extremes and it works and ford also says that it can actually start charging when the batteries between -10 and -20 degrees celsius which they claim tesla will only start charging uh if the battery is warmer than freezing and so in this case now i know you're typing right now you're like yeah because you shouldn't start charging below freezing i'm sure ford's engineers know that as well we're all on the same page so great but i think it is cool that they can charge at a very low temperature it's also working to heat up that battery when it is really cold so that it can start charging it a bit faster so able to start charging at around -10 degrees c also starts heating it with that process and then can increase the charging rate from there but either way they have developed this it's been tested minus 40 degrees and you know making sure that everything still functions now on the subject of cold temperature performance you can set a departure time so it will heat up your cabin to whatever temperature you would like and then it will also allow you to heat up the battery before you take off so if your vehicle is plugged in which should of course be left plugged in then you start heating up your battery before you leave so that you get maximum range once you start to drive another good feature about this mock e for cold weather performance feature number five of course we've got to talk about very strong jason the frunk so here of course one of the really cool things about electric vehicles is that they are making trunks front trunks more common and with ford here they're saying you know this can basically be used as a cooler so there's a drain hole right there you can fill this up with ice put some drinks in there i think i would probably take out this kind of cheap tacky plastic storage compartment divider here but regardless a nice big space up front that you can fit some things it is worth mentioning that while there is an exterior seal you can see this rubber seal here on the hood it's not actually sealed so you know of course there's the drain hole so water can drain out if you fill this with ice and then also you know you can see your electronics down in there so if you have water sloshing that could potentially come up and over into that or if ford suggests us and you know fill this up with chicken wings a thousand chicken wings or something like that you might have some of that hot sauce spilling over and then also uh the latch for the front hood is also within this storage area so not exactly perfectly sealed what i think would be cooler cooler is if they actually took the hvac system and kind of hooked it up to this somehow so you basically had a refrigerator up front how cool would that be camping if you could use your battery to keep this front trunk cold and use it like an actual refrigerator that would be awesome of course expensive but you know i think it'd be a neat addition to have a rerouting of the plumbing that enabled a you know refrigerator mode and also if you actually had like a drain that you could seal rather than just having a hole that's you know kind of always going to dump everything out so i think it would be cooler if it was actually you know genuinely sealed and turned into an hvac thing but nonetheless very cool to have a front trunk you can put you know a bunch of ice in throw some drinks in there keep them cold for a good while feature number six now you know that i'm going to try and find a way to bring tires into the discussion what i'm excited about this is the premium so this has some larger wheels than the standard maki these are 19 inch and look how much sidewall they give you these are 55 aspect ratio tires fantastic i love to see it on an electric vehicle so many modern cars especially once you get into the premium trim levels you know they give you no sidewall and there's a couple advantages to this i think the reason why ford did this uh wasn't for the aesthetics because you know people seem to like very large wheels i think they did it for the aerodynamic benefit because the smaller the wheel generally speaking the less aerodynamic drag those wheels will create and thus you improve your range so you basically just want like a flat sheet here and by using this fat profile right here you know you've got that big flat region rather than you know these spokes which are chopping up and making that turbulent air so i love that they use these with these wide profiles but there's a downside these are 225 over 55 and this is a very heavy vehicle so it's it's extraordinary to me that they're using such a thin tire i mean this is the same width as on my crosstrek and this thing's probably got 1500 to 2000 pounds uh somewhere in that range on my crosstrek as far as the weight of this vehicle so these are very thin and what i imagine is going to happen is you're going to have some pretty decent tire wear because it's using you know a small contact patch and you're putting a ton of weight on them it was also rather easy and yeah it's an electric car so it's got a lot of torque but it was rather easy to get those tires to spin and it was also cold outside so i'm not just blaming everything on the fact that it has thin tires and these are of course all seasoned tires but it was happily ready to spin those things uh you know coming out of a corner putting your foot down the rear end's a bit playful and kind of comes out it's actually fun uh but just noted that as far as overall grip um yeah pretty narrow tire to put something put on something this size especially this weight number seven is the app and this is just the way that the future is going to be going i think cars are all just going to start having these apps but they're very handy so you can see you know on your phone your charge level how much range you've got you've got controls if you want to open up or close the windows you can open the trunk you can start the vehicle press and hold there and so it starts it up and then whatever you have that setting for for heating the vehicle it will start heating it the thing that i have not found and maybe it just doesn't exist is i don't see somewhere in here where it tells you the interior temperature or setting the interior temperature i think you just get three choices you know cool uh you know warm or or a bit warmer and so i wish you could actually see the temperature inside and set the exact temperature but nonetheless it is very useful to have this and have these controls all on your phone one thing that i do like is they actually have all four of your tires and your four tire pressures so it's neat that you can see that right on there and it also tells you what the recommended tire pressure is so it says recommended cold pressure 39 39 and you know on the left side we've got two of them at 39 and then on the right side perhaps we should add a little bit of air as it's cold outside and it's gone down 38 but cool that you can see that tire pressure right there it's something often overlooked and i think putting on an app will help people say hey i need to actually go add air to these even though this says do not use as a tire pressure gauge which you shouldn't you should just use a gauge when you refill it but hopefully this lets you know hey they're low fill those things up number eight is this massive lovely touch screen which we have in the center here and i'm not going to go over you know all of the features within this because that's incredibly boring but pretty much if you're coming from you know most older vehicles this is going to be a huge upgrade you know it's it's quick to respond for you know your button touches uh you put hit little ford mustang icon up top and that gives you all your vehicle controls and then you can hit this guy right here basically like a little home button and get to whether android auto or apple carplay and i love that you have wireless apple carplay in here so you've got access to spotify waze and google maps and you have this massive screen for it all wireless the second you get in your vehicle it's connected it's set up you punch in your destination fantastic i love the incorporation here of apple carplay keeping it all simple because if you hate everything else about this infotainment screen you've got apple carplay which is simple and easy to use and you've got your apps right there big and easy you know even someone with gray hair like myself can find them and read what they say for number nine let's make some people angry but i think this is actually really cool so for number nine we are talking about artificial noise uh using the speakers to make this carp sound i guess cool or different sound different than it actually does sound because electric cars are pretty quiet so if you hit your little car icon here you can see we are in unbridled mode we've got our three driving modes engaged whisper and unbridled this being our you know fastest most extreme mode and here you can see propulsion sound so if i hit that little info button uh you can see propulsion sound is generated to enhance the driving experience and so they actually pipe in these noises from the speakers to make it sound different now why do i like this well i like it because it has this on off button and i think that's amazing so for the people that do like it hey you push a button you turn it on for the people that don't like it you push the button you turn it off i love that you can choose because some people might think it's fun and if you do great now you can't really have a problem with them doing it because they allow you to turn it off what you can have a problem with in my opinion is the noise that they chose because to me unbridled sounds like an exhaust like it sounds like an engine running and hearing the exhaust from the inside when you put your foot down [Music] so that's a strange choice to me like this is supposed to be the future and then we're trying to make it sound like a combustion engine and i don't think maybe ford's saying this doesn't sound like a combustion engine i don't know maybe maybe it's just my imagination that it sounds like one but to me it sounds like exhaust like it sounds like kind of you know a meaty exhaust that you would expect from a mustang except this is an electric one so why are we making it sound like i don't know maybe if there was a choice of something cooler and surely maybe in the future there's an update that you can make it sound like cool space noises or you know there they have unlimited options as far as what they could have chosen and then have this futuristic thing that sounds like everything that came before it it's like wait what why why are we doing this so i think it's cool that it's there i think it'd be even cooler if there were options of what you can make it sound like and i love that you can turn it on and off number 10 i am very excited about now i don't know if you all know about spare tires it's this thing that cars used to come with uh where if you got a flat tire you just go to the back you actually had a whole extra tire that you could use to replace that flat tire get to the tire shop get a new tire you're all good and so what i'm very pleased to show check us out we're looking in the back we've got the cargo up pop that oh so i thought because the floor was so high that we actually had a spare in here but unfortunately we do not so that's a bummer like all modern vehicles it doesn't have a spare but that doesn't mean that there's nothing exciting about the rear back here there's a couple neat little things the first is this little easter egg you can see a little ford mustang right there in blue between the overhead lights so that's more exciting than a spare tire right and it goes out so there's only a brief duration that you can actually see it while it's lit up and then it goes away so a nice little easter egg there another nice thing that they've done with the cargo tray or the cargo area is they have this cover and you know these covers are pretty common you'll see them on all kinds of different vehicles but usually they have rigid mounts this doesn't have a rigid mount and it's not actually rigid itself so the whole thing is flexible so what i like about this is it actually works well as a cover to cover up your cargo however if you have something that's weirdly shaped you know this entire thing is flexible and so it can just you know distort its shape so that it matches whatever you're sticking in the back you don't have to worry about things not fitting well so a cargo cover yeah i know it's it's not a spare tire we're all sad good news we've got a bonus round so for number 11 uh yep going above and beyond that's me uh we've got this heated steering wheel i absolutely love heated steering wheels i think they are the nicest luxury feature that exists i'm sad that my tesla does not have it and my tesla was more expensive than this vehicle and it didn't have it so i absolutely love heated steering wheels i wish they all came with it also out of curiosity obviously this video was filmed and recorded a bit differently than i usually do reason being is i didn't have much time with this car and so i wanted to kind of knock out a video and talk about the things that i wanted to talk about and not worry about all the time that it takes to film and so i did it with a bit different style using this handheld camera now was it horrible to watch did you get nauseous watching from all the movement i was actually very impressed with the stability of the camera i think the audio is good i think you know obviously it's a bit grainy as far as the the image quality but that's because i'm inside a garage and there's not all that much light but overall i'd be curious to hear your feedback on filming in this style is it okay is it acceptable because it was actually a quick way of filming which i appreciated and i was able to you know i didn't have this car for all that much time but i was able to film in a style like this and get an extra video out pretty quickly thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below
