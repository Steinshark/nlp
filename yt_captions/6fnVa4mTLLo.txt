ladies and gentlemen I have beef with chess.com do you remember mittens the chess bot which captivated the world in early 2023 of course you do well I pitched that chess.com should have dog Bots they've had other Bots since the mittens and catbots but I wanted them to feature canines why because I have one of my own and he is adorable and his name is Benji some of you know that some of you don't just.com listen to me sort of you see they turned Benji into the lowest rated bot of July 2023 . he started off as a 300 ELO bot that's disrespectful I wanted Benji to be the highest rated bot and potentially challenge mittens in a cats vs dog Showdown and they listened to my idea and then threw it back in my face but what they also did is they made Benji trainable and the more that you play against Benji the higher rated Benji gets him he will get higher rated as the month goes on in fact today I was just sitting around on my couch and I noticed that he was already rated 1600. this is Benji this is a photo from today this is very adorable I'm telling you that objectively you don't even need to give me your opinion of this this is my doggy and he is now currently rated 1600 and so in today's video I am going to play the bots of chess.com for the month of July and I'm going to play my own doggy in chess maybe he will make a guest appearance but if not then he will make one in a future video the Bots are wish boy rated 950. buddy buckets like is that after Jimmy buckets that's actually very funny if it is and if not then it sounds interesting uh Benji who is currently rated 1600 uh pinky who's 1750 and ponchik ponchik is the final boss of the month of July until Benji takes his soul hopefully uh ponchick is the lovely dog of Levon aronian uh armenian-born Grandmaster and panchik still has the Armenian flag his father has since changed his Federation to the United States but Lavon aronian one of the best players of the last some 20 years so that's what we're gonna do uh I uh I'm gonna start with the white pieces and we're gonna play Bots from 950 to 2600 and they're dogs so adorable hey kids today we're learning about the 1978 World Chess Championship between Anatoly karpov and vixor Court snowy you literally won't believe what happened um I didn't ask Pawn to D4 we're starting off um D5 all right um I guess I'm gonna play a Queen's Gambit I'm gonna play a Catalan with Knight F3 and pawn to G3 the idea is to feed and Kettle the bishop on on the diagonal like this and then short side castling uh this bot is playing a semi-slav defense this is crazy um wish boy is playing a triangle system defense in the Queen's pawn and now they take on C4 I leave this here for now I have multiple ways of winning it back first of all I can win it back with the Knight second of all the queen third of all this night that's not a good move because you need to develop the other pieces that if you're gonna develop the queen early in the game you need to have a tangible reason to do so uh I can play Knight E5 and now I'm gonna take this and attack the queen I I don't really know what wish boy is doing so that that now I'm now I got my Pawn back and my Bishop is very strong the queen moves they're attacking my knight I can move it again or I can try to make progress in the position the queen is always comfortable on C2 in the Catalan it helps support the center uh don't put your knight in front that would be very tragic I think I'll develop my Bishop threatening to take an opening up uh wish boys King uh wish boy protect against that and I guess we'll just finish development like this um everything is okay Knight G4 I is there a threat to this move not really um so I'm gonna Target the bishop it can't Retreat anywhere actually which boy just moved the Knight and then uh all right well that's just the free Bishop for me then now you probably missed this the queen is attacking the pawn in the night right it's also attacking this so I'm up material it's a good idea to trade pieces I just want to go play Benji just want to play Benji Pawn to E3 I could have defended this Pawn I forgot about it he won't take [Laughter] Rook A4 uh Knight E4 when you're up material you should trade all right we're trading pieces and I'm threatening on H7 oh Queen guards and now the bishop comes back and we'll come back this way and I think I'm gonna put my knight on E5 or not uh I am threatening this that's very nasty by me uh which boy didn't quite stop it got a little bit lucky there but I'm gonna attack The Rook if the Rook moves anywhere it's made okay The Rook did not move anywhere um I guess I'll just give a check and win The Rook like this so now I am up two Rooks for a bishop you're gonna win these Pawns easiest way to win this is to simplify and take as many pawns as possible uh we're gonna take this on the next move and uh he can take okay he does take which boy getting cooked trash has bought I mean just kidding which boy you're adorable remove come on wish boy it's just a matter of time or some to the D file some of you may be confused how to win this position because like if the King goes here you might accidentally stalemate yeah like if I push this it's a stalemate which is kind of ridiculous um so you need to always make sure the King has some Breathing Room uh in this case this in my opinion is the easiest way just put the Rook back you can take it as long as the king is just cut off and stationary yeah it's easy and now I'm gonna win exactly as I should which is by promoting uh two nights and then delivering a checkmate with my rook and my two nights so we're gonna go here we're gonna go here cut the king off I'm gonna bring the Knight we just have to not give a stalemate maybe I should make another night what do we think about that I'm gonna go here here and promote another night there we go because he's not resigning I'm gonna you know what I want to make another night how about that I'm gonna make four nights against this bot that's what it gets is it needs to find the resign button now it's stalling all right now I got a lot of nights so I gotta not I can't stalemate all right the king is cut off which is nice I'm gonna bring my king so my Rook is defended could have cut the king off again yep like this now we're gonna bring the horses check and that's nice that's share yes no I I don't want to share that was awful uh GG's though all right buddy buckets uh I got the black pieces this game and Benji's next um all right we'll start off with the Karo Khan against the 1350 bot I'm 2800 Queen age five doesn't make any sense against the Cairo because you can't even put your Bishop here so now I'm just gonna develop right this is why the form of Checkmate doesn't work against the Karo Khan um if you take them this so I would just recommend developing the Knight first to hit the queen and you could push you could you could do a lot of things here um I'm gonna develop my knight it's not the best move but it is what it is and now I'm gonna develop my bishop and I'm gonna develop my pawn and my other Bishop okay so this move blocks my Bishop but now takes away the natural developing square of the Knight which is nice for me so white has kind of gotten in his own way it's also a dog wow H4 on the way this is really aggressive stuff wow okay well uh I could play H5 I could also just play H6 I mean I there there's nothing here there's nothing I was very aggressive but in fact I don't even have to Castle I think my opponent has played very poorly and I can already start firing but I'm gonna play principal chess with the King still in the center I can open things up yeah it's a good move we'll take uh and now I can play for rookie 8 and E5 I could have maybe also just played E5 I can also play here that's just a terrible move I have no idea what this bot is doing now we're gonna open up the center which is very principled with the King still there Queen A5 is next D4 always looking very nice uh rookie three looks nice rookie three looks really nice but I'm gonna go here I think they're ah then I play rookie one oh predicted it uh check uh I don't have a check or a check but I guess I can take the rook and then take the pawn and uh that's actually Checkmate by the way if I if that happens so we're gonna trade and take the bishop and I am up a lot this bot was worse than the other bot let's play A5 A4 maybe I could have brought my Rook it doesn't really matter oh no my my knight no don't take my night I don't take my night I don't know double check oh no rugby one that's Checkmate oh okay that bot was awful they're really bad at identifying a strong 1300 Baht I don't know why the bots on 1300s are so unpredictable now it's time to play my dog in chess Benji I raised you well you're up to 1600 now let's see what you got for me ladies and gentlemen bark food bark walk food sleep let's bleach they better have made this voice lines good or I'll fire whoever made this bot I I do not work at chess.com no I listen to Folks at chess.com watch my videos and I don't want anybody to think like I'm their boss none of y'all work for me please don't my dad is so funny each night after we put on our matching pajamas we train chess puddle puzzles until the sun comes up I'm so lucky my dad wrote a book for me to chew up you son of a you better not eat my book all right I'm gonna play the Vienna does Benji say anything about the Vienna no F4 Vienna Gambit versus my bot my dog not my butt my my dog bot Benji plays Knight C6 this is the Vienna Gambit declined and um Benji takes on F4 Dad gives me a treat every time I move the little toy forward I still don't know why adorable um I I guess I'll play D3 I want to take this Pawn back okay Benji does not want to get it's exactly like a stick on the street by the way it's exactly how he acts uh Knight to D5 I want to take this Pawn back with my knight Bend you please thank you thank you thank you very much uh now we're gonna go Knight takes here and I I think the position's about equal we probably have a slight slightly better position black has some damage pawns by black I mean my bot my dog why do I keep calling him my butt this is a fork but Benji I don't think you should I mean I can go Queen C1 but Benji I don't I don't don't be greedy Benji don't take this Pawn okay very good now I'm gonna open up the center you see Benji didn't hassle so yeah now I can open up the center and that looks very dangerous don't take with the bishop all right but this looks really nice I mean look at my Rooks laser beaming uh I want to go here but first I need to do this and if check I have D4 and then I take and Benji's in serious trouble I think oh Benji I really don't mean to beat you in chess Benji it's looking really dicey but there is this it's not over it's not over but Benji's not gonna Castle anytime soon oh but Knight E5 the Haymaker Knight F7 night night that hits the queen ah this looks really unpleasant but again not over yet Queen B4 Maybe yeah and then and then and then maybe Knight F7 okay now I like this I like the fact that Benji can't Castle that's good Queen B7 this looks really nice yeah the the cutoff of the Kings and the oh that's a nice move but I have check I have check and I can come back to take the pawn and I think I am in good shape Knight C6 looks good knight F7 looks good knight C6 Knight E7 if I move my knight I think I think I'm just gonna just go take the pawn and then I'll play Knight C6 and now I feel like I'm threatening a lot of very unpleasant things here for Benji uh Rook D1 Rook d8 is that oh 97 oh Knight E7 oh he stopped Knight E7 look at Benji stopping that that's really nice what a champ he's still gonna lose but you know he's still gonna lose but at least he's putting up a fight he's trying to Checkmate me I mean you gotta love it look at this incredible stuff that's made on the board um I can take then here and I actually yeah I mean if I If I sacrifice I guess I have to go here wow good fight Benji you put up a good fight but unfortunately now dad has to win the game um gotta pay the bills that's a rook Fork yep and that's next dad didn't teach me that move yes I did yes I did stop lying big wolf says Benji all right Benji out of respect I am not going to uh play any in a disrespectful manner I'm just going to promote to a queen this is a sad moment I'm gonna beat my dog takes do I still made him out of Mercy uh no no GG Benji that was good that was you put up a good fight I look forward to playing you when you were too good and and you can you can you know you can beat me uh yeah it was a nice game where I I got my Pawn back from the Gambit and I and I thought I did a nice job here it's important to attack in the center of the board before your opponent is able to get safely castled and I think I demonstrated that pretty nicely with my prying away the queen from the defense of the Pawn on D6 um it was a good game uh and Benji played well but unfortunately I am very good at chess and also very handsome also a great dog dad all right now we're gonna play the 1700 and then we go up a little bit to 2600. um I want to play a Dutch I'm working on a Dutch defense course I have many courses but I'm working on the Dutch defense um a lot of fun lines in the Dutch one of them is the Leningrad I've played this quite a bit castles so when you play F5 G6 and then you play D6 will the bot go here okay bot does that that's fine but you really should be pushing your C Pawn out um but okay I mean there's nothing really and there's nothing like horribly wrong with this uh uh E6 Knight C6 Knight C6 D5 is a little bit unpleasant but I can always play E5 in fact now I can play Knight here to hit the bishop and that prepares E5 doesn't that just hang a pawn am I okay first let me take the bishop because that was my plan and isn't this just a am I missing something I feel like I am because I I so in the Dutch you need to be careful about these checks to your king at Knight F7 which can be a bit a bit annoying and queen C4 is definitely a thing like the bot is uh being a little bit unpleasant here for sure um if Knight D4 Queen C4 E6 E3 maybe I have D5 then there's like Knight D5 no I I mean I that actually just looks pretty decent for the bot wow you have to play some stupid move like Queen E8 foreign which is just extremely annoying I'm gonna play E6 I hope the bot doesn't go here 95 if take then take wow if take then take okay okay take um I don't think that was the best move dude this bot is ridiculous by the way it's playing extremely well um I'm gonna go back to C6 I have to win this Pawn it's too strong it's too strong Knight D5 definitely expected rookie eight potentially if if I move my queen anywhere else I run the risk of of getting forked so I'm gonna go rookie eight rookie six the bot is just playing perfectly uh I saw that move coming and I was afraid because I couldn't do anything about it so let's go Knight to D4 if take take yeah I saw this E7 I guess I play Queen here and I want to go C6 next that is a mistake because I think that allows me to play Pawn to C6 and my knight is still defended by my Bishop whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what is that that doesn't make sense I don't think the Knight is still hanging and the Knight is still defended I mean I'm playing a bot so I'm kind of terrified but I I I don't think it's handling this the right way which is which is kind of a wild thing to say to a robot uh rookie seven is a is a move we can trade and then Knight G6 I can go out there but I also like this move just attacking the Knight it looks pretty reasonable okay I feel like we've made progress the bot still wants this but I can I can play G5 and I think the worst is over night H5 I think I can I think I'm gonna trade Queens and I can take one C2 I believe I mean easier said than done but we're gonna try it boys and girls uh now we come back I think this was a mistake too um and now maybe Rook C8 and here something like that get the pawn Rook C8 trading is bad yeah I think trading is not a good move we're gonna try to get this Fork pork yes yes we got a four oh now we're in good shape we take back the fork is still there I think we take this one although I'm not really sure there's a difference ah nice that was a poor game but it doesn't matter because you'll have no idea it looked like it was a good game it looked like I was under control we're gonna get the Rook to the second rank very important to paralyze the opponent's king uh and now relatively straightforward game uh oh I did not do that but uh should be easy attack the bishop everything is on a dark Square A5 A4 I'm gonna sack The Rook for the pawn and that's just game over you can't take it if you take it I promote yep I'm gonna re-center The Rook exactly like I did in the other end game and I'm just gonna Advance there's absolutely nothing the bot can do A2 is next or that and uh I don't promote I don't promote to anything except Brooks and knights which brings me to the final game the 2600 elobot punchik is it helpful if your dog dad is a 2700 rated Grandmaster good question um I'm gonna play D4 has defeated many Grand Masters this way after the game you are allowed to pet punchik twice no more no less pawnshop will not stop speaking in the third person you must play by punchek's rules okay um my favorite opening the Raptor variation C5 D5 Queen B6 I'll play Knight D2 we're playing a very aggressive way against the bot it's not gonna take this has taken that G6 sacrificing a pawn to open up the files alright this is a very very aggressive uh opening being played right now E4 so I'm down two pawns against the bot um maybe I can win and I can be a hero Rook B1 I'm down two pawns against the bot this is like very scary stuff three pawns I have sacrificed three pawns against the bot wow um Bishop C4 just for crazy amounts of development crazy crazy amounts of development here um I can take I think I can also just develop can also play like Queen G4 man every move looks good um I mean I think I am just gonna play Queen G4 Rook H7 is now one of my threats okay the bishop looks really strong and D6 is not possible Rook H7 looks so nice but then Knight E5 Rook H7 Knight E5 so I have to I have to finish up my development first but now D6 is possible okay but now I have Rook H7 can I also sack my queen for a mate that would be pretty sick but I don't think it works Rook H7 let's go Queen G6 my two pawns have been seized back and I can take the Rook next all right so now we're even on pawns no wait I'm still down upon I can't count it's okay uh go to Chas bad accounting happens I want to give a check and sneak back here but I feel like I'm for I'm I'm letting the King come out um and the queen wants to go back to F6 I definitely haven't haven't have a nice attack here I can walk my king over get out of the pin that could be an idea but night before could be coming um what do I do I don't want to take it's a little too early to capture that between h8 Queen G8 oh everything looks good everything looks good in this position I'm gonna I'm gonna play Rook B3 I'm gonna oh I Pung this Pawn what am I doing that was unnecessary over complicated it over thought it let's play Queen takes G7 that was bad I mean it's a very complicated game but no need to blunder pawns away King F1 that's almost mate which is I really don't like that E5 Knight G5 it's like am I getting mated am am I doing the mating I can't tell E5 I don't know am I mating am I losing King E2 okay Bishop B7 he said porn check that's funny uh chess players are such nerds um on check I Hate Everything um Bishop E4 I no no no no no no no no no no rookie three no this should be four what do I want in life what do I want check back can I make a draw I think I have a draw here check and queen back how do you guard the bishop oh my Bishop I I just get too stressed I get too stressed playing these Bots man I just I I just panic I just Panic oh that was so unnecessary now I'm just gonna lose oh now I'm gonna get slaughtered see this is why you watch me for entertainment and why you watch Hikaru to like actually defeat people yeah this just came over and nothing wow um form up for my own like ego I I just want to make sure that I like it really wasn't that bad of a position yeah I was like slightly better Queen C3 yeah here I had the idea to walk my king and you know the computer says it's the it's smart this was bad but this was also fine oh and the bishop E4 was the best move of course it was because my Bishop was hanging that's so frustrating I mean I I said this because I think somewhere in my brain it was like your Bishop is hanging you should move it and then I was like wait a minute I should just repeat moves because it's gonna repeat well that's kind of a bummer to end this video on but the good news is that Benji my beloved is going to probably get revenge for me uh and I and hopefully Benji soon will be higher rated than 1559 and um we'll take revenge on Pawn chick because that was ridiculous I Benji help your dad is a degenerate all right help me please save me from myself uh that's all I have for you today um maybe I'll try to fight Point chick again but in the meantime you know what you got to do get out of here oh and go play Benji
