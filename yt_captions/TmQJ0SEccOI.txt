I'm a little worried about Google's pixel three Excel amidst a growing number of smartphone sporting 4000 million power batteries or more this thing comes with three four thirty can having a stock version of Android Pi make up for it we're gonna find out welcome to the battery test so today we're comparing for smartphones the pixel 3 Excel samsung galaxy note 9 - 10 s Max and something we've never tested before Sony's Xperia x3 and before we get stuck right into it I'm just doing a bit of calibration here setting all the phones to the same brightness same speaker volume with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on just to make the test completely fair I've gotten picked up new versions of every device here so all of these phones have had less than three charging cycles so we started a test off with Instagram nothing too heavy and you'll notice that all three Android phones especially the Sony on the right-hand side seem to be dropping charge a lot faster than the iPhone and really this is nothing alarming this is just how I os displays battery percentage and be ready for it to accelerate downwards as the test goes on even after 20 minutes of Instagram Sony is already on the back foot here having lost already six percentage points things are looking good but to really try and exemplify these differences we're seeing let's try something a little heavier Ark survival evolved for those of you who don't know has basically been imported from consoles and PCs and is one of the most taxing games on a phone right now and for the sake of clarity the default resolution on Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 is 1080p but for the sake of making it a fair test as far as possible I've put each smartphone on in maximum resolution which is to say that the pixel the note and the Xperia have a pretty equivalent number of pixels on the display but the iPhone lags behind about 30% less then again that phone does have the largest display here as 6.5 inches and as you might know lighting up these phones displays is pretty much the biggest strain on a phone's battery so that's a big enough difference to be significant right now the pixel is trading blows with the note 9 pretty surprising given that that phone has almost 15 percent more battery capacity there are a couple of potential explanatory factors the first one of course being that the pixel is powered by Android 9.0 which does come with battery and efficiency improvements whereas the no 9 is still stuck on Android 8.1 the note 9 also has a slightly larger display to push not to mention 2 gigabytes more of RAM and I've done a lot of battery tests with a note 9 phone and I have found that when it's on 1080p the default setting battery life is amazing but it does take quite a hit when you move it up to quad HD plus all right so a couple of heavy games down and the trends don't really seem to have changed somehow the pixel is still ahead of the note 9 and the iPhone is at 90% well of course it is so what I've loaded up now is a game called mobius final fantasy 4 which the first time you booted up asks you free for keeper byte download pretty horrific and at the same time as this download is happening we're also seeing this video being streamed which seems counterintuitive it would probably slow it down but nonetheless a challenge to the battery a lot of what we're doing here is a little more than how you might use your phone on a day-to-day basis but I guess that's kind of the point of the comparison I'm trying to simulate an extreme case scenario if you were to push your phone to the absolute limit which one would last the longest something else definitely worth pointing out is that if you look at the bottom of each phone all three Android phones are showing the navbar iOS has a much larger proportion of apps that fill the screen and in a sense here the pixel and the Samsung are almost cheating a little bit by having this black bar at the bottom of the screen there's a portion of that display that isn't being used and can effectively be turned off Android does have plenty of apps and games that will take advantage of the display and even on ones that aren't you can usually force the app to be full screen but I tend not to do that because it often distorts the image or cuts off bits you need for a bit of a change of pace what we're doing now is opening up the camera on each smartphone to record 4k video I was actually kind of surprised with the pixel 3 that a phone with so much power doesn't actually support 4k video at 60 frames but a second so we've recorded at 4k 30 and opened up each file in a video compressor one of the more demanding things you can do on a smart phone having a look at the battery percentages again you can see that while the Sony phone's battery capacity is comparable to the pixels clear it's battery life isn't Google and Samsung's flagship Tsar still at each other's necks here which credit we're due is pretty good for the pixel it's better than I was expecting but you might say the biggest surprise here is how well the iPhone is doing now remember on iPhones the second 50% Falls much faster than the first but also there are a couple of reasons why the tennis max should theoretically have advantages over the Android phones it's the only smartphone in this test powered by a seven nanometer chip which is quite a significant cut down from the ten nanometers you see on the other three the other thing is that iOS 12 what the phone is running on is really really efficient the battery performance on any iPhone running iOS 12 per milliamp hour of battery is better than what I've seen on any Android phone I guess it's just a shame then that compared to most Android phone makers Apple skimps on the actual capacity itself on a bit of a side note I'm trying to make every single video better than the last one so for this video we've got completely new graphics every part of this test has been redesigned so let me know what you think to it and if you are new to the channel it would mean a lot to me if you could smash the subscribe button I've got a couple more pixel videos planned but also one on a phone that I can't talk about just yet it's really quite exciting as this test has gone on I've started to speed the timer up a little bit just to get things moving and now that we've hit three hours and 43 minutes Sony is struggling it's on its last legs and thankfully the other three phones aren't even close I'm not impressed by the sony the battery capacity itself isn't bad but even though it's running Android 9 like the Google pixel 3 is even though it's got only 4 gigs of RAM and the smallest display out of these three phones it's pretty much run out before we've even hit the four hour mark I actually kind of like the unusual way that phone looks and the camera is a definite improvement from its predecessor but as we've just found out that battery life alone is enough for me to not want to use it daily as the remaining phone's start to reach those lower percentages the iPhones lead still hasn't changed but the Note nines has in not a long period of time it's gone from being quite a bit behind the pixel to now almost having twice the remaining capacity so to simulate winding down at the end and watching some videos we're gonna open up YouTube one more time and this video I've loaded up isn't just a subtle way to stay on brand but it's also an interesting display comparison you'll see out of the three the iPhone has the least saturated colors it's considered a very accurate display but I prefer the contrast and the coloring on the galaxy note 9 we've now actually just passed the five-hour mark over an hour more than the Sony phone that makes all three of these phones pretty resilient although the pixel is literally just about to go now but even then at five hours and 20 minutes nearly that's not an embarrassing defeat by any means as expected that must have gap between the Samsung and the iPhone is now pretty much drawn to a close there's not that much in it at all so to finish off we're putting up a classic the original Angry Birds game it's one that has stood the test of time I actually find it quite refreshing to play a game on my phone where I'm not asked to buy a loot crate every 12 seconds and if we fast-forward this a little bit Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 ends up running out first but barely the iPhone is left with 2/3 percent by the time this happens that's the kind of difference that you wouldn't really notice on a day-to-day basis only really when you're doing a side-by-side comparison like this I think said that both of these phones completely nailed it they have the largest displays out of all four and we are well into six hours here really impressive for such a heavy test pushing on a little bit more at 6 hours and 16 and the iPhone finally calls it a day so let's quickly summarize the results and see what to take away from this right so xperia x head 3 was in last place not a terrible result but really not a very good one I would have expected more given that on paper it's almost the same as the pixel 3 then we had the pixel 3 and while I'm not blown away by the result I feel like this is crisis averted it's about as good as we could have expected given its specs this was followed by the node 9 which was a fair margin ahead I was really impressed with the way this phone performs the note 9 is one of the better flagship phones for battery and 12 minutes later the iPhone ran out so basically the takeaway is that the iPhone and the note 9 are the winners of this test between the two the result really depends on what you said Samsung's screen resolution on when you set it to max resolution it's pushing more pixels than the iPhone but it won't last quite as long and when he set it to full HD plus it's pushing less pixels on the iPhone but will last longer all right guys as always thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it my name is Erin this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
