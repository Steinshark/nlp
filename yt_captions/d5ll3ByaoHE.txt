a multi-billion dollar crypto bank is collapsing and i'm here to explain why celsius celsius celsius celsius celsius celsius network celsius networks this platform is celsius network definitely is one of the big ones in in the crypto space joining me now is celsius founder and ceo alex mashinsky the core business is to challenge conventional banking where holders can find decent yield at a time when traditional savings accounts pay almost nothing how is it that by doing nothing i can hold the usd stablecoin and earn close to 10 let me stop you right there you can't it turns out today we're answering all the questions what is celsius why is it collapsing and why don't they just convert it to fahrenheit honestly well i'm here to answer celsius is a place where you can deposit your cryptocurrencies in exchange for interest payments and they will turn around and give out loans uh and charge interest on that as well and if that sounds like a bank to you depositing and lending money i should clear that part up right away celsius says they're not a bank because banks are bad banks are not your friends we all know that and we decided to create a replacement for the banking system right something that acts in your best interest a place where you can actually have your money work for you not just you work for your money and basically three years since we launched the product we've paid a billion dollars back to the community wow that guy you just heard speaking is alex mashinsky and nobody hates banks more than this guy i mean look at his shirt how could his company which lends money and takes deposits be a bank when he has a shirt that says banks are not your friends weird foreshadowing actually in fact before we jump into this whole thing i need to tell you how much alex hates banks he hates them so much he says that banking and securities laws shouldn't apply to his company quote banking and securities laws shouldn't apply to celsius because cryptocurrencies are commodities this is from a great article by bloomberg and he says quote like a neighbor who borrows a cup of sugar then later gives back a cup and a tablespoon more that's right the normal rules shouldn't apply to him why would you regulate this humble little sugar lender well i can think of one reason maybe it has something to do with the 25 billion cups of sugar that celsius has under management wait i'm sorry dollars i got a little confused there and yeah actually it's not cups of sugar they're lending so much as it is digital dollars which it's kind of hard to say that lending digital dollars and lending regular dollars are not pretty similar things again i think most people would say the rules should apply to them especially since celsius is now collapsing and we do not know yet whether it will survive this crash or what will happen to its 25 billion cups of sugar but of course the big question is what is causing this collapse well it turns out for the past few months people have been worried about celsius's ability to repay customers back their withdrawals partially because of the insane yields that they were paying out for example if you were to deposit like a dollar at a bank you'd get a fraction of a percent of interest every year on the other hand if you deposited one tether or usdc at celsius they were paying nine percent per year on your money that's the same amount of money and celsius is paying out a hundred times the interest rate on that exact same deposit basically and the question is how is that possible right is this thing too good to be true and if it is when is it going to collapse well the founder mashinsky has been telling everyone that it's not too good to be true in actual fact the reason this is possible is because banks equal bad and celsius equal good he's quoted as saying it's the traditional finance system that's ripping people off by taking their deposits using them to make money and then claiming it can only pay tiny interest rates somebody is lying mashinsky said either the bank is lying or celsius is lying oof that aged poorly didn't it because despite him claiming that everything was fine things under the surface weren't actually so great see at least in theory the idea of celsius isn't like totally insane right banks do give tiny interest rates compared to what they make and celsius was charging fairly high interest rates to borrow their crypto like to borrow a stablecoin they would charge 12 which is more than they were paying to deposit it but the real problem is that no bank or new age finance company can ever loan out a hundred percent of what they have as deposits the reason is that if you lint out every dollar you took in you have nothing left to pay withdrawals back with and so you're left in this sort of conundrum on the one hand you want to loan out as much as possible to get the interest to pay your depositors but on the other hand you need to keep enough on hand to pay for withdrawal and that's all money that you're not making interest on which makes this whole thing kind of a weird balancing act lend too much you can't meet withdrawals lend too little you're losing money every month now perhaps to solve this money problem celsius created their own crypto token called sell which people could invest in this token in theory was supposed to lube the whole system up and make it work smoothly like a finely tuned engine it could provide liquidity where they needed it actually they literally described the system as a wheel according to machinski a wheel of fortune that keeps on giving according to him this was celsius's main business plan flywheel token economics he called it issue loans collect interest give it to the people lend coins collect interest on coins buy celsius distribute to members you get the idea money goes up forever well right up until it doesn't because in case you haven't noticed it's winter in june i mean checkmate climate scientists we are in a crypto winter okay and markets are all down and all of a sudden people start to get a little worried money doesn't just go up and so some withdrawals start to begin at first everything's fine the financial times reported a billion dollars flowed out from march to may no big deal right but as things continued things got a little shaky for celsius because all of a sudden everyone sees luna collapse in may which was because of unsustainable yields and you're looking at celsius like that kind of looks like the same thing but then worst of all the cell token which they created started to plummet now this is where things get bad because the cell token is like the grease in this flywheel remember it was how they were going to get out of their jam they could just always sell their little token and get the money to pay back anything maybe they had some deposits locked up right but if their cell token becomes nearly worthless all of a sudden small jams become much more dangerous so things are getting worse and compounding this problem a lot of deposits of theirs are locked up for example their ethereum deposits were locked in eth2 now this part of the story gets a little complicated so we're kind of grazing past some stuff that i may get to in a full postmortem i'm doing later but all you need to know for now is that they didn't have enough liquidity and they started to take loans to pay back for withdrawals this was documented by the crypto researcher dirty bubble media he would track the crypto that flowed into their wallets and started to notice that big exchanges like ftx started sending 50 million dollars in usdc to celsius all of a sudden and he would post this for everyone to see and it sort of became a vicious cycle the more the pressure mounted on celsius the more celsius would take out loans or try to find ways to pay for withdrawals but then people would see that and post it on twitter which would cause people to panic thinking that celsius was unbacked and as a result even more withdrawals would come which would again make them need to go out for loans i think you get the idea sort of the opposite of mashinsky's flywheel and eventually all of this became too much for them officially on june 12 2022 celsius paused all withdrawals swaps and transfers the idea here being if they can recoup some of the crypto they have locked up elsewhere they can actually pay for withdrawals and i get that this may have been necessary but this is sort of like the pilot in the aircraft saying don't panic but i'm putting a pause on the engines for a second i i mean everyone's going to immediately panic and the cell token plummeted another 50 in one hour from there this obviously compounds the solvency issue further because any cell tokens that they have are even more worthless not to mention it's unclear whether celsius has all the money to pay back investors so maybe they're just putting a pause on the inevitable meanwhile people start to crawl around the terms of conditions at this time they signed up to and they found something quite worrying they found the bankruptcy clause that was in this centralized like bank that's not a bank and listen to what it says in the event that celsius becomes bankrupt enters liquidation or is otherwise unable to pay its obligations any eligible digital assets used in the earned services or as collateral under the borrow service may not be recoverable so it turns out that when a bank that's not a bank takes your money the rules don't apply to them the same way i mean don't you get it when you were giving them your hard-earned crypto it was more like you were lending them some sugar cubes and i don't mean to make light of this or anything but their position is so clearly silly although i want to be clear that celsius i hope they make it through this not because they deserve to but because the investors who have their life savings stuck in there deserve to keep their money i mean if one thing became very clear to me while researching the story it's how many people dump their life savings into this once again coming from the bloomberg article quote as part of a contest in which customers shared their celsius story many said they entrusted celsius with their life savings one said he took out home equity and cashed in his work pension and his savings for his kids education to put the money into the company accounts i mean this is rough guys it reminds me a lot of the luna situation where people were just dumping ridiculous amounts of their money into it even a pension fund in canada actually participated in a funding round for celsius so they're exposed to this whole thing too it just looks really bad and so for all of those people's sake i hope that celsius isn't what it looks like which is bankrupt which is a weird thing to say about something that isn't a bank anyways that is the story of celsius i'll be giving a full post postmortem coming soon but i wanted to give some clarity around this subject for those of you who are listening to the news right now hearing what's going on thanks for watching subscribe if you enjoyed it and i will see you in the next one
