what if I said that if you calculated the area 
of an icosahedron then you compared that to the   official ISO specifications for the thread on a 
bolt so that's the ratio between how far apart   the different bits of the thread are compared to 
how deep they are you would find they are exactly   the same answer mathematically speaking I mean 
I would find that downright shocking if it was   something more like did you know that the cube 
root of the imaginary number I is the same as the   square root of 75 I'd still be a bit shocked 
but I'm like well they're both Roots I mean   one's imaginary one's real but I can kind of see 
how they might be linked or if there something   like did you know the radius of the sphere that 
fits around a cube is the same as the cosine of   30° I'm like oh okay I I can imagine I mean 
30° and a square or a cube is not obviously   linked but I can see how they'd be the same and 
this is what I love about mathematics unexpected   links between different concepts except in this 
case not only are each of these in pairs the   same thing but all six of them are exactly the 
same mathematical concept they all have these   exact same digits what is it about these digits 
that means that they apply to so many different situations right so what is going on behind all I guess it 
doesn't go back in behind all these situations   that mean exactly the same number shows up every 
single time or spoiler 10 times 10 times the   number same digits well we're going to start just 
with the icosahedron because working out the area   of an icosahedron made of 20 equilateral triangles 
is not that complicated we just look at one of   those equilateral triangles it's equilateral so 
we can Define every Edge as being being a single   unit long to get the area we now need the height 
and I now we'll split the triangle in half the   base is a half we can use Pythagoras to work out 
the height is uh the square < TK of three on two   and now we have everything we need to get that 
total area because as you may remember the area   of a triangle is a half times the base which is 
also a half times the height which is the < TK of   3 on 2 oh and that's that's half of it so we then 
need to double that multiply it by two to get the   complete area although the two and the half they 
get on real well they are they're gone so we're   left with that that's it it's a half of < tk3 
on 2 that's the area of one of these equilateral   triangles we multiply it by 20 to get the entire 
aedon again the 20 and A2 they can cancel out they   leave a 10 behind um and that's it that is the 
area of all 20 Faces of an icosahedron 10times   time the < TK 3 on 2 and uh guess what the < TK 
3 on 2 equals this is it so that's why because we   work out the area we get roo tk3 on two this 
number the mystery number this video is All   About Time 10 just shift the digits along one but 
that's all well and good how does that tie in to   the iso bolt well if you go into Wikipedia like 
I may have done and you get the diagram for the   iso specifications of what that bolt looks like 
you can see right in the middle an angle of 60°   and that's because the profile of the thread on a 
standard ISO bolt and the US ones as well it's an   equilateral triangle and that ratio between uh the 
height of that triangle and the distance between   them is well exactly the same it's the square < 
TK of 3 on two now technically we don't use the   entire triangle in the thread we take a little 
bit off the top take a bit off the bottom it's   actually only 5/8 of that triangle that the 
ratio is < tk3 on 2 and that's why this works   because we have the same equilateral triangle in 
the thread of a bolt as on the faces of our aosa   hedrin we get exactly the same number in both 
cases up next we have the cube root of I which   presents us with two problems first of all how 
are we going to get a equilateral triangle out   of that and second we already know what the cube 
root of I is it's netive I there's no root3 on two   to be seen because you can check this I * I * I 
equals I but there's more than one solution just   like if you were doing a standard square root and 
you're solving something squared equals something   else you can find two different solutions in this 
case you can find three now we could do that the   hard way by setting up a bunch of equations and 
solving them and actually that is precisely what   doing things the Hardway mat is doing right now 
yes we can work this out algebraically we just   need to expand out this complex number cubed 
that's a 2 + 2 a we've got another a squ over   there squ B that makes sense so if we substitute 
in B we will have a s but thankfully we don't   actually have to do things the hard way a what 
we can do do is work it out geometrically with   our axes we got our imaginary axis up and down and 
the real axis side to side and our first solution   is just negative a we can put that in down there 
and just like you'd have positive and negative   square roots which would be on either side of 
the real axis in this case we can just swing   those up so they're 120° apart and that gives us 
all three solutions the question now is what are   those top two ones equal to well guess what we 
can fill in under here yeah you know it it's a   triangle same triangle as before it's got a 30° 
angle and a 60° angle and because this like the   radius of this is equal to unit CU it started 
down here on I that's still one we've then got   a half and we've got our friend root three on two 
it's finally here you knew it this this is where   it's going to come right out of there like that 
actually you can do the same maths as before and   get the value of those two points and it's oh 
um this is the real part which is the distance   along the real axis you've also got that half 
an i and one of these is negative so you end up   with half I minus < tk3 on2 and half i+ < tk3 on 
2 but the point is because we can turn this into   the same triangle we can show that the real part 
is our ridiculous number everything comes down   to that triangle whenever we see this number 
pop up probably that triangle is hanging out   in the background somewhere and this may be more 
familiar if we take all the values and we double   them so instead of having one a half < tk3 on 
two we just have a one two < tk3 triangle this   may be my favorite triangle to this day whenever I 
need the sign or the cosine of 30 or 60° I either   draw or imagine this triangle and that's where 
our cos 30 came from as well because cos is uh   K the adjacent over the hypoten and the adjacent 
from 30 is < tk3 and it's on the hypotenuse of two   and actually that's how I originally came across 
this number I was looking up the value of Co 30°   on the online encyclopedia of integer sequences 
and it listed the other cool uses of this number I   was like oh my goodness I had no idea this number 
popped up in so many other places I think we've   covered oh all of them um apart from two last ones 
we need to go through first of all we have why is   it the radius of a cube with a sphere put around 
it well as you can see on this incredible graphic   here that the space diagonal of a cube is root3 
um all the other Graphics in this video by the   way made by this individual this one editor Alex 
put together we're so proud it's actually from   a future video but we're using it now so keep an 
eye out this this is going to come back but anyway   the point in this case is if the space diagonal 
is root3 the radius is half of that because the   circum sphere goes through all the vertices it's 
root3 on Two And finally the square root of 75   what's going on there well that's just a bit of 
algebraic manipulation what is the square root   of 75 if not the square root of 25 * 3 25 comes 
out that's the five at the front um which is half   a 10 piece of cake that wasn't that hard that is 
the 8660 254 mystery explained and actually I'll   put this one back where's it go I think it goes It 
goes there perfect we'll get that in post so thank   you so much for watching this video if you want to 
watch all of doing things the hard way Matt doing   all the algebraic working out I will put that up 
on patreon if you're want my patreon supporters   you can watch it because this video is entirely 
funded by my fantastic supporters on patreon they   funded all of these Graphics which are starting 
to get a little in the way uh and you know what   that bul wasn't cheap I had to buy that graphic 
made the Acosta hedrin myself and uh it took Alex   several days to do that Cube so you know there's 
a lot of costs um going on here and people sport   me on patreon tend to do it because they want 
to see more good mathematics communication in   the world which is why the videos are always 
free and you know completely openly available   to everyone but what doing things the hard way 
Matt was doing I don't I don't think humankind   are any worse off for not seeing that so we're 
going to put that behind the pay wall and if you   don't want to support me me on patreon uh or 
you already do or you don't want to commit to   a recurring payment absolutely fine you instead 
you could donate to the online encyclopedia inte   sequences they're fundraising at the moment I've 
given them uh some of my own money not the patreon   money my money because I think the work they do 
is absolutely incredible a phenomenal resource   please do give to them and if you can afford it 
please do help fund these videos link to patreon below
