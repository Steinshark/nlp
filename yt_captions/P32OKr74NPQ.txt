when we expanded our space to give the Creator Warehouse merge team their own building I outright refused to get them their own internet connection which sounds unreasonable until you consider my perspective I already pay for commercial internet right over there a line that actually has to run through the dmark in this building so why should I pay for a second internet connection that's why we set up a ubiquity air fiber XG a dish setup that allows you to wirelessly beam internet between two locations at speeds of up to 6 GB per second which sounds great right and to be fair they are pretty great when they're set up properly we just aren't Wireless install tchs and we made the mistake of mounting them on poles that are so short that the wireless signals flying between the dishes hit the side of the building on the way which actually limits us to about 1 sixth of the theoretical Max now we could fix this with some taller dishes but the proper solution is always going to be hardwired the question is just how and the other question is who will sponsor this video xplit level up your live streams with simple yet effective broadcasting and video production tools for use on platforms like twitch and YouTube check out xplit at the link below and use code Linus for 69% off your first purchase or subscription funny number but it's real so our first thoughts were not going to lie Pretty Jank see the electrical mechanical room for this building which is actually the one for this entire three-building complex is right here literally 25 Paces a Stones Throw or a wrench's throw as it were from our building across the parking lot so it did occur to us to just string a wire between the two buildings or hack a microt trench into the parking lot and hope that nobody complained but believe it or not we've been trying to get away from Jank lately thankfully there's a solution because this is a three Building Development there's already conduit between the main mechanical electrical room here and the one in our building we just have to find it oh well it's this one obviously it's not going to be quite that simple though you see that conduit goes to the very opposite end of our building which is not where our unit is also I couldn't help noticing it's really full how the devil are we going to do this oh we don't need that for that that's to go to creat a warehouse from here there's already fiber that goes over to our building yeah but aren't we using it sort of this giant cable which looks suspiciously like the one we ran through the woods is where the fiber comes into the complex it runs up into this distribution box where the fiber is actually terminated the these two cables here because we have our own dedicated wavelength are our internet these other ones are for everyone else in this building in fact our old connection actually breaks off of it here you can see Linus media uh this is plugged in and doing nothing sick yeah our dedicated wavelength runs over this really thin cable loops around there over to this guy that giant box just has a switch and a battery backup in it can confirm is battery backup is fiber optic network switch here's the Upstream to the provider that we showed you before and then here's our Downstream fiber pair which comes out here and goes into this box which actually raises some questions even for me this is a switch Yeah with just one thing in and one thing out isn't that just a cable with extra steps yeah I think they do like their speed limiting and stuff in there like routing and I see so this is not to our benefit this is so that they can control our shiz yeah got it okay yeah fine then why don't we get to the part where Jake said sort of in this box the fiber cable from the switch is coupled into the big cable that runs over to the studio you can even see on this helpful label 12 single mode fibers hey that's a lot of fibers yeah it's uh 10 more than we're using right now you can actually see it says fibers 03 to 12 are dark that means they're not in use which is great we can just terminate a couple of those fibers and we don't even have to run a cable right it's not what you told me before we started this yeah it's not uh we don't own this cable and while we probably could get permission to use it there is an easier way this right here is a perfectly ordinary single mode duplex fiber optic cable it's got two strands in it one for send and one for receive but the thing is single mode fiber can carry many wavelengths of light at the same time without hurting the signal that means instead of using two fibers to run from our ISP switch to our rack we could install a special bir directional transceiver woo that uses a separate wavelength of light on the same fiber for transmit and receive that's going to free up the second fiber on our existing cable so the part that we are actually allowed to be used for us to send internet back from the other building over to Creator Warehouse well sort of just just to hear well to hear we still got to run the C that's why we have this to go from here to there yeah that's going to be fun don't worry about it question for you this seems like the kind of thing that's going to knock out everyone's internet access when has that ever bothered you before what is going on here what the he there's like 40 people in this building I can put them on the back up yeah all right okay yes we actually do have backup internet now it's so cheap is there a reason we don't just use the backup it's not commercial grade blah blah for like 120 bucks a month we can get internet that's faster than what we paid like five grand a month for here when we first moved in there we go done we're on the backup in theory the connection automatically fails over anyways it's just that it takes like 15 seconds n so I just forced it I set the backup as the priority One hopefully nobody notices hopefully nobody was in the middle of an upload uh we could have checked that anyone middle of an upload anyone uploading to where to to where these people to the internet no no I mean is your computer working yes then no okay see you later nobody was uploading anything we're all good uh sort of there's still activity on the way and I was thinking about what could this be it's parek because it's Port forwarded to that specific Wan interface and then on top of that in parse SEC you have to like Define your external IP so any editors that are working off site right now are going to get kicked off I see how quickly can we have this up and running can we just ask them to take lunch yeah in theory it should only take the amount of time that it takes to put that transceiver in in theory hey I lied uh parac doesn't work right now I think they had scheduled maintenance oh so parseek was already broken yes cool see you later let's move on okay do you want to go over there and are we doing this like uh you know nuclear you know do you trust yourself to uncp the like LC duplex clip like take the two fibers apart I've never done it before so I'm just going to YOLO it but okay cool that's that's the answer I needed um you need the transceivers which are in Creator Warehouse so you should grab the those cool car's still working Robert I haven't disconnected it yet it will stop working okay I'll let Robert it's not hard for him to act exasperated and walk away from me he's just like that all the time um wait well I can't just take one of these they're not like duplex connectors in that you can just use whichever one on either end oh are they think about it right if you're transmitting and receiving on different wavelengths if you did transmit on the same wavelength on both sides you would be Shining Light into light and then the receiving on both sides would be getting nothing and they would actually potentially burn each other out yeah that is really a thing so lasers swapped so they're kind of paired but not really U these are all one side oh I see so you see it says 1270 1330 The Other Side Is 1330 1270 makes sense yes um so if you're going to use bir directional fiber transceivers pay attention to that make sure you don't order all the same ones because they will not work all right cool lots of cool stuff coming over here in creat a warehouse we've got the RGB shirt in charcoal and hey let's leak that Matthew can I have that yeah oh the laptop bag is going to be so awesome luggage strap magnets it's going to fit 14inch laptops even with a Big Caboose look at all that wire holding in wire management oh okay I don't want to talk about the 16in one yet I guess that's leak never too anyway the point is here they are fiber optic transceivers were the guys over here complaining about the internet spe complaining uh no I don't think so Matthew have you guys actually had internet reliability issues over here or it turns off and on here and there oh I haven't had any problems with the speed also do anything too czy I see I didn't realize that it cut out from time to okay well that explains why we're doing this cool I thought Jake was just just like H oh this is cool I want to make a video um which is fine too are we going to need these attenuators Jake didn't mention anything but when you have overpowered transceivers these can help to knock down the signal strength a little bit to keep them from burning each other out but um I don't know if he didn't say anything then I guess I'm not going to bother what could go wrong what could go wrong my company could have no internet the whole thing woo I'm trusting Jake hello hello hello okay there's one more thing to mention oh do I need the attenuators we shouldn't need it right away because it's in theory in Spec there's a bunch of couplings in the chain already so there there's already going to be a decent amount of signal loss but yeah okay so are you going to unplug yours now I mean that is plan yes quick cue for you oh wait no I'm in the wrong box wait what do you mean how are you in what box are you in you should just the switch Yeah the switch and you're taking not the Upstream one the downstream one no I'm in the switch box yeah you weren't before eh oh yeah I was oh yeah yep okay well I'm just keeping my ladder exactly where it was yeah you didn't move a ladder right no let me just get all my pieces aligned here I need to have these ready because the last thing that we want want is to accidentally get these fibers dirty or damage them so I'm just going to without touching the very ends pop those little caps on all right our internet is now down it's out oh he unplugged it okay we're going oh no oh God now I'm going to pop out the transer that was in there what are you talking about Jake are you talking right now I'm having problems I'm going to mute now bye and I'm the one one who needs adult supervision you see this one fibers coming out yeah I couldn't push the lock down and it was really hard to get out now I'm going to pop it out of the duplex clip just like that which fiber are you going to use the left hand one or the right hand one I was going to ask you uh they're colorcoded so why don't we just go with blue they're not they're not colorcoded on my side because there's like four different cables in between here and there oh my God so just use the leftand one assuming that you didn't take them out without realizing which is which position left from what orientation Jake well like if you're looking at it plugged in okay let's Orient based on the clip your finger is on the release yeah and I'm staring at my thumbnail my thumb is on the release and I'm looking at my thumbnail the left the left hand one the left hand one I mean we'll find my right hand though oh my God okay great that's cool I believe you can figure it out do I have to break it to get it out I've never done this before what what you're lying shut up what do you mean break it how would you how would you break it you have to take the fiber out I'm uh I'm going to plug my side in soy take this [Applause] guy L it in oh it touched the end of the metal that was bad there we go what's the problem I am just trying to figure out how to get this apart without breaking anything okay well I'm plugged in I'm GNA come over there now sure before we go over there and help him I'm going to plug in this other transceiver this is a 25 gig transceiver that's going to be providing the internet back to Creator Warehouse so we don't have to come back here and do it again later that in and then we're going to plug this into our 25 gig Dell switch here there we go see I've got my one fiber and I just put that bad boy in there you figured out yet oh yeah I was just calling you you don't answer your phone oh that's fine I don't see a link oh that's not good I can try the other side oh yeah wait hold on a second hey there we go oh really yeah no we're dumb because if you have two ends of a cable it would be the opposite that would be the corresponding one yeah that makes sense hey Matt oh so it's working so it's working yeah we have a link so you can leave that one that's already plugged in on the other side wait this is already plugged in on the other side yeah I figured we might as well because oh okay than coming back I was going to tell you I only have one CI these are both GE yeah this the CI is for Sienna which is the brand of switch fs.com sells transceivers and all the different switch Brands and in theory a lot of them don't care and you can just use the generic which is what G stands for um I just picked Sienna so we hopefully wouldn't have problems I thought that was the coding for the wavelengths yeah okay let me wrap my brain around this we're doing send and receive that's our internet that's our internet this is Creator warehouses internet connection from over there back right so I have to plug this into nothing something a cable do we have a coupler yes oh it's working though right yeah I guess I could just go check uh we should probably put an attenuator in there now that it's working though do you have attenuators there I no I left them over there okay uh how much do you want I was just going to do two because we already should be within range cuz like every coupler which if you think about it there's at least three maybe four is going to have a little bit of loss so I was thinking 2db would be fine I mean we could do five see if it works if it works then we're good as I mentioned before an overpowered transceiver can burn out the unit on the other side so since these are 10 km transceivers if we put a 5 D attenuator so that is intentionally causing 5 DB of signal loss um that should help to prevent any kinds of burning out mishaps over the longer term and we're linked just like that and I'm apparently supposed to figure out which of these conduits goes to the Creator Warehouse unit something we could do is we could go to the other side and see what color and characteristics the pull cord has we got Blinky lights look at that it's online that's the backup that's the main one I can't believe this worked okay now we change it back and hope that nothing works hey look at that the speed test servers here aren't really fast enough to do the full 10 gig but it's working wow I can't believe we just unplugged our internet and didn't take everyone's internet down that's so cool oh oh Jesus wow he's he's really he's into it he's in the he's not even in there anymore that conduit doesn't actually go to the electrical room here I didn't even tell him where the conduit comes out um I hope he's figured that out himself but maybe in here is it bad to waste Linus's time like this like I I feel a bit bad just from the time wasting aspect but he would totally do something like this to me so then I feel much less bad you know you figure it out yet where the conduit is my God is this a bad time to tell you I already know which conduit it is it's under the sink you were on track though were you following the fiber cable yes yeah okay look at how how professional that install is oh wow look it come comes down here here you can see the fiber box there God leak just hanging on are we not going to fix this Plumbing who did this which part the bucket or the FI completely unprotected fibers are just hanging here good old uh telis teexs I don't believe Tellus did this really no they screwed it into something in theory we could have just used ts's existing fiber but then you know we we don't really own that so oh yeah w why don't we just do that Jake well because I want to pull I want to do it properly because I want to pull fiber that was the real answer and then he corrected himself um so the you see the orange and white string in there on you see how there's like three conduits is the Box open right now or no no LTT screwdriver LTT store.com let's go kind of wish I had the stubby right now though it's weird for you to wish to be shorter hey n and I just start pulling on this right oh yeah definitely should we pull both fiber cables like just no I don't think there's any reason to cuz we're only going to use one of them anyways great okay see you in a few okay so there's a few things to keep in mind when you're pulling a cable through a conduit unfortunately this cable was supposed to come with pull Loops which would just be like a little plastic or steel thing that's integrated into the cable to make it easy to pull uh it doesn't look like they got made with those so instead we're just going to electrical tape the pull cable to the cable and hope that it doesn't come off the other thing to keep in mind when you're pulling the cable through you are using your pull cord this pull cord is going to come all the way out and there's no longer going to be a pull cord in there so we need to pull one with the new cable at the same time so we take a pull cord out and we're replacing it with a new one hello hi okay I'm going to pull on this a little bit hold on hold on no it's not still tied I untied it so do not just start re on it okay I've got a good grip okay I'm just going to pull a little bit just to you feel that nope you feel that nope you're lying not lying how about you pull it from your side then okay see anything brother I did this yesterday you're just fing with me I'm not pull more there we go now it's moving pull more okay there we go okay this is the right one beautiful okay stop pulling I got to do some taping here so just give me a minute I'm going start by taping these fiber ends cuz this is the the most important part we don't want to damage I don't want these caps to come off while we're pulling it and I don't want to rip the connector off do we have any lube like yellow 77 or whatever there was very little resistance when I tried this so I think it's probably okay okay I would strongly recommend using lubricant if you're pulling cable through conduit though it makes it a lot easier and you can get these like very low residue ones that won't break down the sheathing of the cable or anything like that um yeah and if you don't have it basic hand soap is a really good option so I tied it between the two pairs which are protected with electrical tape and then I'm going to wrap it like crazy you really really do not want this to come off uh mid pole cuz then you are out of luck you're you ready uh almost I just got to tie up the uh the twine the replacement pull cord take your time got all day what what what' you say what okay do you want to pull a little bit now you know Jake there is a fair bit of tension on this that's okay it's moving smooth on my side okay we should have lubed this we can Lube it if you want we should Lube it oh God like soap uh yeah this should be fine we're lubing her up all right can I start pulling it's nice and lubed all right just keep lubing it I put lots of lube in the hole don't worry oh wow this is definitely hey slow down stop stop stop stop stop stop stop and just tangled up here hold on okay wow it really does slide nice now eh oh yeah bud oh boy oh this is not good ah I don't really want to have to unspool 200 ft to untangle this but oh Jake yeah I was kind of thinking we just go out the door Jake Jake Jake I'm not angry son I'm disappointed look it could have just been wrongly wrapped from the factory but then I would have to be mad at infinite cables and we all know that that's not possible no it's definitely not possible probably because we were shaking it around before we shot a bunch oh I see what I'm trying to say is it's your oh I see yeah it's your fault so I see I see so this is on me 100% okay we're done okay we're good hey all right really did you just do that he took the whole neatly spooled thing that we just did and he just dropped he just threw it on the floor should be fine I'm in position okay you can start pulling now can you imagine there was like two more feet yeah come on buddy anytime you're ready hold on I think something might be coming through it's a boy it's really wet yeah well I poured it in the hole so oh how the hell am I supposed to get this undone with it all slippery like this G Wiz a curse might have over a little bit the question now remains how do we get it from here to the closet no you know the answer to that what this yeah oh yeah but um see about that no stop you know no I don't shut up this is UPC you see how it's green oh that's an angled connector they use that on passive Optical networks like um when you have fiber to the home it's a passive Optical Network they use that so it doesn't shine back like reflect back off the connector this does not so if you put them together it won't work and I did order an adapter but it doesn't look like it showed up for now we can try it by moving the switch over here or we pull this all the way over there I was thinking we just move the switch here um oh God the switch in here it's fine no yeah but we can't just put the the switch here just for like a day or two until the adapter R you know how many times we've deployed something for a day or two well then we won't deploy it we'll unplug it after do you have a patch cable that we could at least just like run in a not awful way over there oh yeah why don't we just do that then it's not going to be any worse than what they did yeah yeah run it along the base up here and over here and over here and down here and through here or something oh uh it's not coupled we got to grab a coupler I'm going to come back and do this properly later but for now we're just going to couple our cable into our extra little fiber up there put our fiber into the coupler that one side still has a cap on it for now and then take this guy and plug it into there so I'm on the right side the white side on this side there we go okay I couldn't find another coupler so I'm going to do something naughty and steal it from this box thanks ISP appreciate you don't tell anyone I did that wait where's the coupling jeez okay awesome uh we need a transceiver I will go get one the existing switches we have over here these UniFi Enterprise 48s don't have 25 gig so we're going to put in an XG 24 Enterprise uh which is a 24 Port 10 gig switch with two 25 gig ports um and then from here we can kind of patch over we can use two 10 gig links to to give 20 gigs of connectivity between here and these or whatever we want to do we also might just not put this switch here and just have a 10 gig link between the buildings it's you know they've been operating on gigabit for over a year and it's been fine um so 25 gig is it's probably Overkill but it right okay I should be a pro at this now pretty smooth the last time took a lot longer ready oh Jesus scratched the let's catch you guys up Jake moved the switch out of the network closet because this direct attached copper cable is not very long and we needed to plug it into this computer and this is a 25 gig Nick yes sir all right let's see it running at full speed yeah the connection's actually working now that's another update oh yeah cool oh yeah what happened when you're using like 25 50 100 Gig you run into forward error correction when you're running at those crazy speeds and they expect forward error correction mode 74 andell by default defaults to nothing cool so usually with a direct attach cable it doesn't matter when you start to move to actual Optics got it then it matters so we set it CL 74 you can see right there nice and it worked I didn't put an attenuator in there yet but we can see the receive power is minus 2db and if you look at the product page the overload happens at two so we should be okay we could put a we'll probably put one on there anyways 2db in there I mean you can also see it's only transmitting at like minus5 and it can transmit at up to 4 DB so it's going to automatically adjust we're in the range I might just leave it but sure we'll leave it alone we'll see any who yeah internet well let's just just just do a speed test obviously that's the the best way to it's a screen cap I'm sorry hey that's about as fast as I can ever get out of a speed test yeah our internet is 10 gig but the speed test servers on the other end not so much that makes sense the upload should be faster it might be more importantly let's have a look at what kind of speeds we get off of our Nas which is over in the other building what are you doing trying to find there was 150 gig F fine just Just Go With It doesn't have to be just go to the temp yeah just G that's lot that's lot okay that's 800 megabytes that's it it's SMB man you're not going to get I've seen faster than that yeah I mean it could be the system let's try going back oh look not even 1 Gigabyte a second I love SMB it's great it's quality this isn't a limitation of like the connection this is a limitation of single client SMP and if we had more than one client we would be able to overcome this limitation and saturate more you see that one core is just pegged yeah what if I try and copy two files at one time I I got to start separate I know I got to do separate transfers hey it's exactly that is a little higher no it was 800 wasn't it no it was like 7 okay now it's down to the same basically the same thing you know what we need he knows CH E oh you weren't even thinking that Jake favorite piece of software the point is just this is like seven times eight times faster than what we had before and it won't go down in inclement weather which to be fair the dish hasn't really gone down in inclement weather wasn't there the one time with the snow there was the one time with the snow but they also it was still like Early Access firmware up until like a month ago so overall I'm actually really happy with it it has been shockingly stable it goes down for like 1 minute every couple days but it's usually in the middle of the night and it hasn't been doing that since it's been updated to like Mainline firmware cool well we should just leave it in place as a backup kind of like what we have over at the lab yeah okay it's back it's back and it's exactly the same as it was doing before all right high five SMB woo we're not really done yet though this raises a pretty important question why doesn't everyone just use bidirectional transceivers for everything really Jake well the transceivers are a lot more expensive than standard duplex transceivers for example the 25 gig transceivers we got for this project are more than double the cost of the duplex transceivers that we'd use otherwise and okay $50 versus $120 isn't huge but if you were to multiply that by a 100 or a th000 servers suddenly the extra fiber cabling sounds like a pretty good deal unless your cable is really expensive imagine this you got like a 20 km run that's already there right and you need more throughput you've maxed out that throughput there's no room in the conduit the city's not going to give you a permit or you know running that cable cost you a million dollars you take your duplex you split it and now you have double the throughput now you have double the throughput except okay you know how we talked about two different wavelengths through a single fiber for send and receive many isps would actually be using a far Wilder setup called multiplexing where they use duplex fiber and they're running a ton of different wavelengths through each one and then splitting it out on the other side we actually saw this this is wild look at this from the uh Z16 facility tour holy see I told you no no use this footage it's wild but look at that that's so cool so cool like this segue to our sponsor secret lab sitting long
