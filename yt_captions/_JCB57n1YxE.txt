best chess players in the world period right now in 2023 going head to head this is everything we ever wanted uh this is an unbelievable match played in three segments five minute Blitz with one second bonus time three minutes Blitz with one second bonus time and one minute bullet chess with one second bonus time this match was unbelievable back and forth action I'm going to show you I don't even know how many games enjoy yourself sit back relax throw me up on the smart TV listen to the to chess content in the shower I don't really care what you do uh if you're lucky enough to catch this video in the first 48 hours that it's out all my courses 25 off right now there's a sale going on Dutch defense courses out gotta throw that out there because there's gonna be a lot of watching this recap so you know I got it but I gotta Market a little bit also pre-order the book pre-order the book New York Times bestseller much love to all of you who have pre-ordered it already my friends take a deep breath take a deep breath in don't you dare click on the sidebar I'm gonna I'm gonna make a bet with you I'd like you all to listen to me before I get into game one the average viewing duration of one of my videos is around 12 to 13 minutes all of you listening to this right now make it at least until minute 15 of this video then I give you a permission to click away I'd like to see how strong of a community we have here we go here we go five minute chess the first game was a draw they drew the first game this is their second game of five minute Blitz Magnus opens up with e45 and we have a rue Lopez Knight F6 Hikaru goes for the true and tried Berlin he loves the Berlin Magnus has no Berlin for you Bishop C5 and Bishop A4 that is a very very big sideline I have no idea what that is C3 Knight C3 all played before Bishop G5 Magnus voluntarily Retreats his bishop and very quickly we get into a big maneuvering game notice the pieces C3 D4 is the typical thing you want in the Spanish a lot of maneuvering Hikaru ends up routing his Bishop to G7 and puts his Queen on f8 I mean you it's a very very obscure maneuvering type of game until it's gonna start breaking open a few moves later you see Hikaru double banging that pawn in the center from C5 and E5 opens it up with Ed brings the Knight back to apply more pressure Magnus plays D5 chops it down and one Pawn is going to break free in Magnus Carlson's position and it is the F Pawn same side attacking chest particularly on the short side when the kings are Castle on the short side is done with the F Pawn and all Magnus has to do is restrict Hikaru on the queen side and there it is the Declaration of hostility this is Magnus Carlson's first game with white so this is early in the match it's it's like round one of a fight it's the first set of tennis you're playing to each other's strengths and weaknesses seeing what's good what muscles are sore E5 critical move but how does that move make any sense Pawn to E5 is an ingenious move because you are playing on the Square where black is strongest you are literally playing to Black strength like Novak Djokovic likes to do to his opponents in the first set Hikaru takes but now that pawn is a clogging of the arteries all three pieces are now blocked because Magnus had no plans of recapturing F5 like turning the screw like putting the cap back on a bottle and Hikaru is trying to break free but Magnus walks him down rookie seven and Hikaru resigns Queen is hanging but rookie 8 would win the queen back and it doesn't matter what takes back if Rook takes C7 Queen takes A6 if Queen takes E7 Queen take 6a6 beautiful shot Magnus gets the first win of the match in his first game with white and he played a major sideline so this is poking a major hole in hikaru's opening repertoire he is off to a great start but they made a couple of more draws and then Magnus got white again this is picking up the match now three to two first segment five plus one Blitz this time Magnus is poking around and seeing what Hikaru is doing in a slightly different way D5 takes takes Queen C2 so this is a queen's Indian chosen by Hikaru takes takes Magnus takes a big center Bishop D3 and pawn to H6 played by Hikaru now everything is good Magnus has a very reasonable position Magnus playing D4 playing E4 seeing what Hikaru is playing what openings he can bully a little bit and now D5 a very nice idea once again utilizing a Central Pawn breakthrough the idea of which it's very difficult for hikar to take this Pawn because this bishop is hanging and once Hikaru doesn't take this Pawn that pawn is there to stay that move is given a great symbol I think Magnus is better than chess.com's game review but I digress Hikaru gets active with his Queen looking to create counter play but Magnus playing on all three sides of the board the center is locked the queen side is expanding the center has a rook fighting for Equity Magnus also controlling the king side as well we are likely headed for an end game the Rooks are off it's Queens it's Bishops it's Knights now it's just Bishops and knights and rather than taking like this Magnus takes with the bishop he didn't like the fact that the pawn was gonna struggle to make progress and now it is a bullet game and it is the best end game player of all time versus probably the best defensive player I don't want to say of all time because you know Petrosian there was like some very very good Defenders karpov was an incredible Defender but over the modern generation it's not even close Knight back to G8 Queen Isa it is close Magnus is probably the second best defensive player of all time Magnus looking and poking and prodding he's got that pass deepon Bishop C2 Queen D2 Queen I5 is he gonna find a way through four seconds each it's a mad scramble also this is an indicator for who's in better form in the bullet remember they got to play bullet against each other so time is ticking D6 Magnus breaks through and he still has a pass Pawn uh oh uh oh this is bad news Hikaru is now down a pawn and that pawn is running and it's running really really quickly Bishop D5 Queen F6 it's all over it is all over actually after Bishop takes C6 Hikaru resigned because a queen trade is happening the C Pawn is going through my friends if you're cheering for Magnus Carlson now's a good time to start because the last time if you're not cheering for Magnus Carlson that was a good time sir last match they played Hikaru roared out to a five-game lead Magnus is up two he's now up four to two and he is looking real good physically but also with white when he plays the white pieces now the match is five to three it kept on going it was a back and forth Affair but not yet Magnus Carlson LED early and he led for a while Hikaru looking to fight back by playing a very offbeat E4 Sicilian Defense Magnus played D5 took the center and then we got C4 and it was uh Magnus firing in all cylinders early in this position with G5 G5 is the move you make with black when you're up two games ridiculously exotic stuff Pawn to D4 on passant G4 Queen takes on E5 now again this is the sign of an arrogant man I'm not calling Magnus arrogant I am saying he is allowed to be arrogant because he's up two games against Hikaru he's firing on all cylinders and if he can put Hikaru down three games on the five plus one section it is everything that he ever dreamed of by the way 25 off courses sell 48 hours if you watch this video uh Bishop to E3 also all courses have a free sample I'm just saying like look 15 minutes remember you promised me 15 minutes after that I don't care where you go let's try to get the average view duration of this video okay I'm not even gonna put an ad it's gonna be no mid-roll ads between 12 and 15 minutes do I should have said that in the intro we're seven minutes in doesn't even matter just testing Community Bishop B5 and in this position Magnus plays a very provocative move E5 that breaks all principles you are not supposed to be playing with pawns when your king is in the center much less when there's a rook on the other side and now all hell breaks loose C4 a brilliant move Pawn to C4 counter-attacking this is hang naked because of Bishop takes FC because the bishop would hit the queen on F6 Knight C3 eight The Bishop's just hanging the pawn the Knight is hanging Hikaru is basically leaving all his pieces to hang in the name of initiative Knight takes D5 Queen G6 now the other night gallops in C7 looking mighty juicy Knight C7 check the king slides to the center of the word Bishop B6 the Knight can't take the bishop because the Knight has been to the King by a White Queen on D1 Bishop B4 rookie three magnus's King is making a run for it with 28 seconds on the clock he's winning Magnus is winning this game he's about to go up three games to end the five plus one segment King f8 Bishop C5 rookie two where's the moment the King has escaped completely the King has completely escaped Magnus Carlson is winning this game the bishop has landed on D4 that was a mistake instead of putting the bishop on B4 he had to put it on its home Square reason I don't know stockfish is a scumbag Hikaru takes Hikaru back in the driver's seat Pawn to D3 20 seconds per player Knight into E7 F4 hitting the Queen the queen is bouncing around like a pinata but that's not even the right move apparently the best move in this position was to give a check with the queen with white it doesn't matter they have 11 seconds on the clock when they're human and they're way better than you and me combine times five y three cutting everything off now Magnus is winning again H4 but he goes here Hikaru plays Knight D5 Magnus is just pushing the pace all of a sudden blunders Rook F3 and Rook G3 and he's losing his Queen he's losing his Queen but hikaru's not even taking it because the queen is perpetually pinned Queen G3 HG Magnus tries to sneak the pawn in but it's too little and it's too late and he resigns oh my God my abs heard from that commentary best chess commentary can we just agree recap commentary it doesn't come close it doesn't really make that much sense but you know what whatever I'm the elephant in the room I'm the elephant in the room there's nobody else in the room I'm I'm I if I want to be an elephant I'm going to be an elephant you have no say in that 15 minutes you promised you have five minutes to go Rook F1 five plus one segment ends five four can't get any closer Magnus had two moments to pull away he didn't take him because he car was the man he's the man I mean he's not just gonna go down like this we enter the three plus one segment of this match it is five to four this is this is what dreams are made of these are the two best speed players in the world and it's not close okay it's really not close I mean it's it's when they have bad days it's close it ain't close Magnus opens up with D4 C4 B6 we have another Queens Indian Bishop before that Bishop is going to trade nice Knight E4 this has been played millions of times this actually was played in a recent Hikaru game that's a mate the Bishops are crossing against each other it's a very very solid position F5 F4 okay all right Hikaru now Hikaru getting a little bit provocative Magus you win a game against Magnus you start you know like a fighter you start dropping your hands put the hands behind the bike you know you get up you start hands behind the back like oh you can't hit Philly shell like Shawn Strickland you know throw the front kick listen I this is going to be a hype recap huh Queen D2 Queen F6 Rook D1 Knight A5 hits the upon on C4 Bishop B7 Knight B7 E3 if there is one weakness in Magnus Carlson's game one there's none but if you had to say one or the universe would explode King side attacks receiving it's happened before and he's human Nikki might disagree with that he might watch this and go that guy's an idiot I'm an idiot with I got four million Subs I got a little bit of credibility and anybody pales in fear cowers in fear a little bit when the king is attacked and you don't have a lot of time E3 F3 that doesn't look that nice and hikaru's got a nice position and some of these things could get really dangerous and they do kikaru now uncorks five genius moves against Magnus Carlson first Rook F4 you can't take because you're pinned and the threat is Rook H4 Rook E1 Rook f8 bringing in the next resource and now Hikaru hits Magnus with the three piece on the soda Jorge mazvidal backstage versus Leon Edwards we begin with Knight take C4 brilliant number one he deflects the queen away from the defense of everything else why is this move so important because now the pawn Falls and the game is over because Rook H1 Queen H5 is a devastating attack but Magnus defends himself no he doesn't because now kikaru sacrifices the queen queen to G three oh my goodness Queen G3 is ridiculous King F1 this is mate if you take the pawn gets through all these beautiful pieces none of the bozos are watching the back rank anymore King F1 Rook H1 King E2 F1 queen king D2 bouncing him back like a pinata Rook H2 game set Boom headshot dead Queen G3 Knight C4 Queen G3 was unbelievable it's a tied match it's five five this man played Knight takes C4 Rook H4 and oh my goodness oh my goodness that what we did G3 this is unbelievable stuff it's five five my friends is five to five the Manchester side we just played like an hour plus magnus had two game lead and he was close to making it a three get inside match now kikaru is gonna push the pace with white and you best believe this man was bobbing his head Hikaru playing what's called The Beginner's Sicilian this is like when a beginner learns to develop these three pieces this is called like the bowdler attack or something and you know black plays E6 but he's allowed to do this because it's Blitz he's not looking for an advantage you're not looking for those a little microscopic Advantage which is slowly develop over 40 moves and seven hours of play and nobody sponsors chess because all games are extremely long and very boring but that's another Point A6 D4 he's not looking for an advantage he's just looking for a position Queen E2 Magnus plays D5 and D4 and C5 and Knight C6 and he's very and the second he developed this bishop he Carson what you doing man Magnus you want to cancel go ahead go ahead with my queen knocking on the door go ahead and Magnus said come get some that's what I love when both guys are dead sure that their plan is the best Hikaru says you really want to cancel that's mate Magnus says so what Carl says I'm not laughing Magnus says hey Carl what are you doing you have no attack Hikaru says yes I do you unpinned and you can take my Bishop not only can you take my Bishop you can take the whole G file Magnus and in a couple of moves you're probably thinking that you're going to Checkmate me on G2 look at this look at you go look at Mac look at Magnus activating all of his pieces and my friends Magnus has five seconds on the clock this is not a good position for Magnus White's pieces are completely restricting Black's oxygen and when black is done defending himself white is not gonna stop Knight F3 Pawn C3 now breaking apart the center take take wait Karo didn't take back Bishop C2 this move had nothing to do with taking over the center the point of this move was to bring back the bishop who stops Checkmate I got news for you this guy Queen f8 Magnus Carlson resigned Hikaru is up 6'5 first lead of the match oh yeah six to five and he's winning multiple games in a row in fact if you've been counting Hikaru one to four to five and to six this is the first time in his four-year career of playing in the speeches championship and all the games that he's played Magnus Carlsen has never lost three games in a row not in his life but even that's rare three games in a row and this kept going hey Cara built a two-game lead E4 E5 Knight F3 Knight C6 again and now Magnus opens up into the Berlin so we go deep into the Berlin this is the Berlin end game this is the opening by the way you're free to leave now you could any of you with bad attention span all the uncool ones get go 16 minutes you did good you did listen you did good Knight C3 Bishop D7 King C8 H6 B6 one black doing everything he's supposed to do it's exactly how the Berlin is supposed to be played black develops a big structure the king ultimately goes to B7 and now it's about how white decides to push for an initiative and this is how Magnus gives up his e-pawn Hikaru says okay I'm the best defensive player in the world take take I'm a pawn up now let's go Magnus come get some come get the pawn back Magnus you want the pawn So Bad Monkey in the middle I don't know who hikaru's teammate is it's also Hikaru rookie one go take the pawn back boom G5 that's hanging by the way that's just a hundred percent of Free Pawn I think hikaru's idea here was to play Bishop D6 and it's actually very clunky getting the Rook out and if you're too slow I might just trap it so Magnus played G4 trying to kick the night out before Hikaru had a chance to do anything now King G2 King goes to B7 because now Black's King is completely safe Bishop to E5 take take rookie eight take take okay the game is probably just going to be uh Magnus pressuring Hikaru and winning the end game rookie one Ponto C5 Hikaru is down a minute on the clock he's down 0.7 on the advantage Magnus is the best end game player of all time Magnus plays H4 Hikaru takes King H3 Knight H4 and my man Hikaru a minute down 40 seconds on the clock just completely gives away upon completely gives away a punk you know why he's giving away a pawn because the Rook is going to open up and then when the Rook opens up he's going to fight back and it's actually kind of difficult to defend that pawn but Magnus finds a way to defend the pawn because he's Magnus Carlson he just goes for the bishop Bishop H6 now Magnus have to stay patient he wanted he needs to play Knight F4 guard the pawn and slowly make progress but he rushes he blunders a check King G4 and he blunders that The Rook can go back now you may ask yourself why not this I'm allergic to bad moves well I'll tell you why first he would go here King G5 and then this and actually even though you are up a piece [Applause] I give you a little clap you have no Advantage whatsoever there's no Advantage whatsoever I'm gonna get the pawns I'm gonna win the win the pawns you can you can't save the end game Rook F2 you still laughing what do you say of course you can guard the pawns no Knight F7 check oops kikaru saves this game and suddenly look at how much time Magnus just burned after Bishop H6 Bishop F4 Rook F5 Advantage gone dead no Advantage anymore this was magnus's chance Rook F2 Pawn C4 game is going to end on a draw that's it players shuffling back and forth there was a May threat and this is very scary actually Magnus is uh still pressuring kikaru here rook and Knight he's got to get the night out though he's got to get the night out though he's gotta get the night out and in a in a Time scramble Magnus kind of panics and rather than taking and saving the Rook end game teaches lets he car Hikaru wins your car is up three games it's eight and a half five and a half it's over it's it's over so at this point they took a break because there was a commercial break and where we live in a you know capitalist dystopia so you know there was a commercial break and there was ads and so on and then the players came back Magnus changed his shirt he changed uh shirts which is a big deal and not an update like for the latest tabloids Magnus is now down three games can he find any effort can he find a second win because if not he's going to lose this match so Magnus plays a sicilian Hikaru plays C3 rookie one and uh and a very very solid Sicilian where he keeps a relatively straightforward Pawn structure he takes very limited risk and he's just playing solidly but I got news for you mag Carlson cannot play solidly because he's down three points so he sacrificed as a bishop Magnus sacrifices a bishop in front of hikaru's King and drives the Knight to D3 and all of a sudden kikaru's got 29 seconds Magnus has two minutes and nine seconds he's got a brand new shirt maybe because he ripped the other one I don't know if he changed pants because you know the others suffered something Knight H5 Knight G5 he tries to kick the queen out but hikaru's defenses are rapidly falling and and as a bonus his Bishop has barely any moves and as a bonus his Pawn is falling and his Queen isn't in the bishop is hit and as a bonus he's gonna lose a rook so when you thought it was all over he gets hit with like a 15 move combination he's got no pawns left his King is weak he literally loses he's down four pawns and my friends if you're a Magnus Carlson fan you better cheer right now because those pawns mobilize quickly and at this point the time ran out and Magnus Carlson roared back with the shirt change Gambit and only Trails by two games a fantastic game and kind of one of these games where momentum is everything you win three you're up three games and all of a sudden you take a break and you want to ease into it and the man goes here and uh it's bad news so Magnus made a comeback and now it's nine to eight and this is the final game of three plus one if kikaru wins this game he takes a two-game lead to the bullet if Magnus wins this game it's 9-9 and he storms back from three games down a Spanish now kikaru playing a modern steinits like a king's indian-esque Style game Knight E5 Bishop takes A4 a lot of pieces traded hikaru's position a little bit passive but slightly massive H4 Magnus instigating trying to poke at hikaru's King creating light squared weaknesses but Hikaru is doing a great job just sitting there stubbornly defending himself playing excellent chess D4 looking to trade everything now we have F5 oh my goodness Hikaru utilizing all the resources Rook A8 Bishop F2 Here Comes hikaru's King and he's done everything he can to create a completely impenetrable Fortress now it's about trading pieces down and of course the players have absolutely no time here Rook A5 is not the blunder of a rook the bishop can't take the Rook because black would play Rook takes King so Rook B6 through K3 and now Magnus has this position to operate in where he is up a pawn but they are completely immobile not a single one of them can move this one maybe but after Pawn takes and Rook G2 that's gonna fall black has what's called a fortress why does gonna have to find a way in but Hikaru is not going to allow it will Magnus over press and panic in a Time scramble look at this I mean everything is on the same side you trade the Bishops you trade the Rooks you just can't get to a King and pawn end game because that one is losing but black hanging in there both sides five seconds all hanging on a knife's edge Magnus looking looking but he can't find anything Hikaru too good at defending but all of a sudden the bishops come off Rook D7 still a draw probably still a draw but suddenly suddenly Magnus pitch completely ditches the Pawns of the king makes it through rookie seven King G6 F6 oh my goodness Rook H7 check King G6 and pawn to F7 seals the deal in a crazy scramble ladies and gentlemen you cannot have scripted this any better Magnus jumps out to a two-game lead in the five plus one Hikaru wins five games out of six handing Magnus first time in his career three losses in a row and must be Chess Championship takes a three-game lead and Magnus wins three of the last four games and it's 9-9 going into bullet yes sir this is what you call a match this is what you call a match oh my goodness Pawn to F7 check it's time for bullet nine points each one minute chess if the match is tied we will play more bullet and then we will go to an Armageddon I mean you this is just incredible stuff all right we start the bullet E4 now Magnus playing a Karo Khan defense a two nights plays Knight F6 he Cargoes for Queen E2 and Magnus goes for this very very solid line with Bishop A5 we have Queen F4 uh Queen A5 Bishop F5 not not Bishop A5 I don't I don't even know what I'm saying anymore uh rookie one Queen G3 and Hikaru goes for an attack but then he comes back and then he develops his Bishop instead trades like this players hate the knights Bishop F4 very very tense game you can kind of tell the players are really easing into the bullet it's a dead even position Queen F5 now kikaru starts bringing the Rook Magnus plays over here with A5 and queen B5 but Hikaru seals out magnus's Queen which could be bad because you lose F7 and Magnus creates counter play and gets in but now it's a free-for-all I mean one guy is gonna go down here rookie two you lose this you lose this Rook E3 pins Queen takes D4 one by black but now kikaru takes on C6 Queen B2 okay looks like we're headed for a draw Queen A2 rookie sit Magnus thought kikaru was going to trade Queens and he mentally just prepared that move and lost his Queen oh my God oh my God a crazy brain slip there that wasn't a mouse lip but it was a brain slip and Magnus goes down by hanging a queen in the first game of the bullet oh my now Magnus stage the comeback he won two of the next three games and led 12-11 with time ticking on the clock now Magnus opened up with E4 and we have another Spanish we've had a lot of these Hikaru once again employing the steinit setup with King is King's Indian style F6 castles takes takes very tense game Magnus recovering from the queen slip G5 and Hikaru just G4 take take CD CD Knight D2 Rook C1 but there Here Comes ikaro chucking everything on the queen side Magnus still poking at him on the queen side because Magnus knows the car's not gonna get started with the attack if he stops him down slows him down on the queen side here comes the car though take take Rook C6 Bishop f8 Hikaru doing everything he can but Magnus is quicker on the queen side if Magnus can break through successfully on the queen side Hikaru is not going to be able to generate enough play quickly enough he Karo Rook A2 position dead equal but very tense Knight H4 Rook F7 is is offering a trade it's so tense oh my God Queen D5 Rook c7s oh my goodness Magnus got the Piggies on the seventh rank rookie eight Queen B5 poking at The Rook King F1 Hikaru Barrels in he Barrels in he's got Queen H1 but now King is running Queen G2 Queen D3 time is ticking and as it nearly expires Hikaru doesn't have any more attack Rook F6 Queen B3 and my friends Magnus Carlson has taken the 24th game of the match and leads 13-11 with just five minutes remaining kikaru must now win the two remaining games of this match and then we might get an Armageddon oh my goodness here we go Hikaru must win game with the white pieces employs once again this obscure Sicilian variation Bishop E3 it's got these weird Bishops in the center B5 Bishop B7 Here Comes hikaru's Queen Galloping out to the king side Queen trade no Rook D1 rookie one the pieces are ready for action while Magnus is once again trying to stop hikaru's attack by counter-attacking on the opposite side of the board D6 H4 there we go Rook D3 H5 kikaru starting an attack the Knight centralizes and the Rook is going to rotate over Bishop H6 but but Magnus cold-blooded King f8 the bishop comes back now Magnus has turned to sacrifice the night Bishop takes E4 though Hikaru completely doesn't care about all of this not worried about these tactics takes takes Magnus pokes back out but here comes the age Pawn here comes the age pawn queen trade no H7 the pawn is sneaking through to become another queen now Magnus has to come here but he's hit from this side with Queen B7 and Knight F5 oh my goodness there's angles coming in from all sides of the board this Pawn is a square away from becoming a queen it's about to become a queen Knight E5 h8 Magnus had Queen H7 here but I guess he was really worried about the collapse of his position a pawn has just snug through and Magnus Carlson loses this game and it all will come down if Hikaru can win the next game of this match we get Armageddon and we get a playoff it is 12 to 13 E4 how is Hikaru going to pull off this there is no way he plays G6 he's gotta get a worse position to create any winning chances for himself at all Bishop E2 and let me tell you the engine is not gonna like this it is a deadly deadly attempt to play like this bishop F3 King B1 the kings are on the same side how will you possibly create any sort of attacking chances well it's Hikaru and it's Magnus and together they make magic Knight F3 gf3 Bishop A2 and out of nowhere Dynamite strikes as the buzzer is expiring if you take then Queen E6 and he's just gonna be a clean Pawn down so instead of that Magnus goes here but Bishop E6 Queen B5 and here comes the attack of Hikaru Queen C3 Queen H5 no he doesn't want to trade King A8 Queen back to B5 and my friends Magnus is losing his pawns and here comes Hikaru building up a very strong structure C5 A4 the attack is roaring forward a b c b king B7 making way for the Rooks butts Rook D6 is a massive massive commitment 30 seconds on the clock per player all you need to do is stack on the a file maybe two of them Queen E2 Bishop B3 opposite colored Bishops favor the attacking side Rook A8 Magnus knocks on the door F5 all hikaru's got to do is take because after takes and takes he has Bishop B3 and the flood gates open it's over but instead he goes Queen F1 right away he plays Queen F1 right away sacrificing his bishop and now apparently Queen A1 and some really weird variation leads to the king running out this way for example Queen A1 King C2 then you have to find Rook A2 King D3 Queen D1 King E3 and rookie and I mean I'm telling you this is instead of that Hikaru plays Rook A1 Queen C2 trying to defend against maid Here Comes hikaru's second rook and it's winning here because of an absurd tactic Rook D7 King C6 and in this position Magnus Carlson sacrifices not one but he sacrifices two Rooks Rook C5 check the point is that the king is left absolutely defenseless but you might ask against oh the other Rook while all of these pieces are just a move away from absolutely taking the white King's Soul King C7 all the queen needs is a little bit of help from her friends pawn bishop the king's Escape is completely sealed he's gotta go to B7 and the game is over now actually with a Checkmate net Queen D5 King B8 but that since the match is over anyway Magnus Carlson plays Bishop E5 and offers a draw and the game ends in a draw King A7 would have led to a mate after Bishop D4 King B8 Queen D6 King C8 it makes really no difference here here here here here here ladies and gentlemen the speed Chess Championship has concluded with Magnus Carlson beating Hikaru Nakamura 13 and a half to 12 and a half it literally could not have been any closer at all as the final game literally ended with both players getting checkmated and Magnus sacrificing not one but two Rooks to counter-attack Hikaru at the buzzer and seal the match are you not entertained 25
