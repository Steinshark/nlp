an arrest warrant was just issued for dokuan the founder of terra luna a 40 billion cryptocurrency that collapsed to almost zero earlier this year and i know what you guys are waiting for let's just put this guy on the wall of shame and just be done with him but unfortunately we can't just yet because the situation is a bit more complicated than it seems at first you see dokwan's arrest warrant was issued from south korea according to bloomberg where he's allegedly violated the nation's capital markets law and if you don't know what that means here's a hint the law applies to crypto tokens that quote work like securities so south korea seems to be treating this like a securities law violation which makes sense most companies can't offer 20 a year in stable returns and stay out of jail for very long which is maybe why dokwan along with five others are now wanted in south korea however there's a twist because dokuan doesn't live in south korea anymore he's living now in singapore so does this warrant apply to him i mean sure he can't go to bts concerts anymore but is he actually going to get arrested well it depends on whether south korea can get dokuan extradited which it seems like they're going to try to given the fact that they knew he was in singapore and filed this anyway they probably think they have a good shot at it which given the scale of luna's collapse i do think they have a chance and i do think it's also very important for us to at least try to give consequences to the people like dokwan who set up these ridiculous crypto ponzi schemes otherwise what's the point what's the lesson of watching luna you know just go repeat what dokuan did and hurt more people but yourself make money i mean that's what justin sun is literally doing right now with usdd although it's worth saying that do kwan wouldn't call himself a winner with luna he claims he's down infinite he said it in an interview he did with coinage media the word that i used to describe what happened here is down infinite i've just got to say there's something so ridiculous about being interviewed in a skyscraper with millions of followers and claim you're down infinite it comes across as so delusional and out of touch because i can almost guarantee you dokuan has at least a million dollars socked away somewhere i mean at minimum he's not impoverished so there are actually people who are down infinite from luna but do kwan isn't one of them and i don't want to get into the specifics of what down infinite are but you can just use your imagination when people lose their life savings in something like this what happens and i bring all this up because it's important to understand that part of the story of tara luna's aftermath is dokwan's attempt to paint himself as a victim of it but part of this image rehabilitation is with this interview itself with coinage media because i think it's worth being skeptical of them in part because they're helped funded by dokwan himself you see coinage media isn't just a random company their parent company trustless media is funded by dokuan in fact the interviewer himself is the co-founder of trustless media so literally the guy who's supposed to be holding dokwan's feet to the fire his company is in part funded by the guy he's interviewing so yeah many people including myself felt that this was just like you know a ridiculous puff piece but not just because of the appearance of bias but literally some of the questions we're doing this interview now because you want to talk about what happened truthfully and transparently i don't know if you're talking other lawyers now and they're saying yo you probably shouldn't do this are they i mean are you serious how is this a real question hey you're obviously being so transparent and truthful do your lawyers get mad at you from how truthful you are like why isn't it considered a possibility that dokwan is lying to us and being opaque in fact it gets even more ridiculous than that because zach the interviewer even goes so far as to suggest that maybe luna's problem wasn't how big it got but rather that it didn't get big enough but if you were standing at the fiery scene of the crash your first instinct probably wouldn't be to say you know what the hindenburg's problem was it wasn't big enough but in the case of currencies like tara that actually kind of was the problem now obviously i think this is nuts i'd be embarrassed to think this let alone say it out loud like hey you thought losing 40 billion dollars was bad let's make it bigger next time we didn't play it big enough we got to go double or nothing and yet this is sort of dokwan's defense for himself according to him luna wasn't a ponzi scheme and he's not like elizabeth holmes he's just an idealist who bet big on the future of currencies not that big and i think i lost that's right guys he lost he's just a victim like everyone else he's down infinite or that's what they want you to think and this is why i think this arrest warrant is actually a pretty big deal that alongside actually arresting dokwan would go a long way to debunk this defense to tell the world no you can't just go start up billion dollar ponzi schemes and then cry your down infinite when it all comes crashing down and so even though i can't put dokuan on the wall of shame yet i do look forward to the day where i can but until that happens don't listen to anyone promising you stable returns on anything except me of course don't forget to pump the stock it's unruggable
