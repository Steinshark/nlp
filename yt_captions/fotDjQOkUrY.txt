[Music] welcome to the Asus Rockford a small IQ not quite sure why I threw the smaller box we do actually need that in fact we're gonna start with that this box is even lighter than it looks and to be honest when ASA sent me an email a while back saying that they wanted to send out the rock phone this is about as big a package as I was expecting the entire other crate was a complete surprise but at the same time very excited to see what's in there with price competition in the phone market becoming fiercer by day it's unsurprising that packaging has sort of taken a backseat and so seeing a phone presented like this is a real surprise it comes with their own proprietary Aero active cooler not to mention this separate eggs agonal box which contains a 20 watt charger and of course a USB type-c cable ok smartphone itself and as you can see it's a little different we're gonna come back to that giant secondary package in a minute but even without anything else the rogue phone is a ridiculous bit of kit it weighs 200 grams has Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and it looks like an absolute unit we've got a 6 inch 1080p AMOLED display but more interestingly and 90 Hertz refresh rate this might actually be the first OLED smartphone ever to use over 60 Hertz and what this means is that the phone just feels a little smoother and more fluid but noticeably less so than the 120 Hertz on the razor phone you've got 8 gigs of RAM and an overclocked Snapdragon 845 that runs at 2.96 gigahertz instead of 2 point 7 or 2 point 8 and obviously of course a vapor chamber to keep it cool not to mention the detachable Aero active caller or if you're tryna game whilst also charging performance is very good but at the same time at not entirely different from the note 9 or the oneplus 60 and I'm not sure this slight overclock was worth the effort the real differentiator here is the attention paid to gamers the rock phone has built-in ultrasonic sensors which essentially act as air triggers you can squeeze the sides of the phone to enter the performance focused X mode and also use the triggers as programmable filled buttons when playing games the front firing stereo speakers are some of the better available the device supports 802 11 AD Wi-Fi which is even faster than AC and there is a side mounted port for playing games while charging and this port comes into play with accessories and let's just say the accessories that are built for this phone aren't the ordinary kind that leads us on to this behemoth of a package this one was a bit of a struggle while the first packet was lighter than it looked let's just say the second wasn't a hand as you can probably tell right now what we have here is an Asus prog branded suitcase that's ridiculous after a couple of minutes of just enjoying these simple pleasures of product with wheels we get to opening this and there's a little bit of shrink wrap on the handles you can see the Republic of gamers logo on there and there's a code to unlock it which thankfully ended up being zero zero zero otherwise well this video wouldn't have been quite as good inside I almost didn't know where to start there are six giant packages all to do with the Rob Byrne various gadgets and accessories that go with it and there's actually room for the phone box as well in there now to be honest with at least half of these before I open them up it wasn't actually clear what they are but being the heaviest and the coolest looking box I decided to start with a twin view Doc [Music] turns out this is almost definitely the most over-the-top smartphone gadget you've ever seen it's got a six inch AMOLED secondary screen which funnily enough is made to look almost exactly like the front of the phone so when you slot your phone in there it looks like you have two of them and functionally speaking it literally feels that you have two separate phones although it's all being powered by one you can run two separate fullscreen applications on each display you can play a game on one and watch a YouTube video on the second one not to mention the dock gives you physical shoulder buttons enhanced calling a 6,000 milliamp hour battery pack and haptic feedback using inbuilt vibration motors also while the second screen isn't a phone in its own right it has its own set of stereo speakers creating four speakers in total the display resolutions you might notice that for this test right so nearly two and a half hours into this test now and you'll notice the iPhone 10 R has been okay this is the mobile desktop dock which if you literally just wanted to connect your phone to your TV to show some photos is probably a little overkill but if you want to use your phone as a workstation then it makes a lot more sense because it is loaded with ports you've got four full-size USB s on there and even space for an Ethernet cable this is the game vice which once connected to the rock phone allows you to remap all sorts of virtual controls to physical buttons which is nothing new you've seen that on all sorts of Bluetooth controllers before but this one is actually connected directly via the USB C port so there's pretty much no noticeable latency also the controller as you can probably tell feels pretty great [Music] this is the why kick which has a similar functionality to the mobile desktop dock we looked at earlier but this one is wireless the main thing I was actually worried about going in was latency because when you move from wired to wireless connections generally there's a little bit of perceptible lag but actually that wasn't a problem at all the only thing I did notice is that the framerate isn't as high using a wireless connection as it was using the wired the onslaught of accessories continues and they call this one the professional dock and it has a USB type-c to us bas as well as a full size HDMI port oh yeah and room for Ethernet the last accessory we have is this one and I'm sure you're ready for some sort of secret feature but this one actually really is just a case so the rock phone pretty ridiculous right even without the accessories the phone is just bonkers through and through and it's a weird one because I'm amazed at how much effort Asus has put into it given how nice your phone it is let me know what you think in the comments down below my name is Erin this is mister who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
