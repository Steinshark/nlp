okay i've spent the last two weeks with the just announced flagship phone from sony the xperia one mark iv and you can tell very quickly that this company is now fighting to make something special so the question is can sony a smaller 5000 employee phone company with a lot of ambition actually beat a huge 300 000 employee mainstream smartphone company like samsung let's find out well you're not getting much of an unboxing experience either way i'm just like 50 of flagship fans nowadays you get nothing with this phone except in this case like literally nothing not even a cable but when it comes to the smartphone itself you really do get the continuous impression while using it but sony is actually trying to just make the best phone that they can they put a 4k display on here that's 50 more pixels than practically any other phone and when it comes to brightness this thing is not 20 or 30 brighter than last year it's 50. sony speakers were already great too but now they further upgraded the bass and the volume to the point where you know that traditional tinny phone speaker sound that's gone their last phone had a weak selfie camera they fixed it they've given us a headphone jack a dedicated camera shutter button this is one of the very few flagships that supports microsd cards i love the fact that they've made the sim tray completely tallest and that they've made the matte finish on the back practically immune to fingerprints it's just a thoughtful design and really that doesn't sound good it's the main benefit of sony being a much smaller company you get the distinct feeling while using these phones that they aren't as commercialized as samsung's that this device was not created with the mindset of right how do we sell 50 million units this year and how do we get people to sign up to every single one of our services but instead the simple goal of how do we improve the last one how do we make the best phone for our sony community i mean just look at it the xperia one mark iv looks practically identical to the one mark iii which looks practically identical to the one mark ii you can tell that sony isn't playing the game of we've got to make sure our phone looks different every year and add flashy new colors to make it seem like a more noticeable upgrade either that or someone needs to have a word with the marketing department but there is another side to this coin see while having a smaller team can give you the autonomy to add in nice personal touches just because you feel like it there is also a very distinct advantage to scale in the smartphone market like because of how samsung's operation is an order of magnitude greater than sony's it it gives them the budget to one invest far more in research and development to be able to create features that are not just new and innovative but can also be internally tested millions of times before actually being put on store shelves to make sure they're also reliable and optimized and two support devices for longer like if you look at the most profitable smartphone companies out there samsung and apple they're also the companies that give the most consistent software updates four years and five years respectively compared to sony who'll probably do two and it's not that sony isn't trying as hard it's just the nature of their lower sales volume makes it much less time efficient to match the bigger companies they'd have to put in the exact same amount of manpower and resources to create and update but it's only going to benefit to 20th of the number of people and you can argue that this support this optimization this reliability is kind of the biggest factor in a smartphone's success like if you really think about the phones that have truly failed over the years the red hydrogen one the next bit robin the htc evo 3d none of these flopped out of a lack of intention they all have very strong visions it's just they weren't backed by the resources and the investment power to deliver on them thanks to the immense and increasing complexity of a smartphone so that leaves us with an obvious question can you feel it here compared to samsung's top end flagship does this feel any less optimized and any less reliable well 90 of the time not in the slightest and if you're enjoying this then a sub to the channel would be so nice this is a pacey smartphone with fluid animations super responsive gesture navigation and the sheer torness of its screen makes it an absolute beast for all those scrolling apps my thumb feels positively liberated from how much less work it has to do here plus sony has absolutely smashed the core content consumption experience the combination of this cinematic 4k screen these new and improved speakers dynamic vibrations that physically shake the phone when there is bass it's in some ways an unmatched phone for experiencing youtube and netflix games look great too and they feel like they wrap around you with this ultra wide display i wouldn't call this a phone for gamers because i have noticed some pretty high temperatures if you push it but for moderate gaming it's beautiful and of course this camera system is in a lot of ways quite special you might well know that in the market for professional cameras sony's alpha brand is somewhat of a leader like this is a sony alpha camera this is a sony alpha camera and so the fact that this xperia 1 mark 4 is apparently using tech from these cameras is well it's enough to give me the tingles and you know what this thing does deliver an extremely reliable focusing system like alpha cameras it can burst fire like a demon taking 20 photos per second and they've added an absolute truckload of creative visual effects to play around with like partial color which is really cool it lets you pick a color and then only that color will be highlighted on screen and the one thing that this does better than any other phone in the market is slow-mo i honestly don't think any other company cares to be honest but on the sony you can take slo-mo videos in 4k resolution and it's pretty much the only phone on which you could then also watch those back in full quality but okay the camera is also a pretty good place to talk about where this phone goes wrong here's the thing you need to understand sony's alpha cameras are phenomenal i can't knock that but if you really think about it sony's ability to make incredible professional cameras it has almost no bearing on their ability to make great mobile cameras 95 percent of what makes traditional cameras good is their hardware they're huge custom sensors they're full frame lenses it's not the technology their incredible hardware means that they only need very simple software compared to what most smartphones use and so this idea of bringing over alpha technology to a phone which is using a very standard tiny phone sensor all of a sudden it doesn't feel like such a bonus in fact in most cases while the sony does take good clean natural looking photos it doesn't hold a candle to the intelligence of a mainstream flagship made by a huge team of people like the s22 ultra to capture the kind of photo that we've almost come to expect on a 2022 smartphone it actually takes a lot of work behind the scenes like every shot requires the phone to take 10 or so different frames at multiple exposures and mesh them together it requires it to identify people's faces and adjust them based on the skin tone and the environment it requires tons of sophisticated micro adjustments that i just don't get the impression this sony is making as much when you take a photo on this xperia for the most part what you see is what you get which you know there was a day where that was a compliment but not when you compare it to the s22 ultra which after capturing will literally comb through every single pixel in the image sharpening bits tweaking colors and improving lighting and this software processing it's important when you're taking zoom photos the s22 ultra will detect text for example and use artificial intelligence to neaten it up it's important when taking action shots where the samsung will realize that you're doing a lot of moving and cleverly take multiple shots and pick the stillest one it's important when you're taking video the xperia lacks that powerful high dynamic range that these mainstream phones have it's important when you're taking portrait mode shots where sony's edge detection and artificial background blur they still feel a little basic and it's really really important when you're taking night photos where your phone has to capture many many frames and then use machine learning to piece them together into a single brighter shot now i will give sony this they have successfully distilled the look and the feel of using an alpha camera into this phone all the menus the fonts the sound effects and i understand it i could totally see the loyalists who love sony cameras really appreciating this authentic touch however to be really brutally honest interfaces are pretty much the worst thing about professional cameras i love my sony alpha camera but let's be very clear if i could swap its ui for android 12 i would do it in a heartbeat i mean look at this beautiful home screen slick menu operation material design everything bright and colorful but the second you open the camera app you feel like you've jumped back 10 years and the layout isn't as intuitive as more mainstream phones either the camera experience is split between not one not two but three separate camera applications it doesn't respond to gesture navigation like the rest of the phone trains you to do and like why is it that if i want to use portrait mode on the rear camera i click this button and then this button but then to do portrait mode on the front camera i go into a completely separate menu i want to reiterate here this is not a bad camera in fact ceiling is just as high as samsung's but it's just that lack of behind the scenes grunt it doesn't leave you any room for error if you don't get that perfect shot in the moment this phone isn't going to save you now the final two things that i want to quickly point out are the one while this screen is way brighter than sony's last phone it is still noticeably less bright than samsung's and two that my battery experience hasn't been amazing the capacity is great at 5 000 milliamp hours but on an average day of usage i'm getting about six hours of screen on time which is okay but then if i push the phone by testing its camera it'll end up as more like four and a half this is early software bear that in mind but to be honest all this stuff is quite consistent with my experience of other sony flagships again presumably because of slightly less thorough optimization compared to larger corporations so the thing to take away from this is that the xperia one mark iv has merit there are legitimate reasons why you might want to buy one for example it's absolutely top-class media experience but compared to a flagship from samsung who it's very clear build their smartphones by constantly keeping the average consumer in mind it's very clear why samsung phones sell more than sony phones and i would still be more likely to recommend someone this over this now if you are in the market for a new phone right now there's a pretty good chance you've been checking out lots of different stores signing up for multiple services and handing out your data like it's everyone's birthday but let me ask you a question do you have any idea how many companies hold this data and more importantly how to get it back a lot of people assume that at the point where they delete an app from their phone or deactivate one of their social media accounts their data just disappears but the truth is unless you specifically write to a company and exercise your right to be forgotten all of your sensitive personal data address phone number credit card everything will just sit on this growing number of servers from every single thing you've ever signed up to and well it goes without saying the more servers the higher the risk of a leak this does happen quite a lot and these data breaches involve the private information of hundreds of thousands and sometimes even millions of people all exposed to scams and online crime okay this is what mine is trying to counter they're the sponsors of this video and their app gives you a visual summary of exactly which companies know what about you and how to get it back so if i sign up with my email on saymine.com i can see that 861 companies are holding my personal data who on earth is come with daddy so i can just click on this company card it'll tell me what type of data they hold the risk level for a data breach and then i can just hit reclaim if i decide they shouldn't have it any longer and that's it with the help of mine i can send that company a data erasure request from my own inbox i can see the status of the requests i've sent to all times in the reclaims tab they even offer a solution to businesses to help them manage their privacy operations much better and eventually improve the experience for both consumers and companies so i'll leave a link down below to get started on your accounts to enjoy the full value of the internet today you kind of need to be open to giving out your data more and more that's why you need money to check out my experience meeting apple's robot for the first time that video is here or to
