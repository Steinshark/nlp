okay we're not gonna waste any time welcome to six surprising things you can do to customize your Android smartphone first up we've got an application called Kate wlp something I've never covered before because it is one of the more complex Android customization tools but there are some shortcuts you can take and it is very much worth the effort kW LP is a live wallpaper maker but one with so many options that you can almost create your own launcher in its entirety there's a lot to it but using presets means that instead of trying to build a theme you can just tweak an existing one for a quick example I loaded up this preset called bleeding edge and it looks amazing but when I'm scrolling the home page is only moving about 50% of the distance it needs to to reveal the layer below all I have to do is to open up the application and locate the top layer I then dipped into animation settings and essentially just adjusted the speed of the animation so that when you do scroll one scroll will mean that that top layer disappears entirely and that's it all of a sudden this works exactly how you'd wanted you hex shaders is a live wallpaper app that I have covered once before but it is improved a lot and there are now over 20 different options to pick from not to mention these aren't your standard live wallpapers each one has a pixelated look to save battery and when I show these to people they're either completely entranced or they can't stand the aesthetic but to me because the grid is actually hexagonal and not square I think instead of looking pixelated it actually looks kind of artistic volume pie is one that doesn't need much of an explanation once enabled you swipe from right or the left of your screen to bring up sliders for your media alarm and call volume with a lot of phones even this one the find X your fingers don't naturally rest on the volume buttons so if you want to change the volume on the fly without needing to adjust your grip this is any way of going about it you can also just give a light touch to bring up the media volume alone which I thought would be really fiddly but it works alright then we've got Niagra launcher which is a pretty new one if the fanciness of what I've shown you so far doesn't appeal to you this launcher lets go to any app in two taps and it can also be used one-handed from the name I'm guessing it's inspired by the famous waterfall and you see elements of this when using the launcher it's not overly animated though quite simple and to the point next up we've got keyboards and there's actually two that I want to show you the first one being crew mur which adapts to the color of the application you are in so if you're in the Play Store it's green if you're browsing YouTube it turns red and so on and so forth it is packed with gestures and also has a knight mode which can change the color tone when low light is detected so it's not too in-your-face when you're about to sleep also this app has been a long time in the making and has just had an update which has drastically improved the autocorrect the other option is flexi and visually this is maybe even more to take in on default settings there are colors and animations everywhere but the word prediction and correction is very accurate and gestures like swiping to delete words speed things up when you get used to it it's a fun one to play around with as well lots of fine-tuning you can do in the personalization tab you can even make each key press cycle in the colours of the rainbow mirror lab is probably the coolest way to make your perfect wallpaper a good way to describe it would be as an abstract photo editor and the best way I found to create a wallpaper is to take one you already like and then add a slight tweak like the height map which takes light areas and lifts them out of the image there's everything here from the ability to add turbulence to your background create pop-ups which distort the wallpaper and my personal favorite introducing geometry which lends itself quite nicely to nature and landscape photos a lot of fun to be had here if you did enjoy the video I have got a lot I mean a lot of Android customization content so link that from this video as always thanks so much for watching my name is Aaron this is mr.
