I have driven for days through the unimaginably
vast Australian Outback in Western Australia we have covered over one and a half megameters
that's over one and a half million meters roughly a thousand miles to be here in the
middle of nowhere underneath the Earth's sun which is an incredibly bright object and a
blasts light in every direction through the solar system the solar system including the
moon so the moon casts a shadow and roughly every year and a half that shadow hits the
Earth right here which is why everyone has gathered there are people here just to enjoy
it a lot of people have brought like amateur astronomy things scientific instruments in
fact my wife is here with a proper scientific experiment she's setting up as we speak and
I thought well I want to get involved I want to collect some data but not with an off-the-shelf
telescope oh no with my own handmade telescope and so that's a project that I gave to past
Matt past Matt here to make the telescope yes I've got a beard timer circular and we
need a few three key import units in a telescope first of all we need a tube so we've gone
and got a whole bunch of uh postage tubes that should do us for the tube at one end
you've got to put some Optics maybe the other end too like a mirror have to get the exact
details some level of Optics and then you need a sensor so actually we're going to start
with the sensor I've ordered one to this box so it literally arrived today I'm very excited
let's get it open here it is look at that it's a light meter [ __ ] I'm using a carry
okay this is gonna be the most professional telescope ever that's our sensor it's a single
Pixel people get real obsessed with having loads and loads of pixels to capture the image
coming in through the Optics I think no one pixel that way number one always stays in
Focus number two you'll need any Optics you'd put your single Pixel sensor at the end of
a tube telescope done okay so now we've got a single Pixel working this will uh tell me
on the screen exactly how many how many photons are hitting it I guess how bright it is and
we just put this at the end of a tube and it becomes a telescope the tube assembly process
was taken on as a project by my producer Nicole and Camera person Alex and my goodness they
did not hold back on the artistic Flair handing it in very delicate oh look at that it's got
oh you got the it's already been labeled look at that all right that's great so it's the
Parkerscope I thought we're going to call it the Parker solar probe what do you mean
that's already been used Honestly by who NASA never heard of her okay so so it's called
The Parkerscope as you can see it's always in Focus one of the many many features and
uh what's that one by one resolution 0.00001 megapixels focal length Infinity magnification
zero Optics nope all of these are for show only they do they do nothing I assume they're
just going to make um I mean look more respected and less likely to be laughed at by the other
other astronomers at the eclipse we then cut down the Parkerscope to a much more manageable
size and cut out a notch so that the light sensor could sit neatly inside the safety
of the tube with no tube that's picking up five 40 5 30. there we go that's good enough
it's still giving me 270. so we've lost half half the brightness but in theory if I'm at
the eclipse pointed up at the sky Mount that there somewhere plug it into a laptop to log
all the data this way anyone kind of moving near it it's not going to pick up that it's
just going to pick up the changing changing brightness of the sky so there you are that
is my gift uh to Matt in Australia ah amazing let's set it up what I'm thinking is I don't
want the telescope pointing at the sun because then the brightness will change just because
the sun will move in and out of shot so I'm going to have a pointing like away from the
Sun to just get like the ambient brightness because that's frankly all we've got the resolution
for just the actor walking past change the value that's not a good sign this changes slightly if I stand here you
know I'm just going to tape off that slot am I playing with the Parkerscope was simple
to leave it running for the entire three hours of the eclipse so I can get a complete plot
of the brightness of the sky throughout the entire eclipse the Parkerscope is running
largely as planned I've got the light sensor in the tube it's all held together final the
knobs are still on the side it then goes into the handheld unit which as we said before
is USB into the laptop now that took a bit of programming thankfully my brother Steve
is a much better programmer than me and he actually worked out the way that you can you
know query this and get the data back and it's in a ridiculous format it's actually
base 10 digits but they encode them as as a hex so you've got to take the binary that
comes off turn to hex tech that's ridiculous I'll link to the code below if anyone else
has to battle with one of these we've solved the problems code below all the turbo bits
I wrote Good bits Steve wrote so on my screen over here is putting up the values as they
come in both the original uh bits of hex and I'm decoding them it's all being saved as
we go along and I can't help but say what a professional looking outfit the Parkerscope
is and how it does not look out of place next to actual scientific equipment with my wife
here Professor Lucie Green uh so Lucie what is what is your actual kid doing I like it
comes from the University of Aberystwyth and um it's a telescope that they designed and
built which ultimately collects data that allows us to measure the density of the gas
in the atmosphere of the Sun so what we've got is a lens on the front and then a camera
system which has in it a Polaroid filter basically so the light that we're measuring from the
atmosphere of the sun is polarized then we know the polarization of the light coming
through it's important to know that because if we measure it we can work out that ultimately
the density of the gas in the atmosphere of the Sun and what's really nice is the name
of the telescope is CIP the Coronal Imaging Polarizer but it's a Welsh telescope and CIP
means glance in Welsh which is really lovely so glancing at the Sun during the total phase
whereas Parkerscope means having a look at giving it a go but the important thing is
it looks like a real bit of scientific kit I think they're indistinguishable thank you
I've got more glue and tape and type hey I had the Parkerscope running before the eclipse
had officially started so I could get a nice Baseline brightness reading and just to recap
some of the terminology during an eclipse we've got the moon coming towards the Sun
so far no Eclipse yet first Contact is when the very edge of the Moon touches the very
edge of the Sun and now we're in Eclipse Town We Carry On The Moon gradually covering more
and more of the sun second contact is when that Leading Edge of the Moon touches the
far edge of the Sun in our case we were going to have to wait for an hour and a half after
first Contact before we got second contact but now it's totality this is the dark part
of the eclipse this is going to last about a minute for us before we have Third Contact
that's where the trailing edge of the Moon touches the edge of the Sun and after that
it gets bright again and an hour and a half later of watching the sky get gradually brighter
and brighter we have fourth contact which has been Moon leaves the Sun the whole thing
is about three hours from beginning to end if the Parkerscope serves me well I should
have a plot of the brightness of the sky a curve of how much light there is from the
entire process so what shape do we think that curve might look like well one way to approximate
it would be to take a unit disc gradually cover it with another slightly bigger disc
because of our perspective with the sun and then just track the total area we can see
and of course we can run that in Python first I use Python to give me a white disk to represent
the Sun and then I've got a black disc for the moon which is scaled to the apparent sizes
we had during the eclipse the moon was actually 1.092 percent bigger from our point of view
the magenta by the way has no impact on the simulation I put that in afterwards just so
you can see where the Moon is easily at all points in time and you can see I'm tracking
the percentage of the sun that's still visible what I actually did was count all the pixels
in the original disk and then I've just got the percentage the fraction of the pixels
you can see for every frame as the moon covers it up and yes there's a analytical way I could
have just calculated each of these but this makes a simulation a bit more flexible which
is going to come in handy in a moment although the sun is not a uniformly bright disc it
actually gets dimmer the further out you go so we could compensate for that with an unevenly
colored in disc that then we cover with the moon and you know I did that here's my simulated
Sun that gets darker as you go further out now the actual physics behind why that happens
is a bit complicated is because when you're looking at the middle of the sun you can actually
look further into the sun because when you look at the edges of the sun you're looking
at it like a glancing blow and so you can only look so far into the sun because of the
optical depth or rather that's where the photons are emitted from the plasma and the ones on
the side have to go through more plasma to get to us so we're actually looking at ones
that are closer to the sun's surface and they actually produce less photons because they're
cooler the point is it tapers off as you get to the edge and I've used this formula as
an approximation for that process yes and different frequencies of light actually have
different u values in this approximation I've picked a u of 0.7 which is pretty good across
the range of visible light we're looking at if anything it's a little bit higher than
you'd expect so I've got the sun about 40 brightness at the edge which is slightly more
limb darkening than you'd expect but I thought I'd go for something that makes it a bit more
visually obvious what's happening and hopefully if we look at the values I'm getting out of
this simulation and now I'm adding up all the fractional values of the pixels that are
still visible it will be sufficiently different when we compare it to the first simulation
and what about the fact we're just pointing it at the sky I'm sure people who know more
about the atmosphere are yelling things involving refraction and scattering and yes I know it's
not a perfect metric and of course the sun is moving during this so it's getting like
closer to the point of the sky I'm pointing it I guess it's going to be complex I think
we we can still pull out some kind of nice curve finally after all this waiting around
second contact happened and we had totality this is the main bit of the eclipse this is
why everyone was there this is the bit where Lucy could take the cover off her telescope
to record her polarized light data she only cared about the photons arriving during the
total eclipse because she just wanted to see the sun's atmosphere now that all of the Photosphere
was finally blocked post eclipse and I have a mild problem because the sun's move so much
and I didn't put enough thought into where I put the Marcus Coop originally the sun is
now actually going into the tube which means I'm getting crazy high readings down here
like way higher than I got before more than would be justified by just like the Sun moving
around in the sky so even though it's going to kind of ruin the data I'm going to move
it if I didn't move it the data would be ruined as well so I think the only thing I can do
is shift it into a new like equivalent spot in the sky and hopefully that'll fix the data
problem you could do that that's a more realistic
uh value on the thing down here but what I'm worried about is if people walk by it changes
so I'm just going to walk by I don't think that's adjusting because of
me I'm going to go with that as my best option so I sadly it's now pointing a lot more kind
of horizontal and I did the change at 12 minutes past 12. and so we now just had to wait for
the end of the eclipse I'm not gonna lie most of the people left after totality people just
packed up and they were on their way but not us we were going to wait there patiently get
all of that delicious data however you don't have to wait because you're watching this
in the future and I know someone who's already got all of the final data and is able to show
us what the results look like future Matt here I'm back in Perth now and I've both got
all the data from the Parkerscope onto my laptop and I thought it'd be fun to film the
data processing bit in the Sun so I've come down the beach hopefully the sound really
is very loud waves hopefully the sound of that's not gonna be a problem I I had the
plot and I'll show it to you and here it is check it out that's that's the data isn't
it incredible so you can see I mean straight out of the box you can see here I repositioned
the Parkerscope that's when oh life's happening now little Sun going in to the tube and that's
obviously reflecting onto the sensor the sensor's very sensitive that's why it's called the
sensor short for sensitive and uh and so I repositioned it here you can see the adjustment
and then all this noise I'm pretty sure that is people walking past uh reflecting light
onto my incredibly sensitive scientific equipment and then here flat does flatten out post a
clip so I have got the post Baseline but you know what I've got such a good beginning bit
so this is before the eclipse all the way into the eclipse there's totality that little
bit there and then it comes out afterwards this is where the Sun starts hitting it so
you know what it's symmetric we're just going to use the first half now one thing you may
have noticed there's a few spikes in my data so this is like outliers like anomalies in
the datas now this bike here I've actually got a zoom in of just that section you can
see that there's there's the recordings we should be getting as it's getting darker suddenly
boom I'm naturally low value and then back up again now the new line here is actually
slightly lower so I could get rid of that where's that small one there it is there so
if I was to delete delete those two bits of data there we go uh shift up there we go okay
now you can see there's the before drop and after so my theory is this is when I mean
either someone walked over into something weird when I wasn't paying attention to the
Parkerscope or this is when it was switching scales going from one scale like one range
of value to the next range down and maybe it doesn't perfectly line up before and after
who knows but what I did was I just I've removed the outliers I just straight up deleted them
I didn't try and do anything else clever around it so you can still see Little Steps little
step function there where I've taken out that and I've only got the the four of the eclipse
and then I've got totality and ever so slightly after two things to note here one you can
see one you can't the one you can see is the lead-in this is before we had the eclipse
even starting this should be perfectly normal day like like any other day and sadly it's
changing it's gradually going up and that's because the sun's moving in the sky and that's
changing the intensity of what the Parkerscope's looking at and secondly if you look at the
totality so if I zoom in where's totality here it is look at that so here it is the
light is coming down down down down down and then it goes flat and there's a tiny like
such a small value of like residual light that's going on and that I guess is either
light that's being reflected in from the atmosphere elsewhere or it's from the corona I don't
know but is a trivial like point one percent of what we've got to start with left but even
that is very very slowly going up so even over the one minute duration of the absolute
totality part of the eclipse even though there's barely any light you can still see it ever
so gradually changing because the sun and the moon are still moving in the sky and so
there's still that one weird change let's assume that's what's happening and so what
I did was I took the lead-in data this is like the if you go back to the whole plot
this is just this section up here before the eclipse has started at all you take the lead-in
data I approximated that as a linear curve just like a straight line and I worked out
what that is and I worked out then what I'd have to do to remove that from the data if
you do that with a simple linear correction you go from the Blue Line That's before I've
corrected it down to the orange line that's now see they have a perfect flat start here
the totality is is better but not perfect it's still got a very slight increase on it
but I'll have to do something far more complicated to fix that now if you're thinking surely
there's a better way to do this then just you know really naive linear approximation
of what was going on you're correct I could have done a much better job and there's a
lot of reasons why I didn't and what I tried they're all a bit too much for this video
so I'm going to make a bonus patreon only video because it's my fantastic patreon supporters
who meant that I got to go and do all this at the eclipse anyway so on patreon there's
a video where I explain other things I tried to do to calibrate fix compensate the data
and we look at two cheeky mysterious spikes oh one that I haven't talked about in the
main video so if you want to check that out I'll link to it below and at a minimum have
a moment to appreciate the patreon supporters who make these videos possible what we're
going to do now is compare what I've got here the orange line to the simulations where I
was moving the discs in front of the sun here's the first one this was the full sun with no
limb darkening and there there you go you can see fully bright I've just normalized
everything to be one and then it dips down totality goes back up again those are the
numbers that you saw in the previous simulation video that I had and if I add on now the dim
sun you can see it's a subtly different line actually no if I drag that down you can have
a bit of a closer look at it so you can see it's exactly the same idea the purple one
is the no limb darkening and you can see the green one where there's limb darkening first
of all it stays a little bit brighter for longer because it's the dimmer bit that's
being covered and if it gets all normalized to the initial brightness in both cases so
it all lines up and then it uh then it overtakes and then it's below so without limb darkening
the drop-off is a lot more straight linear with limb darkening it first of all it goes
out and then it comes down I think it's a little more flamboyant which is kind of fun
so the question now is where did the data in the PArkerscope land well I got it so first
of all I took uh the simulation data I converted it to be the same range as what I had off
the Parkerscope I then took the Parkerscope data and normalized it to be one as well so
it all lines up I put it together and it looks like this and now you can see there's no limb
darkening in the purple there's the actual data in the orange and there's with dim darkening
so the the actual data is slightly above it but the same shape as the darkening they all
crossed at about the same place give or take and then down here look at that match look
at it that's so I mean there's the bit where I took the spike out and things kind of adjust
so I'm just going to assume that all the stuff over here on the left actually you can see
there it steps off ah all of that I think that's an issue with the sensor and that should
be dropped down perfectly onto the green which I considered doing but I was like that's too
close to fudging the data so this is this is the actual raw data with our one linear
correction that I think that should be a little bit lower and look at the bottom there look
at that match and it's just a little bit on the inside so if you remember when did the
limb darkening I went like more in the dark Direction than I heard on more Darkness rather
than less and I'm now just inside that so actually this gives us some insight into the
sun because the reason you get the limb darkening is because of the gradient of the temperature
in the plasma under the Photosphere in the Sun and because of the optical depth of how
far the photons could move and if you didn't have this gradient and temperature that changes
the photon production you wouldn't have any limb darkening but we do have limb darkening
the Parkerscope has managed to prove that there is limb darkening on the sun which means
you can use the data from the Parkerscope to deduce roughly the nature of the temperature
gradient of the plasma inside the Sun as it goes below the Photosphere that's that is
a fundamental insight into the nature of our star to an eclipse ah I'm so pleased I mean I was
braced for this to not show anything and it'd be a bit of a bit of a laugh you know a vague
curve and once again I like to model the idea that you just you give things a go you try
it and you don't need fancy equipment you just give it a go and I gave it a go and I
was able to show something about the fundamental physics of the Sun ah oh I'm so proud I'll
hand you back over to past Matt at the eclipse we now have all of our data I hope you enjoyed
whatever I managed to do with it we're going to pick up the Parkerscope now save it for
the next eclipse and head home I just want to thank all my patreon supporters who make
this possible I know it looks like it's just me larking around on holiday which kind of
is but there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes a lot of costs and teams and editing
and all sorts of things it's all enabled on my patreon supporters so thank you so much
to each and every single one of you you mean I can make videos like this and these days
there are so many incredible math YouTubers out there making all sorts of videos how long
between when it started and when it ended then we can actually determine the reason
you're the only YouTuber here making a mathematics video so thank you so much here are the names
of all the people you should be grateful to foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thanks for all your support
