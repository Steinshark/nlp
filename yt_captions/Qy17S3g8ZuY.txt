what's up guys chances are at some point or another while you are on YouTube you saw a video titled how to unlock any iPhone without the passcode so what we're gonna do is I'm going to react to about seven of these videos and we're to test them on my iPhone and see you know if one of these work I mean they have millions of views one of them has to work and for every video I react to that doesn't work I'm gonna smash a laptop and I have a pile of laptops over there cuz I have a feeling a lot of these won't work there's no BS behind this so what you're gonna wanna do is ask Siri what time is it what time is it hey Siri what time is it okay did step one it now provides you with a time in which you can select select and it will bring you to this okay and what you're gonna wanna do is push this a little plus button in the top right corner press the plus what you're gonna wanna do is type in Soflo and next what you wanna do is select this select all select all the option to share in this top right corner select share alright what looks like this doesn't work because he said select all and then press share but share is not a feature on my phone it just says copy paste and cut therefore basically this video doesn't work why didn't know it work all right let's watch video number two hi well I do what you're gonna do is you're right now what you're gonna say I wasn't so basically you can hold down this home butchers and what you're gonna say is what what's the time Siri okay Siri what is the time so that's the video he made a video titled how to unlock any smartphone without the passcode and and it was just him putting his phone and a sink stupid videos hate them alright so video number three is titled how to unlock any mobile phone without knowing the passcode and it's pretty weird that what would work for an Android or an iPhone but according to this video okay hold down the start none of those are feature on an iPhone to basically made a video titled how to unlock any phone doesn't work for an iPhone for the dude I'm going to show you how to unlock any iPhone device I'm ready boys let's do this you use simple steps you can get from the lock screen to the home screen Siri what's the time hey Siri what's the time good evening to you okay guys once you're here you want to click on this then once you've done that you're going to hold here say select all copy select all County on that you're going to want to close that reopen it you're going to say 'slap-ass it react or and zero few seconds leave it for a few seconds is it but a processor touch off okay okay removes everything and voila it did not work for much umm yeah it didn't work for me oh what a shock the home button and say remind me remind me okay just tell me what you want to be reminded about I will wake up tomorrow at 11 p.m. I will wake up tomorrow at 11 p.m. alright not one I miss screaming serious what does up with the reminders you're gonna hit that reminder alright so there was our reminder all right and the video already doesn't work when I tap on the reminder like he says look at it it just brings up this so whatever he was doing and this was patched even though alright time for video number six I believe not quite sure this one's titled how to unlock phone without knowing the passcode slash pattern password slash pattern it says phone [Music] on the iPhone or running the latest iOS 10.2 now I'm not a hacker I don't claim plumbing here go to my context and FaceTime I myself or a FaceTime the phone number that we're are targeting the phone that we're targeting here let's FaceTime in hey I'm trying to just test something can you just call my phone like FaceTime I'm not gonna pick it up can you just call it with FaceTime alright so the guy said to have someone faced FaceTime the phone and then he said clear it click custom message all right so my friends facetiming me someone hit message I'm gonna hit custom okay now let's see what the video says to keep doing as you see I'm not the same screen he's application not a big deal I can reply from here but I have to do now is go ahead and enable voiceover using Siri as well the phone is still locked enable voiceover enable voiceover okay so voice over is on this is an assistant accessibility feature tap on Apple DoubleTap hold it double tap hold on the keyboard until I get this text field to recognize that I'm tapping on the keyboard it's a bit complicated but it is possibly you tried I've been doing what he said in the video but apparently they patched it is I've been doing it for at least 10 minutes now and it's not working what he did so yeah obviously they probably patched it cuz this video it's a couple weeks old so yeah it's official guns you can't unlock an iPhone without the passcode about how many clickbait videos you see look my girlfriend's phone again hey Siri what's the time oh so yeah guys I watched seven different videos on how to unlock an iPhone without a password or passcode none of them worked none of them work and I have a feeling no video on YouTube shows you how to a passcode on an iPhone which is kind of ironic because there's hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of them on YouTube yet none of them work anymore and all of them still are titled like to do in fact is even more ironic that I'm gonna use the video where I talk about these people lying so I can lie in the title and get a bunch of views about unlocking iPhone and I'll see you guys later [Music]
