[Music] what's up guys i'm kitty hd here oh okay what's up guys uh we're out here in sunny warm much warmer than the east uh hawthorne california and we're out here for the tesla model y event and i say we because it's you and i but it's i'm out here we're out here so for the like four of you who don't know uh model y is going to be the fourth in tesla's s3 x y lineup so it kind of completes it so model s and model x are the big the big car and the big suv they're more premium they're more higher priced and then there's the model 3 which you're kind of starting to see everywhere especially in the us it's a smaller slightly lower priced at the lowest price they have car and so model y is going to be essentially an suv version of model 3. so this event out here in beautiful hawthorne why i'm here this is the big reveal this is where they're finally going to show us the design the specs and the price and maybe they'll start taking pre-orders or something who knows maybe uh maybe a surprise or two also you could tell by the reflection i don't know how casey and peter and all you guys vlog with this 1dx this is a gigantic camera but uh we'll get to it i actually really wish i really wish i had a switch pod right about now so some of you may be wondering why model y why model y is even a big deal at all or even if it is i think it is i think model y could end up being a bigger seller than the model 3. and it's because i mean we've seen model 3 sort of rise up in the charts of best-selling cars over the past couple months that it's been out but the best-selling suvs especially in the us the best-selling suvs are constantly way outselling the best-selling cars so i think model y has a potential to be a much bigger seller than even model 3. and so there it is one of the very few tech products of the past year that didn't leak so this is your first public look at the tesla model y so my first reaction to seeing it first rolled up on stage was uh yep looks about right looks like a bigger model three a little taller but you know from this front angle on stage very familiar very similar and the specs of course are similar too so it's going to be 230 miles with standard up to 300 mile range with the long range version and then you can see the acceleration number is pretty modest if you ask me if you're not getting the performance version but of course the performance one is zippy at 3.5 seconds 0-60 and the price range and release dates are all here it's going to start at 39 000 but similar to model 3 they're not going to be making that base model cheapest version right off the bat they're going to make the higher end more margin filling models starting in fall 2020 then the base model at 39 000 will come by 2021. also you may have noticed when they got that car up on stage uh seven people got out of it so tesla is saying model y is a seven seater with three rows of seats that is something i had to see in person because that's uh it doesn't look that much bigger than model three but that's exactly what i did so when elon was done on stage we got to go outside and see it in person a bit more for ourselves go for a test ride and take a closer look now seeing it outside and driving on a different light basically the more angles i see it from the more i see it as basically a hybrid in design between the model x and the model three it's like the two of them had a baby or something and really it's mostly model three since it's sharing parts with it but with a few differences so one it's bigger than model three that's the obvious one two there's an all glass panoramic roof now which looked really cool and seamless but was literally impossible to get footage of tonight three the ride height is a little higher and that's on purpose so you sit a little higher in the same seats in this crossover than you would in the model three four i think the front trunk should be a bit deeper as well that is me speculating uh they didn't let anyone open the front trunk or rear trunk but it looks like that should be the case and five speaking of trunks the hatchback so it is now an automatic lifting rear lift gate that is great for cargo i love the model s hatchback uh i've had all four tires in the back of my car the other day so i'm happy to see that that's gonna be great for space and then number six with all that extra space there is a third row option now like we saw seeing it in person it looks extremely cramped and my gut reaction is i don't recommend it if you need three rows worth of people on the regular get a bigger car like a model x type of size because if you do put people on the third row yeah you better hope they're either smaller or much younger because the legroom and headroom seem to be both extremely limited model x has more space of course and number seven something i found really interesting so if you look at the parts where there is normally chrome on the model three so the door handles the window trim the mirror pieces where it's normally really shiny all of these pieces on the model y as you can see our sort of a satin matte black color and it turns out that's the way it's going to be there are no shiny chrome pieces on this car it's like a factory chrome delete so you don't have to get your car wrapped to get rid of the chrome anymore so i think that's pretty sweet not a lot of people notice that and that's mainly it so i mean you know i got my 30 second test drive like everyone else who waited it was pitch black the footage was almost useless but hey i got to ride in it um and one of the angles that you actually don't get to see as much in a lot of the videos you're going to start to see is the back of the car like the butt of it to me it kind of looks like a model 3 with the lights but then with the tall shape of the model x but no spoiler so again very hybrid like and the interior as far as steering wheel and display and the seats and everything is exactly the same as the model 3. so basically if you like the model 3's looks you'll like this if you didn't like the model 3's looks then this is going to change your mind or anything but that's about it i mean all the time i got to spend with model y was pretty brief hopefully we get to spend more time with it soon maybe we can do an autofocus episode in the daylight sometime that would be sick also bonus i got to spend a hot minute with the 2020 roadster first time i've ever seen the car in person actually and sweet baby jesus that car looks incredible i want it to exist so bad right now so many things about it like the carbon fiber and the wheels the rear diffuser the screens on the inside the seats the color the arrow the bodywork everything so hot uh i really hope it's on time that car is sick anyway that's been it guys hope you enjoyed your first look at model y the affordable slightly larger model 3 with a third row option and a hatchback liftgate i do i really do think it will sell more than the model 3 because of the utility but only time will tell so stay tuned for more videos either way thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music] [Music]
