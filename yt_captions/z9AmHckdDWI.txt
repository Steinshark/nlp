recently we showed off the 100 000 desk PC that we built for Carl Jacobs a Minecraft YouTuber with copious Capital but we only showed you the destination not the journey so here it is how to build a hundred thousand dollar desk PC and how to thank our sponsor see Sonic we're here in beautiful Squamish British Columbia to check out SS CAD cam these are the same guys that did the Machining for our play button PC and the machines they have in here are freaking incredible come on come on Andy this massive hunk of aluminum isn't even one of the largest that's going in our desk this will make one of the Wings and it alone is 315 pounds and just this part was nearly 2 000 Canadian dollars to machine the wings of our desk we're using this DMG Mori dmu65 this thing it absolutely smokes our tormach like not even in the same league this thing has 60 Tools in it and they swap just so fast it has a 46 horsepower spindle that goes up to 20 000 RPM the ability of this thing to shred through aluminum is absolutely incredible the wings of our desk are at the absolute limits of the size of this machine even just getting this thing on here is a huge pain in the ass like you can't just Chuck this in a vise like a normal thing so instead it's held in using one of these orange clamps so down on the bottom of our big block of aluminum we have these studs that are threaded in then it goes in like that and you're able to tighten it right down there's three of these in the bottom here the whole thing is a complete custom fixture just for us all right can we run it press Start oh heck yeah I did a thing this isn't even the largest hunk of aluminum that we need to machine though this is the Canada arm3 and it's what Amish normally uses to load material into his Mill only problem the load limit is 400 pounds and our hunk of aluminum is 550. that's 3 500 worth of aluminum he had to use a forklift to get this in there this old Hoss might have been made when Carl was only one year old but it's still got it where it counts biggest thing well it's big this thing's able to take seven feet of stock in the X direction of course to fit a piece of aluminum this big onto it we needed to make completely Custom Jigs once again so down here we have a big custom piece of aluminum where you're bolting down straight through it when all said and done this 550 pounds of aluminum is going to be turned into just 65 which means we're going to have a lot a lot of chips this huge bin is where all of our aluminum chips are going to end up and we expect to fill it 12 times fortunately all of those chips are going to go to a recycler down the road so it'll be turned into well like pop cans another desk no we're not making another desk enough of me talking though let's get to Machining Tim Hit It oh [Music] I couldn't help noticing that it's in a lot of pieces yeah this right here actually arrived in the back of a car this is what we have to do today if this video is any less than three and a half hours long you can rest assured that it's been cut aggressively and there's going to be a lot of extras over on floatplane.com wings onto frame let's go I mean there's three of us and it's all been test fitted so theoretically it shouldn't be that bad should we have gloves to make our lives easier in terms of cleaning it later first things first we're going to take these parts and we're going to install them and then we're gonna Slide the wings in okay so yes these are indexed to each side this is a left side front that is the right side front and I got washers here right uh on the on the bolt side just put all the bolts and two nuts on we're gonna Loctite everything okay so I've got all the bolts and uh hold on it's a little tall okay do you want to speed run the desk or not all in now that the project has been fully designed Tim figures he spent over a month of dedicated time just looking at SolidWorks and that's nothing compared to the time that this thing took to machine the details on this are incredible so this KJ a ball End Mill went across and did all of this so there's this nice little texture here this is not some cast part or something like that is machined what we're gonna do is we're going to make sure that these are flat or at least as close to parallel as we can we're going to be fitting neoprene on top so it's not going to be a super big issue sure but we do want them to seat nicely when we put the wings in these puzzle piece slots so we're gonna put lock cutter in each of them flatten them tighten them up so just apply loctates yep just inside and it never came apart again we're good yeah all right that one's done moving in for this remember is there okay do not have ratchets oh we do but we don't have a half inch doesn't matter I have a sneaking suspicion I can do a better job than they are right now by just laser eyeballing it Tim you're with me right physically oh my God our side's so much better Alex that's so far off hey watch this hey be nice be nice to it my number one goal with this shoot is to make sure that Linus doesn't drop the desk sorry uncomfortable question how much did we spend on aluminum was it over ten thousand dollars yes Carl you better beat Minecraft like hard Jesus Christ that's backwards put it down backwards how long before the first Saudi Prince asks us for one of these like first in line for the throne or no no it's not backwards it's upside down Wait no that's not right is it oh yeah okay that's even worse are you messing with me no I'm not no you're messing I'm worried you're gonna drop it I don't even believe you no I don't I'm not trusting you anymore don't let go why would I let go it's not screwed in I love how industrial this thing looks there's just a certain Beauty to Raw machined metal Carl has no idea at this point what he's getting like look at this how could you not sit at this because it's backwards but I know like guys I'm trying to make sure Carl's not like because we don't technically have the money from them yet you guys know that right I'm not an accounting uh let's install radiators what that's not the next step you won't be able to install the legs if you do that oh then let's install the legs good job Linus good idea if only there's a step-by-step list so that it all goes together properly this computer is going to weigh like a thousand pounds 350. 350 pounds how the hell is anybody gonna move it it's getting built into a crate you want it extravagant buddy it occurs to me that not every motorized standing desk is built equal can this actually handle the full 300 pound girth of what's sitting on top of it it's 350 pounds and that can hold 375 plus all the water plus the components plus all the uh this is very borderline 10 bucks says I can solo lift the desk let's go hold on don't Tim you're saying next we can level the legs and then take it off the saw horses no we have to show off the cardboard thing the cardboard do you remember a couple months ago when you were running for an Uber and I was attempting to show you the ergonomic design study that I'd done to say that the desk would actually feel good to fit in oh yeah oh yeah this this is actually critical because an early revision of the desk PC design suffered from the same fatal flaw as my original desk PC it was thick all the way across the front so Carl would undoubtedly be celebrating beating Minecraft and whack his knees on it which sucks so I asked him hey would you mind doing a casual complete redesign of the entire face of the desk and angle this so we can maintain the depth we need in the back for the hardware but have a nice place for knees to go um did it end up working like has anyone actually sat at this yet as soon as I tightened that side we can check out what's the point of a height adjustable desk if you can't adjust the height so what we're doing right now is we're just homing the legs to make sure that they are both at exactly the same height so the whole thing doesn't sit off kilter like this then we can take the saw horses out and work on it as they're not on the ground but they're struggling not yet not yet you're good good yeah oh it's very short okay height adjust press and hold the down button until it reaches its lowest height then wait until it rebounds to the lowest height which signals the reset process is complete hmm I can't get it to do anything okay now you locked it yes way to go Alex damn it down I wonder if the desk is too heavy it's expecting to just have a certain amount on it I think it's a safety mechanism well it's adjusted a little bit at a time say look no problem the point was never for it to be a standing desk but that it would be a height adjustable set of legs because all the other ones on the market just do set screws okay worst case scenario we asked Plexi spot for another controller or something and we replace it easy yeah because we have other desks from them they don't do this do you want to lower it back down and try to sit at it oh knee clearance is more than adequate yes cardboard prototyping for the win okay what's next aux power supplies you've probably noticed that this is not a normal PC power supply that's because there are many things going into this PC that are not a PC like for example the RGB lighting tubes we could use LED strips but instead we used well there's still LED strips in there but really powerful ones you are going to take this beautiful lovely well machined three axis CNC milled piece of desk and you're gonna put a couple holes in it ah no not there right there right there no are you gonna put the Titan tube on there well I just assumed that we'd make a hole with this lightsaber hi Linus running late on that video here take these Heavenly organs from EK water cooling heaven it's beautiful EK did up these reservoirs for this project that are a completely custom check that out and B gold-plated to just really sell the opulence of this setup man I love it and there's not one but two of them mad respect for not just the equipment but the expertise that it took to design and build all of these parts like these are works of art these are not computer Reservoir pump combos Ah that's metal on metal I do not like oh wow that is extremely tight thank you no I mean was there a total of six pumps six six pumps oh my God this is gonna take forever maybe a little bit faster all right now stop and pull it up I never do that and that's why I have three kids are you just countersinking by eye yep you're stressing me out Tim that's okay did I mention there are going to be a whopping three of these in the system five I thought what shot really five I mean we weren't constrained by budget what all are you even doing over here you're still countersinking it yeah by eyeballs yeah why because do you need help many many ways Linus okay do we have benefits yeah there we go that's gone there's radiators on here and everything she fits nice two mil yeah there's not a lot of space but that's a good thing apparently it's called tolerancing news we're gonna install all the gold fittings on these radiators after we install the cables to the fans those have to come first so then the other way of providing those instructions would have been we need to put in the cables for all the fans then put in the gold fittings okay so you're right but the thing is for the rest of this video Let's watch Tim and see if he can say you're right without also saying butt Dan and I actually uh we're here till 9 30 uh last night building these fan cables he was an absolute Saint and uh and helped us out with a lot of the soldering work that needed to happen and because this desk is not a normal computer we had to make custom length cables for everything even this what is that this is for the standing desk legs and if it doesn't work properly I blame Dan no no he doesn't deserve blame are you just are you just trying to make the workplace less hostile and toxic is that I just try to instill goodness in the people that I work with man you know you got a deluxe computer when you're getting and lubed O-rings on every fitting we do not want this thing to leak can I can I help you with this you doing it what I have two hands here they're here but as we have established the knee is perfectly fine for this job it's gonna be a really tight fit but the tolerance does work now we got this I believe easy mode these are not the same length at all but okay sure this is where it goes from big sheet of aluminum to big sheet of aluminum with two gigantic pump reservoir combos on it and these things look incredible stage you're probably wondering what purpose do these serve ah let me explain there are three coolant Loops in this system now I didn't call them cooling Loops because one of them doesn't actually cool anything the first coolant Loop is on this side it gets three radiators two pumps and cools the CPU the second cooling Loop is over here three radiators two pumps cools the GPU the third coolant Loop this is great actually just occupies the space between these tubes so that there's just fluid moving around between this giant Reservoir pump distribution plate thing so there's no purpose at all other than to look amazing it equilibrates oh my God that's unnecessary if say Carl was playing Minecraft and really stressing that GPU with RTX on and the GPU Loop were to get hotter these gold tubes would get hotter than these gold tubes so the coolant flowing all around them would actually take that X excess heat from this Loop and dissipate it through these radiators what we're marveling at right now is how little Flex there is in the middle of the table so you can see that there it's basically a completely flat surface we were expecting that the cable management tray that's going to sit under here and act as kind of a brace would be needed to keep it from bowing but as it turns out um a big slab of aluminum is like and it's worth noting that it's not fully weighted yet we have it out of the water we haven't added a lot of the components like the 4090 and the motherboard but it's it's doing remarkably well and I'm I'm quite pleased to see at how well it was machined thanks Amos PCI plates mobile plates are you cross threading that no if I could do that with my fingers you'd be impressed though these are ugly we actually had to use a different type of aluminum for those than the desk itself because we needed this one to bend cleanly 6061 aluminum does not Bend nearly as nicely as 50 50. right but it's pretty it's prettier which is why we used it and it's it's more structurally sound for an application like this but this with pcie plates and just for the the motherboard backplate works great what you're going to be doing is taking this and sliding it in from this side which doesn't similar so much matter for this guy but for the other one it does and then you're going to be putting the screws on the bottom first and then that way and then on the top we're almost at a Loctite in here which makes it really hard to accurately like squeeze it out but I have a strategy no don't use the floor I wouldn't use it as lubricant though it's stuck does this hold up the graphics card it does are you kidding me this is a 100 000 computer and we have a little aluminum cube with double-sided tape on it Tim are you kidding me well we'll need this all right okay Okay this may be the sloppiest sleeving job I have ever seen but how well a you were lazy and used split Loom yeah B this heat shrink is the wrong size and you barely even bothered to shrink it and see you didn't even bother to heat shrink the other side do I go lever not this right here when it's in location looks fantastic it's like they get they get split like that and it has to be on an angle it looks fantastic when it's actually in there all of my criticisms were entirely valid it's very easy to just put some heat shrink on there if you want but I want to make it I know which is why you should have done it no we need to make sure that's all the correct length and stuff we haven't done all of the wiring yet for that linuses about criticisms and I have made these criticisms known already I'm sorry what are you happy about because it can't be that we're still working on this project so this entire thing has never been on legs we are going further than I have ever gone before Mr Frodo and this was something that I had prepped uh prior to installing but the scaffolding was in front of it so I could never actually test fit it all right so this if you can just barely see is now what it looks like see how it just runs underneath those USB cables z790 dark it's a very specific reason that we got this motherboard because it's Kingpin Edition there's that bottle because we love EVGA also though because the color scheme is amazing also because the ram is at the top which makes our tubing run so much easier with the layout I'm going to go ahead and install the very fastest gaming CPU on the planet the 3900 KS from Intel is it power efficient no this is a great value but is it the right choice for Carl Jacobs 100 000 PC absolutely it's a 980 Pro 2 terabyte the real reason we chose the 980 is because we chose it a while ago but we're going to say it's because 990 is a rumored to be dying yes that's it speaking of which I have a similar justification for our use of 6000 Mega transfer per second low latency memory it actually doesn't really help performance pass that as you would know if you watched our recent video looking at high speed memory performance scaling on Intel 13th gen processors but actually it's because you know well I already told you okay can I help you guys um with something else I have installed CPU oh I can install CPU block who moved the damn seat oh I did hey is that not thermal compound probably you know there's definitely enough of though gold that looks amazing now I'm sure you thought of this but you know that there's a specific Inlet and Outlet on there right uh yeah we'll just run the pumps backwards did we account for it yes are you sure I have absolutely no idea these tubes go flat from out of the block into the distribution block and so there's no way for us to cross them they're hard-line tubes we couldn't have this one come out to this side and then have this one magically teleport through it that wouldn't work when Jake and I built the VR Gaming PC in the lounge we discovered that the difference between installing these the correct way around and the not correct way around can be 30 to 40 degrees holy crap it would be a disaster I have to say to your credit though Tim this is about as smoothly as I have ever seen a project like this go my new favorite feature of this computer the four RGB headers on this motherboard overclocking board performance first but damn it that doesn't mean you don't need RGB are we ready for the cable tray yeah I think so you could kill a man with this dribble whoa hi how you doing hey guess who did that oh I it was you yep yeah 100 it's so that right there is strain relief that is very important I don't know I'm feeling pretty strained oh now it's time to talk about what might be the most important component of this build this right here is a 750 watt power supply and not just any 750 watt power supply it has a modular interface and manages 80 plus Platinum efficiency we will have not one but two of these for a total of 1500 watts of low profile compact power and did I mention it comes with a 10 year warranty that's right when csonic says trust me bro they got you the batteries are dead for our cordless heat gun so I'm using our other cordless heat gun oh my God Alex something we haven't talked about yet is the monitors he's going going for a dual vertical I don't know if he knows this yet but he's going for a dual vertical monitor single horizontal in the middle monitor design that's going to be perfect for monitoring your chat having your stream preview up and all that kind of stuff and then of course gaming down the middle Tim you were saying that this is another like first off the line This monitor but this is the same one I have wait this one's overclocked did Carl get a better monitor than me by the way I had a major concern about the vrms on the motherboard because those of you who've been paying close attention will have realized that there is no real airflow going across the board but Tim pointed out that they thought of this and that's actually one of the reasons that they chose this board it has fans back here that are going to take fresh air from the outside and blow it across the board so our RAM and our vrms are going to be totally taken care of look at this mangled o-ring I found in one of the fittings it's a good thing we didn't try to put that in well this is a really big loop like normally this goes up pretty fast this is going to be a whole lot of this it is going up though yeah yep if this is like spiff's PC I will be so mad what happened with spiffs PC I just fill it with water and then it leaked water all over the GPU and then yeah let's go this is gonna take a lot of water whoa what the crap who didn't put this pudding back on Jake let's go let's go speed filling careful that is open oh this one's open too I didn't put it in over here either damn it Alex what the Jake let's go let's let's two three go let's go come on come on come on there we go let's just let it do its thing for a little bit let me just see it's gonna do the exact same thing well we're just gonna let it do its exact same thing just for a little bit uh should we just press the CMOS clear button and see what happens yeah that's a good idea okay I feel good oh hey hey let's go yay you want an energy setup I would strongly suggest that we just down clock the ramp a little bit and it probably will be happy no we're gonna down clock the ram are you kidding me I would strongly suggest taking yeah you know what guess what Get Wrecked Alex because here we go [Laughter] it's trying something we also don't hold on hold on just lightning yeah 6 000 megahertz let's go no we're not doing cinebench we're playing Minecraft Jake God it only does one thing wait 100 degrees oh I loosened the block and it's locked up I wonder if the loosening of it is what actually fixed oh no oh yeah I kind of think we have to play Minecraft today no I'm feeling really good about this craft Minecraft Minecraft 350 she's fine don't worry about 100 degrees what the crap yeah you're running prime95 yeah it's Prime 95 and it's doing what like four and a half gigahertz okay so what did you say it was classic.minecraft.com oh wow I mean this is with prime95 this is prime 95 in the background gotta chop the tree gotta karate chop the tree from the underside that's what you get and you guys get the end of this video hey thanks see Sonic for sponsoring it uh your power supply was obviously not the problem which is great because there was something bound to go wrong and it wasn't you it's been a really long day if you guys enjoyed this video maybe go check out the first video we uploaded about this where we show off the completely finished one the glass is in place like yeah after you spend the next two or three days cable managing everything
