stop perfecting your config I feel like I rant on this all the time you gotta know where good enough is like I have some things that I consider good enough one of the things that I really wanted to perfect was this one right here which opens any folder anywhere of my predefined set of locations and then opens up a tmux thing right there for me this is something that I wanted to perfect because it's developer productivity right it allows me to go fast between things whereas just like making sure that I have the right font and stuff like that I've literally never thought once about my font nor do I know what my font is nor am I going to know what my font is going to be I've never thought about my terminal I just use what x term 256 colors from the 1984 or whatever when it was written I don't care about those things because I don't care about them I just want tmox to work I want I3 to work I don't care about screen tearing I'll fix it because I know you guys want screen tearing I just use the default because I don't care you know why because I want to just develop tools that make me productive and make me fast and make me amazing at developing that is why I'm spending so much time creating the thing to be able to debug LSPs you know why because this is what I might be doing for the next couple months at Netflix so therefore I'm going to build tools to make me more productive I like to build the effing pickaxe okay that's what I think is the Glorious most glorious thing in the universe to do build the pickaxes build the pickaxe that builds pickaxes okay differential pickaxing I love it okay so now that I've just alienated half the audience and half of you hate me let's read this are you one of those people who spend countless hours tinkering with your configuration for their editors Ides terminals or other applications do you find yourself spending more time on this and never-ending Rabbit Hole of micro configuration than on actual programming if the answer is yes as it was for me at some point it's about time you stopped wasting your time love it uh in this post I will discuss potential reasons behind this Behavior offer some strategies to overcome it was this a a I have uh uh Tinkers Anonymous um hi I was unable to hold down my job I my name is Bill I I couldn't stop tinkering with my my config what is this uh and talk about some serious problems that it may lead to oh I hopefully I mean if you Tinker for longer than four hours I I hear you're supposed to call the doctor um before I continue let's make one thing clear by no means am I saying that there is uh there's something wrong with trying to master your tools or attempting to adjust them to suit your specific needs absolutely you should do this always uh it's actually the opposite I think it's a great investment of your time that will make you more efficient and productive developer in the end absolutely however it's important to recognize when constant configuration becomes an obsession and a meaningless search for Perfection that's impossible to achieve anyways it's time to learn to accept the good enough and move on to a more meaningful things that will truly bring you closer to your goals I actually really like this statement that's that's unbox it uh about once a year for somewhere between two to three days I try to redo my setup in a way that I really really like and then the things that I don't like I'm gonna be using obsidian to like write them down and then sometime later this year I'm gonna do another one of my my sessions you know why because that is like the best in my opinion that's like the best way to do it because you should just sit down have a concrete list of things you really really hate you make sure that they actually bother you and then just do that when's the next round probably a couple months I I usually like to do it like a good October time I feel like October is a good time I might wait till 2024 to really fix it people are obsessed with configs if you if you were to go on YouTube right now and find any video related to programming I bet some top comments would be uh one of the following what's your editor terminal that you use what's the name of the color scheme in your font editor uh let's see do you have a link to your dot files repository by the way um to this day I still think uh I still think this is the funniest answer I ever saw on Twitter and this was given in a non-ironic way just I have a policy of not answering those sorry like just literally said it unironic anyways uh very often it seems people completely ignore the content of the video and simply come to the comment section and ask these questions why is that why are people so obsessed with these seemingly irrelevant details people find things pretty I mean I get the pretty Factor you know I get it you know that's why obviously I have a beautiful waifu in the background that which has no life uh and so clearly uh one potential reason is that spending time configuring the environment makes people feel productive and can provide a sense of achievement fine yes you aren't working with what you should be working on or you aren't working on what you should be working on but at least you are spending time with the tools you normally work with so you don't feel guilty that's fine however the harsh reality is that uh it's simply a way of procrastination it uh it's trickier to spot because it's not obvious as watching TV or playing video games but the end result is the same no work is being done yeah I mean this is a I mean I I understand the argument here uh that you're making but you gotta like you gotta time box it and put some stuff on it tinkering with your environment perfectly fine doing every day weird move being on the latest everything weird move another reason uh is a much more profound in his excellent Ted Talk uh called the Paradox of choice and Barry Schwartz argues that all of the choice we have in today's world produces paralysis rather than Liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all he gave an example of a study on investments in voluntary retirement plans what was found was that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered the rate of participation went down two percent if you offered 50 funds 10 fewer people participated than if you only offered five why because 50 different options it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that uh that eventually people end up not choosing at all okay yeah we can clearly see this phenomenon at play with highly customizable editors like neovim where the customizations options are almost endless I mean it's the same thing let's see I mean the reason why I don't like that argument is that it's the same thing with vs code right you open up vs code and you no one uses default vs code everyone customizes it and then you start wanting to customize things so you start having to do this Progressive searching through Json files to flip the right property on and off it's all still the same thing it's just which one do you want to choose to do and some are a little bit easier vs code is easier off the rip absolutely 100 1 000 uh but it's still I still find the at the end when I want to make something customized for me I still have the same problem I have to search through Json instead of programming Lua it's like which poison would you rather have right uh there are so many plugins to install so many options to explore and so many color schemes and fonts to choose that people feel paralyzed and simply look for someone else to make that decision for them this perfectly explains the flood of questions we see everywhere about people's setups okay that's uh I'd say reasonable I think the thing is is that you have to have a concrete picture in your head of what's happening and if you don't have this like concrete idea of what's Happening it feels like magic and until you understand it things feel magic and Magic is hard and sometimes you just want the answer you don't want to know how the the sausage works right another thing is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and finally make a choice the fact that we had so many options to choose from makes us less satisfied with our choice than if we only have a handful of our Alternatives why because it's easy to imagine that we could have made different choices that would have been better that imagination causes us to question the correctness of our choice if you only had one option instead there would be absolutely no overthinking I mean I think the Soviet Union agrees with this this logic I mean part of me likes the choices you know I I I totally get this but at the same time I don't like this you know what I mean like I like I like choices and that's why I also I time box it right again I said this like nine times just wait till you're so frustrated with something wait till you have like a defined set of goals achieve goals move on right once again we can transfer that observation to our domain the fact that we have so many customized customization options for our work environment makes some of us feel that we have the right and we let's see what we have right now is not enough and they're away it's a perfect key map or color scheme right around the corner that will make our setup perfect it's easy to imagine that if we just had a different terminal setup or a different IDE we would become a much better programmers right you won't be uh uh time of the saddle you know what I mean time in the saddle and you will get there anything else you're lying to yourself but I will say customization and learning how something works will Ex will allow you to see programs larger sucks to suck absolutely but I don't wanna that's why I don't want to beg on it completely which is customizing and Building Things does allow you to see things in a bigger more complete way which makes software less magical which makes you more effective so you got to know you got to know the bounds here now that we know some potential reasons why people spend so much time on configure configuration let's talk about what we can do about it um I think there's a whole group that he just straight up missed which is people just like it and they just want to try to do different things they like experimenting it's just simply fun for them you know not all video games are an escape from reality some video games are just because you want to have a little time off and enjoy something that's different that's cool too you know that can be okay too sometimes a cigar is just a cigar uh now that we know some or let's see the first and most important step is to realizing that a perfect setup doesn't exist and will never be achieved exactly just like you'll never like marriage does not make you happy finding the right you know Finding I know because I know a lot of you are Arch users so you've never you know never even talked to a girl but talking to a girl doesn't make you happy right that's not how happiness works you know sorry I hate to be that person but you know uh the real there's not some future state in which you're happy right if you're not happy now you're not happy then if your setup isn't perfect now making some changes to it ain't gonna make it perfect later like I hate the doing this do you know what I mean I hate it sorry uh the realization itself might be very liberating and freeing from us from perfectionism which is an enemy of progress yeah absolutely as an example learning to accept the good enough allowed me to set up this blog from scratch one year ago in a single evening I used free theme created by someone else it was far from perfect and there were things I didn't like also I didn't have I didn't have a comment section or any other way for people to engage with my content but I was completely fine with that since my goal was starting to start writing and not tinkering with yet another configuration so I resisted that urge awesome yeah uh however if that little mindset shift is not enough for you it might make sense to introduce some small rules for yourself I was suggesting following the primages advice let's go get him uh on approaching your configuration he recommends visiting your configuration only once every couple months I I tend to do a couple months or a year I time box it again which I think is a very healthy and uh sustainable approach in the meantime take a mental note of things that are annoying and slowing you down so that you can address them when the time to overhaul comes I love this always group your activities beautiful that was sweet by the way that was sweet having a little shout out many appreciations buddy on the other hand if your goal is to start with an editor like Neil Vim don't bother initially trying to set up everything on your own just copy a config from someone you follow use that uses new I think TJ's Kickstarter is beautiful beautiful place to start or just start with a really cool project like kicks I got them uh that will allow you to start using the editor as soon as possible so that you can see whether it's something for you or not and then after some time you'll know which things need to be adjusted this is actually a great spot on advice wait for the frustration I feel like I've said this a million times wait for the frustration don't try to dream of something better wait till you go okay I really hate what's happening here then come up with an idea that is how you fix the thing and then have like a set of things you want to fix and do them all at once it's fantastic stay away for uh stay away if you're a beginner I'd argue that the consequence of perfectionism can be more severe if you're just starting out in programming reasonable that's actually pretty reasonable if that's the case stay away from all that as long as possible your goal is to learn programming so focus on that learn the fundamentals first the time to learn and configure tools will come eventually but this is definitely not the right time yet I still think Vim motions are good to learn as soon as possible if you try to do everything at once you will be frustrated and overwhelmed that may ultimately cause you to give up programming entirely free yeah good advice the urge might be really strong because being uh able to engage in online discussions about editors Ides and terminal setups which by the way I don't do that uh or understand uh memes I do that can give you a sense of belonging to the programmers Community but please don't do these shiny things but please don't let these shining things distract you from the real goal which is to learn how to program absolutely this is why I mean this is one reason why I really loved college is that it was just like a series of harder and harder problems and bigger and bigger projects just force you into just building things on a regular basis and my teachers even said if you want to be successful and you want to pass these classes you better build more than what I tell you to build in these classes that's just that you better be doing a lot more and that's that it was really good for me honestly it's actually like without Ray Babcock telling me that I don't think I would have done it right away right I needed someone to be like trust me this is the secret it's not just about configs honestly it'd be great if all of this was uh was only about tinkering with our configuration at the end of the day who cares that some of us might spend a couple hours every single day searching for the perfect color scheme for our neovim setup uh unfortunately the problem with striving for perfectionism is that it can manifest itself in other much more significant aspects of Our Lives for instance not realizing that perfect doesn't exist can make you feel dissatisfied with your current partner the place where you live or the job you have right there that's a that's a great take great take great take Um this can also mean that you may end up waiting for the perfect moment in your life to start chasing your goals which will obviously never come great take this is a great take uh if the argument presented in the previous sections weren't convincing though let this motivate you to fix your obsession with configuration because as you can see your overall well-being is at stake summary I hope you found this post useful I wrote it as much for you as for myself to constantly remind myself that striking a balance between spending time on customization and actual coding is essential and again I mentioned multiple times throughout this post remember it's not about let's see it's not merely about configs to the end thank you subscribe to his new newsletter uh where's your Twitter link dog you have a little twit little Twitter link hi oh yeah there you go check out the twitters hey follow you right back really appreciate it that was a great article well thought through uh really really good oh I didn't realize this just came out oh I didn't even I didn't even get this notification sorry I get like a one kajillion notifications I don't I don't know it just it just does this and it just keeps on happening and then people send me this and then I go I can't oh hey this is my dick invites you know I'm glad oh gosh why are people why are people talking about how I got my stack Overflow question the best way to measure your dick in bites uh something big dropping over the next few days now this is how you properly mean people okay this is how you do it okay I want everyone to take note that there's so many people that are like oh Tia sucks got him no no this is it okay this is the way you do it make it hilarious how big is it can we measure it without spoiling foreign oh shoot okay there was something I really wanted to say now I've completely forgotten um there's something really really important okay so let me tell you about how much I take my mentality that he just mentioned like to a t in my previous world I could be on a a word like this it hit uh leader PW and what it would do is it would actually do a uh what's it called it would actually do a project search for the word underneath my cursor and I could also do a leader P capital W which would do a project search um for the with a capital W search so it actually go through all the periods so if I did that so just to show you the difference between those two so if I do uh v i capital W it highlights the whole thing or if I do viw it only it only highlights that so I'd search the project for that thing underneath my cursor I currently don't have that implemented in my current round because I forgot to do it I've had the same dot files for eight months now I simply refuse to edit my DOT files unless if it's a complete blocker think about that like I really do take that don't configure until you really have a strong reason to configure to the absolute maximum I know it's ridiculous but that's how I avoid it because you know why I'm a configuration Andy if I don't I gotta be super important oh this is exciting this is TJ I think the article missed the fact that some people learn uh learn from a lot from tinkering with stuff yeah I feel like I emphasize this uh maybe not stuff like color schemes absolutely but that could ignite a passion for coding which is what happened to me absolutely I think this is where some people's zero is right oh sorry we're Lua around here this is where some people's one is you know what I mean this is where their first step is I would not be a software developer I am without my random tangents into the neovim uh coding which was basically my first real coding stuff I did I did it wow I was still in school with very very little programming experience at the time this is actually a really good thing I think TJ hits on a good point which is there's also a place in your life where it makes more sense to dive into things in more complete nature in a place in your life where it's less time to do that like TJ when you're in school your life commitments are just way less right you have way more time to do a lot of things and so spending an evening just configuring is that okay at that point why not if it makes you passionate why not but if you just got done having a kid and you want to go spend days and you also have a full-time job maybe not the best time to be doing these things maybe that's where my Approach where I set aside specific time for it makes sense and so I do think that there is definitely there's definitely a balance there and I definitely think that there's something really true it's true kids are hard fatherhood confirms 2023 low-level baby making uh three kids uh full-time job three side projects Cottage restoration home renovation exactly uh so I think this is actually really really really really really really awesome I actually I love the take TJ um I think you're 110 correct which is at the end of the day and I know I didn't emphasize this well whatever Sparks your passion to keep learning is more important than doing the right thing especially during the learning phase right like if you should go through the data structure and algorithms class and you absolutely should but you had this great idea from watching the first one where you could go and build something that you thought was really really cool shut the data structures and algorithms course down and build that cool thing 100 go all in on it and do it because it sparked and made you excited follow the excitement because it's gonna get you through everything because there's also going to be hour after hour after hour of just horrible errors and things that are just feel un overcomeable and it's the joy it's the passion it's the excitement that gets you through that and truly makes you into a good engineer truly makes you into a great engineer you know what I mean the name is I think TJ has a lot of really good ideas again
