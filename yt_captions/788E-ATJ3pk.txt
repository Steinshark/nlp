14 iPhones two months of preparation this is it a new or next a new version of every single iPhone flagship ever created this is the most expensive and time-consuming video I've ever made but it's gonna be amazing so Before we jump into any kind of camera comparison we're gonna start by unboxing all of them starting with the original iPhone and this is actually the only one where I didn't manage to get a brand new version of the phone it was coming out at like 10,000 pounds for the sake of just having a seal but that said this is next to new and still has all the stuff you'd get when the original package and on that note you can probably tell already iPhone packages were much more elaborate back then I felt like getting a smartphone in general was considered a much bigger deal and so this thing is packed to the brim with stuff including a pretty excessively sized charger that still delivers the same 5 watts of power of the newest cinema ones you get a 30 pin cable Apple's standard at the time and what I thought was pretty cool a full-on charging dock you've also got a good old iPhone stereo headset here now this iPhone is also known as the iPhone 2g I really like the way it feels it's just dense and solid ok moving on we've got the iPhone 3G this was released a year after and I remember this thing if you had an iPhone 3G I was 13 at the time it was a dream you could play touch hockey you could pop virtual bubble wrap to your heart's content amazing on a damager to give you a bit of context one of the biggest features of this phone was the fact that it had GPS in it yes it was only 11 years ago but this was a different era also as the name suggested this was the first iPhone to come with 3G functionality and arguably even more important than this is when Apple debuted to the App Store which was super basic at launch but was soon to change the entire smartphone landscape we still got the same excessively sized charger as last time and the cable and the earphones you get with this they're the same too and over the Surreal part taking the seals off an 11 year old brand new iphone let me tell you this video has been months in terms of planning and preparation but moments like this make it worth it compared to the iPhone 2g that came before it they switch the aluminium to just straight-up plastic which still feels solid but it's just a bit less premium also massive shout out to invisible shield for sponsoring this video because bid genuinely wouldn't have been possible without them I love Apple packaging so nice now for the iphone 3gs which is an almost identical-looking phone on the outside but is a completely rehaul device on the inside we're talking faster CPU GPU it's got twice the RAM although we are still learning talking 256 megabytes compared to the 12 gigabytes of today's phones you'll notice a lot of the seals on these phones because they're so old they weren't meant to be unboxed ten years later they have warped a little bit and they look a bit crazy on the front but they are genuinely sealed phones you'll notice everything's gotten quite a bit smaller with this phone even so I am loving the sounds of this crisp packaging got some newer Apple stickers and Apple finally were the 3GS managed to compress that same five watts of power into a slimmer charger same cable was there on the 30-pin connector here but the earphones have not been updated on the 3GS and onwards they come with a remote and microphone the often 3GS was like an everything upgrade speed yes but also battery life camera quality and new software this thing shipped with iPhone OS 3.0 because yes my OS was called my phone os back then and that brings us on to the iPhone 4 which I shipped with iOS 4 I'm going to say it straight up I love the design of the iPhone 4 I think that the shum for Sandy sort of sharper aesthetic is just better than the curves we had before and the curves we get after no there you go so you can see with this phone they've actually raised it above the packaging so let's put that to the side we've got exactly the same 5 watt adapter still on 30 pin as well in terms of the connection and the same in-ear stereo headset the iPhone 4 got people excited it was a big redesign but also it was claimed to be at the time the slimmest smartphone in the world and you can see these champers here they're made with stainless steel because Steve Jobs himself insisted that compared to aluminium which is a softer metal he really liked how stainless steel aged over time he said it gets beautiful when it wears so that's the reason that is so beautiful I actually love this phone headphone jack oh also the new body of this phone just meant that they had to redesign the antennas and a lot of people actually reported losing signal entirely on this the iPhone 4s was an incredible phone but launched at a time of terrible circumstances so Steve Jobs has actually meant to do the keynote to this phone as he did with every other iPhone launch but he was too sick at the time he was in hospital and it turns out he passed away the next day so in a sense this was the last phone that he saw get announced on the outside the phone looks pretty much identical to before but the s in 4s it signifies the introduction of Siri and this was game-changing I remember when it came out people going crazy about it they could only do basic tasks but they loved it there was people's kind of first glimpse of their own personal assistant and again same charging brick same cable same earphones although this was about to change the year after also in the years when Apple wasn't redesigning the body it looks like they paid more attention to what was inside the phone because with the 4s the phone got a massive leap in camera and processing onto the iPhone 5 and this is one of the biggest changes that Apple made to their phone lineup you'll see why in a second had to be super careful to knife everything from the side so I didn't actually do what I have done before I just straight up to stab deep foxes because at this point a lot of these are pretty rare so the first thing is ear pods the iPhone 5 is the first time these were packaged inside the small phone and these were a massive improvement over the standard iPhone stereo headset they still get the same charging adapter but the other thing that's changed and this is pretty major is that the 30-pin connector has been shifted to lightning so that has changed 30 pins to just eight pins and the Lightning is also now reversible okay so the phone itself and since the passing of Steve Jobs Apple switched back to aluminium from stainless steel and this meant they could build a phone that was slimmer and lighter and the directions changed now but at this time it was all about building the slimmest phone he also noticed the screen on the iPhone 5 is quite significantly taller than the one on the four really like this as well actually it's really nice the iPhone 5s was the first time Apple also introduced a cut-price smartphone alongside it the 5c but in this video we're focusing on you on the flagships another big thing with the 5s was that this was the first iPhone shipped with iOS 7 and visually speaking this was one of the biggest overhaul athol at had a much cleaner much flatter a little bit more colorful as well he's still getting ear pods in the box same plastic case and still getting 5 watt charger and still a lightning cable following on from this idea of Apple introducing its bigger internal changes in the phone's that don't change much externally this one had a massive chip upgrade the a7 chip inside this was the first 64-bit chip on a smartphone which meant heavy computational tasks like recording slow-motion video were handled much better it's also actually the first phone to have touch ID which is a fingerprint scanner built into the home button and if we compare the back to the iPhone 5 you'll see that the 5s is the first time Apple has introduced dual LED flash it's meant to give a more realistic exposure to people's faces the oven 6 was the first time Apple also introduced a plus sized version of their smartphone presumably they saw the success Samsung was having with their note series and had to have a part of it I do remember really liking the size of the iPhone 6 I was a note user at the time and so this felt refreshing Lee petite in a sense it feels a bit like an iPod Touch in the hand and this thing is full of big changes it's cameras it's performance its battery and even its design I never actually liked the iPhone 6 design I think compared to some of their past phones this is not Apple at its peak but you probably already know there was a bigger problem which I'll come to this phone is shipped with iOS 8 which was definitely a subtler up greater than iOS 7 things like better predictive typing and better battery usage information so bendgate the iPhone 6 is made almost entirely out of aluminium the whole chassis and it's relatively soft compared to some of their past phones and so if you put pressure on certain parts of the chassis it was known to bend also yet I mean it's not a bad looking phone by any stretch but I just think it's rounded corners then as classy as some of our first past ones so if we put that next to the iPhone 5s it is so much slimmer iPhone at 6s and as you can probably imagine with this phone Apple made it very clear that they'd strengthened the see they probably tested that a billion times the phone is thicker and compared to these 6000 series aluminium used on the last phone this uses newer 7000 series aluminium and it could supposedly would stand about twice as much pressure before bending again standard Apple box contents here nothing new versus the six I feel like the iPhone 6s was not really a high point for Apple the battery life was criticized and the camera Cena's not quite as good as some of its competitors that said this was when Apple introduced 3d touch and a lot of people like this the idea that your screen could respond to multiple levels of pressure the iPhone 7 was the first time Apple introduced a jet black color option and it sold pretty well although Apple actually issued a warning on its website saying that if you don't put a case on it it's prone to suffering micro-operations still of course for the sake of this video we had to get hold of one no the main reason this video took entire months to film is that your best bet of finding potentially old phones that are still sealed is through pre-owned sites like eBay but at the same time you also get scammed a lot a lot of the time people buy phones they'll open them and then they'll reseal them and with this iPhone 7 it looks like that's what's happened anyways inside the box starting with the 7 the air pods are now packaged differently and come with a lightning connector so the body of this phone it does look a lot like glass it's actually not glass the phone is still made of aluminium as before but yeah I mean it's definitely the more premium feeling version so the Plus version of the iPhone 7 is also the first time Apple introduced a dual camera system but the standard smaller phone just has a single but almost definitely the most controversial part of the iPhone 7 was that this was when Apple removed the headphone jack and to compensate they did include a headphone jack adapter in the box but it felt early and it felt a bit surprising to a lot of people now I really like the iPhone 8 this is back to glass on the front in the back of the phone but this time Apple introduced wireless charging never actually seen the black one in person so this will be interesting it's a seriously dense phone but it feels good we're still getting Apple stickers in the box as well although these have changed over the generations you can also see compared to the seven it generally looks pretty similar I feel like the camera has become a little bit separated from the rest of the phone but apart from that the general positioning of everything has stayed the same now the iPhone eight was unusual for another reason it was actually the first time Apple introduced three smart phones in one event as well as the eight and the eight plus it was time for the ten and this really felt like a pro phone this felt like Apple throwing all its best technologies that had been working on behind the scenes all at you at once and the moment when they announced this was kind of amazing they were at the launch event they'd announce the iPhone 8 and the eight plus and they did that classic move one more thing and it was the 10 it's still pretty much the same packaging but they have just changed the layout internally the most obvious change here was no home button Apple had designed a gesture based control system and people basically had to relearn how to use this iPhone we've got a completely new 3d facial scanner on the front of the phone and the iPhone 10 was the first time Apple used an oled display in one of their phones traditional ones just used LCDs it was also the most expensive iPhone ever starting under thousand dollars 2018 or last year to us the iPhone 10s and to some people this was a more forgettable upgrade they wasn't considered gigantic but there were two primary things here in a year when Android phones are coming out with pretty much bezel as displays and pop-up cameras this did feel like a bit of a conservative upgrade but under the hood did was every bit as capable also the 10s is the first time Apple's stopped providing the headphone jack adapter I guess they're assuming that if you're buying a 10 s then you're probably already on an iPhone 7 or later the first thing is the a12 Bionic chip a chip so powerful that even over a year after it came out even now it still outperforms a lot of top-tier Android phones and the second thing is that this is the first time in quite a few years that Apple's camera sensor size actually increased and they combine this with better software too and that leaves us with the iPhone 11 Pro and Joe since the iPhone 7 where they introduced a separate plus variant that had a dual camera versus the single it feels like apples been leaning towards this notion of having a pro phone and a standard phone but the 11 is finally where Apple attaches those labels to be completely honest I wasn't that excited about the iPhone 11 I've seen old leaks had seen all the renders for like six months prior and it didn't really do it for me but having used it having seen it having tested it and compared it to other phones it's pretty remarkable in terms of both the battery and the camera it is unarguably one of the best phones to date they've reshuffled the internals of the box a little bit but the most notable improvement here is the charger Apple finally gives you a fast charger in the box it was a got the same smart folding pins that we've seen on the Apple watch charger we've still got these same ear pods but the cable underneath has been changed to instead of the standard USB a two lightning this is USB C two Lightning alright all phones unboxed let's get into some testing now as you can probably imagine the process of setting up 14 iPhones was a very interesting one I don't even think my room is ready for what was about to happen so I spent about three hours rearranging and setting this up I don't think I've seen this many cables in my room ever anyway just for we get to the comparisons here's the thing with invisible shield they've just come out with the glass elite line of screen protectors and they are probably the most advanced you've ever seen we've got the standard glass elite which has extremely shatter and scratch resistance it's got reinforced edges and a new technology called clear print which disperses the oil to ends up on your screen to the point where it becomes invisible I've applied this to our - Tim the antique glare version builds on this further by adding an a matte layer that keeps direct lights from reflecting on your screen so it will drop this on the iPhone 10s there's also a privacy version which prevents anyone around you seeing what's on your screen and probably my favorite the glass elite vision guard Plus which has all the benefits of glass elite but with built-in antimicrobial properties that kill a whole load of nasty surface bacteria plus a layer that filters out high-energy blue light to protect from digital eye strain also the application process is watertight I tested this eight times on eight phones and I didn't get a single air bubble so it is time to test and you can probably imagine yourself the process of setting up 14 iPhones from all these different generations was an interesting one I feel like I encountered every possible era on the way not activating phones phones not synching with iTunes phones not booting phones battery's dying everything it is pretty cool though that the iPhone that I had is running iOS 1.0 that's kind of rare and it means a whole lot of things you would expect on a phone are just not here including the App Store but I was quite surprised to see that the OS still runs smoothly sadly for the sake of making these comparisons I did have to update it to iOS 3 and also to send a few phones back because of dead batteries but finally we did get there and so let's start by comparing unlocking you might remember the video I made recently comparing every Samsung Galaxy smartphone and waltz on those the unlock patterns changed dramatically on the iPhones they haven't really all the way up to the iPhone 5 it was just a case of swiping and then typing in a four-digit pin code unlike the Samsung Galaxy phones the way everything looks on the iPhones really depends almost entirely on what version of iOS it's running and so I've updated each phone on to the latest that it can reach and so you'll notice on the 5s which now runs iOS 12 Apple starts defaulting to six digit pins as opposed to four digits previously and the point of that is to overcome something called brute forcing which is where someone basically tries as many combinations as they can until they eventually guess it in the iPhone 6s from 2015 and onwards those phones all have the option for iOS 13 the latest software that's kind of amazing just before the speed comparison I wanted to quickly show you how the app store has evolved and you can probably tell yourself looking at the 2g and the 3G it is old-school we're talking grey backgrounds we're talking a dedicated section for the top 25 apps but things have changed so much on the iPhone 3GS which was supported all the way up to iOS 6 you get a much more advanced app store with multiple rows that can be scrolled independently plus a genius section for recommendations on the iPhone 4 you can see when Apple was testing a feature called near me they wanted to show applications that were popular in your area but that didn't really take off and from the 5s and onwards were into the modern era this is the current design for the App Store and you could call it a magazine layout it kind of brings attention to a few important apps and games and then hides the others away but in a way that can be searched for quite easily okay time for a benchmark and my weapon of choice is the pass mark performance test primarily just because it's one of the few benchmarks works even on older versions of iOS it's not gonna work on the iPhone 2g because that's on iOS 3 which is super old but it does work on the rest of them and thankfully the iPhone 2g in terms of its processing power is nearly identical to the iPhone 3G so we can use one score interchangeably if we take a look then at CPU performance over time it's kind of amazing between the 3G and the 3GS the score is almost four times higher between the 4 and the 4s it is a three times jump between the 5 and the 5s almost four and a half times these are astronomical leaps in performance after this point there aren't any jumps that are as significant in terms of percentage gain but between the 7 and 8 you still getting almost twice the CPU power which is a lot the 10s was a pretty small increment over the 10 but the 11pro actually a bigger jump than I was expecting but the biggest jump comes when we compare where we are now to where it started and on this benchmark at least the score now is he' thousand times higher than the first iPhones that's crazy the next thing was a camera test but just before that while the phones were all out here I thought I'd show you what the calculators look like on these phones if you got there right at the beginning on iOS one it looks pretty circular and after this it starts to become squarer and as soon as we hit the iPhone 4 it stays square but it starts to become flutter in terms of design and on the 5s and Beyond you've got the current aesthetic which is circular again but flat now I'm gonna do a display comparison as well but it's time for cameras and let me tell you trying to carry 14 I phones at the same time is a logistical problem but we got there and what I've done is captured four photos but with each photo I've captured one version on every single iPhone and so you can see the progress made as we go up the ranks the improvement in the quality of shots is going to be most noticeable in low-light which I'll show you in a minute but during the day there is one thing you'll notice dynamic range improves massively the ability to capture detail in brothah bright and the dark parts of the image and I would say up until the iPhone 7 something is lacking and this somewhat addresses the misconception that smartphones have plateaued that they're not evolving because actually a big part of this improvement to serpent in the last few years and for perspective we're going to switch back to the iPhone 2g just to see how that compares if we pull up a new image in a similar lighting condition or cycle through a bit faster but you should notice these same trends the shadows become better exposed and the bright areas more well controlled generally speaking the iPhone 10s is a notable turning point where dynamic range finally gets really good even though that phone in most other senses was quite an iterative upgrade and again here is a comparison to the iPhone 2g at the beginning but another thing worth noting is that the iPhone 11 pro introduces an ultra wide camera for the first time on an iPhone now for low-light I found a staircase that was pretty much unlit it wasn't pitch-black I could still see with my eyes but dark and you'll see the first few iPhones pick up almost nothing just a glimmer of light and the interesting thing about this is that that trend barely changes leaving the iPhone 5s the fm6 the iPhone 6s it's not until the iPhone 7 that we see a jump in low-light performance this again plateaus until the iPhone 10s which does a better job of dealing with noise and manages to produce low-light photos with more natural colors but then you can see the impact that night mode makes on the iPhone 11 Pro and if we swing back to where we started it is unbelievable to think that these two phones are shooting the exact same scene the last camera test is run cameras and right off the bat you probably noticed we started on iPhone 4 because every iPhone before that didn't have a front camera you'll notice skin tones improving over time as well as somewhat the exposure of the sky behind me but again this is another one of those cases where the big jump actually doesn't happen until the iPhone 8 and even bigger jump the iPhone 10's the 11pro makes slight adjustments to this and can also go much wider than every iPhone before it so for the display comparison I wanted to transfer the same image onto every single iPhone and this proved to be a bit of an adventure in itself with the original iPhone not even having bluetooth not connecting to my gmail and refusing to acknowledge my laptop but I didn't I should do it anyways displays and starting with the original iPhone we had 165 pixels per inch or PPI and this was considered pretty sharp at the time the stayed constant with the 3G and the 3GS but it wasn't until the iPhone 4 when we got a massive leap this device was when Apple introduced the term Retina display they still use it today and it refers to the idea that the resolution so high that the human eye can't even discern individual pixels the stayed constant for the iPhone 4s and funnily enough for the iPhone 5 and beyond the resolution density actually fell a tiny bit probably more noticeable though is the fact that these phones were the first time Apple used the standard 16 to 9 aspect ratio in the iPhone 6 saw a massive improvement in both display size and display quality the Apple was still stuck using LCD panels compared to many of its competitors that used OLED but that said these were still some of the best displays on the market and on that note 2 the iPhone 7 that came afterwards had a record contrast ratio for an LCD display the air for an 8 went down pretty well too but at the time most eyeballs were on what was launched alongside it the iPhone 10 they announced this at the same event and it was the first iPhone to use an OLED display and OLED is slimmer and lighter than traditional LCD plus it can produce better colors and as what allows this nearly bezel a swarm factor to be possible and the pixel density also jumped massively here to 458 and over the next two generations this display was refined better brightness better contrast the oven 11pro is something like 20% brighter at peak brightness than past versions that's quite a lot again a huge huge thanks to invisible shield and let me tell you most times you'll see a sponsor it's because a company has reached out to a youtuber but this was a case of me going to them because I actually do use invisible shield products on almost every phone I use and I can stand by them so links with that are gonna be in the description anyways this video has been a really really long time in the works if you enjoyed it a sub would be massively appreciated and with that being said do let me know which line of smartphones you want to see next in the ultimate comparison series if you haven't seen the galaxy lineup do check that out I'll link that from here and with that being said my name is Erin this is mister who's the boss and I will catch you in the next one [Music]
