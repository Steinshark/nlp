welcome to this demonstration of how to make better code samples for your programming talks it follows on very well from jensen's talk about the importance of drawing people's attention to the right parts of your slide a quick summary of the basics that have been talked about very well in the earlier talks today a particular thing i do want to point out though is the importance of being able to export your slides as pdfs we've already had a request from yentz to submit our slides from today's talk so if you can do your highlighting in a way that fits well with saving as a pdf for people to read offline then that's a bonus i'm going to be focusing today on showing you a few techniques in powerpoint to help with i'm talking about highlighting details in code but it doesn't have to be it can be animating and drawing attention to different parts of images that you've got on the screen um just so but just for context let's talk about showing code so i believe that it's important to check that your code compiles before you paste it in so i have here some code that i checked before that it compiles and it'd be really nice if we could just copy it from our favorite ide and paste it into okay so i'm going to switch to editing at this point now so we're going to try the first method we're going to paste our code in yeah but we've lost all of the highlighting that's really annoying well never fear if i undo that powerpoint has paste in and keep the source formatting well that's not too bad we've got the color coding which is important for people to be able to quickly glance at your code and see context but i want the um fixed space fonts as well well there's this weird trick one weird trick that if you first paste your code into microsoft word now if you're using different editors you can experiment and try similar sorts of tricks i think that if i show hidden characters why this might work is because of the different kind of line endings anyway let's select that you may you'll experiment you may want to not get that last end of line and so now i'm going to paste it in but i want to show you that i've actually customized uh using this customized quick access toolbar so that one i think is paste and keep source formatting that's what happens if you get the line break wrong it's not consistent i don't understand why but so i'm using shift and left arrow so now i'm not getting that last character this is fiddly but once you get used to it you'll get into a stride and get into a pattern and it will be quite quick and i definitely recommend when you find your workflow write it down and save the notes so let's try that hooray okay now we've got to get rid of this annoying bullet point and maybe i could with more time if i was going to keep on using this style i might create a new layout so i can easily create a new slide that's ready to paste in right so now we've done some of the first bits that yent's recommended and yeah it looks like code but i want to be able to tell people about particular areas of interest and one easy way to do that is because we've pasted it in this text getting good quality images and we can just do the highlighting and i won't i won't select more um examples here but you get the idea so that works and that's this is actually how i did my first very first c plus plus talk did the highlighting for it and then i used a laser pointer um to point at the different highlights and i failed there so it doesn't work having multiple highlights on one slide so the next logical thing to do is to say all right well i'll create three copies of the code i've done this in the interest of time saving so if you look at this number at the bottom i'm on slide five and then slide six and then slide seven i did that for a while and it worked quite well but you can't rely on your slide numbers to judge your progress through the talk you can't say i'm halfway through the time i'm halfway through the page the slides because it's probably not proportional and and i've also fallen for the fact that if you discover a typo in a comment or a string or something in a slide that's got six highlights you've got to go and fix it six times and you're bound to miss one so that's kind of annoying so that's kind of like level two it's nice for the audience but we can do better so i'm going to focus on what i ended up using and settling on just it's a bit fiddly to explain but at the end i'm going to show you how you don't have to memorize the steps you only have to do this once and then you can recycle so i need i want to get the details recorded in a talk and actually when i started doing this in 2019 i did write down the notes and i had to go and find them in order to write this talk i couldn't remember the details so i'm happy that there's going to be a video of this so right i'm going to go to insert and i'm going to insert a shape you could do a rectangle but i quite like the rounded corners it's just a bit easier on the eyes so i'll start by drawing my first highlight and of course it's solid so that's no use to anybody i would be if i'm not doing a demo i'd be using all the keyboard shortcuts so i'm going to say shape options and fill the shape and let's make it a pale ish yellow and i'm going to make it semi opaque partly because i want to be able to see the text underneath and whilst i'm building up the animations and partly because it ends up just looking better so it's not too bad but i really like having a slightly different colored border around the end so maybe i might choose a darker yellow it doesn't it's not critical for this but you want it to be consistent so choose something you like now i've created that i don't want to be having to repeat those steps so i will experiment with different keyboard shortcuts and find that on a mac in powerpoint if i hold down the control key and click and drag something i get a copy of it so that's good if i hold down the shift key it keeps the and move it vertically it keeps the left alignment and let's oops and do another copy so obviously i'm not going to waste your time perfecting the alignment but just to give you the sort of idea so now i've got the bits that i want to highlight and as an aside i think it's worth saying this might seem like quite a lot of work but once you've got it set up it actually turns out to be a brilliant reminder of things that you intend to talk about because you don't have to remember which of the three lines or the four lines i want to talk about you go through your highlights and you say very calmly very confidently explain the line so it's kind of like your auto cue and i found that really useful if i pick up and talk and repeat it sometime later obviously if we start the slide there that is not interesting so the animations are our friend and in particular the animation pane so what we're going to do is select one rectangle at a time this is slow because it's doing some kind of preview and i'm sure there's a way to turn that off but anyway so there we go so we've got four things appearing so we're going to be spending a lot of time testing what this looks like okay the first thing is i actually really want that first highlight to be shown as soon as i go into this slide so instead of making this one appear i'm going to make it disappear so i start and then i click oh that did not work ah so many times before i selected it via the object here and then said disappear and you see how we've got another animation so let's delete that what i actually want to do is select the animation there and change it to disappear this is why you want to be able to visualize the animation steps this pane on the right is really important so now let's test it great hooray huh but there's a horrible gap what can we do about that well if i click on one of these and expand i never memorize the order of these things they're really non-obvious i think but this second one we don't want it to be on the next click we want it appear to appear with the previous one and so now rather than one two three four we've got one one two three so let's see what this looks like first one is visible next click okay hooray we've got that right but we carry on ah i want to get rid of that music name space thing okay so the trick for that is to select all of the middle rectangles so not the first and not the last and i'm going to say after animation hide on next click and i'm very intentionally not doing that on the last one and i'll show you why so let's start the slideshow again yes yep yep yep now the reason i'm not hiding the last one on click is because at this point i just want to go on to the next slide so that is the mildly tedious but really quite effective way in powerpoint of achieving a series of animations like this now hendrick mentioned obsidian in an earlier talk and actually my last technical talk i did i used obsidian to generate slides and it's advanced slides [Music] plugin you can just paste code in and with a little comment you can say i want to highlight lines one then two to three then five then seven and it just does it all for you um so pick your tool and get to know how to use it now there's one more thing i want to do and then i'm done with this slide and that is that the text is washed out because it's in front of my code and i've done that deliberately because it's easy to select things and move them around but once i'm happy with it then i'll click on the border for the box that's got the code and say send all the way to back um no that's wrong send all the way to front okay and now we haven't got the wishy-washy so that's it if you had more time i'd run through the steps a second time but you'll be able to watch it on the video later now a little bit of a tip you really don't want to be doing all of that for every single slide you're going to make mistakes and it's really easy to get the animation steps wrong so what i have at the end of my slide decks when i'm preparing them is a slide like this right at the end and let's say that the most number of highlights i want is seven i doubt i'd ever use that many but here i've got the animation set up and i've named all of the rectangles so i can see the order so let's say i want to quickly highlight four things in this slide go back to here i'll click outside of the slide so i'm not risking dragging stuff so i want four so i'm going to select first three and then command and click or i can control and click on a pc i've got four things selected and copy those go to the next slide paste them in and then start moving them around i'm not going to align them up it's not going to be worth your time but just to demonstrate one two three four and onto the next slide so all the time i'm looking for time saving ways so that i can as andre said get the slides done and then focus on practicing one last thing to mention in terms of tips you can in powerpoint customize the icons the actions that are across the top of the screen there's a whole load of things like paste with source formatting and stuff like that that i don't use all the time and they're buried in sub menus or sub sub sub menus or whatever and if i find i'm using something quite a lot then i'll click on this three dots and select customize quick access toolbar and you have access to all of the commands in the program there so they're grayed out from the screenshot but this one here was paste with source formatting and that is how you get to have better code samples in your programming talks thank you very much indeed i'll get there
