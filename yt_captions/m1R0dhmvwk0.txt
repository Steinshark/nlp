all right hey be less precious the essence of the book radical kandoor is the concept of ruinous empathy have you ever noticed that people on the internet the people that say be kind like the the biggest hell on the Internet is when someone has the word be kind or says the phrase be kind they are the least kind people in the universe yeah we're doing a dhh article when I see someone say be kind I know for a fact they're not kind they're the biggest dicks they're always the biggest dicks every single time uh that by trying your best to coach employee performance feedback and overly gentle language you end up confusing the message and cheating the recipient out of the clarity they desperately need to improve or prepare for what happens if they don't facts hey Dylan hey by the way we we just started we literally just started this but Dylan just rated us if you don't know Dylan he is the O camel Champion uh reason all the good stuff check them out this concept extends to more than just direct employee feedback this can also seep into other forms of communications policies and ultimately in the entire culture at 37 signals we've labeled this broader problem as being overly precious I actually really like this take you like uh what's his name uh TJ we've talked about this quite a few times TJ I don't know if TJ's in the Stream but we've talked about this idea of being overly kind in GitHub PRS where you can't tell somebody what they wrote is bad and this is like a very like this is a big theme right now in programming like that you have to be extremely gentle with somebody like if somebody submits bad code you should just be able to say like hey that was bad code what's going on here like this just does doesn't work out at all I don't know it's just something that I think is is is is largely lost in our today's world is that we are trying to constantly look out for people's feelings and you rob them of good feedback you know because there's nothing wrong with saying what you wrote is bad code like I agree you have to be politically correct it's not even political correctness I don't it's not even that right like political correctness I don't even want to go there this is not political correctness this is people feeling like they're unable to give feedback because they're they they worry that the other person is going to take it bad right like that criticisms of a thing means criticism of the person which is not true at all bad code is bad code like here here's a fact of life I look at all the code I've ever written 6 months later and I think it's shitty code why oh why should I have a hard time with someone telling me it's that what what code I wrote is shitty right why why why would I ever have that problem I don't even like my own code I don't even like it at all like one of my least favorite people to pair program with is myself because I know for a fact that I'm about to dislike whatever I've created permitting an environment where people don't have an emot emotional regulation exactly like my big worry like I I by the way I love this concept I'm very happy that I know people hate dhh but I love that he's talking about this cuz this is such a needed topic especially today where it feels like everybody is so careful when you just need somebody that like that comes in and just tells you what it is dhh on stream I i' actually have no problem having dhh on stream I'm not one of the I I'm just not a a a person that's really scared to better make sure I say the right thing I better make sure all all the viewers really like me oh no uh yes you can provide constructive criticism without personally attacking someone yes that in fact if you I would I would say that if you personally attack somebody it's not constructive criticism cuz then you close them off but you also need constructive listening you need someone that can listen when what they've built comes under question you shouldn't need to go sugarcoat but you don't have to go tals on people exactly there's like the constructive listening I think is equally as important as constructive criticism but I think most people don't listen constructively I think most people uh they they don't want to it's too hard because nothing feel like it never feels good to to know that what you've written is not that good cuz sometimes you know like how how often are you writing a bunch of code you set up a PR you're starting to go through the PR but like it automatically tages people like say with stash or something and you realize you left in some code that's like ah I could have done that better right I forgot about this small section I could have done this better now I feel bad and then you realize then someone comes in and says Hey this codee's not that good and you're like yeah my bad it was just some it was like I didn't revisit that part my fault right not a big deal and they're like yeah yeah not a big deal can you redo that part I'm like yeah absolutely not a big deal let's go right W take I need to learn how to take criticism just like I need to learn how to give it exactly it's a two-way street criticism is truly a two-way street uh let me give you an example we used to have an official mental health days for employees we have an explicit invitation that people really should just take some time off if they felt overwhelmed or mentally fatigued here's the old paragraph base camp recognizes to I don't understand also oh there must be something behind it I'm like what's this two for what's the two for that your mental health is just as important as your physical health consider taking by the way this is great by the way this little statement right here a good job on them to say that your mental health is is as important as your physical health by the way I'm I'm a big proponent of being of hylomorphism meaning that your your soul and body are one and so your mental health is your physical health your physical health is your mental health uh consider taking a mental health day every now and again when you're feeling overwhelmed or mentally fatigued if a day or let's see if a day or two won't cut it we'll work with you to find a way to reduce the burden of your work at base camp on your overall mental health we really want to do let's see we really do want your work at Bas Camp to be the best work you can do in your life and we appreciate that that's not possible if you're uncertain about your health okay so this feels like a very uh like I don't necessar like I mean I agree in principle with everything said here like in principle I think that if you if if you're checked out mentally you're just not going to do good work right like I think we can all we can all agree with the statement in principle right uh that's precious overly precious in fact I cringe when I now read this the idea that employees are so mentally fragile that feeling overwhelmed as a reason to be absent is Bonkers I think we also use the term overwhelmed quite a bit when I think the word we're actually looking for is welmed did you know that there's actually a different there's there there's literally welmed is is a term that people used to use all the time that was more accurate to probably describe what we're doing welmed means that you're kind of like under the waves you're being buffeted by the waves like you're not toppled you're you're just you're being buffeted overwhelmed is the part where you you literally tip over like you're you're done you're out you've been game over right I'm whelmed by this stream I'm whelming I'm WellMed so hard right jimy Jimmy Jimmy welmed right and uh is the re let's see I do actually agree with this like in some sense I've had we've had one specific time in my marriage life where I actually truly needed some time off due to uh we had a we had a miscarriage you know and it was really hard on my wife you know post post uh postpartum depression is like a real thing and just really causes some bizarre stuff right and so this happened in 2017 or something like that and honestly like that was a genuinely hard time we were in the overwhelmed State as opposed to you know as opposed to like I mean everyone we we're all welmed from time to time but there's like specific Parts in life but I can think of one time in the last 10 years in which having a week off was nice to have right and there's AIG big difference between those two things right uh everyone feels overwhelmed every now and then and that's not adequate uh reason not to show up for work I'm actually on this team I'm I'm pretty much completely on this team because I think we over describe our emotions for the most part uh could let's see could you imagine if the rest of the world ran into something like this that your trash cans wouldn't get emptied if the truck driver felt overwhelmed no just know we do you know it's funny this is actually such a good point in the sense that how often do you not extend that like that Grace that you want to other people right like it's really really hard like how often if you get bad service in in a restaurant and you're pissed at the server you don't even know what's going on like you have no idea yet you expected that person to be on point you know it's fun it's you know we always do these kind of things where you expect somebody else to to not have these things but you love in writing we all love in writing we all this is why be kind exist in Twitter profiles and they aren't kind they project right not every day is going to be a magical at work yeah dude most days are just slogs I mean that's that's how work Works uh some days you really do just have to power through if you can't then use some paid time off to recover taking it out of the same allowance that someone else would spend on a holiday in fact I've come to believe that this type of language and expectation setting actually makes people more fragile it's very I mean it's it's a very interesting hypothesis the more you say that you should take time off if you're feeling overwhelmed the more you are likely to feel overwhelmed and take time off I wonder if there's something to that I can't say that there is or isn't but you know there is something interesting about there is something very interesting about telling people that you could become overwhelmed and you need to be very very careful and about people actually taking that internalizing it and identifying wrong things as being overwhelming it's very interesting uh by the way yes okay so people find this it's very very funny people either hate this or love this I do like highlighting things the first there's something very visually pleasing for me about things being symmetrical and so like when the first and last character aren't there there's something about it that makes me really really I don't know what it is it just makes me very happy you know what I mean very very happy also by the way I I I should say thank you I should say thank you even though I'm in the middle of something hey complex stack I hey thank you very much appreciate that I do mean it I do mean it thanks for the 10 gifted Subs um this is very interesting because I the hard part by the way for those that don't know I'm I'm trying to agree with this article even though part of me is kind of fighting against it like because the thing is is that you don't want people to pretend that emotions don't exist I don't want people to pretend that they're not hylomorphic that somehow their body and their soul are two separate things in which they walk around and one can be injured while the other one isn't like I understand There's real problems but I also understand the other side which is sometimes I feel like we make mountains out of mole Hills like legitimate mountains out of mole Hills I don't know it's kind of like a weird it's a it's a weird it's a weird dichotomy which is like how do you how do you provide a place for people that are genuinely suffering to get better and how do you prevent people from accidentally or in ition Al taking advantage of it or even adopting a mentality in which they can't uh they they actually can't see the force from the trees because they're so stuck in this thing of trying to find a problem or they're feeling like there must be a problem because like real talk work can be satisfying work can be part of your purpose but work doesn't necessarily guarantee purpose or satisfaction you know and I think a lot of times we mistake this kind of like life we we mistake this like life problem you know we call these like midlife crisises and all that kind of stuff where you're actually realizing that your purpose isn't as what you thought it was and and you're feeling this like missing out on things and I feel like it can kind of materialize into this just like continuous dreadfulness because you have no purpose in what you're doing you're just doing it and and some people right now are making incredible money being programmers but they don't feel fulfilled fed because that's not where you get your fulfillment from and then all a sudden they get all this money and then things aren't working out and you find yourself just as unhappy right like you you read it all the time and we all disbelieve it right like how many times have you read a story about somebody who's made a lot of money and then said money won't make you happy and you go N I don't believe that guy money will money will make me happy no I trust me if I just had a little bit more I would be like you realize you're that person and it's hard to listen to it right it's really hard to listen to it and I'm not you know I don't know money can make life easier for sure a no one's arguing that one uh I do believe there's something uh to treat people like they're fragile they will become fragile yes I do I do believe that you know like uh a good example of this is that your bones grow by straining them and like actually hurting them right you grow your muscles not by treating them very carefully but by like literally abusing them as much as possible the the opposite of making grow like being careful is the opposite of growth in a lot of things it's very funny how that that can happen right but there's a limit there's always a limit nobody is a fool everyone understands there's a limit right but there's this weird in between place is having a boner the same thank you beina G I appreciate your insightful comments all right let's keep on going uh that it plants the idea that working in front of a computer is so mentally taxing that almost nobody can bear it without occasional mental health days that's just not true and it's not helpful uh getting rid of the nonsense is part of how we've been scrubbing the precious out of the organization we have been far better uh off for it over the past few years that doesn't mean scrubbing uh scrubbing out caring it doesn't mean turning it uh into a hard ass the opposite of precious is not being cruel o I like that oo I like that the opposite of of precious is not being cruel I do like this uh but being clear it's expecting a reasonable baseline from people that anyone in the real world could recognize as fair I believe this is can we rename this from uh SpongeBob case to Twitter case I feel like this is like what is a hard ass a hard ass is just somebody who's just like constantly expecting a lot out of you right like maybe that's probably that might not be the right way to say it but that's that is intense about your failures and doesn't necessarily celebrate your wins being too precious is the same as being too fragile that's not the goal to Aspire to we should all be chasing higher resilience instead I do love this this you know one thing I have been doing and I've been practicing in it on and off for the last couple years is is actually Tak I know everyone hates this topic taking ice baths like actually taking cold plunges because it builds pretty heavy emotional resilience doing something that is absolutely awful and doing it is really really hard like you have to like you really have have to like go into it going this is going to this is going to suck you know what I mean it increases the tea level sir it's regardless of the benefits of the physical benefits there's also like a huge mental benefit which is that when you do something that is absolutely difficult things feel not as difficult shrinkage may occur oh it yeah for sure you mean like doing react and vs code like doing react and vs code raw egg Arc went I'm not gonna raw egg sweat tent then ice bath uh then sweat and repeat yeah we we my wife and I uh we've gone on a date where we did ice ice bath together and then a 180 degree sauna then ice bath and 180 degree sauna then ice bath and 1880 degree it not easy my main disagreement with this article uh is the same as it would be uh for the opposite take people are different stop trying to group us all into a this works for everyone it likely doesn't my main takea away from that is that you just made everybody the same you literally just did what you said you shouldn't do the problem is is that everybody likely won't achieve their potential what you can do and what you think you can do are two very different things anchor bias is a real thing if somebody tells you hey it's really really hard this is going to be really really difficult you you should expect this to be hard you will expect it to be hard if somebody tells you a trigger warning at the beginning of a movie more people are effective negatively than if they don't tell you there's a trigger warning like anchor bias is real it's really really really real and so the only thing that I know is fairly Universal among most people is difficulty will either produce failure and despair or great success like that's I like people when they live up to a challenge they didn't think they could do it fulfills people in a very huge huge mean you mean a challenge no a trigger warning is you know what a trigger everyone knows what a trigger warning is right uh trigger warning is just simply like this film contains violent depictions of this and then people you know it's there to warn people who feel triggered when they see certain things this this film contains drug use right and so they're trying to do that and to try to like help prepare you for a hard thing and then often the preparation of a hard thing makes you less resilient emotionally it's it's kind of funny you know what I mean it's hard right honestly it seems like that stuff uh let's see let's see honestly it seems like uh they do that stuff not to get canceled I don't know about that I don't know if that's really canceled like any movie right like they they warn you about drug use you're saying uh discipline will get you the furthest basically yeah I will say this is that uh discipline is probably your greatest path to Freedom Liberty is not being able to do whatever you want Liberty is the ability to exercise your will those are two very different things and some people get those very very confused like a very simple example of someone addicted to drugs they're not exercising their Liberty they may be free to do what they want they're not exercising their will their will has been taken over to something else so you know what I mean yeah they're enslaved they're enslaved to their their body and stuff like that's that there's a difference and people often goof up those two things and so you don't want to be you don't you don't want to do that right some people can be more free and be more locked down with rules than other people who have no rules they're they're I mean that's why you often see these kids that have really privileged upbringings often highly addicted to drugs highly like they're failing out of school they're they're they're they're absolutely un achieving everything that their parents achieved and it's because they're not actually free they had more freedom than you did they just had less Liberty because they got they you know they became they effectively became victim to themselves on accident and they had no idea how they never learned that discipline and all those good things anyways the name is dhh you know dhh I don't mind a lot of his opinions honestly I think he I think dhh and I are probably closer to having the same opinion then we are having different opinions I don't like all of his takes like recently he did the whole thing about about like going to Windows I I hate Windows um I think his dropping of all types from JavaScript and that enjoying typeless Javas like type typeless linting of JavaScript as a good thing I don't I I'm not on his team either right but there's some things that I'm really on his team you know I wouldn't put it as a rare dhw I give him like he he like everybody else has some positives has some negatives right you know I love how he's using Linux on Windows yes it's using Linux on Windows It's really because everybody wants to play hell divers okay can we can we be real here it's because people just want to play hell divers that's all that's happening here and he's like oh everybody we're using Windows okay you know everybody we using Windows and I just happen to need a 480 TI to open up neam a Jen
