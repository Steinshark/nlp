guys we live in a time where millionaires and billionaires love to manipulate the market like they're brushing their teeth they just do it because they can they see another one do it and they go hey it's like golfing like someone hits the ball far and the guy goes i can manipulate the market even more than you can that's what happened with the dave portnoy copying elon musk the man got a little jealous of big bro elon musk and decided if he can manipulate the market like we showed in the last video of bitcoin and doge i can manipulate the market too and i'm here to tell you don't fall for it please ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla ah you think i'd figure out how to say that i've said it so many times uh the reason i'm talking to you i'm on a mission of mercy i'm here from mitch and murray and i'm here on a mission of mercy hey look you're gonna see this around and it's funny dave portnoy is manipulating the market and he's doing it and he's just saying like evan dude we kind of live in a crazy la la land time let's just have a la la land fun time and honestly you're gonna watch this you're gonna go for a second you're going to want to gamble but then you have to remember what am i doing am i just making a millionaire rich again why do you guys do this please for the love of god crypto deserves better than dave portnoy just creating random picking random coins that are probably ponzi's games and chilling them so if you don't know what i'm talking about uh this was released yesterday dave portnoy founder of barstool sports if you guys don't know throwing his hat in the ring because he was sick of elon musk manipulating all the coins press conference um as people know i am the baron of bitcoin i will never sell my bitcoin i will never waver in bitcoin yo anyone who says they have diamond hands they always have paper hands by the way they're always the first to sell that's necessary here with elon musk says i'm sticking with bitcoin but the event of the last couple days and weeks have made me think i have to get involved in something beyond bitcoin i see what elon does he's pulling levers so one day doge is good next is bad bitcoin good bitcoin bad it's time for me to choose a side and i've done that so he basically goes hey yeah elon musk is manipulating the market i can't do it because i don't have a big enough social media following so i'll find my own market to manipulate that's what this guy is about to do and here we go doge ass litecoin safe move shiva hoge the new breed of coins and i'm gonna pick one and i'm gonna become the leader okay this is objectively funny it's like the funniest scam i've covered so it's like hot it's hard because i know a lot of you are again i know you i know my audience i know a lot of my audience is like it's a scam but is it fun though can i have a fun time while losing money stop it i'm i'm here to tell you stop stop what you're doing check it look have a gamble account make it like less than a percent of your net worth but do not put money where you can't lose it guys please forty thousand dollars of the coin that i will declare my allegiance to i told everybody at parsons hey this is my coin i will not sell in the near future i will stick with it i will do it i will ride it either to the stratosphere or hell on earth so here we go dave portnoy founder of barcelo sports found all right get to the point here so he puts on the caps and of course he picks drum roll please the answer is safe mode safe moon is not yeah you know that trash coin we reviewed like a month ago yeah that one now in the dave portnoy business and vice versa why i don't know why it could be a ponzi scheme i like the word moon because that's where i want to go dude at least he's honest look is it market manipulation yes is it a trash way to scam your followers yes also yes is the sec gonna do anything about it no no because you know what the sec is doing right now they're having a beautiful nap time i don't know what the sec is doing they're doing jack dude they're doing nothing elon musk when it plays the market dave portnoy manipulates the market anybody else touches their twitter account talks about any stock bank i don't know it's incredible to me that in the crypto space so many people are getting away with this but i think this is what's going to get the market regulated when the sec sees stuff like this is they're going to be like oh yeah you can't do that if i ever had to give somebody a good argument for why we're in a bubble with crypto this would be it the fact that this video not only was seen but was seen 1.6 million times and the price of safe moon i think went up 25 even though he's not a financial advisor and telling you he's not a financial advisor surprise surprise people end up investing in the thing he's shilling this is the best argument for why we're in a bubble i mean literally the guy saying is it a ponzi scheme i like it it says moon in it moon it's like dude i mean like i know the guy's rich and losing 40k doesn't matter him but it is kind of a little scummy like you're like shilling it to all your followers who probably a lot of them are like blue collar guys it's like it means nothing if you lose it if they lose it it actually matters it's pretty scummy to me everyone ponzi ponzi ponzi it's early if it is a ponzi get in on the ground floor to the moon okay dude again objectively funny if anyone tells me this isn't funny you're lying to yourself it's like if bernie madoff had a sense of humor honestly he'd be like hey is it a ponzi i don't know like get in early i mean you're early so why not why not sure it's a potsy whatever what it's a ponzi like get in early dad the moon safely we go make my eyes blue make them blue that's the new thing i already have blue eyes i want lasers safe moon get in now maybe moon safe there it is i don't know what you're doing invest responsibly oh there it is there it finally is i don't know what i'm doing i'm not i was financial advisor this is the bet look if you're smart and you see this [Music] hey you realize we're in a bubble right you get real comfortable with the fact that we're deep in a bubble right now when this goes viral and it gets millions of hits uh and people actually make decisions based on a dave portnoy tweet we're viral when the value of a crypto token is literally just did a guy with a twitter account make a video about it saying that yeah who cares if it's a ponzi and then it goes up we're in a bubble oh and by the way uh right before he did this he tweeted that his whole intention of uh announcing his coin that he already bought was just to move the markets so he literally is like yeah i bought this and i'm basically going to talk about it so that i can manipulate the markets i mean look is this that different from what wall street does a lot of the time no not what they're actually a lot of times they're just manipulating the market but the difference is is that he's promoting something that's actually has no value it actually does has no purpose in the world it's mind-blowing to me and honestly it's gonna be sad when all these people's coins go to zero but uh you know what look in the meantime enjoy it enjoy the memes enjoy watching this dumpster fire and you know what just be safe guys be safe because i know i know my audience and i know some of you guys are looking at this going that looks real tempting i wanna want to gamble i want to go to vegas with dave no you don't because when dave loses 40k he goes to another table when you lose 40k you lose your car all right that's basically it i hope you guys are smart don't fall for these stupid celebrities just manipulating the market because yolo they can and elon musk did it i find it annoying this one was pretty funny but still is annoying so thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed please invest responsibly don't be an idiot i'll see you guys next time
