welcome to the top 17 most garbage Tech failes of all time so bad that I don't want to just throw these products away I want to incinerate them from my mind starting off with BMW who in 2022 decided to bless us with the generous offer of paying $18 a month to heat the seats in our car yes the car seats you already paid for and they already have everything required to make the heat oh and the extra fuel cost you're going to incur from that heating you pay those too the company was literally going to block the feature until they received your direct deit and it actually gets worse this is all part of BMW's extras which includes absolute gems like the sports iconic sounds which is literally just engine sounds for the price of $120 the audacity to charge someone $120 to make their car sound like a car so I'm giving this a 2 out of 10 fail cuz trashy as it is it's not like the company has suddenly toppled because of it and they have now just retracted the feature although I'm not buying a BMW anymore especially after their SMY ass comment that basically tries to tell people who complained that they were wrong and they just didn't understand all right off you [Music] go but you know what's even worse than paying for a feature you should have had for free paying for a feature that you were born with enter the Power Balance bracelets these Loops right here were advertised as being able to increase your athletic performance by resonating and responding to the Natural Energy field of the body with hologram technology and it sold like hot cakes becoming CNBC Sports product of the year and even spawning imitator Brands trying to copy their technology unfortunately it was soon discovered that the only technology they actually had was the tech that made those shiny stickers you find stuck to Microsoft Windows CD boxes leading to the company being slapped with an enormous $57 million lawsuit for false advertising and then proceeding to go bankrupt in 2010 closing the loop as it were with a very respectable 3 out of 10 but you know what's even trashier than charging people for something they shouldn't be charged for charging people so that you can charge them more enter Amazon's entire Dash product lineup this company created a whole ecosystem of physical products whose entire purpose was to make it easier to order more Amazon products like there was a dash wand that could scan barcodes add those products to your Amazon basket and then order them with a voice command but I think the funniest one is the dash button individual $5 physical stick on buttons for ordering specific products from Amazon in a very literal one click they're like light up green when pressed to confirm your order was placed or red if something went wrong now is this cool in concept yeah sure is it nice that when you place your first order you get refunded the price of the button yeah sure is it also dumb beyond belief you beter I mean for starters what do you do when the price of the product goes up do you find out when it's already at your door or like when your bank calls you to say your account's empty what about when a child or a guest comes in and just hits the button to see what happens or cuz they think it's a light switch I mean it's not like Amazon ships you an undo button with it but the thing that really makes this seem like some sort of offseason April Falls joke is that on top of all of this Amazon had already been running their subscribe and save subscriptions for household products for years which completely eliminates the need for you to even recognize your out of a product and then order more and also actually saves you money cuz you get a discount for subscribing leaving these poor Dash buttons is essentially an expensive way to pay more for products and get them later so it's almost not surprising that government's decided to rule against them for violating consumer protection laws and that the buttons were quietly discontinued shortly after I think we just clicked order accidently I hope you like Head and Shoulders but sadly for this next company it's pretty hard to quietly discontinue a product when that product also happens to be one of the most funded kickstarters of all time this is the coolest coer I've managed to get one and I'm not even joking when I say this is one of the most impressive products I've tested all year okay so for starters it comes with a blender BL a blender that tells you exactly how much alcohol mixer and Ice to put into your drink and the cooler is what powers your blender you place your blender inside and you press this button nothing will happen if no blender is placed in there which is such a major safety feature and this company has literally thought of everything cuz once your drink is Blended you've even got a stand for your drink ready to be poured you can see there's a divider going down the middle of the coer that is also a chopping board and it actually gets better because this thing has plates that come with it they've got a spring-loaded mechanism to store them and those plates they double as frisbees sorry the thing has magnets everywhere like there's a magnet inside of here to store your pocket knife there's a magnet inside of here which is to store your actual knife there's even a bottle opener here with magnets at the bottom so that it can collect your bottle caps it's got an LED for when you get scared at night it's got an extendable handle and wheels for transport and they have even built in a pulley system that allows you to stretch this over this massive compartment here to tape down other heavy things that you want to carry with the caller this is amazing and over 62,000 backers agreed granting this company the funding of $13 million how do you mess up from there well backers were supposed to receive their callers February 2015 but instead they got a letter from the company's CEO telling them that he was pushing the launch back to add some extra features turns out those extra features were that he was also listing the item on Amazon you had 6 2,000 people waiting for a product they'd already paid for and yet this CEO decided to delay that shipment multiple times just to get more cash through the door and after about a year of these delays things got messy angry backers started attacking CEO Ryan Greer doxing him by sharing his personal details and even sending him death threats forcing the whole operation and what could have one day been a billion dollar company to shut down and the vast majority of the people who believed in the product never even being able to touch one four out of 10 now if there's one thing it feels like every Big tech company has had a stab at it's building a smart home speaker they all want a piece of that pipe it's just that when it was Samsung's turn to do so in 2018 something went majorly wrong they said it' be available by the end of the year powered by their own Bixby personal assistant that would be absolutely decked out with three speakers covering your high notes three separate speakers covering your Motes and then a big subwoofer to handle base all topped off with a feature called sound steering that could figure out where you were in a room and direct sound spefic specifically towards you improving your sound experience while minimizing distraction for others well that sounds great can I buy one no mate sorry is it the currency very soon after the announcement red flags started to creep in the company kept reassuring people that it was coming but while doing that kept pushing the release date further and further back and yeah the company did physically show the product off at the CES Tech show The Following January although there was only one speaker in the entire Samsung booth and hilariously it was attended by a Handler the whole time who was the only person actually allowed to talk to the thing worried much Samsung announced a public beta later that year in South Korea for a Galaxy home mini so they hadn't even released the main Galaxy home that they did originally announce but now they were releasing the mini which they hadn't announced only to people who signed up for a beta and then the following year still without announcing the product the Galaxy home mini was given away as a gift for Korean customers pre-ordering the Galaxy s20 phone and that was the last we saw of it like with a lot of these things the product was honestly pretty cool cuz aside from the expected features it also had an IR sensor allowing it to be controlled or control other devices through infrared signals like a TV remote which means that unlike a lot of smart home speakers which are specifically designed to work with smart accessories this could interface with all of them but they never actually released it to buy and then nothing time just went on fans kept asking Samsung kept ignoring I just find it so funny that this is one of the biggest tech companies in the world and yet they just keep acting like I swear I have a girlfriend you just can't meet her what Samsung should have done is just come out and put a pin in it so people could stop waiting for it but instead they've left fans pining for over 5 years in counting which constitutes at least a four but you know what this next company is going to wish they made nothing cuz that's a whole lot better than stealing someone else's product design and then getting caught yes I'm talking about casei so for the most part this company seems to have had a pretty clean record their cases have always been pricey yes but premium because of it with massive customization not to mention a company valuation of nearly a billion dollars and an expanding Suite of physical experience stores in theory that should be a sign that you're making original products well all of that went out the window when YouTuber Jerry rig everything released a video showing how casify transparent looking skins were not designed by castify but in fact ripped straight off a collaboration between him and another case company called dbrand all the little Easter eggs inside jokes both from the YouTuber and dbrand that would make no sense to be present on anyone else's product all of it was still in castify cases my favorite one is 11111 which is the day that dbrand started business oh and the dbrand logo oops now Casi designs were actually slightly different but that makes it a whole lot worse because it becomes very clear that they've not just copied but copied and tried to change it to make it seem like their own and then failed at that but the thing that turns this from just scummy into pure garbage is that it's the same design but it's just worse because case devies ripped the files from the dbrand website as opposed to the raw files that dbrand uses to print everything is just significantly lower resolution with things not being aligned in the way that was originally intended I mean this is already bad news but it just kept tumbling the company issued a statement claiming that they're a Bastion of originality which funnily enough is not a fitting tagline to use when you've just been accused of your blatant unoriginality and then more parties came forward but like I fix it a company focused on Tech repairs who realized hey wait a second case defy's x-ray case that's our image case Defy is getting sued at least once but maybe more and either way the reputational damage is going to be an even bigger hit than the millions they might have to pay out like we featured case toy before but we're not going to do it now leading this to be an easy 5 out of 10 okay you remember squid game right no not that one this one although to be fair both pretty great well in trying to recreate the sheer vast success of it Netflix very recently created their own version with real contestants only a year after Mr Beast already made one real contestants who seem to act an awful lot like paid actors with almost anime like exaggerated personalities that don't hold up in real life but that's a whole other conversation now obviously with a real game show no one's going to die when they fail a challenge right or are they turns out that the filming conditions were so poor that Express solicitors a British personal injuries Law Firm is representing two players who claimed they suffered hypothermia and nerve damage while shooting the red light greenl in cold conditions in the UK apparently the requirement to stay motionless for long periods of time during the shoot in the cold is what caused the injuries which is not just careless on Netflix's part but also implies that it was all very staged as in the original show you'd only have to stop for like a few seconds Max mostly but to top it all off while the actual squid game got an 8 out of 10 on IMDb and a 9 85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes this masterpiece is a 4.8 and a 44 and is also now being probed for its questionable ethics given that the original show was made to try and show the Injustice of the whole thing the inequality of how the wealthy would sit up top and pay to watch the people in difficulty betray each other and go through Unbelievable pain for their entertainment is this Recreation not disturbingly close to actually proving its Point regardless trash version of something that a YouTuber has already done better and earlier 5 out of 10 oh and uh speaking of things that have already been done better now we're in the top 10 we can't not talk about what's been described as the biggest failure in media history CNN plus so CNN like most other cable TV networks noticed people canceling their subscriptions in favor of streaming and rightly thought well yeah we need to be present there too so they allocated $1 billion into building this subscription service that they were saying was going to revolutionize news they hyped it up in a way that made it seem like exclusive 24/7 news content from all the highest profile hosts in their Arsenal like CNN 2.0 the trouble though was that the end product was not that it was a few live shows but nothing close to the news already being delivered for free by the normal CNN and it couldn't be anything more than that anyway due to contractual obligations that CNN had with the cable TV providers and then as for the rest of the content you would get it feels like CNN completely misjudged Their audience there was a cooking show a book club show there was even one about the challenges of being a dad like who decided this I think CNN massively overestimated how invested the average person was in their hosts and how much they actually cared about seeing those characters in these shows and at the same time they underestimated the impact of the internet how it's made people so used to just consuming news content for free it became very clear very quickly that the people who liked CNN for what it was they weren't getting any more of that by subscribing to CNN plus it almost felt like a please follow my only fans request for I I guess the super fans of which clearly there were not many or for a Savage take as ramp Capital LLC puts it imagine blowing $300 million on a paid version of CNN when no one even watches the free version cuz yes if there's one silver lining to all of this it's that of the original 1 billion budget CNN only ended up spending 300 million of it because the service shut down so quickly that they didn't have time to burn the rest CNN targeted 2.5 million subscribers in year 1 it only h a peak of 150,000 leading it to be one of the fastest ever services to both come and go lasting only 32 days I don't know whether to be impressed or appalled that they managed to spend that much money in that little time but hey I mean at least CNN has done some good things the same can't exactly be said for Ticket Master people already thought that Ticket Master was a garbage website they've a well established reputation for making themselves the only place to buy tickets marking up the prices of those tickets and just making the whole booking process unnecessarily stressful through their poor website like in March 2023 when selling tickets for the Cure their fees were no joke higher than the actual ticket price itself but this slow growing dissatisfaction with the service it all came to ahead with Taylor Swift's ears tour Ticket Master like most companies they want to make as much money as possible but the way they do it is the thing that sucks it's a dynamic pricing system that constantly assesses demand and anytime it feels like people are willing to overpay it makes them overpay and so in the case of Taylor Swift whose concerts are going to have possibly the most rabid Demand on the planet this site absolutely screwed it I mean the queuing for starters just to get the option to buy tickets fans had to join cues of 40,000 plus people only for Ticket Master's highly unstable website to glitch and send them right back to the beginning again I remember reading one lady's account of it and this happened to her no joke 41 times just while trying to secure these tickets but it gets worse because many fans found that once they'd gone through hell to get the tickets finally into their basket and they were gleefully celebrating those tickets were taken from them before they could check out offered to other people for an even higher price these tickets they kept creeping up in price until they hit no joke $500 per person not including ticket Master's own extra fees and then then when the lucky few who just mortgaged their homes to go see Taylor Swift had actually managed to secure something Ticket Master said do you know what that customer experience that wasn't bad enough got to do something else I guess in response to scalpers who buy tickets on their s to try and sell them on eBay or StubHub for thousands instead of the already absurd hundreds Ticket Master decided to make the UK tour a lead Booker event meaning that the person who booked the ticket has to be at the venue to be able to get in only problem is they make that clear on the website and that move would also come at the very unfortunate cost of gifted tickets becoming immediately worthless after they'd already been purchased so yes Ticket Master were rightly investigated this year by the US Senate for overexerting their Monopoly in the live music ticket industry although I think bigger consequences also need to follow 5 out of 10 but if you subscribed to this channel then you are an instant 10 before we reach the top five what I'd call the catastrophic tier of philage we got a couple of puzzling ones ones that when you look at it just begs the question what were they thinking like Microsoft Zoom let me set the stage it's the end of 2006 everyone's happily using their flip phones you just got your grandar into Nintendo Wii Sports and Apple's iPod has absolutely swept the market for MP3 players well naturally Microsoft wanted a part of that party and the answer to try and get it was the zoom 30 named after the number of gigabytes of storage it had and not the number of people who bought one although that wouldn't be far off now in terms of of features the zoom was basically just a carbon copy of the iPod it had one unique thing which is the ability to share songs that you own with other Zoom users who could listen to them a few times which could have been a really big thing mind you if Zoom had actually taken off enough for it to become relevant but it didn't have anything that could get it to that level what confuses me about this product is that if they had released it in 2001 maybe 2002 there might well have been some market share for it to capture but I mean releasing a bootleg version of one of the most influential media devices of all time that fixes none of the user problems that people were having with that device 5 years after it came out I mean the only appeal the zoon ended up having was literally just people who wanted a good MP3 player but didn't want it to be made by Apple they got that market but while Apple held over 70% of the MP3 play market zoon didn't even manage to surpass four and then the real nail in the coffin came next year when Apple announced both the iPod touch and the iPhone igniting the smartphone error and pretty much overnight killing the desire for a standalone MP3 player so zoon decided it was time to bury this mistake which from a company as big as Microsoft having now sunk in $289 million in its development it's a massive 6 out of 10 fail you know maybe companies should just altogether avoid four-letter words starting with zed because next up is zoom an even bigger flop Zoom was found that in 2015 as a yes you're not dreaming robotic pizza delivery company and it raised $500 million promising to automate the entire Pizza making process with robots at every single stage robots assembling the pizzas at the company's HQ faster and more precisely than any human could do and then robots inside trucks that could cook the pizzas during delivery starting at just the right time based on the customer GPS location data I mean if this is what the robot uprising of the future looks like where do I sign up the problem aside from technical issues hampering every single part of the process is that they forgot to factor in the roads the company was based in San Francisco and if you've seen San Francisco you will know those are not good roads to be trying to cook pizza on leading to many deliveries where the cheese that was meant to go on top instead being used to uh decorate the floor of the van and the company's solution to this problem is hilarious instead of cooking while driving they instead resorted to parking up in a central location and then using Runner cars to get the pizzas from those trucks to other people's doors so congratulations you just invented a normal pizza shop except it's a tiny little metal vehicle the company made a huge series of layoffs in 2020 cutting over 500 employees including all of its Robotics and food delivery truck business so the whole thing they very soon officially shuted the pizza business and started to sell sustainable food packaging for some reason Zoom is a pretty catastrophic seven out of 10 fail in my books made worse by a snarky leaked email from the CEO blaming the pandemic for most of the job Cuts but we all know it's because they tried to make a robot pizza delivery company now have you ever accidentally screen shared the wrong thing maybe you playing fortnite on your other monitor on a work call whatever it is can't be as bad as this Muhammad Mony Rosman in 2021 an employee of the automotive company valo left that job to go work for NVIDIA the graphics company but it looks like he took a couple of uh keepsakes with him he' allegedly downloaded without authorization the entirety of Val's Advanced parking and driving assistant source code and while screen sharing on a Microsoft teams call he accidentally minimized his PowerPoint presentation to reveal it but do you want to know what the worst part of this is do you know who he was on a call with at the time none other than his ex-employer valo who Nvidia just so happened to be collaborating with if that's not poetry then I don't know what is somehow it gets even scrappier though German police raided the guy's home as part of a criminal investigation and they discovered not just reams of valo documents on Muhammad's PC but also printouts and even the physical valo Hardware pinned onto his walls the guy pleaded guilty and was forced to pay a $155,000 fine which while in itself is chump change compared to some of the other fails here it is a career ruining move that has valo also seeking hundreds of millions in compensation from Nvidia for stolen Trade Secrets now it's pretty hard to top something as specialist as that but I think the online therapy platform better help might just take it the concept of the site is that a lot of people increasingly they need the help of a therapist for their mental health but they don't have access to one or are too nervous to go out into the world looking for one so better help makes therapy cheaper more affordable and more accessible by doing it all online promising Safety and Security to these vulnerable people which is what makes this the roughest one so far this site is notorious for sponsoring countless YouTubers podcasters and other influencers which racked up the numbers I mean in 2022 alone the site served 2.5 million customers and it sounds like it's doing a great thing so what's the issue yeah see the FTC in an investigation they found that betterhelp was selling the data from these customers to companies like Facebook Snapchat and Pinterest so those companies could advertise more directly to the vulnerable people and that they got this data by repeatedly pushing people who signed up to the service to take this extremely personal intake questionnaire with questions like if you're experiencing overwhelming sadness grief or depression and if they think they'd be better off dead imagine bringing vulnerable people like that onto your site feeding them statements like rest assured any information provided in this questionnaire will stay private between you and your counselor asking questions like that and then selling that info so that Facebook can try and advertise you some anti-depressants it genuinely makes me a bit sick 7 out of 10 and yes as well as taking a hit to subscribers better help did also have to pay out 7.8 million in refunds to customers because of this anyway moving on you know the Marvel Cinematic Universe right or the MCU well this universe has faced one of the most unfathomably quick drop offs in history it might not be clear if you look at the surface level like if you just take averages Marvel is still the highest grossing movie franchise in the world but that's not the full story from 2008 to 2019 Marvel managed to do something amazing they created a very literal web of 22 full length movies almost all individually strong and all completely interconnected slowly building towards the the ultimate climax that was Avengers endgame and that Peak was such a high peak it's the last movie I can remember where people were actually scrambling to get cinema tickets for and the crowd reactions when there was a plot twist those felt like the moments you live for and the numbers match that feeling with endgame still to this dat being the second highest grossing film ever to be released but as soon as that chapter closed that's when it started to go wrong as Marvel with the next chapter they've tried to do far too much I guess they thought well if 22 movies can result in a climax like that and make that much money well what about 22 movies plus 12 concurrent TV shows at the same time too they started churning out so much content that no one physically had the time or the money to keep up with it as it basically required a Disney plus monthly subscription and then perhaps to try and push even more people into subscribing the company also started increasing the importance of all of this side content within the universe to the point where if you don't watch the latest Marvel TV show now it's often not just that you'll miss out on a single funny reference in the next Marvel movie but that you'll actually be approaching that movie with a significantly worse understanding of the characters than someone who has put their career on hold to actually keep up with it all and pair that with the massive superhero fatigue that even many core fans are feeling people are starting to skip things and as soon as you start to skip some of it it becomes much easier to just skip all of it skip is actually a very appropriate word given the state of this room right now and this isn't just my personal feelings Bob Iger CEO of Disney he's publicly blamed Marvel's recent poor movie performances on their Disney plus output diluting audien's focus and attention and while it's not like Marvel or Disney is getting cancelled or being fined for anything it's tough to understate the sheer level of monetary loss that they're seeing right now like Antman and the WASP Quantum Mania that thing only grossed $470 million at the box office it needed 600 just to break even so the company is already a far cry from the one to 3 billion per movie that the last gen Avengers films were pulling in and they might well continue down that Trend unless the company figures this out that's an eight but now we're in the top three the trash at the very bottom of your trash bag starting with IRL a social app founded in 2016 focusing on groups and events designed to get people to meet up in real life with the goal of creating more authentic and organic communities and this thing raised $200 million skyrocketing to a EV valuation of 1.2 billion we're building Facebook groups and events for the generation that doesn't use Facebook IRL CEO Abraham Shafi told The Verge there just happens to be no other product really focused on this space for the Next Generation which is cool and all but in 2022 people started to get suspicious of this guy Abraham shaffi claimed that 20 million monthly active users were on this app and use that as a way to make people feel oh well everyone's on this app maybe I should get on it too except that he really shot himself in the foot as this brought on an internal investigation from the board of directors which found that 95% of the app's users were Bots the app is literally called IRL and its users don't exist in real life and just to put that into perspective Elon musk's main argument when trying to pull out a buying Twitter was that 20% of Twitter was bods obviously as soon as something like that becomes public the app had no choice but to just shut down okay you've heard of the metaverse right in October 2021 Mark Zuckerberg completely rebranded Facebook the company not the app to meta because he made a massive bet on not just the future of tech but the entire world popularizing the term metaverse to describe this future vr/ world that he predicted we'd be living in and also massively boosting the company's spending in it I distinctly remember the moment the announcement happened like easily one of the most bizarre sci-fi like things to ever happen in the tech bace kind of like we were suddenly being told the future starts today but in a really creepy whether you like it or not kind of way and this whole thing is failing hard due to a combination of both bad timing and bad execution either of which alone is enough to topple a company but together well that's going to cost a lot of money to fix in terms of timing I mean no one saw it coming that's part of the problem it's a sign that we weren't ready I mean if you really want to create drastic societal change like this the way to do it is not just to drop it in the laps of unsuspecting civilians but instead to slowly surely build out a list of products with useful immersive capabilities in a way that people don't just see it as a new era that starts tomorrow but just naturally drift towards it and then in terms of execution meta's own virtual world platform Horizon worlds it's just awful literally feels like something out of an uncanny horror film everything is just empty and dead and boring and ugly like okay it's one thing to tell people the future complete it mate but it's a very different thing when you tell them that and then show them that it looks like this check this out wow so that's pretty neat they talked a huge game about how the metaverse is going to revolutionize work but I'm yet to see a single useful work product that people are actually taking seriously and just the fact that in researching this one of Google's top recommended searches was legs says everything you need to know about how real metaverse interaction has felt now regardless of if the metaverse is ever going to pick up in the future if we just look at the state of it right now it's bad and it's getting worse in the first 9 months of 2023 alone meta's reality Labs division has recorded a loss of you might want to cover your R for this 11.5 billion which means they might just be about to break their past record loss of 13.7 billion in 2022 and it's all happening at the same time as major staff cuts which is not exactly a sign that it's suddenly about to turn the corner especially after being nearly $50 billion in total deep into this metaverse Venture yes 50 billion it genuinely feels like Zuckerberg is taking piles of cash in his hands and Laser pointing them into whatever the nearest trash can he can find is how can I give this anything less than a nine and more concerningly what's worse than this I'll tell you what Twitter or X or Twitter I mean that's the first part of the problem when Elon mus came in and bought Twitter for $44 billion it felt like a rogue move but I don't think anyone expected how far he would go to save the platform now Elon correctly noted that Twitter's business model wasn't the best and that they needed to find a way to make more money but the steps he took to get there felt like a massive overcorrection for starters he forced users to pay if they wanted to be verified or even keep their existing verification dicks which changes the meaning of it really from a way to discern public figures into a how big's your wallet contest he dialed up the ads to 100 you'll now see them on the sides you'll see them as you're scrolling you'll see them in the replies all while him firing about 80% of the the company's Workforce to reduce costs and then he started to introduce his own personal views to the platform Elon really liked the idea of free speech which in theory does seem like a nice idea but what it means in practice on Twitter is just reducing the level of moderation which is probably less a choice more just a consequence of firing everyone and the way it's been done I don't see how it helps anyone you only need to scroll your home feed now to see explicit footage of serious incidents happening and even death not to mention that Elon himself has been accused of anti-Semitism which when something like that happens to the figurehead in charge of calling the shots for the entire company that's going to start hitting confidence so at the same time as the Company's trying to dial the number of ads up the advertisers have well basically just Uno revers them by pulling out not helped by Elon not so politely telling them to go away which combined with traffic to the entire platform having dropped 14% after just one year of musk being in not to mention the dissatisfaction from a lot of people who are still using it has all led to a big Dro in company value official reports have confirmed that Twitter is worth at most less than half of the 44 billion dollars it was bought for but according to journalists who unraveled the true meaning of one of his tweets the actual value may be as low as just four which is just embarrassing considering how short of a time frame all this damage was done in and I think worthy of a 10 now the only oh my goodness man got to be brave here now the only other 10 that I want to give out for the opposite reason is to the Opera browser here's why every time I use the Opera browser it makes me feel like I have a a co-pilot working with me in a metaphorical sense in that it has the tools to allow it to work around my needs like Lucid mode which basically means no more blurred videos you just hover over any video be it old be it new and with one click it's going to be sharper it's going to be clearer and it's going to have less visible ghosting and now you can also pick the level of video enhancement you want but also the co-pilot exists in a very literal sense with Opera's own baked in Ara AI you want a summary of the web page you're on that's like two clicks away you want a quick answer to a question without having to Google search and then scrub through articles it's right there and I know it seems like a massive faf to set up a new browser but this can literally import your old browser settings in a minute Link in the description to download Opera now
