what if there was a way to make our numbers much more readable so instead of printing 1 billion we would just print one b and today's lesson will concentrate on doing just that using one simple pack let's get started immediately by opening up the terminal and pip installing numerize and with numerize inside our program we can now type in from numerize dot numerize import numerize so to demonstrate this we will create a number of type floats and the first number will be 1915. so it's a normal number quite small but good enough to get started with showing you how effective this package is so the formatted number of type string is going to equal numerize and we just have to insert the number here then if we print this F number we're going to get 1.92 K in the console instead of this whole number which can be seen as a bit cleaner and you can also specify how many decimals you want so if we have three it will give it all the decimals that we have for this number here now of course this was a trivial example and a lot of you might consider that this is clean as it is but what happens if you have a number such as one two three four five six seven eight nine that's a very big number and formatting that could make life a lot easier so if we're printing this number to the user for example we're going to get 123.46 million and you don't even need to specify the decimal if you don't want it you can just remove it completely and we'll get 123 million to simplify things for the user but maybe one or two decimal places does not hurt and we can also simplify this with scientific notation we can say 10 to the 10th power and we'll get 100 billion back if we do 10.12345 all right forget that let's go back and say 999 and run that we'll get 109.99 billion although I must mention that at a certain point if the number is too big it's going to stop doing that conversion I believe it's after 100 trillion it's just not going to consider it anymore so that must be around maybe 12 and whatever comes after 100 trillion is just going to be interpreted as the normal number but until that huge number it looks pretty good and that's actually all I wanted to show you regarding this package it's a very simple way to format your numbers and can make your app look beautiful if you don't care about having such specific numbers that bloat your console but anyways let me know what you think about it in the comment section down below also I really recommend you join our Discord server there's a link in the description box down below there's a lot of cool people there and it's a good place to share resources connect with python developers and just have fun in general so check it out the link is in the description box down below I'm often there just to have some random chats but with all that being said thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
