[Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] welcome back to yet another day into life to me a very very busy day building my trillion dollar startup usually start my mornings by either meditating or going on a walk because you know why wouldn't I next to this time to get to work it's a bit of a problem though that I have with the app I'll explain later today I want to show you some of the progress that I'll be making with my app over the past few days I've sort of spent a lot of time thinking about like what is actually the vision of this app in case you're not aware I'm building like a personal finance application but I don't just want it to be like a just another budgeting application there's like things I've been doing with the vision side of things the other thing I'm going to show you is how I've been able to get really sleek and nice looking styles for my app even though I have absolutely no design skills whatsoever and the last thing I want to talk about just some of the things that I am doing as a solo entrepreneur and solo software engineer to stay productive because there's a lot of things that I've really been doing like tweaking with my lifestyle and the way I live to maximize my focus because I just believe if I can find a way to just be able to sit down and work for more hours I'm just gonna be able to outwork everyone [Music] today [Applause] [Music] I actually wasted so much time in my previous life trying to learn the code completely in the wrong way but just building my app has taught me so much about coding that I just for like a year of just learning and building is like small stupid apps I could have just learned so much faster if I just started by just trying to build something bigger rather than the get-go so like that is what I recommend to you guys if you want to learn the code just freaking stop building something like now today and I feel like a big thing that stops programmers from actually trying to build something bigger is because programmers are not designers they feel like well I don't know how to create good designs and Designs are really important so they feel like they have to go and learn all the CSS and all this fancy stuff when actually all you have to do is this now the Styles I used are like these ones are here I paid for these but you don't have to pay for these like you can just go and find free ones from online or something like that and essentially like this is how you get your apps to look really good you just literally like you go find templates and you just copy them like it's not more complicated than that so straight away right now if styling was the reason why you aren't starting with your app there you go like I was just freaking fixed it for you [Music] thank you [Music] so I went from this to this in just like two hours of work I think I've deserved a lunch break because I've started eating it's known as like a slow carb diet basically the idea of it is that I'm eliminating all like Fast carbs so essentially all sugar especially all fruits uh bread these kinds of things because what happens when you eat these fast carbs it's like carbs that absorb really quickly in your body you get these crashes so you probably have this feeling right when you have a massive meal like two hours you just have this feeling of being lethargic and you just can't really focus really well so I always had this so now that I've stopped eating those kinds of fast carbs all together I basically don't get these crashes at all but yes this does mean that all my meals are basically very Bland but it's also because I am actually trying to get very lean for this summer because I am standing here pretty fast so for that reason I am headed to my favorite place to eat here in Dubai to have a very delicious salad foreign [Music] if you're ever in Dubai looking for like a breakfast brunch or just like healthy food then that place is the place to be highly recommend [Music] I can't believe all those people just wasting away at the beach when you could be you could be working you could be coding what could be more fun than that so this month for me is all about working on my startup last month so the month of March I was more focused on the YouTube stuff I was building out my course by the way if you want to learn the skills to become a python developer check it out anyway I'm basically gonna be coding every day so if you like seeing these kinds of videos where it's like Vlogs of me actually coding and like sharing my lessons from the process make sure to like the video so that I know that I should be making more of these in the future essentially [Music] thank you a bigger problem I've been having with building my app that I'm learning as I go through the process that because I've never built something like this before which is like wherever I build anything I always try to build something that's completely different than what I made before because that's how we learn we learn by making mistakes and doing stuff we haven't done before the issue is that I keep trying something like some technology or some database thing for example that's the thing I've been working on and then because I'm not sure exactly what's the right one I'll start using one thing and then I figure okay this is probably not the best way and then I have to like re-work the code or like what's the word um like refactor the code completely to use something else and that takes a lot of times that you know it's just the reality of app building you constantly refactoring stuff but I should probably just stick to one thing and then just like at the end if it doesn't work then I have to change it but then I might end up wasting a lot of time and stuff this stuff tends to take a lot more time and then you imagine because of these kinds of things but you know I enjoy it that's why I do it I love the challenge so I've just installed GitHub cohopal for the first time like is there something I'm missing here because for me just doesn't seem to work like it's supposed to Auto generate code for me right but I tried to like write this currency converter function which should be something quite basic that you should be able to do so that is just not how you do a currency conversion function no no no no let's see if chat TPT can do a better job see that is a functioning currency conversion function that chatbt can do for me but GitHub copilot cannot I guess I just don't know how to use it please help me [Music] okay there is done coding for the day is done we're gonna end off the day with a coaching call which I'm gonna start in 10 minutes with one of my coaching clients I hope you enjoyed this video let me know if you enjoy these Vlogs and if you want to see more I sort of where I want to take this channel is more like number one I'm gonna keep going with the normal like how to learn the code kind of videos like learning stuff which is like the stuff that I teach but also I want to have more of also documentation so I want this channel to be a mix of education and documentation so documenting the things that I'm doing right now which is building my startup and teaching the things which I have already learned and if you want more details you can go check out my program python developer masterclass if you want to learn the programming skills from me and not only the programming skills but also skills like getting hired about productivity habits these kind of things that I've literally spent years studying and doing and learning so that's going to be linked Down Below in any case thank you for watching leave a like if you enjoyed and remember that you can do a lot more than you think as your network [Music]
