so hello everybody i am here with father john strickland father john is a parish priest in the seattle area in paulsbo i hope i said that right in folsvo on the west coast he is also on his he has a phd in history and so on the side he also writes a blog he has made a podcast called the paradise in utopia and he is now publishing books he's published a book called the age of paradise which i've read and his second volume which has it come out yet i think it's coming out soon yeah it came out in november uh age of age of division so the age of division which i'm reading at at this moment and i think so much of what he is hinting at the things he's bringing to the fore are extremely important at this time to help us understand history and a more global vision of christian history [Music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world and so father john uh i had just read the first volume i'm reading the second volume i'm i'm very excited to see you do the things you do um one of the frustrations that i've had is as i explored the church fathers and i explored the history of the east i realized just how much was lacking in my own historical understanding and how so many movements that happened even in the west cannot be properly understood unless we have this more global vision of of the east and the west together in this discussion in this conflict you know a mix of influences and so uh maybe you can tell us a little bit about what prompted you to want to tell this this narrative yeah yeah thanks jonathan well um so i i was teaching a university uh full-time uh before i went off to seminary and became a parish priest and that's my main work now being a parish priest here um but uh impulsebow but uh but i've always had this really really um strong interest in history and in the the legacy of christianity within the history of the west i've always been interested in that that's what got me interested in history initially and and so when i decided to study history you know at the graduate level that um i just i just i got to a point where i really wanted to understand as you say globally the history of the west from a christian point of view it was always dismaying to me to see how little attention was given to uh to the role of christianity in our culture and in the formation of our culture and when attention was given to it often it was negative you know the crusades the inquisition the witch trials and all those things um so i really wanted to learn about that and then i wanted to tell the story and so um in the past few years i've had an opportunity to start writing these books that are a history of christmas from its origins all the way up to the present which is designed not only as a narrative that's interesting and just hopefully enjoyable to read hopefully interesting just to learn about history i think that's really important in itself but i i really wanted to contribute to our ongoing um discussion we have today in america canada the west um of where we are culturally and why we face so many problems culturally as almost everyone would you know admit today on the left or the right and so my book series is itself titled the rise and fall of what the west once was and it's a history of what i call christendom a word that i appropriate from its kind of medieval use i don't like the term medieval we can talk about that later maybe but but um but it's it's recognizable so that that term arose as as a term defining action civilization and i think that even though we live in a post-christian society today um it's still a post-christian christendom it's still a civilization that is fundamentally shaped by christianity and so my project it's in four volumes you mentioned the first two of those um i'm working right now in the third volume the age of utopia that should be out by the end of the year and then the net final volume will be on the 20th century it's uh provisionally entitled the age of nihilism um this is an effort to understand how christendom um first of all arose and then over the course of time was changed and was altered into what we see today which in many ways is post-christian but it still has as i say by using that term utopia it still has a very strong um kind of root in uh or roots in uh the christendom of the past yeah so that's what i'm trying to do yeah and i think that it's very i was i was really excited to read the book because you know some people have seen that i interviewed tom holland recently and he has a similar position in terms of his discovery that to what extent christianity is at the core of our value system is at the core of what we understand to be a person you know so many things about how we understand uh reality comes from christianity and the fact that it has been so poo-pooed in the past and it's been kind of uh cast to the side you know it gives us an opportunity to now tell a better story and what i love about your book is that you know tom focuses mostly on the west and he himself kind of expressed how he's frustrated that he couldn't include the east but in your series that's really the story you tell you tell this this global story of of christendom and not christendom in the sense of just a kind of political dominance of of christian of the christian emperors or christian rulers but rather this capacity to enter into a hint of the kingdom of god in the world through the this profusion of christian identity and christian participation in in the world and uh and so i like i said i'm really i'm really encouraging everybody definitely to read the book because it gives you a narrative of history that we haven't had in the past and one of the things you want to do and maybe you can expound on that a little bit for us is you want to reconnect the east and west story you want to show us how there is an inevitable connection between the east and the west in the way in which even the middle ages developed yeah you know there's two things you mentioned there that i that i think are really important um jonathan one is uh christendom as i define it is not a political system uh it's not a a a union of church and state or something like that you know the loss of which is you know lamented by reactionary or cons conservative christians today it's it's much more than that the state inevitably becomes part of the scope of christian the christian transformation of the cosmos world but that's only part of it and so i located the origin of this civilization with a supporting culture as i define it that directs its members toward the heavenly transformation of the world that's my definition of christendom um i located it at the very beginning of church history at pentecost actually because i think it's it's right there in the book of acts and in other early christian documents which i cite in volume one the age of paradise and um and for three centuries it was it was a viable dynamic element it was a sub culture it wasn't the dominant culture uh it was a proto-civilization it wasn't a full civilization yet but it was there from the start continuously acting in this world is exactly what is a um a traditional christian cosmology or understanding of the world um because i i think that there's something we're missing in our in our contemporary modern debate about christianity and that is how very um cosmologically affirmative it was and historically in that first millennium that i talked about in the first volume and it embraced the world it tried to transform the world didn't reject it and run away from it it really was interested in engaging it and that's what we're missing i think a lot of the time today yeah and i think it's it's very fascinating because people portray christianity as this denial of of the world and you know it kind of this weird nietzschean vision that christianity is a is a kind of hatred of the world and uh you know the naysayers yeah exactly but that like you said that is not what we see there is this notion of self-sacrifice all of this is part of of understanding that the christian you know self-sacrificial love is the the zeitgeist of christianity but the fruits of that are these communities that are bound together in love and that you know kind of flow out into reality you know you see how literally the saints died in certain places and then geography started to transform around these saints relics and how the world itself you know uh pilgrimage places became new centers for for civilization christianity reorganized even the space of the roman empire not just it obviously reorganized its ethics and it's its way of being but it actually reorganized even the geography of the roman emperor i mean constantinople is the ultimate example of how christianity itself reorganized the empire it was the city it was the christian city yeah right yeah i mean absolutely you know jerusalem became uh the center of the world you know and understood in the christian sense yeah and that's why the crusades were always focused on it so so much um no so we could talk about government politics and and how that's really not the center it's an important it's part of the christian traditional christian vision of the cosmos but or culture but it's not the main center of it it's like you say it's the world it's this it's the world that's filled with the presence of a living god it's a world that has been penetrated by the kingdom of heaven which is drawn near to it what i call paradise that experience of paradise but the other thing you mentioned and certainly i want to give time to this too if you're interested in talking about it is that point that that you uh you know you noted that i'm trying to link east and west here this is a history of the west for sure most of my work certainly in volumes after volume one like the one that just came out the age of the division it's mostly a narrative about the west so there's plenty about byzantium and russia there as well um and we'll be going forward but um you know it's really interesting if you look at the history jonathan for the first millennium you know we in the west were so used to thinking the west dominates the west you know kind of leads the way culturally speaking everything kind of comes from the west and and if you go back in time it's like an onion peeling an onion you start to see that there's no west um there is a west but it's not really it's not the center if you go back far enough into the first millennium you find the center is the east yeah and one of my chapters in the book um age of paradise is called uh uh when the uh when the west was still eastern and uh i talked there about how for two centuries the popes of rome which we think essentially you know the kind of symbols of western civilization at that time were all recruits from the east from syria and especially from uh constantinople and eastern parts of the uh empire at that time um famous uh important fathers of the church theologians who contributed to our understanding of culture especially what it means to be human anthropology and what it means to what the world is cosmology such as maximus the confessor they were eastern they came to the west maximus helped organize a council in rome itself and uh and these are people that are just forgotten you know gregory the great the pope of rome i have a son named after him actually um he was just a fantastic example uh having lived in constantinople for a few years he came back and became pope of rome and he's recognized certainly in the west by roman catholics for instance um as as the most important like person of his generation and beyond um but he had a very eastern understanding of the cosmos and the place of culture within the cosmos but it's interesting to be recovered i think there's a polemic there's such a polemic reason why we've come to learn history this way right there's a there's one of the one of the let's say one of the tools or one of the weapons of the enlightenment has been to paint this idea of the dark age this idea of the middle ages as this dark regressive you know backwards age and usually what they mean is basically england and northern france like that's that that's kind of like it's france and england basically that they're talking about maybe germany is the kind of and it's only for a few centuries and if you take into account constantinople the very idea of the dark age completely vanishes there is no dark age it it it it's actually that you know constantine sets his capital in the east and then that capital becomes the cultural center for all of christendom and the influence of constantinople reigns all and even even at the conversion of charlemagne you can actually see how charlemagne takes on the tropes of constantinople visually in terms of artistic history you can notice how he takes on the imagery that he gets from constantinople uh and so like constantinople had running water and had you know education and had all the things of a civilization and so i think that the reason one of the reasons why we don't know about it is a polemical reason is that we don't want we don't that the secular modern secularist doesn't like the idea that the middle ages don't exist the way that you portray them yeah you know the term medieval is interesting i'm actually writing about that in the age of utopia as i as we speak the the whole concept of the middle ages of course as you say is a polemical concept it's a it's a weapon of the enlightenment the term wasn't actually coined and and then became kind of established in western culture only in uh after about 1700 during the course of the enlightenment and it was really the product of the of the so-called renaissance when first petrarch uh father of renaissance humanism uh likened the whole history the thousand years that preceded him as a darkness a cultural darkness that overcame the west from which he needed to escape and his escape was into the seculum into the secular non-uh religious non-christian unchristian kind of realm of the uh of the pre-christian uh culture of pagan of of pagan greece and rome and others after him uh coined you know this idea of of light and darkness and then this was this became kind of consolidated by the by enlightenment it really dismisses a thousand years of of western history yeah it it that's effectively what it does and you can it's funny because in a way if you look at the context you can have some sympathy for petrarch like because he's coming out of the plague and so you can understand that here he is like no seeing these bodies dead all these dead bodies and this whole breakdown of of culture that's happening because of a disease and then projecting that back onto history for the for for a thousand years you know and so i mean i can i can kind of have some a little bit of sympathy for petrarch but i don't necessarily have sympathy for those who weaponized his his vision in uh in the enlightenment and you know how can you look at a gothic even like even terms of the west like how can you look at a gothic cathedral and say dark ages and i don't understand how that's possible i mean there was a breakdown in terms of of these non-roman pagans who were who are kind of taking over for a little while but as soon as they become as soon as they become christianized you see the transformation start to happen and that's one of the interesting things that you explore i think in your book is that on the one hand you're not afraid to show the dark side of some of the things that happen even in terms of constantine's conversion or charlemagne and all of these figures that convert and you can see that that there's still some elements that they have to deal with that have to be transformed but nonetheless you can point to actual fruits of the changes which occurred in their conversion even if it was in total so yeah constantine did kill his his son and that's a horrible thing but in in that chain from a pagan world where it was absolutely normal to to do that kind of thing it or this constant uh destruction of the of the hairs and and this you know these horrible uh emperors that were doing monstrous things you can nonetheless see the difference and you can see the transformation even if it's not it doesn't bring us into the holy of holies let's say right away and it won't yeah for sure it won't in this world and and i try to emphasize emphasize that you know the age of paradise so-called is not an age when everyone lived in paradise and everything was you know just happy and and beautiful and holy and you know good no there was darkness everywhere i mean it was darkness everywhere and there will be darkness as i understand it as as someone who reads the scriptures and thinks about the christian revelation seriously i think they're always going to be that darkness that petrarch spoke of that pentebre in latin um you know but what's interesting there jonathan is it wasn't just as i understand is i as i do the research and think about it you know when petrarch had this reaction um to this kind of reaction to his culture it wasn't i think driven just by the the the plague the black death which he did live through his act one of his sons um was actually perished as a young man from the plague so he knew it quite well but i don't think that's really the main thing i think what's going on there um and this is what i this is what i bring out in the second volume the age of division is that once that that disconnection between west and east took place once the west no longer was rooted in eastern christendom there's a real there's a real change a real shift in in the culture and i do believe this is extremely important for understanding why we're dealing with um kind of out of control abortion and and why we're dealing with political correctness and all the other stuff that afflicts our modern culture today because that detachment from a civilization with a supporting culture in the east that directed its members toward heavenly transformation of the world when that happened a great pessimism began to seep into western culture you can see this in what i call the stavrocentrism or the cross-centered culture of penitential pessimism the rise of of of of the doctrine of purgatory for instance which i look at real closely in the second volume all of this of course following the the great schism i call it the great division between east and west and and you start to see a culture that's very pessimistic and i think you know jonathan i think that's really what was driving petrarch's turn almost best return because he was a smart brilliant man and so enjoyable to read his turn toward what what is called the seculum the secularity the secular world is a world that is un spiritually untransfigured untransformed a world that exists only for its own sake and that is the beginning of it it's a it's a flight from pessimism um the the pessimism of the christian culture of the west having um become just detached from the culture of the east for a few centuries now that's really the beginning of what became the renaissance and its humanism and the enlightenment and the detergification of art um when art no longer had a liturgical role to play and it just became an end in itself um the renaissance being the the classic example of that yeah and i think there's also this you hint at it a little bit also in the book and i have like i said i'm still in the on the first 100 pages of the second volume but you know the problem of the uh the iconic classic controversy it's something which people especially as an artist i take that very seriously but it's something which is ex it's very important and and people ignore how charlemagne and the frankish court is meddled is like mixed in with the whole question of the iconoclastic controversy and the solution that the franks gave and that the the west ultimately kind of arrived to was something which didn't totally integrate theologically the image which kind of said we have these images but we don't see them as liturgical we don't see them as participating in this in the reverence and the veneration and then ultimately kind of moving up towards the worship of god and and i think that that's that's like a little i don't know if you talk about that but i've always thought that that's a little seed which was already planted in the west and then as the renaissance came and then the reformation came there were no arguments people didn't have uh they didn't have uh saint john of damascene's incarnational argument to be able to explain why we have this stuff in the church and so it kind of this kind of fell flat by the time the protestants arrived no one i i think john calvin even in his when he talks about images he doesn't even address in john damascene's argument he doesn't talk about the incarnational argument at all so that was all the way back during the time of the iconoclastic controversy where the excess of the east and the and the kind of and the west this strange mixture created this problem which which just continued on right you know the the west never developed a really clear coherent understanding of the image you know in the east of course with iconoclasm they were forced to and john of damascus and and theodore the study came forward and and articulated as fathers of the church articulated what the image is you know and like you said it's it's grounded in the incarnation it's grounded in traditional christianity's understanding that the world is not disconnected from heaven from god from paradise but the world is filled with presence sacramentally especially and liturgically the presence of heaven and that's what the image and the theology of the image does in the in in the east and in the west uh charlemagne's court you know we're talking charlemagne for your listeners and viewers i mean it'd be like about 800 so this is still before the great schism but it's about 800 this is going on and his frankish theologians they didn't get that at all they saw the image as being pedagogical only as being something that's useful for teaching and that's that's that's that's fine that's good that's part of it but as the fathers of the seventh ecumenical council in the east had said it's it's good for teaching but primarily it bears witness to the fact that god became human in the incarnation the world the cosmos is not on its own uh living out its life for its own sake it is now joined to heaven and to eternal eternity and that's that really is the break i think that's it and after that you know you mentioned the renaissance boy i mean you talk about what was going on in the renaissance and calvin's reaction to it you look at what the renaissance did with art the humanists i mean our culture celebrates michelangelo and raphael and and titian and all these famous you know leonardo and but if you look at these from a from a deep historically deep point of view it's it's an it's it's just a an aberration it's it's it's so weird to see what they were doing with their art yeah i agree i mean obviously i agree that's why i'm an iconographer and uh you know i had that this interesting discussion recently with a catholic uh uh thomas you know about this problem of nakedness in art and why in the west they've kind of accepted that and i really i see the to me the the renaissance is a pagan move it's a it's a move towards a pagan thinking a pagan aesthetic and pagan sensuality and so like you said there's a sympathy for calvin or the reformers were reacting to this like you were wrecking through rubens in a church with all this like naked like orgiastic flesh in the altar and you're like okay so this is it like this is what we're gonna have in the church now so there's a there's a certain sympathy for for as as you move into extremes sometimes you can understand the reaction to to something which is already excessive and then it moves into another excess and then after that it's the history of the west it's just from one excess to the other from one extreme to the other all the way into the you know into the utopian age of our of the of the modern world right now but i love like to me i i'm really happy that you say that because i've been kind of secretly secretly thinking that the iconoclastic controversy and this the relationship between charlemagne and the conflict that happened and the wars of the iconoclasm that happened at the time are are one of the key key moments in the definition of the west and the the separation between the two and how the the problem of understanding the incarnation and the transformational aspect of reality appears very clearly in that moment where you know even today when i talk to to to catholics and protestants sometimes when i talk about the transformational aspect of what christ brought and how we are called to be brought into god and to participate in the life of god you know like the people they they don't feel good about that they feel uneasy about it but you see an example of that right there in charlemagne's court at that time yeah and that's simply the doctrine of the incarnation you know that's why the orthodox east is very comfortable using the word theosis or deification when it talks about its understanding of salvation it's not just you know release from condemnation um uh escape from punishment uh it is but it's much more much more than that it's participation in the life of god and and that's that's really central to it yeah there's a i keep i hate keeping this harp on charlemagne i mean because i'm french is one of the reasons why i'm so interested in charlemagne but the fascination of that moment to me is so important because you see even that as charlemagne is distancing himself from the east and saying i'm the emperor and he was named emperor after irene's deceased husband like in the order of of of uh he wasn't like emperor of the of the west he was like emperor after the byzantine emperor and so as he's distancing himself he's taking on all the visuals of the of the east and so you can the carolingian renaissance is basically a kind of westernizing of byzantine uh imagery and you see it in the in the in the ivories and the imagery and the mosaics all of this at akin like this kind of golden uh look that he's trying to imitate so it's a weird it's an interesting like i'm separating myself but i'm also being completely influenced by this this society that's it it's it's very strange it's almost you know schizophrenic because there is this total identification with the byzantine example the emperors of rome or the byzantine emperors and um and charlemagne now assumes that because he's conquered so much of the west and he wants to integrate a big powerful imperial state now pope of rome has gotten fed up with the east because of iconoclasm and it's irene i mean i mean the empress said i have sympathy for them as well i wouldn't like what would you have done if you were pope and then you know this empress is is killing you know her own children and like okay what do we do here declaring herself emperor and like okay this is not going well oh it's intolerable what was going on at the byzantine court in the east was just intolerable over and over again and and it was heroic for the papacy to try to find you know to stand up against that and and as i say the the papacy played a very heroic role in much of the first millennium and even beyond um trying to you know correct uh mistakes that were being made by political authorities especially emperors you know like that but back to you know to charlemagne what's interesting there is that on the one hand he totally identifies like you say he builds his new temple in akin famously built and modeled on on byzantine architecture he assumes this almost cesaro papa's kind of um he's he's almost like a priest he couldn't you know he was really interested in theology he had theology read to him charlie may be sitting at his dinner table in his palace hall and he would order his servants to read the city of god by augustine while he's munching on his dinner you know i mean that's that's the mind that charlemagne that charlemagne had but his theologians these frankish theologians were so i mean they're like the the first um cultural activists you might say they were shocked troops of a new western identity that is distinctly and by definition not eastern you see and that's the break that's where it starts of course nothing's done in a single generation in history but that's where it really starts you start to see the formation of an identity we call the west distinct from the east or the greeks so so i think what what happens after charlemagne is you get this different culture which defines itself against the east not with but against the east then the great schism comes a couple centuries later 1054 is the excommunication then after that all these changes start to happen under the influence of the papal reformation of that time you get papal supremacy you get um you get the um uh the the crusades starting within about 50 years of the great schism um beyond that you get doctrines like purgatory which projects um the experience of paradise for someone you know living in that culture purgatory is this tremendously you know um intimidating uh process of punishment after death post-mortem punishment that that the effect its effect on the culture of the of the west is is profound uh that culture becomes inherently you know very deeply penitential pessimistic um the experience of paradise that i tried to document in the first millennium and my first book gets put off until after that purgatory you know plays out uh thousands of years whatever a year isn't it beyond this world and and so you you get all these you know the the um the paintings of giotto as beautiful as those are in the 14th century those paintings you know are intensely um they're designed to create an intense uh reaction or response of of sorrow and penitential um uh uh kind of doubt and and and and and introspection um that itself contributes to a growing pessimism and and so this this tendency in in the west after charlemagne and the great schism is more and more to to lose that incarnational culture that was so strong in the east and so strong in the west too during the first millennium but now after the great schism and that great division it becomes much weaker that's what happens with petrarch and the uh and the renaissance so-called the humanists come forward and they say you know this is and they're not they don't put it this way petrarch almost puts it this way but they don't quite put it this way but what they do is they seek they seek um they seek human fulfillment no longer in a world that's been transformed by heaven they seek human fulfillment in a world for its own sake a secular so-called secular world and that's their contribution that's why renaissance painting is so naturalistic and so fleshy and and so focused on the artist as genius you know michelangelo's signing you know the story about his pieta that famous statue of the virgin mary holding the dead christ that gets put in uh saint peter's he he kind of he he finishes the the uh the carving of it and one of his most famous works and it's put you know for everyone to come look at and he stands back in the shadows we're told by a contemporary account to see what the reaction is because artists are very very competitive then and for commissions and all that and some bumpkin comes in from the countryside and says that's beautiful who did that and some guy some bumpkin standing next to him says i think it was a guy named raphael i don't know what he says exactly that's not michelangelo michelangelo recorded that he became infuriated he went home that night and came back to the church with the hammer and chisel and he chiseled right across the strap of the virgin mary's uh chest this is the work of michelangelo and that's the there have been autographs before that but that's the origin of the artist's art autograph that's so necessary in modern art you know the artist is is is pushing the limits has radical things to say and to reveal or michelangelo's decoration of the sistine chapel you talk about like revolutions in liturgical life this is a chapel with an altar and over the altar you see the sea of naked bodies right it's it's incred it's the last judgment too it's not even what you would see the incarnational icon in the east was the the virgin mary of the sign with christ you know being born into this world of from from a human mother now it's the last judgment and all of its terror um you know the the famous uh creation of of adam and the system example uh he modeled his image of of of god creating adam uh he modeled him on zeus if you go back and you'll get statues of zeus this highway you know this like he's been to you know gold's gym or something that's really you know oh chest and he just looks with a white beard and all that stuff i mean that's just it's beautiful and it's in a in a worldly sense but it no longer has any liturgical or sacramental significance at all yeah there's so many things wrong with that painting i can't even start like why the naked like all the naked babies and why is there like a naked teenager next to him and it's just very disturbing michelangelo's paintings are very are very disturbing uh look at rafael think about you know the famous sistine madonna um you know that's the one of his many madonnas by the way rafael is writing about this in my new volume the age of utopia it's accounted by by a contemporary his name was vasari about the history of the lives of the painters you probably know about it he said that rafael was like a total womanizer yeah and he would you know he would he would seduce his uh his female models that were sitting as models for him and modeling is a totally new thing too um and when he was pain they would they were they were modeling the madonnas for him but in assisting madonna he's got those two little what are they angel thingies i call them yeah they they changed they had these figures in roman art which were called puti where like these little domestic gods you know like these little babies with with wings and and then they they somehow changed the cherubs into these poochies and so the cherubs which are these like flaming you know flaming glories of god with like multi multi eyes and wings became these cute little uh naked babies with wings you want to poke them in the belly like the pillsbury doughboy and they become totally insignificant and powerless and that i think jonathan is the sign of the shift in culture now for a secular transformation of the world from a heavenly one the heavenly powers you know the archangels angels seraphim cherubim i mean stand about the throne of god you know we can quote the divine liturgy um these no longer are relevant so they become these two little bored looking cutesy little um angel thingies at the bottom the painting and that really becomes the image in baroque painting as you know better than i yeah of what an angel looks like like it's just a cute little powerless unintimidating baby because there are no demons to worry about because man is autonomous you know that's pico uh de la mirando's uh argument um in the dignity of mandarin that during the renaissance that man is autonomous he's in control of his own life now and and you just get this demonization this diminishing of the heavenly presence in this world and angels are now represented even as christ how do you pray to christ when he's a naked little baby you know i mean you know with his forgive me but his genitalia exposed that's not a liturgical image anymore yeah it's interesting though is that something that i've been thinking about in terms of art there's something like for example michelangelo's work it never landed right it never landed it never created a tradition it never created so nobody copied his images nobody copied those paintings and made them into other whereas i think that there's a there's still an implicit thing in the catholic tradition there's still the possibility of so there are still images which appear later which become almost iconographic you know in their use let's say so if you have someone who has little saints cards with a prayer behind it you know there's something about that which even though they don't have the theology to explain it there's an intuition that people have about their connection to the saint and the way that say that these little saint cards that that are cheap and you can buy at a little gift shop the way that they're framed even though they're still western and they still have a kind of photo photo type realism to them they've been sobered up they've been brought into a kind of more frontal pose all of these elements of iconography nonetheless kind of persist in this folk in in in a kind of into intuitive folk world that continues to exist even though in the big churches in the high churches there's all these diagonals and all this madness and all this these floating investments and all of this kind of craziness you know for the for the humble pilgrim and the the little person who has a the card of a saint in their in their house it'll still look something like an icon there'll be a little bit of a tinge of of a remembrance of that of that world because it is more connected to how we actually engage people we the type of we don't you don't meet naked people and you you can't you can't pray i mean i don't know like have this like kind of sensual naked person in front of you and you're supposed to you can't look at them in the eye and then invoke them or you know ask for their prayers whereas these little saint cards where you just see the figure looking at you with a bit of a glow in the back it's kind of tacky but nonetheless it has that it has a little bit of the iconic memory let's say it does you're right about that and i think that's just instinctive it's maybe intuitive um there's also of course this revival of um eastern iconography you know you see in a lot of western churches these days yeah but i think that's that's what people are seeking um i think that that's what human beings were paid for was a connection with heaven and um and and that's the way we we make it you know we don't make it by looking at a fleshy image even if it's in a jerk even if it's over an altar it doesn't do anything it keeps us locked into this world into the secular it keeps us in the secular and man was made for more than the secular and and so that's why people are trying i think especially today to find a way out of this i think there's a it's really a cultural dead end artistic dead end and i mean look at the 20th century you know because of the disintegration of the human figure you know that just you know i think humanism as it was expressed by michelangelo like you said he never he never really created a tradition that followed him i think humanism just spent itself by the 20th century you know it was seen more and more by first nietzsche but then artists of the dada movement and the the the dolly and the the surrealists and others picasso for sure it was seen as a counterfeit as something that was just you know didn't have substance and it's interesting because even if you look at the history the there's a little microcosm which happens in the renaissance which people don't like to talk about so much because by the end of the renaissance there was a movement called mannerism and you see it even in in michelangelo's late work where it's as if this kind of glorious realism and this kind of glorious sensuality of the beginning of the renaissance quickly turned into this strange exaggeration the stretching of figures the the excess in color and and so you have this weird manneristic painting which happens at the end of the renaissance which is only broken by the council of trent and this kind of this kind of glorious baroque but you almost see a microcosm of what's going to happen in the whole story right there in the renaissance by the end of it you have a disintegration of form and then if you if you take a bigger loop all the way into modernism you have the same move which moves all the way down into because as you kind of explore the sensual aspect of of something as you fall into the passions those passions have no limit right and they start to turn into weird things right you know the weird you know and that's you can see that in the madness of pornography today where it's like it goes into all these weird little uh like fetishisms and stuff and so it was already there like right in the renaissance at the end of it and then the whole modernism like you said you can see like by the time you get to france's bacon you're like you know that you know what a portrait by francis bacon was promised to you in michelangelo already at the beginning post-modernism yeah francis francis bacon is a good good example of where this all goes yeah exactly exactly um and so one of the things that friends bacon know he he passed away i don't know a while ago i think so yeah a very dark figure even himself like he he himself manifests a lot of the of the darkness of of what the nihilistic 20th century is you know in his in his story as well in many that's what that's what the artist um of the post renaissance post chiseling autograph is all about is self-stimulation um you know driven to create um not to reflect heaven or anything else but to be the center of creation and radical breaking from everything that preceded it and and and sadly that is i think just creates a maniacal kind of personality the modern artist yeah exactly but you look at you look at traditional iconography as you well know jonathan i mean the the standard the way of life for an artist a byzantium was to fast to fast you know to pray to receive the sacraments on a regular basis and then to hand on tradition um through the image that has been already preceded you and you don't radically alter that image yeah and there's been there's been an effort to now we have some iconograph some iconographical saints you know saint andre uh has been recognized as a saint you and you can get an icon of of andre rublev and so there is this this and his you know he was a monk his whole life was a was it was a transfigured life and so it showed in his in his painting um so i one of the things that i really like about the book is how you you also you it's really what i like is that it although you have a perspective you you're careful not to fall into polemics as well where you show the promise for example like we talked about charlemagne you show the promise of charlemagne like how this could have gone like it could have been it could there there are some positive aspects which could have gone well and then showing how no this is how how things happened you know you do the same with constantine a real like there's a certain amount of realism in the way you approach it you show the positive aspects of the papacy the negative aspects also even of how the moments when constantinople was in heresy and was completely off the off the chart and so there there isn't it isn't just like a it isn't just a it's not a polemical work in that sense it really is trying to tell the bigger story right so that people can have a east-west vision of this christian culture which if you just show one side of it you you you lose out on so much of of how the world ended up uh and so i don't know have you seen someone else do something similar to what you're doing because i haven't really seen that on the horizon i haven't no i haven't john and that's that's what motivates me i i guess you know is you know i mean i love the west i i mean well we're westerners yeah yeah i mean i do and and i mean i'm you know we were talking before we started uh we're just chatting a little bit you mentioned something about i think some positive things about the west science and such i i i would i would really be at a loss i can't even imagine you know what i would be i mean i can't but without classical music and i can't access classical music without modern technology you know i mean i've listened to i've listened to tchaikovsky's sixth symphony like probably well of course that was his last let's do something early like his whatever his uh violin concerto i've listened to tchaikovsky's violin concerto a hundred times or a thousand times more than tchaikovsky ever listened to it i mean that's one of the incredible things about modern technology is you know we can access things like that i can just play that you know as i'm driving or working or whatever and there's so much that's good yeah but um the back to your question what's happened is that there really is it's it's maybe polemical it's maybe just about an unconscious bias but there is this sense that there is no ease someone knows something about there's a russia and it's always associated with a guy named putin you know and that's kind of it uh maybe there's some ballet maybe you know there's tolstoy that's kind of the end of it and um there's a you know star trek didn't he use a character called check off or something like that it's like i mean it's so minimalized and it nothing's known about it and and that's what i was trying to do a lot of people who are today um of which francis bacon that we just spoke of might be a good example of uh that is to say the problem of art um and morality and stuff like that a lot of people who are concerned with the the the issues of today trace those back if they trace them at all a lot of people just talk about them i think that's why trump was such a big deal because people don't really want to think about history they or the past or origins of anything you just want to solve the problem i in an immediate sense but if people think historically about where this came from you know i think it'd be interesting to do kind of a survey but i think i think probably the majority of people are going to say it's the sexual revolution yes 60s you know that stuff um those who are maybe a little bit more like you know formed educationally might say oh no it's more like the enlightenment didn't that to us and then others might go further back especially if they're roman um they might go back to the protestant reformation there's a brilliant book out there by um by a guy named brad gregory he teaches at notre dame called the unintended reformation yeah how a religious revolution i forget how the subtitle but it's essentially how the confirmation i gotta control and produce the pluralistic world culture yeah and it's really interesting and some would say that's really when it happened but but what i'm trying to do is say you know what if you go back even beyond that you find that it's really the great division that you know can be marked at 1054 although that's not really everything yeah and charlemagne and and that's really when we see the change that began to accumulate and uh and and and and meet to where we are today and no one again to answer your question my knowledge in the west i don't know what they're doing in russia or or greece i mean jana ross is a famous greek orthodox way scholar and he's written stuff like um about kind of with historical kind of insights into things um some others have as well but no there's almost i mean there's nothing that i know of that's out there right now tom holland is someone that you mentioned i loved his book dominion i i really loved some of his other books as well um but you know he's it's just not on his radar and having grown up in orange county you know i mean at you know in the 70s i was never told anything about the east i mean i wasn't told that there even was an orthodox church there was roman catholic and protestant churches and those are the two christian traditions that are you know behind the the civilization we live in and and um i don't think anyone's doing that right now no i mean i think i think like i've seen some people i was thinking while you were talking about if i i've seen some people do that but sometimes it's done in a way that's so polemical that it's almost it just turns you off right so if i think that it's important to be able to see for example in the the conversion of the north northern people and to understand that there were some positive elements in the franxx as well there was this this desire to be christian and you can see it in the art you can see it in in the architecture that there is a positive element to it but that nonetheless there's a seed which is planted and you can kind of see the seed being planted and it starts to grow and grow and grow and at some point the fruits of that uh start to appear and it doesn't mean that within that there wasn't also some there weren't saints there were saints there there were people who who were in embodying this paradisial uh reality even though even though kind of let's say the current was going against them but that it that we can nonetheless notice that the change was planted quite early in the in the history of the church and just kind of took form as as time went on and so it's hard to say because i'm a french person and so like i i don't like going against let's say my own my own tradition and that's why i also want to be able to see the the also the energy of the north let's say is something which i think is is important because it also happened in russia too it didn't just happen in the in the west it happened both in the east and in the west and so there are positive elements of that energy that came down from the north and created some of the great kingdoms you know the norman kingdom uh of sicily and all these kind of uh these magical places which have a lot of strength to them but nonetheless that seed was planted and you can't avoid it yeah no you're right and and there was a lot you know that's really admirable about frankish civilization um and it's spread in anglo-saxon and celtic you know i end the age of paradise on on the an island of the furthest the westernmost island of christendom which is a scale of michael you know off the coast of ireland with the celtic monks they're about the year 1000 praying and um and the celts you know what had this tremendous tremendously cosmologically affirmative piety that that really is so consistent with everything that we see in the first millennium and and and beyond that the the papacy played heroic a heroic role and really was trying to you know edify and increase the the quality of western civilization for centuries when the protestants came along they were doing a lot and have done a lot for for modern civilization that's for sure yeah and so father john i want i want to thank you for your time and i really want to encourage everybody to go and get his book his books now
