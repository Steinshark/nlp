ps5 or xbox series X well if your answer is neither and you want to go on the PC master-race side of things then this is absolutely something to consider and by something to consider I mean it's my new favorite thing inside the rog Zephyrus g14 is nearly the exact same processor as you'll find in the next generation of consoles including the Xbox series acts as well as the PS 5 now last month before all the world ending stuff I took a trip out to Andy's headquarters in Austin Texas where I got a deep dive on the brand-new rise in mobile 4000 series there's a lot of cool stuff here and I'll probably cover it more and future videos on all these new laptops that are coming out with Rison but they just if it is this you're getting the same Zen 2 for from the desktop on mobile as well as of course in that next generation console and the cool thing is you're getting the same level of performance too is we have that full 8 core design in a rise in laptop for the first time now yes when you hear desktop processor and tiny thin and light laptop that might not gel this is a 35 watt chip with a serious amount of power behind it now let me be clear we're not looking at some cut-down version of rising from mobile yes there's certainly some small differences when it comes to the actual CPU this is the full 8 for 16 thread design and inside the G 14 it's able to boost it 3.7 gigahertz under sustain 100% load aka slightly faster than the processors that you'll get inside the Xbox series X and the PS 5 I mentioned how thin this laptop is can we all take a second here and just recognize the fact that for years and years and tell his dominated laptops right and especially you get in gaming laptops the pretty much were no AMD options up until last year and yet here we are at the beginning of 2020 and we have a that enlight laptop for tannish laptop with more power than pretty much any Intel processor and a laptop that you can get and at lower power this is a 35 watt ship as opposed to the 45 watt chips that Intel usually use now well yes 10th Gen Intel stuff is probably right around the corner and we'll see how close it gets but it is incredibly impressive to see AMD not only taking over on the desktop side not only obviously dominating the consoles but now significantly moving into laptops and consider that there is a lower wattage version of this chip with the full 8 core design available and also book soon I mean oh it's a good time to be team red you know I could load you up with benchmarks showing just how fast this is but a non tech exists so instead let's actually take a look to see what it really is capable on so this is powered by that rise in 940 I 100 HS and is backed up with an RT X 2016 max Q 16 gigs of ram one terabyte SSD I mean there's a lot to like here especially when you consider that this is all in a 14-inch thin and light package well ok let me be specific a 17-point nine millimeters thin package but still quite small for a full gaming laptop there's a lot to like here what I like about this is that as a 14-inch laptop it is much closer to the size of something I would actually want a daily I mean it's not too far off of something like a razor blade stealth but with much much more power now speaking of power not only do we have the a super go left henge which means that you get a little bit of a better typing angle as well as more airflow this guy is rocking a 14 inch 1080p 120 Hertz display it is spoilered excellent like seriously colors great brightness is great and of course having that super-high 120 Hertz refresh rate is much appreciated on a laptop which again is fairly thin fairly light fairly house this is a gamer II but actually this is like one of the most subdued rog designs i've ever seen so inside the g 14 we have whoa a lot of stuffs so first of all we have access to our ddr4 memory although it looks like only one dem is actually available so you could upgrade this theoretically to 24 gigs I think we also have our m2 slot which is well available if I wanted to unscrew it so this has the one terabyte drive so I'm not only going to touch that what we see here is a very interesting heat pipe situation so we have two fans we have one two three oh seven individual heat pipes it does have a decent size seventy-six watt hour battery so something that I haven't spent a ton of time with is actually doing battery life test during gaming but for like light use I've been able to get eight to nine hours to this guy no problem okay so this is really stupid no one should ever care about this I really dig the way this looks on the inside the red PCB with all the black components this looks great I mean seriously look at that like that's like a work of art especially you consider that the outside is so nice and clean this is gonna be one of those rare situations where I have no criticisms not really and honestly in my testing this thermal solution has been more than adequate right CP was able to boost GPU is able to keep a good frequency I'm very impressed let's put this to the test with a game of gears 5 which coincidentally is one of the only games I've actually played on the real Xbox series X now a couple of caveats first of all while the processor is very similar to get in the next gen consoles we are taking advantage of only our TX 2060 graphics which just aren't as powerful but one of the things we do know is that they're working on a 120 FPS mode for Gears v on the console so why don't we see what it takes to get that running on the laptop considering it's got a 120 Hertz display so right now we are playing on medium settings pretty much across the board at 1080p and why don't we see we can do we're 91 90 frames per second or so that's actually really not bad and you can see there a CPU is significantly faster it is definitely being bought like by the RT X 2060 and honestly if we wanted to really capitalize we could easily crank it down to like say 1080p low so we end up getting 90 FPS but the CPU frame rate was 202 so if we had more powerful graphics we could very easily have hit a super capped 120 fps I think you'd really impressive look this is so much power for a laptop right this is so much power not just for a thin and light laptop this is so much power for a laptop full stop as I wait to join the game I am encouraged with 215 frames per second with max settings at 1080p so obviously for the video you can't really see the difference but I can say there right now I'm seeing somewhere between 150 and 200 frames per second and it is incredibly smooth I feel like if I had this I would never lose and broke verses Pro ever again I feel like we're actually gonna win this look at that look how great the Zephyrus is at not dying while we play another game it's not so easy to play alright so for our next game we have F 1 2019 knows the game have been playing a lot lately although certainly not with a controller and dude this is absolutely no problem 1080p high settings we're over a hundred and forty hundred fifty frames per second on this thing I mean if I have my wheel I'd feel much better I'm legitimately impressed with what kind of performance you're getting I mean yeah sure we could certainly use like a 20 70 or something but a 1080p 120 FPS it's not that hard to get a really nice locked experience here the rog Zephyrus g14 has plenty of power for gaming vo it doesn't have oh that's pretty much everything as far as I'm concerned so obviously the G 14 has the performance but there's a lot more to this laptop that I really do like now first of all there's the design yes it's thin yes it's a smaller laptop but the fact is this when especially when you look at it in the white color is so clean now this is the non Animatrix design I said it right I almost said something else but you can see that it has these little tiny dimples however we took a look at the one with the full LED panel at CES and it is really cool you can put up a gift someone not there but we all know the real reason why that laptop exists because DJs and people like Ken who pretend to be DJs want to have a cool flashy laptop for their suite DJ sessions if you're not Ken the standard model really is the one to get as if you want to get the Animatrix display you have to go for the q HD panel which is 60 Hertz I much prefer the 1080p 120 Hertz option now beyond just the screen and the specs I really have to give them props this might be my favorite ROG design yet no look nothing against black and red gaming laptops like all of these but the white the silver the very clean lines this honestly is something that I would have no problem dealing on a regular basis I might buy Boston we are the test drivers wow what great speakers and what a great sounding podcast available it really a dot F M slash test drivers the link in the description um so the speaker setup is actually really impressive on the G 14 as we have four speakers so you have two tweeters that are upward firing and then on the bottom you have a two much beefier speakers on the bottom and because we have that ergo lip design it actually has a little bit of echo underneath honestly while it's not as good as something like the sixteen inch MacBook for a smaller gaming laptop two huge thumbs up and the praise keeps going this keyboard is rock-solid we've got nearly two millimeters of travel it feels great it's a good layout they've actually have some really thoughtful keys so we actually have like dedicated buttons for volume up and down the arrow keys are nice and separated eighty students has made a lot of really smart decisions with this guy I really like it man like I didn't expect to like this laptop as much as I do and well yes it's got the power and yes it's got the great screen but there's so many little Hardware tweaks that make such a huge difference then I found myself daily a gaming laptop for the first time in a while there's also solid port selection so we have a pair of USB a HDMI as well as two USB see one of which actually supports not only a video out but also USB C power delivery now as this is a gaming laptop it does have the standard barrel plug and you're gonna need the normal power adapter for gaming but if you're out in the ballad if you're doing lighter tasks then you use pretty much any USB C power brick and it will give you enough power to keep the laptop up and running they actually point to the right for this time here I can't see anything from this angle Ken no it's not all perfect so we do have a fingerprint sensor supported by Windows hello built into the power button something you don't see on a lot of gaming laptops it is a newer style of fingerprint sensor where even if the laptop is off you can just put your finger on it and it will record your fingerprint and then as soon as Windows fires up it will then send it over to hello versus most which we actually have to press the button wait for it to turn on then put your finger down which is kind of annoying but the problem is is that it's not crazy accurate now give some props to soos because I have mini fingerprint issues on most Windows laptops it takes me several times the training before it kind of gets fairly accurate but still a nice feature and it doesn't it picking I will say that while I love the feel of the keyboard the backlighting isn't super uniformed this is an early unit so they may add that get that fixed in the next couple months before it ships but besides that there's really not a lot that I can complain about it's a really solid piece of hardware so really sell a piece of engineering and I don't have a good way to in this point bringing it all together the Zephyr is actually reasonably priced so this is an upper mid spec model which is a rise in 9 bar chi-x 2060 it's one terabyte SSD as well as 16 gigs of ram for only 1449 there also is a base model available for just over $1000 that lacks the high refresh rate display but still has pretty decent specs like the Rison 7 as well as a 1650 but realistically this is the sweet spot I'm really impressed with the Zephyrus g14 and the fact that it's powered by these new AMD rising processors is a huge win I mean we're getting almost desktop level performance and a 14 inch then like laptop and especially when you consider that that same processor is living inside both of the Xbox Series X as well as the PS 5 isn't very good time to rise up with your console brethren and play games together that sounds like a good idea make sure to subscribe to the channel if you think that that wasn't really dumb waited in the video well then you should click on a different video now they're not going to live together they hate each other a lot we can all use the same processors though Ken
