You join me today in ancient Greece. It's-
- (Well- this) (doesn't look like it. 
They've good lighting.) Thanks, it's it's not not what you were expecting but it's 6th century BC and in particular we're on a Greek island just off the coast of Turkey. It's called Samos and, I know what you're thinking, you'd like to dig a tunnel through a mountain, wouldn't you? Question is how on Earth do you dig a tunnel through a mountain when you don't have access to any modern equipment? I'll tell you how you dig a tunnel through a mountain! Okay so here is your mountain, lovely. Now there are a couple of things that you need to dig a tunnel through a mountain: you're going to need to have an entrance and an exit, those are the two requisite components of a tunnel. So let's say you want to go in here and you want to come out here. Now the thing is is that you can't just start digging in here and just hope that you'll come out here, it's not gonna work right? You need to make sure that you hit the right bit. So what people tend to do - this is what they did for the channel tunnel for example - is you start digging here and you start digging here and you just hope that they line up. Except that- I mean- you you're unlikely to find each other in the middle of a mountain. So you need a technique to make sure that these two lines end up meeting up in the middle. And the way that you do that is by using triangles. (I would have thought if you made) (absolutely sure you were digging in a) (straight line) (you'd be all right.) (As long as you can 
always- as long as you) (look behind you and the hole) (is still behind you- )
- Yeah but the straight line- Hang on, if you were in a straight line, okay so let's imagine that you- let me do like a contour of this mountain. It's quite a wobbly mountain this one. So you want to go in here and you want to come out here; the problem is that if you dig in a straight line you could end up over here. (Right, so how do you make sure- )
- How do you make sure that you get exactly there? And it's not like you can just stand on the top of the mountain and you go, heading that way lads. You know what I mean? Because you can't- when you're standing over here you can't see around there.
- (Right) So it's really hard to even- to even know.
(I feel like in) (the era of GPS you could just do the) (straight line.)
- In GPS I think you probably can. I think you probably can. Apart from the fact that you're in a tunnel, I don't think signal's great in tunnels but- (If you start in a straight line and then) (just keep looking behind you to make) (sure that the hole's still there, you) (know you're going in a straight line.) (Anyway.) (So you're saying the main problem is you) (can't see the other side?)
- You can't see where you're going, yeah, exactly. So the way that you do this, it's very neat. So you try and walk around from one side of the mountain to the other, and as you go - you want to try and stay at the same level as you go around - every time you take a step south you add it up, every time you take a step to the west you add up, and you're very careful about how big all of your steps are as you're going. Maybe you do this twice just to make sure you've got the right numbers. You've done it all in units and right angles and you've been really careful all the way along; because even in ancient Greece you can imagine it'd be quite easy to construct a right angle, wouldn't be too difficult. But in total then, imagine that you have taken 84 steps west and you have taken 13 steps south. So effectively then to get the direction from one place to the other you are talking about a triangle with those as the sides, so you know it's going to be 84 along there and 13 along there, and you know that that's a right angle because you've only ever walked south and west. And so you have this very nice neat triangle - I deliberately chose one that was a Pythagorean triple, you're welcome - so this is 85. So now actually when you are at the entrance to each of these tunnels you can construct a much smaller version of the same triangle and build it here. And if you make a kind of really long rod to sort of extend that angle, and you do the same thing over here so you've got another version of the triangle here, then you should have these two lines- these two angles that will meet really perfectly in the middle. So the only thing you've got to be careful of now is when you're digging to make sure that you stay perfectly flat, you don't want to go up you don't want to go down. And the way that they do that is that they put water in the tunnel, and then as they're digging they make sure that the water just sits nice and still rather than dripping in one direction or the other.
- (Like a spirit level?) Like a spirit level, exactly. This particular mountain, this is Samos and this was in 525 BC. Polycrates - I don't think he's called Polycrates- 'How do you pronounce Poly-crates?' [Computer: Poly-crit-ees] Oh it's Polycrates- whatever, Polycrates he wanted a tunnel. You can- you can shush. Polycrates he wanted this tunnel; it's a kilometer long, 525 BC this was built and this is exactly the technique that archaeologists think that they used. And when they did so they did incredibly well. There was a tiny bit of zigzagging at one end, and they think it was because they were trying to work their way around some quite difficult rock, but then they re-established this sort of plum line as it were. And when these two tunnels met in the middle, 
there's like a tiny little step of 60 centimeters. It's like this unbelievably remarkable achievement with just some triangles. (How do you know where to put those) (triangles so the triangles are at the) (right-)
- That's got to be a line that runs exactly east to west, and that's got to be a line that runs exactly north to south. Do they have compasses? I'm assuming they had compasses.
- (Well) (they knew- they had the sun.)
- They had the sun yeah, yeah that's true. Your open and close to the tunnel, they actually need to be at the same level before you start. You know the water- (At the same altitude?)
- Yeah the same altitude, exactly. Your water thing wouldn't work if you had one of your- if you're like yeah yeah let's start there and you hadn't worked out that actually one was much more uphill than the other. Now this is something they're not quite sure about how they did it, how they managed it, but there is some suggestion - I think it's I'm not convinced by this - but there's some suggestions some archaeologists think that created this tower and then got a massive long stick. I mean, maybe I haven't understood this quite right, but my understanding of it is they went up to the top of the tower and then they dangled a big long stick down and then they sort of swung it around the mountain. So they were like, oh there you go, that's a nice point right there. (Well you could use a rope
for that surely) And make it straight? Yeah. 
- (Like taut,) (although it's pretty hard to keep a rope) (that long taut.)
- Yeah it's like a kilometer. But I don't think they built a kilometer long stick either. Anyway, some mysteries remain unsolved shall we say.
