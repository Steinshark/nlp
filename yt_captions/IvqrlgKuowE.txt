with just a few clicks comrade Stingers asynchronous reprojection demo can make 30 frames per second gameplay look and feel like 240 frames per second it's completely free takes almost no additional system resources and the effect is so convincing that we fooled even the most seasoned gamers in our office we're still above 240. I'm gonna say 120. yeah I'm gonna say like 140 maybe even maybe higher I have no idea this is cool I don't know what you've done holy hahaha just your initial impression is obviously fake right haha April fools no it's December and asynchronous reprojection is not only real but it's actually a mature technology there are literally hundreds of games going back half a decade that are using this Tech to boost perceived performance they're just not the kind of games that you typically play on a monitor but why not right the idea to use it on desktop came from two clicks Philip and it's one of those ideas that is so brilliant in hindsight that it seems totally obvious like this segue to our sponsor ridge ridge wallet has redefined the traditional wallet with its compact frame and RFID blocking plates that's right the Bulge in your pants shouldn't be from your wallet use offer code Linus to save 10 and get free worldwide shipping you can download comrade Stinger's Unity project to play around with for yourself and I would recommend that you do so but first let me explain what's going on here this slider in the corner allows us to control the frame rate of our game while the rest of these parameters are to apply and compare the performance and rendering tricks that make up asynchronous reprojection let's go a little slower this time we'll start with Native 240 FPS rendering I know this isn't going to fully come through in a YouTube video but it looks smooth right it is but let's say we can't afford an RTX 4090 and our GPU can only reliably generate 30 real frames per second drag this down over here set to render at 30 FPS and obviously this is a degraded experience with visible choppiness tearing and input leg then with the push of a button it instantly feels like 240 FPS again even though we're still running at 30 frames per second the first step to show you guys what's happening is to go even further and stop rendering new frames altogether then enable asynchronous reprojection interesting this is a great demonstration of how the display and user input can be refreshed without receiving a new rendered frame from the GPU this obviously isn't a great gaming experience given that we're looking at a static picture in a black void and we can't even move our character but it's very smooth let's take things a step further pun intended by breaking the on-screen objects into strips and sorting them by their distance from the player we can actually guess where they're going to end up relative to the player's input again without rendering a new frame at zero FPS things get pretty messy pretty fast but watch what happens if we have even a little bit more than that not bad for 10 frames per second but the black void is still there especially if we whip the camera around and in some ways it's even more distracting that's where the next little bit of black magic comes in the area of your vision that is sharp enough to read text or recognize a human face is only about six to seven degrees everything else is peripheral vision which is relatively blurry but highly sensitive to motion that's why this is so annoying even if I'm still in The Sweet Spot of your field of view but there's an easy fix you can simply stretch out any object that's at the edge of the last rendered frame until a new update is received and you can see that by filling that void with something even just a loose approximation of what's supposed to be there the perceived image quality jumps dramatically no Wild no of course at only 10 frames per second we're going to be able to break the illusion pretty easily even by moving the mouse moderately quickly but going back to the demo we did before if we boost our frame rate back up to 30 all of a sudden it's far less noticeable unless we look and move at the same time then we can kind of notice that judder but let's say we ratcheted it up to 60 FPS oh now things are getting pretty convincing here then the question is if this has been around for years and can turn the 60 FPS that your mid-range GPU turns out into a 240 FPS experience why on Earth haven't we been using it if I had to guess I'd say because it just didn't occur to anyone that we wanted it myself included I mean when was the last time Gamers asked for a compromised form of rendering the outrage over driver cheats would have been immediate so async re-projection well it wasn't developed to help Gamers save money or to help GPU manufacturers get more FPS on low end carts it was developed out of necessity in the early days of VR it was already clear that being Tethered to a stationary expensive PC was always going to be a friction point for Mass adoption why does it look like the inside of a vagina but mobile chipsets had nowhere near the performance they needed to render 90 plus frames per second at greater than full HD resolutions performance hasn't been perfect especially when there's a lot of like particle effects on screen so they had to do something to bring out lightweight battery-powered headsets that also didn't cause users to projectile vomit within minutes of putting them on and asynchronous reprojection and over the years it's gotten really good don't take my word for it though let's take a more detailed look at the reactions of some of the gamers in our office I have over 900 hours in Apex Legends and over 300 hours in vermintide too I am a competitive FPS player I rank in top five to ten percent on apex Legends globally and I've been a gamer for basically as long as I can remember I play a lot of video games from fps to puzzle to anything I play games on my computer I game a lot and I'm terrible at it I play a lot of games I've helped develop some games hi I'm Mark um I'm gonna say 120. no 90. I would say one 140. yeah I'm just saying like the trails like I'm seeing things rent take a while to refresh on the screen in terms of like frame rate it doesn't feel that much different I want to say it's worse Anthony what are you using foveated rendering my God wants to say that this is the least responsive so far to me this feels like 60. has anything changed no no I can't I can't tell it feels feels the same uh yeah like I can very clearly tell with the with the shadow here just kind of how blurry those edges are for a split second from a technical perspective I'm intrigued I'm incredibly intrigued this is this is super neat it's so hard to know if if I'm thinking I'm seeing something because I'm looking for it or if there actually is something different like if you really quickly snap between like the player model and that kind of cyan uh Cube there's definitely a lot of blur going on at like really high speed yeah it's basically the same as last I can't really tell I want to say it feels better this seems a bit better again if I had to guess about frame rate I have a suspicion that all the frame rates are the same um when you go really fast it's bad that is incredibly annoying I would not want to play like that whoa okay clearly things are things are things are popping in and out of existence I don't know is real anymore uh I don't know if it's just like you know you know how there's um systems where basically whenever something's being looked at is being rendered but as soon as you're looking away it gets called or it's not it's just not rendered anymore um that's what this feels like but like on a slow mode laughs oh oh no no oh what do you mean Better or Worse we'll have the mostly uncut version of those sessions up on floatplane.com if you want to see more it's pretty funny but the gist is that not a single one of our test subjects correctly identified the frame rate no matter what we set it to in fact a surprising number of our respondents thought that 60fps felt and looked worse than 30 because they started actively looking for the artifacts now to be fair to our test subjects they're not idiots it's really hard to tell in person and that's part of what makes this test so interesting but why is it so hard to tell the reason lies in the relationship between frame rate and refresh rate frame rate is a measure of how many complete images per second are generated by your GPU the higher your frames per second the sooner you're going to get the most up-to-date information say for example on the position of your opponents that also includes though the results of your inputs that improves the perceived responsiveness of the gaming experience and is one of the reasons why a high frame rate is so desirable but the frame rate almost never corresponds to the refresh rate of your monitor that is how many times per second it can actually show you a new image I understand why people confuse the two sometimes they are similar in the sense that the higher the refresh rate the sooner you see the results of your mouse movements and your key presses so they have a similar impact on your gaming experience but the refresh rate doesn't work to give you new information unless you've got an updated frame so that they aren't quite the same the conventional wisdom for competitive PC Gamers before the days of high refresh rate displays was that you wanted to push the frame rate to at least double of what your display was capable of that should give you an edge over your opponents by having slightly more up-to-date information on the screen that usually meant targeting about 120 FPS the idea was that by the time your monitor is finished displaying the current frame your GPU will have created a more up-to-date frame for the next one than it might have if both of them were locked to 60. this is what we're seeing with async reprojection but in the other direction the GPU is running slower but the user inputs are displayed as soon as the display can show them even if the GPU hasn't caught up yet that means that regardless of the real frame rate input from the mouse remains responsive and the most common complaint from our test subjects while moving their view at these ridiculously low frame rates wasn't even that the game was laggy or unresponsive but instead it was the stretching along the edges of our screen our test subject's reactions by the way were great when we showed them how the sausage was made what is this what the hell is happening oh my God what oh my God whoa oh okay oh my God this is next level it goes to show how frame rate and perception are so heavily tied together like looking at that I you you would never have guessed that it was it was a 30 before obviously it's not perfect I could get a much better experience with like fancy Hardware but I mean if you can enable this on a lower tier GPU or something that's like pretty crazy and what's really cool about this is that it's not just a placebo having more responsive inputs even if your frame rate isn't that high can make a big difference when you're tracking a moving Target say in an FPS game and this is just the beginning comrade Stinger put this demo together in literally an evening which means that edge cases like kiting a character model are still pretty ugly thanks to all the visual anomalies but imagine if the major GPU and game engine designers were to build support for this into their products Nvidia is using machine learning to generate whole artificial frames in dlss 3.0 and that could end up seeming downright silly if all they had to do was use their machine learning to guess at what should be just outside that frame that hasn't been generated yet or what might be on the side of that sliced up model that you're kiting around however it's not a Magic Bullet either even if asynchron projections artifacts could be nearly eliminated racing games mobas and other games with mostly fixed viewpoints might actually benefit more from traditional rendering at variable refresh rates like with g-sync or freesync so like variable refresh rates or frame generation for that matter this technique is just one tool in the developer's toolbox that if it catches on and matures could be used to improve responsiveness and here's another cool one also minimize power draw imagine this on a future console like a Nintendo switch 2 or a steam deck too you know a device where maybe you could run at 60fps but you're routinely capped to 30 in order to save battery thumbsticks and especially gyro controls could be made far more responsive with almost no increase in power drop suffice it to say I'm extremely excited to see where this and Technologies like it will take us in the future especially in a world where GPU prices have risen to the point where they're just unreasonable and gaming on top tier Hardware has become less and less accessible just like I'm always accessible to
