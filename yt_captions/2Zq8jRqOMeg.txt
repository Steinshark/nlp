let's discuss what we're doing with Peterson Academy we thought what if we could make getting a degree 95 percent less expensive because that's a pretty funny Target it's like we're going to undercut You by 95 percent and offer a better quality experience along the way why wouldn't it be good to provide everybody at least in principle with access to the best lectures you know you might think why should you be generally educating because otherwise you're going to be a useless resentful bitter pointless counterproductive lump and that's not a good strategy so that's why you think you think so that your stupid thoughts can die instead of you if you get to the upper echelons of any hierarchy you'll start encountering people who know a lot about almost everything and so if you're stupid and you don't know anything about anything they're just going to look at you and listen to you for like two seconds and think well I don't know where this clunk came from but you know he's not come along for the ride you need to be enculturated so that you can play with sophisticated people and you could play as sophisticated and productive game but also so that you've informed yourself with the greatest ideas of History so that whatever problem you're tackling you're going to have tools to pack chocolate with once we get it well developed you'll be able to take all these courses and then you know you won't be a complete embarrassment to yourself I didn't enjoy my University experience the professor wasn't interesting I was like I'm pretty sure what they just said wasn't true I got a psychology Professor tell me rats weren't social creatures because they lived in cages literally that happened it's like what not traveling 40 minutes to go to this class and I think it's cruel that people are told they have to go to university they have to spend 100 to 200 000 to get a degree so they can get a job otherwise they're screwed it's just a scam but it bothers me that people are being scammed to learn to not believe in themselves assume that they can't fix their problems and then hate their country basically it would be funny if we could blow apart the university system a little bit because it's broken because of what it did to you like you were alienated out of your job basically you'll be damn fortunate if we can provide you with a list of people who've graduated and if you had any sense you'll employ them preferentially because we did the rigorous screening work and I know how to do regular screen work because I studied that for like 25 years a degree from our University will signify high-level conscientiousness and general cognitive ability and those are very valuable for any employer with a clue so I think we can just skip the application process and go right to the employers we are planning a soft launch in November and we might be able to change the education system that's funny it's weird up yours woke more or less we'll see who cancels who exactly that sort of funny that kind of funny oh yeah [Music] thank you
