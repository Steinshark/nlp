[Music] okay 2022 there's no way it's not better than 2021 right right hi what's up mkbhd here we made it to 2022 all right so there was plenty of tech happening still in the past year in 2021 we had some truly great new computers we had plenty of interesting and unique smartphones the mirrorless camera world took a step up there were a bunch of good evs and a bunch of even better eevee promises the ps5 is a whole year old and still impossible to get but now it's time to look forward this is a little tradition i've started sort of the beginning of each new year where i look forward at the next year in tech actually usually there's a bit of a frenzy right at the beginning of the year in the form of ces in las vegas every january this is actually the first year in like a decade that i'm not going to ces as fun as it probably still could be it doesn't seem like the most responsible thing to go do for me right now but nevertheless i just looked at the calendar there's a lot of new fun tech to look forward to for 2022. so i'm just gonna start off at the top of my list which is apple silicon so the mac transition to apple silicon started in june 2020. it was announced on stage at wwdc and they said on stage that this transition would take two years that announcement was a year and a half ago so we got to be finishing it up now right so we have an apple silicon macbook air macbook pro baseline imac next up or last up would be a bigger imac or imac pro and the tower the mac pro so the imac pro i think probably has the simplest formula right all they really have to do is put the new m1 pro or m1 max chip in there and then give the larger display with the squared off design kind of like the pro display xdr you probably also give it black bezels and uh high refresh rate and call it a day i mean a couple extra ports and mag safe and keeping the sd card slot and the headphone jack would also be great that's your new imac we've seen lots of mock-ups and renderings of what something like this could look like some of them have a notch some of them don't i mean on a display that big you probably don't need to do a notch cut out but i could totally see them doing it either way i think that imac pro will be great for a lot of people and i think it'll be very tempting for me but i won't be switching to it because i'm waiting for the tower so the developing background information seems to be pointing toward a pretty beastly apple silicon mac pro finally coming this year it would actually be smaller than the current intel mac pro tower since apple silicon is so efficient but it would also be for sure the new largest chip they've ever made we're looking at up to a 40 core cpu and 128 core gpu really the main reason i'm so excited for these machines is we've seen what is so impressive about apple silicon in the past which is that they're so powerful and so efficient compared to these intel and amd chips but that's because they're in laptops and things that are battery powered and they have to be efficient but for the imac and the mac pro of course you still want to be relatively efficient so people plugging them into their setups aren't getting higher electricity bills but now you're working with way more wattage way larger thermal envelopes it's like the best most unlocked version of apple silicon possible and i just can't wait to see how they perform i'm ready this is the definition of tech i am ready for please drop one in my setup right now there's also rumors of a new slightly smaller high refresh rate like pro display too to go alongside it to match may or may not happen alongside but i think that'll be pretty cool too but i think we just keep forgetting that machines like this are not meant to be bought and used by regular people for regular everyday computing things like i don't have a mac pro at home i just you get a regular computer you get a laptop you get a little even a bass line all in one totally fine but when i use that huge mac pro at my desk it's a workhorse it's it's been a rock it's been churning through things but even now that thing kind of feels slow in some single threaded tasks compared to like even the m1 macbook air so very excited to see what they do uh all that being said this is all apple stuff and i've gotten a lot of the information of like what i really trust and hope to see from mark german he's kind of the only one i trust with this stuff uh so also from his newsletter iphone 14. so this could be an interesting one one thing that always comes to mind with the iphone is okay new year new iphone what are they gonna phase out this time what are they gonna try to get rid of does the lightning port have another year of life left here maybe i heard they might be also trying to get rid of the physical sim card in the sim card tray that wouldn't shock me at all but there are a couple of things i'm specifically looking forward to in the next iphone because number one they would make it a better phone but number two because the uh the iphone effect sort of tends to have the rest of the industry follow and i think it would be a good thing to follow so for one they could potentially be adding the pro motion display across the whole lineup across all the new iphone 14s even an iphone 14 mini if they do another mini and this would be really nice to see if these were all presumably ltpo displays all the way across the board too for battery life of course so it's a subtle thing but ltpo displays allow you to ramp up not just to a higher fresh rate of 120 hertz but at different refresh rates underneath that in between depending on what's going on on the screen all that to save your battery life in the last video i gave my impressions of the galaxy s21 fan edition and i accidentally put ltpo in my graphic that's actually incorrect that's my bad it's a standard regular 120 hertz ammo led so i pinned a comment to correct that but really you only find ltpo or this variable refresh rate on the highest end phones so the fold threes of the world the galaxy s21 ultras the apple find x3 pros the cheapest phone out right now offering ltpo is the 800 oneplus 9 pro so if we do see apple bring that down across the entire iphone 14 lineup to the cheapest iphone iphone 14 mini if it's what it ends up being that would be very impressive and something that i hope the others copy too it's funny how we go from seeing apple so far behind on high refresh rate to maybe leading the next wave of it but also iphone 14 cameras this could this could be the first year in a long time that we see the iphone megapixel bump here's a chart from my reviewing every iphone ever video of megapixel counts of the iphone's cameras every single iphone since 2015 has had a 12 megapixel sensor and that's not a bad thing they've got this really dialed over the years and low light performance with these large pixel sizes is great the rumor this year is we may see finally a 48 megapixel iphone camera i love this of course but the more i've thought about it the more i feel like this may potentially be handled in a kind of weird apple way see apple's been sticking to the 12 megapixel sensors for so long and they've got lots of good reasons it's high enough resolution to look really great anywhere you might send it in a text message social media whatever and if you blow it up and you want to print one then it'll look okay so why would they switch well presumably this could be a year where apple really focuses on having a pro camera and a pro camera offers you the ability to do much more with your photos so you can have you can have that super high resolution pro mode of course it will typically just be binning everything to 12 megapixels anyway for normal people and normal shots but that pro mode would be sweet and on top of that you know what 48 megapixels unlocks for you 8k video so if they're getting really serious about pro video they can of course join the club of smartphones being able to shoot an 8k but now imagine how much storage space 8k prores video on the iphone would take up i mean we already have an absurd amount if you've ever shot 4k prores on the iphone it's a lot and uh you can't even shoot 4k pro res on the baseline 128 gig pro iphone so i'd imagine they would have some other restriction to shoot 8k prores maybe you'd have to have the one terabyte iphone i don't know but the most fascinating iphone 14 rumor that's gaining steam is probably that they'll be moving to a hole punch camera on the front and moving the rest of the face id system underneath the display huh now to me that's actually that actually seems to work perfectly it's really clever it almost makes you wonder why they didn't do it earlier because we know the cameras that exist underneath displays today you know they've been okay but they're really not the best quality or resolution as far as actual images you can get out of them now the face id sensor is really just working with projecting a bunch of infrared dots so they don't have to have this super high clarity or resolution to work just as well so in theory yeah you can already just move those right underneath the display glass with today's tech they'll keep working fine and for the pristine actual selfie image quality you give that little hole punch cut out and still have a normal selfie camera so that'll be cool but let's get out of apple camp galaxy s22 is right around the corner following up on their winning the smartphone of the year award with the galaxy s21 ultra and i see that this design change that's pretty heavily rumored is probably happening i don't hate it i don't love it but i don't hate it maybe i like it more when i hold it i think phones tend to always look better in person than they do in the renders but pretty much everything that was already really good about s21 ultra is rumored to be upgraded in this phone again it's a classic samsung way better chipset better specs better display uh better cameras 8k 60fps video is slated so they can already do 8k 24 but 30 would be cool and 60 would take a lot of space but it'd be cool too so that's the typical samsung through all the hardware added way and then there's also the possibility of including an s pen this one not so sure about maybe it is included with support or maybe there's an s22 note edition or something like that so we haven't seen a galaxy note in at least a year but maybe this is their way of bringing it back the s pen lives on as long as that happens so that'd be pretty cool i just really hope they don't curve the display over the edges again i've seen a bunch of different mock-ups and little 3d renders and leaked posts and the one thing a lot of them have in common is a really curved display now i like that it's a boxier design kind of like the note always was and i like the flat top and bottom but samsung really got it right by reducing the curve in the s21 ultra display and it would be a weird move to go back on that to a huge curve again we do now have official oneplus 10 pro uh design and specs so by the time you're seeing this we've got the official numbers and photos from oneplus this is sort of following up on going for redemption for the lackluster year of the oneplus 9 series i don't hate this design it clearly was inspired a lot by what samsung just did with their cameras but it's sort of their own take on it but it's definitely different i'm okay with it i'm sure you'll all have your own thoughts on this in the comments section below but i'm i'm okay with this but the spec sheet is absolutely nuts it's all maxed out specs i'll just toss it over here or something so you can see it uh i think the most impressive part though is 80 watt wired charging and they're calling it super vu charging instead of what they used to call one plus fast charging which is dash charging so this is yet another step in the uh operation of the one successful brand under that umbrella in north america which is one plus but that's enough phones i got one more thing that i'm really excited and ready for in 2022 which is evs electric vehicles and specifically this sort of trio of trucks so that would be the rivien the f-150 lightning and the cyber truck now rivien has started shipping their r1t pickup truck which i literally loved honestly on my list of evs i've ever driven it's got to be top five i mean there's plaid model s tycan e-tron i'm putting pulsar in there but then this has definitely got to be in there in no particular order so they're officially delivering them we should start seeing them more and more on the streets this year also alongside the r1s which is essentially on the same platform but it's the suv version it's even lower volume than the pickup truck but that's also anticipated for 2022 and then i also got my first look at the f-150 lightning last year and just today i saw a headline that they're planning to double their production so clearly they're seeing a lot of interest and that's all assuming no delays so they're saying something like spring 2022 that's assuming assuming no delays and then the tesla cyber truck is the most delayed so far out of all these three last we heard elon tweeted that it would be coming out late 2022 barring unforeseen delays but then again also last week tesla removed the 2022 estimate from their website so hopefully not delayed maybe also technically the uh the electric hummer that we just looked at this this past year is also coming out so that's four uh i think this would be really fun if we did a new thousand mile road trip comparing gas versus electric but this time do with trucks i mean we can get a regular f-150 but we can also do these electric trucks and do it while towing something so we can learn something again from this road trip i think it'll be pretty fun the first one was a lot of fun and we learned a lot so maybe leave a thumbs up if you want to see that in 2022. actually it might be kind of hard to do all that while towing stuff because then you still need to like back into a charger but then that's tough with a trailer maybe we'll just do this with a bunch of weight in the bed i think bottom line is it'll be it'll be pretty next level next level like our current channel sponsor cash app cash app is the easiest way to spend send and save your money we already know it's great for sending your friends some money or having them pay you back for something but also you can buy bitcoin and save money and invest on cash app that's probably right in line with your new year's resolutions too so join cash app you can use code marquez to get 15 bucks dropped into your account right away and 10 will go to girls who code so there's a bunch of other little small things i'm interested in there's maybe a quest three coming this year from meta since they've it's still weird saying that i'm so used to saying oculus quest but a meta quest three considering how important the metaverse is to them maybe if we get a pixel 7 we also get a pixel watch alongside that that's probably not happening but generally a lot of really cool stuff coming for 2022 let me know in the comment section below what you're most interested in seeing this year i definitely want to cover as much of it as i can but i want to get a sense of what you guys want to see too so that's been it thanks for watching welcome to the new year catch you guys the next one peace
