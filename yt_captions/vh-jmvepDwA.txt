do you want to literally die buy an android then seriously that's the takeaway of today's apple event if you go to work eat food hike drive a car or ovulate without an apple watch ultra and an iphone 14 you are as good as dead at least i'm pretty sure that's what apple wanted to be the takeaway of their event today behind their appeals to worrywarts and helicopter parents though is some genuinely cool tech and of course a bunch of stuff that everyone else has had for years that apple has slapped a new name on and called it revolutionary so what tech here is actually a step forward and what's just a shiny new label let's have a look at this segway to our sponsor cablemod cablemod's new keyboard cable configurator say that five times fast is the easy way to complete your keyboard look customize almost anything and receive your handmade cable in two weeks or less check it out at the link below [Music] in past years apple has shied away from calling attention to the notch to the point where they got sued over it but for the iphone 14 pro the notch is on full display now it's pill-shaped and apple calls it the dynamic island around the front sensors the pill expands to show you useful information while you're in other apps things like timers music sports scores flight information maps navigation and more can go up here i will personally need to actually use it for a bit before i decide if it's a gimmick or not but what i know now is that it still looks bad while watching full screen video and it also pretty much guarantees that you're going to have fingerprints all over your front facing camera every time you go to use it which is too bad because the front-facing camera now has autofocus which is pretty sweet as far as i can tell this is the first time a front-facing camera has been able to properly focus typically front cameras have a fixed lens that is focused at roughly an arm's length away with everything else being i don't know probably good enough this saves on the space that's needed to have a movable focusing element but completely eliminates any chance of natural bokeh both the base and pro iphone 14 models then now do have this feature and there's a good chance that these new front-facing cameras will be better than many of the rear shooters from a couple of years ago on that subject around back on the iphone 14 pro we get a new 48 megapixel quad pixel sensor that is 65 larger and has a cool trick up its sleeve pixel binning when there's heaps of light you get the full 48 megapixels but in low light the iphone 14 pro is able to take four pixels and turn them into a single better pixel this does decrease the resolution of your photos from 48 to 12 megapixels but it dramatically improves low light performance to be clear this technology is nothing new for instance the samsung galaxy s21 ultra and s22 ultra have a version of this that actually combines nine pixels together but it is a very welcome addition to the iphone 14 pro along with the main camera on the pro we get a 12 megapixel 48 millimeter telephoto and a 12 megapixel 13 millimeter wide and every iphone 14 camera benefits from apple's new photonic engine which is basically their deep fusion photo ai but more better and apparently it can nearly double their low light performance while the base iphone 14 gets the same a15 chip from the old iphone 13 pro the 14 pro gets a fancy new a16 chip the a-16 sounds similar to the a15 we still get two performance cores four efficiency cores and five gpu cores but through the magic of four nanometer it's able to reduce power consumption on the performance cores by 20 according to apple this is the most efficient mobile cpu in existence and given that they've been crapping on everyone else in terms of performance i'd say that's probably accurate and it's probably more power than you'll be needing in a smartphone for quite some time unless you're a very heavy user the biggest advancement with the a16 though is the display engine which brings better anti-aliasing the ability to reduce the screen refresh rate down to one hertz to boost battery life and finally and always on display for the iphone i know i know everyone on android totally floored right now that apple hasn't had an always-on display until now but guys credit credit where credit is due they have finally done it only took them nine years three times as long as it took us to design our screwdriver which is available at lttstore.com but apple giveth and apple take it away in this case take a thing the sim tray actually in most of the world you'll get a nano sim tray but if you buy an iphone 14 in north america you do not instead you get two e-sims now for the vast majority of users this absence of a physical sim tray is never going to be a problem you just connect your carrier to the e-sim and you never think about it again but if you're someone that regularly travels between continents and doesn't have a travel plan or you go places where it's not supported then it's going to be a bit of a change see right now if you want to change to a local carrier when you're on the road you go grab a sim card put it in your phone and you're done going forward with a north american iphone 14 you're gonna have to register that carrier to one of your two e-sim slots that assumes they even support esim and then if you need a third carrier for some reason you're gonna have to go through the rigmarole of removing one of your carriers and adding another one switching it's just a giant what fart anyway if there was one thing that brought a sparkle to apple's eye during the event it was the thought of you being in grave danger like wow they laid it on pretty thick they do have some pretty cool technology to show for it though previously if you wanted to connect your cell phone directly to a saddle knight you'd need a rod jeremy spec antenna and well you still do if you want to have a proper conversation without involving a cell tower but this is really cool by having an app that shows you how to point your phone directly at a satellite you can manage just enough of a connection to send out an emergency message and your location to make this easier they have a form with typical emergency questions so all the information a rescue team needs can be sent at once and even if you're not in grave danger you can use this feature to send location data to your loved ones if you're the kind of person that goes on weeks-long treks across the yukon or whatever the case may be also integrated into the iphone 14 is new car crash detection this is accomplished by using an improved gyroscope as well as a fancy accelerometer that can measure up to 256 g's at a 3 000 hertz polling rate as well as data from the barometer and mic to tell if an airbag has gone off apple apparently recorded a thousand hours of crash test data and from that they were able to tell what type of car crash you've been in and automatically alert emergency services if you don't respond to the prompt crash detection is also a feature on the new apple watch ultra which frankly looks pretty sick the case is titanium the face is a sapphire crystal and you get a new orange programmable button i doubt the majority of apple watch ultra users will ever need it to function as a dive computer a wayfinder or to measure the length of their stride but in addition to those it has improvements for the rest of us like more battery life the watch ultra can last for 36 hours of regular use and up to 60 when it's in low power mode it has dual frequency gps for higher accuracy and an all red night mode that looks sick i think anthony probably put it best when he said this is the apple watch that makes people that didn't want an apple watch want an apple watch the standard apple watch series 8 is largely unchanged compared to the series 7 except for two improvements that it shares with the watch ultra the aforementioned crash detection and some really accurate thermometers one on the outside and the other against your skin these sensors were designed with women's health in mind specifically cycle tracking and a retrospective analysis of ovulation all of this information is encrypted on the device and not even apple has a key to decrypt it which shouldn't be that big of a deal but unfortunately women's rights in the states recently took a huge hit and cycle tracking information could be weaponized against you if it falls into the wrong hands anyway the atrial fibrillation will be able to pick up your distress when you find out the apple watch ultra starts at 800 us dollars good gravy while the series 8 starts at 400 with the sc starting at 250. moving on there's a second generation of the airpods pro that's actually the one i'm most excited about that features new h2 silicon that apparently has greatly improved spatial audio now you're able to use an iphone camera to create a 3d model of your ear to better tune the spatial audio for your specific ears something the likes of sony have been doing for a while overall the new airpods pros just seem to be like better than the old ones more battery life better active noise cancellation and an improved transparency mode the improvement i'm most excited for concerns the case though it finally has the ability to charge with an apple watch charger and also you can easily locate the charging case thank you apple like you can already easily find the headphones but i find that i constantly lose the charging case around the house because i'll just leave it somewhere when i put my earphones in and forget where that happened this is a segway to our sponsor vesey vesti footwear is known for being lightweight easy to pack
