[Music] hey what's up guys i'm kbht here hey what's up marquez are you getting the tesla cyber truck um no well all right it's been about 48 hours and i'm back at the studio and i've been able to sort of crystallize a lot of my thoughts that have been floating around about the cyber truck you may have watched my initial super quick early video of it from the event a lot of people have then after that event i didn't order one and a lot of people kept asking me hey wait marquez did you pre-order the tesla cyber truck and my answer was usually i don't really need a pickup truck so no the cyber truck didn't really change that but it was really interesting but then of course you have the test ride which for tesla is notoriously effective and then just a bunch more information and images and videos since that event have come out a lot of these photos and videos show new angles of things like the interior uh the lights in the bed of the truck and a view from the back seat and the spacious roof line and even how much that weird marble countertop looks so strange in the front i'm not sure still how i feel about that but it's definitely still there twitter user matt landry got a video of the opening and closing of the rear hatch so the driver presses a button on the side and it's pretty cool to see it basically slot open and reveal the rear view mirror and slotting clothes will protect the six and a half foot bed that's allegedly so strong that you can stand on it and also elon on twitter has since confirmed that there will be an option to make that cover a solar panel which could regenerate up to 15 miles of extra range per day if you're into that so if you're really out in the middle of nowhere then this could help you get a couple extra miles which could be useful it's really cool but it's not the reason i ordered it though the specs of course are still right and a lot of people who did their test drives posted their videos of them and they were demoing the dual motor version which is doing zero to sixties in like four and a half seconds so that's definitely faster than most other pickup trucks and even though that's about the least important spec for a pickup you care more about things like total load capacity and how much you can tow that is still a fun by-product of having an electric motor and they will definitely show that off so it's fun but that's not why i ordered it though and then something pointed out by quinn of snazzy labs in his video the bed itself has an l-track rail on the inside of the bed and then the floor of the bed there's a bunch of slots that you can use and these two things together can make whatever combination of mounting points you want to tie things down or arrange what you're carrying in that huge six and a half foot bed that is really smart i think they should have mentioned that on stage it's not why i'm buying it but i do appreciate a good modular design also since the event elon has tweeted at supersaf confirming that there will be a matte black version of the cyber truck after people sent him renders and um that's i i swear that's not why i'm ordering one look at the end of the day when people are talking about cyber truck you inevitably land on the design just what the thing looks like and some parts of it are dope and some parts of it are weird i actually think the lights in the bed are pretty cool assuming you can turn them off the huge bar light on the front looks sick and it's actually very functional on the road and the roof light is more of just cool looking lights but yeah it's the angles and the line choices that make this one of the most polarizing vehicles i think i've ever seen there were well over 20 000 comments actually let me just check it's over 30 000 comments now on the cyber truck first impressions video and reading through the comments they almost alternate hilariously between like this is amazing this thing looks dope it's one i'm glad they think outside the box i'm really happy i want one and then the others will be this is stupid i hate it it's the dumbest looking truck ever it's the worst i think when it comes down to it it's these two lines here instead of curves i mean when you look at this truck there isn't a single curve anywhere it's all angles and points and lines it's kind of like how i draw a truck when i was like five years old and didn't know better but the simplicity of it means it's very different from all the other trucks that are on the road right now much more striking and when you think about it and you take some time with it the more you realize this was all on purpose to stand out in a sea of hundreds of other pickup truck options this one had to be different it had to be striking and it had to stand out in a way and then they had to really lean into it unashamedly and really embrace it to give people a reason to think about it differently it's the same way i'm convinced right now that apple lately does think about making new product design choices that are intentionally a little bit jarring just knowing that the memes will come but soon enough when people get used to it it'll be the reason it's recognizable and even iconic tesla here is trying to break into a market pickup trucks that has been established for decades and it's so mature that the top five best-selling cars in america for like 30 years running are the ford f-150 and a bunch of other trucks that look like the ford f-150 here's a really great tweet from twitter user and research director brett winton imagine you're trying to break into a hundred billion dollar market segment that is 89 male has stronger brand loyalty than any other segment and doesn't give a about your eco-friendly bonafides that is where tesla is the point being it's a it's a market that's not only super mature but it's super locked in there are literally millions of people that buy a ford f-150 then five years later buy another ford f-150 and then six seven years later buy another ford f-150 and so if you come out with a new tesla pickup truck that looks kind of just like the ford f-150 and instead of an engine it has a battery and some motors and a tesla logo on it they're not going to buy it just like they didn't buy the other competition that kind of looks like it they're just going to buy another f-150 so after opening a presentation with a whole monologue about how pickup trucks have all looked the same forever which is totally true they leaned hard into a completely different look and never looked back this is why i'm pretty sure next to model y the cyber truck could end up being the most important vehicle tesla makes and in this tech world possibly the most disruptive but yeah in these two days it's grown on me a bit and in the two years between now and when they're actually into production and start to ship the thing it'll be growing on other people too as i'm recording this elon tweeted 146 000 cyber truck orders so far these are from people who didn't even wait for it to grow on them it's they just liked it already i still don't think it's pretty it's definitely not it's more brutalist but i don't think other pickup trucks are pretty either it just had to be different and i am here for its position as a disrupter and i guess i'm finally starting to embrace my position as a tech reviewer where as this is sort of a piece of tech i'm on the bleeding edge of this stuff and i'm investigating it just to figure out if it's good so i ordered one well i put i put down my 100 refundable deposit that holds my place in line i can turn into an order when they finally do go into production but i'm in line for a triple motor cyber truck i'm all in so i'm looking forward to testing this thing and we'll see how it goes hopefully it's on time along with the other stuff that we're expecting in the next two years but that's pretty much it also if you want to get in on this merch there's a couple days left of it to get ordered where it will ship before the holidays i think nine days left so link below to that as well i think that's it okay thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music] you
