hey what is up guys I'm could be HD here and welcome to another video I'm sure you've already been aware that the smart speaker market has been heating up a lot over the past couple months and year and a half so we got Google assistant in the form of Google home in that smart speaker and we got series smart assistant in a home pod but today we have a bit of an exclusive for you guys our first look at samsung smart assistant in the form of a Bixby home the Bixby smart speaker so we're gonna give it a shot we already know I mean Samsung's been doing great with hardware especially on their phones we kind of just give them that they're top-notch but it's the software where we start to have some questions you know Bixby you probably saw that virtual assistant comparison video didn't do so hot but it's been a couple months there's been some updates so let's give this another shot so the box is pretty simple pretty inviting I feel like in this day and age if you're gonna be putting a smart speaker in someone's house you kind of have to make it inviting to not have them freak out about it but if we take it out it looks pretty good we got some some Bixby blue these blue accents but uh it's nice and dense it's weighted it's pretty clean honestly it looks like a pretty good smart speaker there's are these buttons at the top and they're blue I guess there's no screen kind of like Google assistant or home pod they all have that little screen at the top but you don't really use that when you're across the room so that's not I'm not taking points off for that so we've got to get past this beautiful hardware and see if if Bixby is all about it because that's what makes or breaks a smart speaker if the assistant actually does its job so uh hey Bixby what's your name my name is Bigsby okay so I mean that's I said the name in the question but that's cool it got it all right hey Bixby what's the weather the weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity okay technically correct but I was more looking for like the weather here right now hey Bixby what's the weather in New York City right now it is currently 50 degrees in cloudy in New York City okay so you've got to be a little more specific but it gets it right so that's that's the simple default question of the weather so basically we know there's a long list of things that can probably do like set a timer I look up information on Google we kind of wanted to be able to do also the more novel things like answering more random questions Google uses the knowledge graph so hey Bixby how far away is the moon far far away yeah I think most would have most would have given an answer in like miles/hour kilometers or something but you're not wrong Bixby you're not wrong I don't know most of them can tell jokes so uh hey Bixby tell me a joke knock knock who's there aren't you glad I didn't say banana haha you kind of forgot half of that they don't all have to have good jokes that's that's not a big deal that that's a missing feature um okay so you know that's Siri like what they think of Google and vice versa hey Bixby what do you think of Siri dad okay at least hey the mute switch is very responsive I think it's a play button it's still gone okay maybe something a little less triggering for you Bixby uh hey Bixby just do a trick okay pick a number between one and two okay is your number one no actually okay now that's started going out ho for a second but I think Bixby home can still redeem itself as a legitimate smart speaker cuz it's still it's able to answer questions right so I have a press release from Samsung here says they've interestingly built in a fail-safe to make sure it definitely answers complex questions which I mean that's what it comes down to we're asking a jokes and stuff but it can still save itself so hey Bixby what's 37 times the square root of 94 that's a tough one okay Google what is 37 times the square root of 94 that's that's cheating fifty eight point seven two eight that's that's cheating no it's not alright maybe uh maybe we asked a little too much of it maybe just a phone call maybe that's that's the simple hey Bixby call Mandy okay playin call me maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen stop no stop all right this is something home pod can do this is something Google assistant can do hey Bixby turn the studio light blue okay playing blue by Eiffel 65 sorry for getting both of those songs stuck in your head today okay I at this point I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out if it's really a smart speaker like if there's if there's anything this does better than home pod or Google assistant that would be great I think the one thing Samsung mentioned is it has a removable cable which you know that's good it's kind of hard actually okay that's not that was mmm they thought about it they tried they tried that's what it comes down to Samsung tried they they wanted to make it a little more portable than Google home and home pod so if you manage to remove the speaker correctly it has built-in battery and they push the limits with this battery it's gonna be sitting around on a countertop for a lot so they said they put in a sixty thousand milliamp hour battery which is pretty massive pushing the limits for a small form-factor like this so ideally it should be able to last up to Oh [Music] okay this is a hopefully you guys by now know this April Fool's Day this is your yearly reminder not to take anything you read or watch too seriously I mean if they made a smart speaker and totally better than this right for sure anyway catch you guys the next one peace you
