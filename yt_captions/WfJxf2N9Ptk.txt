ladies and gentlemen the final major chess event of 2023 is over the world Blitz Championship concluded today the open and the women's we have Champions and in this video I'm going to take you through an incredible day of games filled with action filled with drama as always and a friendly reminder that if you never took advantage of the holiday sale of my courses you still got got a couple of days left cuz there's a New Year's resolution you can make to yourself uh on improving your chess all courses are 40% off that's all I have to say I am the sponsor of today's video folks it's round number 13 it is the second day of action at the world Blitz we have to play a bunch more games and we're going to start with Magnus Carlson versus Maxim VRA now you might remember yesterday dubov and neppo double forfeit that was a major story a double forfeit in the world Blitz championship for putting the game of chess into disrespe as they were called well Maxim vagra a world Blitz champion in his own right from several years ago this is always a very interesting matchup we're going to get day two underway Magnus opening up with his favorite opening this is the sveshnikov Sicilian we haven't seen Magnus get a sveshnikov sicilian on the board in a long time cuz it's this true and tried weapon most people when they see Magnus play this they play Bishop to B five that's called the Rosal Lio they try to take Magnus out of a place of comfort but instead of that Maxim plays directly into an open Spanish Knight D5 takes takes this line has been played many many times many times the world the world championship match between Fabiano Carana and Magnus Carlson in 2018 that had all of about 250 Spectators because nobody watched chess in 2018 of course I am joking but none of you probably followed that match a good amount of you some of you watched chess 5 years ago some of you weren't even born 5 years ago some of you have the mental maturity of somebody who wasn't born 5 years ago okay now that we've gotten the early video insults out of the way uh let's proceed with this game in this type of sveshnikov setup generally Magnus attacks with his enf pawns and he kind of allows the queen side to to just stand still now this approach by mvl is clearly clearly something that he has prepared because nobody just bulldozes into a position like this grabbing a pawn and not developing their pieces Magnus plays Bishop D7 and queen C8 but mvl at the end of the day does just have an extra Pawn now he plays Rook A3 Magnus gets rid of the Knight so it doesn't control the C7 Square anymore and tries to trade off some of Maxim's pieces Maxim plays takes takes finally castles and now safeguards his Queen side with C4 and basically says look Magnus you're Magnus but I'm mvl and I have three initials in my name so it's cool also I'm up upon King F1 Magnus plays E4 creating counterplay Maxim says what about a queen trade how are are you going to beat me when we trade queens and Magnus plays Knight D3 oh oh he sacrificed The Rook this man just sacrificed the full rook in an end game to just get this this man Maxim gives up a rook for a knight down 40 seconds on the clock and he basically says Magnus my Bishop is better than any of these Rooks you can't use your pawns your your Rook can't get to the E file unless it does this little three-point turn in a parking lot and then I'm just going to push the rest of my pawns so what does Magnus do exactly that he puts his Rook on the E file in the meantime Maxim got his Pawn back so he has a bishop in two pawns and he Maxim courageously goes for a rook versus Bishop endgame because he's correct this is winning this is an end game where there is nothing that Magnus can do F4 E4 he tries to create counterplay with his Rook it's not good enough Here Comes A6 the last line of defense has been stripped here come the pawns Maxim's pawns are faster oh my goodness Maxim vrav has defeated the best endgame player of all time by sacrificing a rook for a knight for a beautiful technical conversion it's oh this is crazy this is the drama that we didn't the first game of the day they started a little bit early on day two that's that chess tournaments always do that they always start the last day of the event a little bit early uh cuz I guess people have to like travel home or the organizers don't want to stay late or maybe the hotel fees are expensive this is just game over because by the time the black king makes it here I'll just move my Bishop but by then I'll also Queen so I'm too fast what an end game what a technical conversion a beautiful sophisticated Rook Sacrifice from one of the best Blitz players in the world Maxim shrav Magnus lost his first loss he played 25 26 games of Chess now at this point something funny happened all right I am as guilty as the next person I I am perhaps the most guilty of farming Magnus for Content farming milking as the youngans in the comment section say milking the cow for Content but they followed Magnus to a [Music] lake they Magnus went for a while by the lake after his lost now I don't think this is chess 24's video I think somebody must have recorded maybe it was chess Bas India cuz chess Bas India is on site they are doing an excellent job covering the event they have a ton of live boards um I would never follow Magnus to a lake after a loss like I I can't I don't have the social anxiety for that like I can't they're just filming him like an animal walking in a zoo but this is pretty cool on a serious note I wonder what he's listening to also how close is he to the Lake like could somebody just tip him in with like a finger hilarious anyway they record Magnus you know Gathering himself and there was comments here that were like he's about to go cook this is crazy um and um no it's cool it's cool to have footage like this I I could never though somebody else has to do it I I you know I I'll put him up in YouTube videos and you guys will watch videos that of Magnus playing but Magnus lost crazy will he be able to bounce back or will guys like uh artv guys like dubov guys like nepo are they going to make a run well they are winning their games here and there it's a big race of folks at the top Magnus comes back he plays against Alexis SRA he plays a sideline of the Sicilian plays Bishop to E2 all right then later he plays kind of a more open Sicilian now we're sort of in a knorf bishop B7 Bishop F3 Magnus attacks the queen side gets his Rook into the the game targets the bishop on B7 SRA defends the bishop on B7 Magnus Carlson inspired by the actions of the Frenchman with three names sacrifices The Rook bulldozes the center of the board with E5 and now before he takes the Knight zishan Zug gives a check forces a defensive move and then knowing that he's about to lose his Knight not just the vishin Zug in this position Magnus Carlson play a Desperado sacrifice Knight takes E6 his logic was I'm going to lose my knight anyway so I should sacrifice it to open up my opponent's position and then I'm going to get the the the Knight back and before I do that I'm going to throw in a check for good measure because if G6 I'll take and I'll threaten the rook and I can't get taken because of the pin oh my God that walk on the leg just inspired a Madman SRA down to 40 seconds Magnus taking all the things SRA has ever worked for the king is trying to desperately run to safety actually eventually the advantage almost Slips Away according to the computer but black is always under pressure in this position SRA does a ridiculous job by the way of fighting back with 10 seconds on the clock cuz every player here is good every player here is a monster uh but then Magnus look at this bishop to G5 check discovered attack on The Rook gets The Rook back and Black's King just never gets comfortable with 5 Seconds on the clock you are destined to lose this game and he does Bishop to C6 apparently he crawled all the way back back he should have been a little bit more patient maybe Queen B6 covering the A7 score even taking on B2 by the computer was okay Magnus comes back from the lake rejuvenated all right he wins that game um now he's playing against arjunic iy E4 C5 Knight F3 E6 Magnus playing a different way against the Sicilian now now he's playing like a king's Indian attack Bishop G2 Bishop E7 castles Queen C7 A4 taking a little bit of space away on the queen Side ER guys see playing also just a very patient game maneuvering the Knight back to H7 Magnus Knight F1 H4 this is the typical attacking pattern in the Kings Indian attack you wrap around the Knight like this black needs to create queenside counterplay or he's going to get demolished all right here comes black with queenside counterplay Knight B4 and D4 Magnus comes back to attack the Knight Rook d8 B3 Bishop to B7 Magnus takes he takes to alleviate some of the pressure and so the pawns can't actually do any damage now he needs to defend his pawn and then he's going to potentially continue the attack or put the Knight on C4 put the Knight on e4 trade the Bishops what are we going to get okay there we go we have a trade the Knight is going to the queen side there it is we defend the pawn Argin I to creating counterplay with the only Pawn that he has Magnus Zips around continues to fight for the light squares with Queen F3 King G8 Arjun has no problems it's a very solid position but it's still very much a maneuvering game okay we have the entirety of the a file and Ari's got 40 seconds there goes G4 we're creating pressure on all the sides of the board F6 but now knight4 adding more pressure AR's time ticking below 30 seconds Magnus trades away the night very good decision why close position two pawns on the dark squares by playing like this black is going to really struggle to get his pieces into the game now he's going for an end game ery down to less than 20 seconds he loses a pawn his Bishop is still garbage and now we sack the queen because we get it right back and we have a rook and Knight end game versus rook and Bishop with an extra Pawn with extra 30 34 seconds on the clock and the added bonus of being named Magnus Carlson we are now up two Pawns in an end game D4 we're only up one now but we're coming in now what's funny is that you know the evaluation here is like like throughout this point was like plus one and a half plus two the computer was screaming for certain ways of converting but Magnus does it his own way does it like this Rook B6 Rook C6 oops oops right apparently it was better to go Rook B7 Blitz is just about playing on Instinct and playing on feel and uh apparently this is+ 12 this is plus 37 plus 36 uh it says plus 35 but it's plus 35 and a half and I'm rounding up instead of all of that Magnus finds a way look G6 first is apparently winning and then you have to play Rook G1 here but instead of that Rook f8 a very very a stressful game but Magnus oh my goodness what is going on it's equal again it's equal what Knight D4 and then Magnus finds a way to Win It by still oh my goodness oh my goodness oh that was crazy there was like m in the evaluation so many times it was over it was completely over you just I mean you you had to seal the door I guess Magnus didn't didn't didn't see a away after Rook C8 but there's G7 Rook f8 or something I mean and it's it's just wild 40 seconds versus 10 he was trying to bury Ari credit to Ari who was getting his way out of the end game so many times I mean there we could analyze all of this we could analyze all the drawing mechanisms it's night and three versus Rook like it's very hard to draw this with 5 Seconds on the clock but the computer seems to think it's drawable which is kind of nuts but Magnus wins again now popping into the women's section for a second all right we have cuk and we have Gina yesterday we had Alexander we had uh Valentina gun running away with the event already a massive lead cost caught up she got very very close and in the 15th round of the event because they have 17 rounds uh G uh lost she lost the game I think they have 17 rounds I never know cuz they they they don't do the same the men have 21 it's technically not even the men it's like the open section but I'm not even sure there is a woman playing in the open it's really weird I got to double check this but some of you ask in the comment section about this it's a very it's a subject for a very long video that I probably will do at some point but you know um anyway uh for now let's focus on what we have and things that we not not on things we can't really control or have all the answers to point is there are 17 rounds for some reason uh and uh yesterday Gana was crushing but in the 15th round uh Gina lost and because Gana lost it allowed kostuk to catch up she was very close she was half a point away and it came down to the final round literally so if cuk wins and Gina doesn't kostuk might win the world Blitz or we go to a tie break so we have a caroan we have a tarow very very popular opening nowadays especially this line with Knight a six and black rerouting the Knight like this Knight E2 the Knight goes to C7 black plays like this developing the Knight via C7 potentially to attack the queen side potentially to get back into the center F3 Bishop H5 black plays Bishop G6 and puts the Rook on E8 it's a very very balanced game Bishop F5 Bishop E6 she really wants to trade the bishop white says no now black puts a bunch of Pawns on light on the sixth rank just kind of like this playing like this tucking the elbows looking for a fight F5 Bishop goes back but but how are you gonna how are you gonna actually win this game it's a very standard tar toow which is really really solid but okay C4 and now cuk decides she's had enough and in this position plays H5 and starts attacking her opponent with the pawn of her own King Rook E7 slides the queen to F4 taking a little bit more space away from her opponent the East the D5 Square looks really good we trade we put the bishop on E6 we put the Knight on D5 whose Knight is better both Knights have Outpost in their opponent's position Rook D7 Rook E7 we're repositioning we're preparing Bishop D7 white advancing on the queen side we trade the Queens we have rookie one check forcing out the king look at the time though look at the time the time is definitely on cuk side with black knight E7 white is still trying to break through on the queen side very desperate situation Rook A2 eight seconds remaining 16 for black T Bishop D1 Knight C3 white is completely solid she takes on B5 Rook A2 but and the pawn is a runaway but black is going to get back in time the bishop is either going to get back or the Knight is going to get back Knight D3 and Black's Pawn makes it Black's Pawn is the one that crosses the center line black is now a piece up and she's got to convert this game without losing on time she will Alexandra cost UK a very tense end game middle game and end game in the caroan she wins she wins her game which means it all comes down to gunina if gunina wins this game she is the world champion of Blitz if she loses costen is the world champion of Blitz if she draws I think they play a tie break maybe they do play a tiebreak takes takes queen king D2 Bishop C4 H4 H5 this is a grinfield it's a very very balanced position Knight A5 Bishop slides back Bishop goes to E6 Knight is trying to come to C4 white advances taking space away very engine like all right very very like Alpha zero like idea Knight G5 Bishop C4 Knight hits the bishop the bishop goes back to the corner white is making steady progress here with the king the king is brave and now the Rooks are going to come over here to put pressure on the queen side black tries to fight back but white is advancing white is advancing into the black position Rook C look at this excellent control this bishop is kind of a non-factor which is why we love putting that Bishop in the corner like that G4 that Bishop is going to perish in the corner D D5 taking all the space away now black has to kind of commit pawns back but white is just ruthless Gina walks all of her opponents down like the Terminator look at this Rook C2 Rook F1 taking the file black has absolutely no moves remaining Rook G5 is basically mate you go here and this is going to be m a couple of moves the bishop comes to sacrifice itself for the defense there is nothing to be done look at this absolutely ruthless domination of the black position every piece defended not the pawn on H6 but it's Untouchable because then this leads to a mate on H2 Bishop F6 takes takes Valentina gunina wins the last game like the Terminator walking down her opponent excellent game and uh she wins Alexandra cuk the runner up by half a point in the women's I will show you the final standings in a moment my friends there was crazy games going on all over Magnus goes on a winning streak meanwhile dubov and artv are also cooking it up in the kitchen shakar mamara versus artv this is a massive game now what what do we know about mamaro my man always is ready to throw down G4 playing in a Gambit style coming straight at artv artv says you know what if you're going to attack me on this side well I guess I'm going to have to go the other way I'm going to Castle queenside or Tam have one of the most technical players in the game what of the most methodical strategic guys in the game he's very very very good very good Defender very patient player King B1 King B8 takes takes rookie one Bishop to B4 now how is mamaro going to create some chaos midaro always looking for a battle somehow Knight E4 all right DC Knight takes artv is a simple man you give him Knight for Bishop he's going to take it he's also got the connected pawns but he's down 30 seconds Queen F6 he grabs the Knight he knows this is not the best move but he's a technical player and he goes to an end game with white having damage pawns because even though he has eight seconds on the clock that is all he needs to work with rookie eight myar of pinning H4 but it's all he needs to work with now watch as he just the same way as Gina did it in a tactical way watch as artv walks down his opponent gives up the bishop for the Knight what why would he do that for Simplicity the bishop is better than the knight in the long run but he grabs a pawn he wins a pawn yes it gives white the opportunity to maybe Advance which is exactly what mamaro is going to do and now the computer doesn't even like Black's position as much as it did but it's simplicity it's just simp it's a matter of Simplicity and it allows artm to play with less than 10 seconds on the clock my friends how long is art at 10 seconds since like the literally since the 22nd move of the game artf has had 6 seconds on the clock and he completely out Maneuvers a 2750 rated opponent that's his Blitz rating King B3 Rook D2 artmia is just straight about playing the guy with 10 seconds remaining he gets 2 seconds bonus every time he makes a move patience patience Knight C4 and now boom rookie four played with 5 Seconds on the clock sacrifices to get a check pick up this and it's over E7 I was going to say E7 Knight D6 or Rook h8 or King D7 what a game from artf clutch ice water in his veins after 16 rounds of action artf leads the event he leads the event he's half a point ahead of Magnus dubov where's my man dubov dubov is half a point ahead of Magnus as well uh half a point he's very close to Magnus he's half a point behind but the man who walked by the lake Magnus Carlson playing against Serbian Grandmaster Alexander indic plays a NSO plays a solid NSO you know typical Magnus all right solid opening let's see tries to open up the position play C4 look at indich F4 very nice position but these Bishops looking a little bit sus as the kids say Rook B8 wait what isn't that a fork yeah that is a fork what what it well the idea I guess is this if you take I take with check and then I get into your position all of this is weak and these pieces suck but it just straight up looks like Magnus hung a fork nope Rook A2 yo Magnus is still trying to hang the fork okay he still hung it but now at least Queen E3 is a okay now this is a real Fork so he stops it but this move is an indication that the position's about to open and Magnus gets his Knight in just grabs a Pawn on the edge of the board and drives the knight in in a matter of like five moves they went from 139 119 to White having eight seconds on the clock five moves four moves this is move 17 this is move 21 Magnus freezes you in his tracks Knight takes Queen E6 Queen F5 take the light squares stop G4 paralyze your opponent's pieces boom boom boom boom discovered attack on The Rook hits the Queen the game is over you take I take clean up rook B2 Queen D2 two latter mate is coming mate on all of these squares might be possible if you give it them up Magnus wins again oh my oh my Magnus is a man on a mission he just won again that was all after losing the first game of the day now danil dubov Fabiano Carana E4 E5 Knight F3 Knight C6 all right we have a solid game to start rookie one A4 Fabiano if he wins this game is in the running for first if dubov wins this game he is in the running for first it's a big maneuvering battle D4 Knight takes but whoa sacrificing a bishop is Fabby trying to get the Knight back the bishop drops all the way back he's just the pawn up he's just the pawn up dubov and now he he's grabbing a second Pawn dubov invited him in whoa he grabs a pawn and then he sacks the Knight because Queen E6 rookie four so dubov sacrifices The Rook Desperate Times Desperate Measures he's just trying to attack this this this this as you can sell from stockfish it is not impressed Fabiano Carana is about to join the top three Knight takes f8 courageous move if black gets two moves in a row it's mate but it's chess you don't get two moves in a row Queen H3 I have this Inc rible night check deflecting your night you have to spend time and in that time I grab a very important Pawn which prevents you from making much forward progress you can play Knight H4 but then I will check you and that is exactly what happens but how do I stop this and this oh my God how do I stop that there's only one way if the evaluation is plus 4 and A2 but there's only one move to find it and you have 12 seconds remaining is it really plus 4 and a half because Fabiano doesn't find it the best move is Rook to d8 because what after you sacrifice that's M nope the Knight is in the way what the idea is to stop the bishop blocking the king so you can go check King H7 Queen E4 with check if the King goes back you have check here and the same pattern and then you go mate and if Queen E4 and let's say black plays G6 Queen B7 the bishop stops the escape and Rook E8 is going to be mate oh but instead of that Fabiano sacks the queen and gets the Knight and now it's a draw but it's a very difficult draw because dub off's Queen and Bishop are very very very angry Queen C2 King F1 and all of a sudden White's defenses crumble Fabiano panics Rook B5 oh my goodness he's giving Jackson here Fabiano has to move his F Pawn so that Queen D1 he has King F2 but he loses that's the final move of the game King to G8 and I'm willing to bet Fabiano lost on time he didn't have a check he he was struggling to find a move maybe he resigned and then see the F Pawn can move but I'm pretty sure Fabiano lost on time cuz Queen D1 is coming and you can't move any of these pieces but F3 and it's very unpleasant it's a very unpleasant position but it's not completely lost and danal dubov catches the leaders he catches the leaders so it all comes down to the performance of a certain Magnus Carlson as always if magnus's clutch he's going to take the lead and hang on to it he's playing Yu yangi I mean he plays some crazy silent I've never seen this in my H3 never ever ever seen this in my life I got to look this up after C4 playing into a sideline against yuang yuang trying to fight back against the center Magnus takes the center Knight E5 very nice idea he's a pawn up by the way Knight oo says y yangi you want my you want the pawn so bad you got to give up the bishop yep give up the bishop castles D5 holding on to the center Knight takes D5 Magnus says Bishops versus Knights who's going win Bishop F4 let's trade the Queens let's trade the Queens let's trade everything now I have a pawn two squares away from queening indefinitely it's going to be a headache for you Rook D1 Rook d8 Rook D4 A4 is he going to sack The Rook he's not going to sack The Rook he's not going to sack The Rook not yet first he needs to pry away the defenses from the black position and Yu yangi blunders he thinks all of this is solid but all Magnus needed was to open up that side of the board because after takes takes he has C7 and the game is over the game is over because normally you go here and you win but Rook D1 back rank mate Rook d8 is a threat so instead of that we have Rook f8 Bishop B7 you can't stop the promotion if you go back I take and then I get in so Yu yangang Tri to use his pawns C8 Queen he's Magnus freaking Carlson you think he's scared of a couple of Pawns Rook A5 the bishop Cuts everything Rook C5 he's just too fast his King is way too fast all those pawns are like potato chips B3 he grabs one and Yu yangi resigns because he's not going to be able to push the other pawns through what a game from Magnus here we go we're going to keep it moving by the way that's all in a row let's watch with black E4 E5 against young shishov dudo one of the best players in the world Bishop E7 he plays the dubov that's the dubov line right excuse me the dubov line sorry I don't watch a lot of games with black that's correction the dubov line is against the Italian this is just the mainline Spanish my mouth move faster than my brain but in the Italian with the bishop on C4 dubov likes to play Bishop B7 Magnus has worked with dubov in the past hence that's where my brain went that was a very stupid thing to say and I apologize consider this my YouTuber apology Mainline Spanish damn it anti marshal loves to play D5 right he loves to play D5 so how's he going to get this one done B4 okay Duda trying to to limit him but now we see Magnus pointing his Bishop at his opponent's king side H6 let's trade the Bishops all right Bishop is still okay you want to trade that's pretty lame Yan but we can do that now okay I'm still going to create an attack let's trade the Queens funny stuff here by the way you could go here here but instead of that he's trying to do this but he plays King F1 and now instead of taking the Knight we desper tonight to damage our opponent structure so we both have damage pawns but I'm going for this and I'm going for the defile so what are we going to do king F7 Rook Rook trade it's a rook and night end game and I'm I want the I want the a pawn there it is B3 I'm going to get it I'm going to there it is I'm going to get it the position collapses Magnus Carlson has a two-minute time Advantage he has 154 to 5 Seconds how does this man make this so easy the outside pass Pawn is going to be a menace the computer thinks this position is defendable the computer is not youngish of Duda weak pawns two connected passers the king is going to walk over stockfish can defend this position but JKD ain't stockfish he's a human being right with a nervous what just happened how did that well as it so happens JKD is stockfish he's defending this position against Magnus it's a complete draw now it's a complete it's a complete draw there's there's nothing to play for total draw King all right magna's going to do his best but he's not no no no he's going to he's going to draw this game yeah that was C whoa It's Blitz it's Blitz and just like in the Ari game just like in the arigi game sometimes the plot twists are kept until the very end and Magnus wins a t unpredictable but fifth game in a row and this is the final game of today's recap it is Magnus versus report it is a French defense Magnus trying to slow down the explosive nature of his opponent report always looking for complications and an interesting battle Magnus says I don't want any of that let's play an exchange French let's let report tries to create a fight in a position where there might not be a fight warranted let's get the Knight for the bishop just like I did against Yu yangi let's keep it slow keep it nice and chill nice and easy report goes back cuz he's like I got to guard my Pawn wa my Pawn is hanging so he goes back Queen D7 Magnus maneuver Magnus wins the pawn anyway Magnus wins the pawn anyway rookie one and then just says look man I'm I'm I'm just Pawn up I'm just up a pawn I got six pawns you got five that's it you going to defend this position Queen E6 good luck queen and Rook endgame here we go G3 King G2 F3 and a lot of tactics are flying all over the board but Queen C2 is just game over Queen D4 trade the Queens winning Pawn end game there it is two pawns up two pawns up we pushing we pushing P actually it's pushing D pause King goes out Queen B7 D7 it's over there is no Perpetual check this is promotion it takes 57 moves Magnus Carlson wins a six game in a row and that is all she wrote Our tamv and dubal were close but no cigar and my friends these are your standings Magnus Carlson wins his 17th World title with 16 out of 21 he lost one game in 34 games of Chess over five days he only lost to MBL and then he won six in a row that is what we call greatest of all time stuff he loses a game wins six games in a row makes a couple of draws along the way how about this for a sleeper story danial dubov would have tied Magnus for first place if he didn't make a gimmick draw against Yan pishi dubov lost half a point that's crazy he would have had 16 points vladislav artv in third with the bronze mvl Standalone fourth 14 and a half very very close and on the women's side of things vitina a half a point 14 to 13 and a half and then it wasn't even close it was a point after that a point after that and they crushed the women's side folks it's over Magnus Carlson rapid and Blitz Champion backto back years best in the world he doesn't have to be the classical world champion best in the world this was fun this was fun I hope you enjoyed these Recaps tomorrow we will continue with our regularly scheduled programming get out of here
