hello for this series on creating a simple role-playing game I've teamed up with fellow tutorial creator Rocky's hello one making an RPG in unity might seem like a pretty big challenge I produce often both system and content heavy however in this series we will try to boil it down to a few key subjects that are central for almost any RPG and to keep things simple we've split the videos up into two categories gameplay and graphics I'll be handing the gameplay side here we'll learn how to create stuff like player and camera movement interactable and items an inventory system equipment character stats enemy AI and combat on the classic side of things I'll be showing how to model rig and animate a simple character in blender complete with a basic set of equipment I'll also be showing how to take these classical elements and integrate them with the gameplay so in those integration episodes we'll be writing code to trigger the correct animations as well as to interface with Rocky's equipment system to have the equipment graphics actually show up on the character and animate correctly along with them now since some of you may be interested exclusively in the coding side of things or others perhaps exclusively in the graphics the series will be split into separate gameplay and graphics playlists the gameplay playlists will of course contain all of brackets coding videos as well as my videos on integrating the graphics with the code while the graphics playlist will just contain my blender videos the first blender video will be out in a couple of hours and the first programming episodes should be available in brackish channel in just a few days so be sure to subscribe there if you're not already alright until then Cheers
