ladies and gentlemen I've got a very fun piece of Chess content for you today over the last few years the world of Chess has been struck by a very sensitive subject that brings about quite a lot of debate and that subject is cheating cheating at the highest level of Chess is a problem it poses an existential threat to the game but since chess has grown so much over the last few years cheating naturally will occur more and more because it's a game that really challenges us intellectually spiritually emotionally it makes people feel a certain type of way when they win and lose and I have a playlist here on YouTube of catching cheaters now yesterday I had a subscriber email me uh this subscriber is named Justin Justin sent me a game where he played against the cheater and then the cheater tried to play on his own past a certain point and he really shouldn't have done that very very very bad mistake now I'm going to show you in this video several games that that cheater played on chess.com they are absolutely hysterical remember couple of things determine whether or not a person is cheating uh brand new account massive win rate consistent time management massive level of play difference between the high and the low etc etc now let's jump into uh this video because the the this is this is really really really funny stuff so we're going to kick things off here by showing you some of the games that this cheater played uh when they were on their own so the cheater was trying to you know mix in a little bit of their own chess uh with uh with with with the use of stockfish and it was very very funny now normally I don't just make fun of people um but if you're going to cheat I'm going I'm going to make fun of you so Zack rated 1850 played against the cheater uh cheater played Knight F6 Knight C3 E6 E4 this is actually known as a an English opening MOS Carl variation white tries to play E5 very quickly uh attacking the knight in the center of the board now around this time the cheater was either playing completely on their own like from the very beginning of the game or they were cheating you know for the first like five moves like they were just cheating the opening and that way they were not getting totally losing positions in the opening they played D5 uh Zach played here attacking the Knight the Knight went back to D7 so far so good so far so good Pawn takes now Knight takes E5 is the best move uh D4 and now Knight G6 so like I said cheater would basically kind of get out into the opening get into an equal position and then would try to play by themselves so we would get Pawn takes Bishop takes so far so good now white plays Bishop D3 okay now here there's a lot of moves for black uh the best moves are Bishop E7 maybe Knight C6 maybe C6 preventing the pawn from coming to D5 but all of these moves just generally want to develop a piece now I actually think that the cheater I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to have a hot take I think the cheater cheated all seven moves of this game so based on what I've seen from their openings this is this was all cheating and then and and you can also look at the time management I mean it's a little bit tough to to tell because they're getting 10 seconds at it every every single time they make a move uh but this is now the first move that the cheater doesn't cheat okay seven moves they cheated position is equal now they think and now they play a move they don't cheat you ready just look at the eval bar just yeah uh White set a trap white set a trap White's trap was no longer defending the pawn with the queen but you cannot take this because your queen is hanging if I give you a check and white played Bishop B5 check and black resigned so this is what this is this is who we are dealing with uh you cannot guard the queen you can't guard the queen and the King Knight C6 you're pinned so I would just take the queen for free um yeah GG this is who we're dealing with right and and there were so many more of these games I found a game here uh cheater played against somebody named Benjamin right and and by the way actually similar you know similar opening Knight F6 E6 black play C5 this actually called the bonon defense D5 now black played B6 that's not really a move uh in this opening uh Bishop B7 because now white gets the entire Center in this particular game I actually think the cheater uh did not cheat like from the very beginning I I I think here they tried to play on their own and I know that because this is what happened uh they got themselves into a completely lost position in seven moves completely swarmed in the center uh White is just going to play E5 Bishop F4 like black can't develop with this massive wedge Bishop G5 which is a bad move now black plays H6 Bishop takes now Queen takes E5 and this move they made on their own they went back to d8 White went Bishop D3 black went Knight C6 now Knight B5 okay the threat of Knight B5 is to play Knight to C7 right the only way to deal with that threat is to play Rook C8 it's the only way you got to play Rook C8 you got to sacrifice your Rook but at least you get a pawn and you are attacking this and you're not completely lost in fact you are equal your opponent plays Knight B5 they're trying to play Knight C7 so naturally given the fact that you are a chess player playing a 2000 right you are playing a 2,000 now this person basically made a chess.com account cheated for a few games and immediately got their rating really high cuz when you make a new chess account your rating goes up and down by huge margins cuz they don't know how good you are uh so that's what happened there uh instead they went A6 and lost the queen and resigned so that is now two games that we have seen where they have lost the queen right chess is hard look chess is hard if you're watching this as a beginner and you think I'm laughing at beginner mistakes I am only because this person would then proceed to boot up and cheating like a 100 games all right don't cheat you don't even realize how silly you look okay now the opponent played Knight B5 trying to go here and black played A6 invited the knight in and it's basically mate you have to sack the queen so black resigns all right there's more more there's so many more games that ended I mean this game ended in literally eight moves all right E4 E5 this was a Spanish all right our cheater played Knight F6 played pretty normally open Spanish Knight takes E4 so far so good D5 that's not the best move because black because now there's Knight takes E5 now the best move here on Knight takes E5 is actually a really aggressive Bishop D6 what you're supposed to do after Rook E1 uh actually in general general what you're supposed to do here is you're supposed to put the bishop back play B5 Bishop B3 and then take on e4 uh yeah our cheater just went here and gets hit with Knight takes C6 and resigns in eight moves because they did not realize they are pinned so that's a huge threat and after Queen E7 Knight C6 you cannot take back because you are forked cheetah resigns in eight moves this is this is who we're dealing with there's another game this this one was really funny cheer opened up with a with a scotch opening and then develop all the pieces and okay didn't get mated didn't get mated uh Bishop to F what it was equal one move they played on their own they just hung a bishop in one move and resigned yeah yeah that'll do it that'll do it I've got one more for you I've got one more for you um this was uh this was a fun one this was a kingspawn game this one actually went a little bit longer this one was a a pretty aggressive mutually counterattacking game black played Bishop E7 and um in this game black actually started out with a with a with a pretty you know good Advantage but then decided okay uh from around here they decided I'm going to try to play on my own so they played Bishop F5 now Bishop F5 is not a good move because while it attacks the queen it hangs this Pawn uh then the cheater immediately went back to cheating cheater was like you know what I'm going to I'm actually going to attack black then here now Queen C6 and queen C6 uh threatens the Knight but it doesn't because it's defended by the queen so white just went here and then and then black got a little bit but uh but but was just completely lost and and and got mated uh Rook d8 Rook d8 is mate so when the cheater played for a major chunk of the game on their own they weren't very good which is why for most of the games they just cheated they cheated from the beginning to the end and they won a lot of games but oh you are not ready for this this game was really funny so Justin is going to be last the Justin game is absolutely hysterical but our cheater realized that if if if they if they cheat for 80% of the game there's still a good chance they win so here's a game where the sheeter played against the lvan dude that's that that that's the official name uh and uh yeah LV and dude played with the uh White pieces and it was Knight C6 it was an Italian it was D3 Bishop C5 it was pretty normal opening cheater uh using the opportunity of the White Knight Retreat to strike back in the center capture here and then play this move A5 okay Knight G5 and now um her black plays a move that no human being plays ever like never in ever ever ever ever and it's one of the top engine moves and the move is Queen E8 and in general like I told you in the beginning you know cheater would would would generally like play moves at a pretty consistent time Pace uh now we kick out this Knight of course uh this is 8 seconds the next move is you know it's about five to n seconds every single move now we play this move Knight H5 Knight G3 we trade Knights of course that's why we put the Knight there and so at this point uh the cheater tried to play a move on their own okay they played 14 moves of an opening completely equal tried to play a move on their own they went Rook A6 again it's sometimes difficult to even tell if it's a cheater or the bot right because Bots play really weird moves but humans play really weird moves but really terrible moves now white played a very natural move which is Bishop C4 now you would think if it was a bot it would go Rook B6 right it would play Rook B6 that's weird but it's something no no uh no the the human just went back and now was completely lost because they just wasted two moves they straight up just wasted two moves uh and now white has a massive attack over here and Bishop takes H6 was played Black went Bishop E7 and white is completely winning white is plus five uh because white is playing like a human white sacrificed the bishop with the intention to open up the king here uh although Queen D2 and Bishop and queen takes his even stronger but in this position white rushed white rushed sacrific the bishop and the cheater was like I'm not losing anymore and now cheats basically the rest of the game like you can kind of see here you know these silly moves and now the cheaters like Oh yay I'm not losing anymore time to cheat the rest of the game and win so this was this was quite instructive uh and only move of course not to get mated Rook h8 that at least could have been found castles top engine move Bishop G4 trying to trade the Knight trying to trade The Rook uh White plays Knight H4 very clever idea by the way with the idea of Knight F5 uh here not wanting to play only top engine moves again this is kind of a smart cheater like not you don't have to play the best move every time right now the third engine move is Rook d8 which is what black plays uh Knight F5 uh Rook F1 now the top engine move is Bishop F6 F3 uh Bishop B6 third move of the engine Knight F5 of course you have to take only move you have to take only move to keep the advantage uh and now black plays the second computer move the top computer move here is Knight E7 but black plays Queen E7 uh White plays Queen E4 black plays the top engine move Queen C5 trying to activate the Queen White gives a check King f8 only move uh take take and now now this is this is how ridiculous this cheater made all of this look Bishop takes F7 that is a very creative move the idea of that move is that the 2000 rated player is sacrificing a bishop to try to get an attack on this King like trying to play something like this it doesn't work but it is a very human idea now if I'm playing with black here this is what I calculate okay I calculate takes Queen G6 or queen H5 then I play like king f8 queen here here there's no more checks then I calculate Queen H5 threatening these two pieces Maybe play King G8 then I'm a little bit worried about Queen G6 but I'm always so I I actually would just take the the bishop because to me I would I would just realize it doesn't work no the top engine move is Queen E3 check King B1 Queen D3 check King A2 and you did all of that because you're going to win The Rook of course you're going to win The Rook because if you take the Rook Queen G8 there's no more checks you win Queen G5 Bishop F6 or even take the bishop or run the king to safety of course that is why we play Queen E3 check duh because we check check we take the Rook that way will never get mated no taking the Rook loses the game to Bishop C4 taking the Rook is not included in the three moves of the engine so black doesn't do it the top computer move was to give this sequence of checks and then take the bishop okay okay all right okay all right Queen G6 King goes back to f8 Rook H1 Bishop G7 and now you trade the queens and uh you sacrifice a pawn to open up the center of the board then you bring your knight then you take the pawns then you effortlessly destroy your opponent and uh you know Rook E5 would be checkmat so white resigned so very fun stuff right now it's time for the game that my subscribers sent me as we can see this person and anybody that cheats does not realize how ridiculous they look even if you cheat as an intermediate player you look ridiculous like we know you're everybody knows you're cheating everybody now of course in the era of so many cheaters people now accuse people that are playing fairly because they don't they don't know how to actually evaluate like how many of you have been accused of cheating in a chess game because you like played an opening you knew very well so you got to trust the people that have played the thousands and thousands of millions of games and also we got to obviously trust uh anti-che software for the most part but um this next game is very funny so Justin rated 2100 one of my subscribers one of maybe just a viewer not a subscriber don't know uh sent me this game and said all right so look E4 E5 KN F39 C6 and the cheater added a new thing to their toolbox they decided to play Bad openings there's a very common cheating technique they play stupid openings like I have played people who cheat and they lose two Pawns in the opening they play like a terrible Gambit and then I get murdered like they just completely kill me so the cheater now is adding this type of stuff to their Arsenal moves like Queen F6 all right obviously not a good move by the traditional sense but if you've got stockfish in your back pocket you're going to be fine so white develops the Knight black plays Bishop C5 now yeah Justin plays the best move which is Knight D5 forcing the queen to go back and play defense uh the cheater is giving is is either playing completely on their own right the cheater is probably like a thousand or something uh is either playing completely on their own or or or uh is just trying to give some handicap now if I'm playing here and I see this bishop I'm going to try to play C3 B4 or C3 D4 although I completely don't hate castling now the cheater tries to trade off the Knight because white arrived there with the Knight and again since I see this bishop the best plan for white is definitely to seize the center I don't like how Justin played D3 it's a little bit slow for my liking but you know we we can sort of see that the advantage of the queen coming out early is now gone Knight takes Bishop takes uh black castles and now Justin does in fact play this move C3 very slow play uh maybe B4 maybe D4 this bishop will come out in the future we're going to find out so Bishop B6 Justin plays a very professional move he plays A4 with the intention of either winning that diagonal uh or just trying to trap the bishop the cheater plays A5 because it is the top computer move and it stops white from playing B4 Justin now again plays a very good move because Justin's 2100 and the position is relatively straightforward you have a lot of options here but Justin plays Knight H4 trying to beat up the queen right because the queen kind of went out a little bit too early also trying to open up this queen for a line of attack uh the cheater plays Queen F6 back so Queen F6 Queen D6 Queen F6 back trying to Target the Knight uh Justin justifies his position no pun intended Queen G4 black plays D6 now the bishop is activated now the queen slides back to G3 white still has an edge because black played a really bad opening but it the thing is a cheater is not going to beat you in a very locked and closed position like this you know cheater is going to beat you on an open board they're going to find a they're going to use the engine to find a tactic they're going to find a sacrifice the engine can't do anything special here because of the opening like black played in a way where you can't really get mobilized but we'll see H6 right now the best move for Justin is to shove the knight in there although that doesn't really look like it has you know any idea so he plays King H1 the idea of King H1 is to unpin your king and play F4 very nice idea for a human I love the idea cheater plays the best move which is removing the Knight and targeting the bishop Justin brings back his Bishop uh and now the cheater trades the bishop because you know the light Square Bishop for black hasn't moved yet so the idea is to trade off the bishop here relieving uh White's position now if I'm playing white I'm I'm I'm trying to get this to happen right so I'm either taking and playing F4 or I'm playing F4 right away Justin plays B3 and now for the first time in the game the computer has a chance to open the board up and try to claim an edge and like I said the the machine is going to try to open the board up as fast as possible so it plays D5 all right it tries to now change the plan from Trading the pieces fully uh and after Pawn takes Knight takes white is under a substantial amount of pressure again if I'm playing white I'll probably play Bishop D2 I generally would not recommend trading off a bishop like this that's just me it is one of the moves accepted by stockfish though and uh now c4 pushes the bishop now before this bishop Retreats the cheater Mak sure to slide in this bishop trying to punish white for making those weaknesses and now this bishop goes back to C6 right the best move for white in this position was to play Bishop takes H6 which Justin should have seen because Justin should have also cheated the idea is that you sacrifice this but you get the bishop here with a strong attack and then you'll win the bishop it's chaos uh Rook B1 and now black is better black is better black has the bishop pair black has the open board it's everything that an engine needs to beat a human or another engine but it's everything an engine needs to beat a human so Justin plays Bishop E3 uh now again remember the cheater is trying to make intermittent moves that are not the top the top computer move here it's not even close is to play Rook d8 the idea is that you don't want to open up your opponent's pieces the idea is that if you get taken you want a rook to plant on that square to put pressure on everything instead the cheater plays the third engine move because they're trying not to get caught cheating this which doesn't make any sense at all but it's the third move of the engine which is why they played it there is no reason to leave the center there is no reason to put the bishop over here there's no reason white plays F4 now now now the cheater goes back to playing the top computer move um and that's actually a very good moment because if they had you know opened up the f file white would have gotten a very powerful attack so instructive here instead of opening up all of these lines for your opponent's pieces the engine keeps the position closed with this move E4 very instructive uh Justin takes because Justin is a human being attacks this bishop not quite because it's protected and now the machine takes over the open file and it's just a matter of time before The Rook arrives on D3 everything is going to start getting taken Justin offers a trade of Rooks uh but unfortunately in trying to relieve the pressure uh there is Bishop to B2 and now that Rook is trapped so you have to trade Rooks and move your Rook away oh no just kidding the machine repeats moves you see cheaters don't even realize what they're doing right this is the top engine move but sometimes the top line of the engine is literally to repeat the position and then put the Rook back on D3 which is what I said and that's what's happening right Justin is getting machined he is getting machined the computer opened up the position got the bishop pair Clos down the board for White Queen F2 the bishop slides out of the way and now those pawns are being hunted and it kind of shows you how when a human weakens their position from a distance the computer will punish them very very very swiftly and it goes from bad to worse right so Bishop B4 played Justin brings this back and why did the Machine by the way wh why did Bishop B4 get played why did you play Bishop because you're trying to take the pawns so Knight F3 you should probably take the pawns any human being would take this Pawn try to take the other pawns but black is cheating so instead of that black plays the top engine move which is giving up this God of a bishop for the Knight you know why you know why the machine did that because White's options are either to pin their own Bishop to the queen or ruin their Pawn structure completely by doubling the F pawns and opening up the king so the machine before it goes to do damage over there gives away its really powerful Bishop because the machine holds no sentimental value stockfish doesn't care like I've got the best Bishop on the board no it's trying to trade and now the lethal part comes in it's not about this at all white decided not to damage the structure now you're going to lose everything so by pinning yourself my queen slides in into the square the bishop allowed entry and that's it and Justin is busted up but this is not the end of the story it's not the end of the story cuz um at a certain point black started cheating uh stopped cheating and as I told you you just got to watch all right Queen TS B7 all right at this point Justin is messaging his opponent Justin sent me a screenshot he was messaging his opponent like bro you got a you got a bot blah blah blah you're going to get banned like all this stuff and you know black plays is rookie one and it's game over I mean it's basically just made now Justin decides to go out with a bang okay if Justin had taken this the game would have just ended all right Justin here decides I got to go out with a bang I'm G to lose I'm probably playing a cheater I'm GNA sack my queen just going to sack my queen I'm not going to resign I'm not going to resign I'm going to force my opponent to play until Checkmate black takes white plays H3 now there's no back R Checkmate Rook takes F1 King H2 fastest way to win this position absolute fastest way you got to get the queen to F4 you got to prevent the king from escaping so you could play Bishop D6 there's a lot of ways now the cheater starts playing on their own so the cheater played all this played the whole game cheated cheated the entire game Watch What Happens Queen takes okay I mean again you don't need to do that just go for the king F5 now not only is it F5 now this is just that's just a direct like any any player above 1200 I mean maybe at 1200 you still have some tunnel vision but like you just just go for the check stop taking all the pawns when you have a material advantage this big just take just give a check okay fine give a check please Bishop D6 Queen F4 no we take the Free Pawn okay now black has to be careful not the stalemate but white still has a lot of Pawns stalemate meaning remember no legal moves for any of the pieces oh oh Justin oh it's duve tail mate Queen F4 also Bishop D6 yeah now you can't even block the put okay fine okay okay all right Queen A2 all right King goes up all right I mean listen there was there was a lot of mates but the cheater is figuring it out all right they are they are figuring it out Rook F2 okay King H4 okay now we're getting really close to a stalemate but just give checks just give checks every move should be a check okay that's very scary but the good news is now now if you find literally any one of these 97 checks you'll be fine okay you didn't find a check but there are still legal moves now it's made now it's just made now King's only Escape Square Queen E2 Queen D5 Queen F7 G six even Rook takes H4 okay good now we're checking nice I love that King F3 ladder mate ladder mate okay that also works I love it beautiful now the king cannot get trapped now the King has to run to the back rank King's got plenty of legal moves and black it was really dumb I mean it was really stupid but in the end uh black got the job done and um stalemated white uh up 20 points of material and proceeded to get banned literally after this game was played
