ladies and gentlemen we have yet another crypto scam that i want to talk to you guys about today we're here in the 10 million dollar studio because i know i know you want the lambo you want the lifestyle but ladies and gentlemen you got to be careful out there because there are wolves out in the crypto dark woods okay you got to be careful now let's go to the board i want to show you what happened today ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host as usual and we're talking about a very sad story okay the these guys came out with a 32 million dollar rug pull it's this d5 100 token okay but the worst part is is well maybe maybe it's not the worst part i i mean they just were honest i'm going to be i'm going to be straight up with you a lot of scams they don't they're not honest uh this one was they linked after they ran away with everyone's funds people put a ton of money into this new token called d5 100 as you can see right here they left a note to everybody on their now defunct web page the web host shut it down so you have to go to an archive to see this they said we scammed you guys and you can't do about it ha ha all you moon boys have been scammed and you can't do about it devson now i'm just gonna be completely transparent with you guys i spent yesterday hunting this person down to no avail i mean there are a lot of uh kind of dead leads all around even a guy got doxxed by somebody thinking that it was this guy it wasn't it was just someone who had forked the github repo it's a long story but the point is is that we have no idea who did this it's a sad story in crypto when you honestly you have these projects get propped up by anonymous developers and people invest in them and they end up getting absolutely screwed look at this what are you gonna do i mean in some ways it i hate to say it but he's right i mean what are you gonna do we have no idea who this was it was an anonymous uh developer from the start and yet people ran to this scheme and the frustrating thing for me is i try to educate people about scams look the red flags were there right you never invest in something where the developers aren't known even women developers are known by the way you still can lose your money so that doesn't even help you but especially when the developers are unknown that's a really big red flag that this project's probably uh gonna fail again the project can still fail even if the developers are well known but i just feel like there's so much hype in the crypto community i mean obviously right now we're in a huge dip but there's so much uh you know fomo of you just want to jump in what's the next bitcoin what's the next big thing and these unscrupulous marketers can get away with murder because honestly they can just jump in promise you the world and people fall for it now when we go to their coin gecko which is basically just tracking uh tracking the coin as you can see here in the chart initially it was started really high it almost immediately uh fell apart now this is a lot of thing a lot of people don't know is that this project had been basically defunct for months and nobody had really been trading it but the developer just hadn't told everyone that it was a scam yet now the crazy thing is is that you can even see there was a little bit of interest here now at this point it's a total scam but nobody had been told yet and so uh finally people were told and that eventually it's gonna drop to zero because the developer ran away with everyone's money but this just this is like a perfect chart of human greed people jump in because they think they're at the next big thing it nobody's developing it right uh so that interest dies but even you just see a bunch of this is just a bunch of fomo people throwing money at this project after it's already collapsed i mean it's unbelievable to me it's like the project might as well have declared bankruptcy and people are still throwing money at it it just makes no sense and i feel like a lot of it's because so many investors are getting involved in crypto who haven't really gotten burned yet and so they're running into these projects thinking that they're safe or at least they're thinking that they have a really good chance of doing well and obviously they get they get wrecked this is yet another reason people say i mean i know it's a trope but it's serious that like you never want to invest money you can't lose into these projects because it happens that people really do lose it i mean that's not just like a saying i mean especially in crypto you can lose all your money especially on these um decentralized exchanges right people oftentimes will create tokens that they'll say you need to trade in your eth for my token now what people don't realize is that their eth is valuable usually the token they're exchanging it for is not they'll promise you huge yields they'll promise you huge uh returns that you gotta be first in but oftentimes what they're after is the etherium that you're gonna trade for their token and then they run away with it it's really sad to watch people get away with this stuff over and over and over and over again listen people know uh people who aren't new to the crypto community know that this has been happening for some time actually i believe this project was bcs binance smart chain but uh very similar they i mean they want b and b instead of ethereum but the point is guys we've been here before i mean uh an old crypto scam named prodium.io they disappeared and they left instead of saying we scammed you they just left a single word on their website penis yes that's right ladies and gentlemen in all its glory here's another exit scam it just shocks me um how much money these people end up making from this stuff and it makes me really sad because again you can't find them you're not gonna get justice a lot of the crypto currency community there's not there's no oversight there's no regulation right the sec is not going to get them when elon musk tweets and manipulates the market the sec is not going to get them so uh you really got to be careful and i say that personally i like to lose my money the old-fashioned way which is in the cryptocurrency market the normal market bitcoin where i can lose 30 in you know one week that's what i like to do don't don't lose 100 like crypto's already volatile enough is what i try to tell people it's like if you want risk crypto's the place for risk you don't need to go into all coins i mean you're really playing with fire people get involved in leverage people get involved in all these crazy things they don't really understand they get in projects they don't understand they uh they join developer teams or they join a coin with developers who they don't know and they really get in deep water fast trust me crypto is volatile enough ladies and gentlemen you don't need you don't need all these weird alt coins created yesterday to make it even more risky that being said you guys can do whatever you want if you want to go to these sketchy exchanges and get these sketchy coins you know what there's risk there's a reward but be warned among like honest risk of just whether the coin succeeds or not there are scammers just want to take advantage of you that's the fact and if you're not prepared to see a message like this on the website of your favorite altcoin maybe think twice so uh that's pretty much it just wanted to cover this real quick thanks for watching i'll see you guys in the next one
