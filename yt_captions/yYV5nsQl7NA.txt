[Music] whoa whoa whoa what's different what well let me give you a hint we got a big camera upgrade for you I'm so excited this is I feel like can you see my pores can you see every inch of dust on all of the things this is the highest quality camera I have ever owned I feel like I'm this proper adult that has to take care of this thing now um and I'm very excited about it and the first thing we are going to be filming with this new camera is of course preparing you for the future now when you're looking ahead thinking of 5 years from now you know what the scary thing is it's almost 2030 I mean yes let's not get ahead of ourselves it's 6 years away not five but it is really really close like this which brings up the question how do you stay ahead how do you learn skills today that will remain in demand or even become more in demand in the future that's what we are going to go through today all right let's get into it oh hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding future Tech Career you know all the good stuff related videos now let's get into [Music] it now listen don't get me wrong these list this list is going to be very specific skills that you can learn but we had to start out working our way from number 10 to number one number 10 being something you probably didn't expect always expect the unexpected that's tip number one I'm just kidding in all seriousness though coming in at number 10 10 is actually soft skills now you might be thinking Tiff these are skills that are the most in demand in it for the next foreseeable future for the next 6 years seven years why are you talking about soft skills well the reality is asz Tech is progressing at such a rapid pace and also producing tools that allows more people to be technical get their hands in the weeds if you will hands in the you know what I mean at a quicker rate what will happen is soft skills are continuing to become more and more important if you want to stand out so the question is how do you get these soft skills well it's definitely not needed to take a course for soft skills but if you are like me or millions billions of others out there sometimes your technical skills might initially be stronger than your soft skills so you need to work on them just like you do your technical skills here are two courses that I think are great one is from corera which is effective communication for professionals specialization if you are someone who often times feels as though they can't communicate what their thoughts are or accurately get across what you want to this is for you another one is by edex I love edex I think they have some great courses on the technical side but then also too on the personal communication side so this course is problem solving and critical thinking skills now this might be more relevant to people who don't come from a technical background because it's more of that critical thinking that you are building and that is something that you do get with technical skills so that's just something to keep in mind coming in at number nine is user experience now this is an area that is continuing to grow rapidly in demand and can you guess why well for one reason it's because everything everything we are building with AI now AR VR all of this technology requires to have very specific user experiences now more than ever is ux and even UI in demand because of that so what skills are required for user experience for one you need to focus on user research wire Framing and user testing so this is a role that yes you aren't coding per se in it but you also still need to be pretty Tech technical but then on the other side you also need to enjoy interacting with people is you are going to be interacting and testing with users or potential users to gain their feedback that is how you are going to design these applications now you might be thinking what are some courses for user experience maybe you're someone who wants to break into that area you're further along in your career and it is of interest to you we live in a time now where you can go from one role to the other I love any courses typically by Google I would say you know they are such a great company very credible and it also doesn't hurt to have a certification by Google on your resume so this course right here is called Google ux design professional certificate it is a great course if you are looking to level up your skills another one this is really cool I wasn't super familiar with this site but it's called interaction design foundation and they offer really a wealth of knowledge when it comes to user experience and user interface so go check it out coming in at number eight might be one that surprises you at first which is actually blockchain now if you are someone who is in the blockchain space you will totally understand why it is is an area that is continuing to grow in demand actually right now when you go on job postings or look online blockchain is an area that is most widely looking for people to recruit which is very interesting now I think here's the thing blockchain can sometimes get a little bit of a bad rap but it's not blockchain that actually deserves this bad rap well I'm not saying any technology does but what it is also always Associated so closely to of course is cryptocurrency which of course two different things and blockchain can be used for so many different uh everyday uses especially when you think of healthcare when you think of schools universities that we really need to separate the two so this is something if you are interested in blockchain this technology is here to stay it is building our future we will continue to use it and here are some good courses for it now one is a certified blockchain developer course which you can see right here oh by the way I'm going to link all these courses down below the other one is a course by IBM called blockchain Essentials which I'll also link down below now coming in at number seven is something that encompasses you could say many different skills in a way but it's still its own Niche which is internet of things or iot iot is something we interact with I mean every single day from our why can't I think of an example rewind this part all right we're back now let's try this again Smart Homes I mean smart devices are things we use every day when we think of our thermostats our locks nowadays the list goes on and sometimes it's even as I just had there easy to forget what we interact with with iot on a daily basis because it's so ingrained in Our Lives nowadays there's so much potential though for you if you are looking to upscale in an area to get involved in iot it's a fascinating industry a fascinating job that you can really have within it when you think iot you can think of things such as embedded systems sensor technology and wireless communication protocols there's so much to it so because there's so much to it we need there's no surprise there is a ton of different courses on iot but here are some of the top ones the first one is Cisco's certified Network associate so this is a CCNA in industrial certification so this is a really great certification if you're a bit further along in your career and looking to level up with a certification in iot another one that's more so for beginners is iot fundamentals connecting things so this is a course by corsera and if you are just beginning your career in iot I would definitely recommend checking this one out next on the list coming in at what number are we at coming in at number six is devops now devops is something that not only is in demand right now but will continue to grow in demand especially as Tech continues to move faster and teams become more agile devops will become even more essential which kind of feels impossible at this point now here are a few tools or Technologies you will be working with when in a devops role some include Docker kubernetes and Jenkins now listen in some roles you won't be using all that in others you'll be using different ones but those are a really good place to start when you are looking into devops now most people don't just start their it career in devops it's something that you come from either a software development background I mean I've even seen people more from the product management side get into devop so there is multiple paths you can take to get into devops but of course one of the best ways is through some courses AWS has a great devops course it is called AWS certified devops engineer and this is professional level you can see it on screen here and I'll link it down below another one I mean kubernetes is still so in demand and such a niche skill I think I remember about a year and a half ago when I was job hunting I would always see developer Advocate roles specifically for kubernetes and it's a whole other world so that is why this course here is dedicated just to that which is kubernetes certified application developer or CCAD CCAD you know what I mean next on the list coming in at number five is full stack web development yes I know you see all these crazy headlines of how AI is going to overtake web developers we are far from there and trust me when or if we ever get there so many other rules will be taken as well that we will have evolved with AI in this Tech by that time now what has happened though is this role does look slightly different we are now using these tools in our everyday jobs to code better faster more collaborative even it doesn't mean it's a bad thing per se and you can see that by the number of jobs that are still open and in demand for full stack web development so if you are someone who is thinking should I learn how to code I feel like I'm going to waste all my time learning how to code and then AI is going to take it over please do not let those thoughts take over the reality is it is one of the most in demand areas that you can really put your focus to and learn learn not only today but in the foreseeable future as well and four courses on web development I mean there's endless ones but one resource I really love to use is free code Camp I mean one I used it so much when I was first learning to code two it's free three it is it's taught by some of the world's biggest experts they're thought leaders they're such great Educators and I feel like they do a great job of breaking it down I I really love free code Camp so any of their courses are so well done and well thought out I like also to they have a lot of smaller projects you can build so I link them down below too coming in at number four I mean it's no surprise it's the new oil can you guess what that is data and analytics these skills around data science and analytics professionals they are continuing to grow in demand data is not running out we are continuing to gather more and more data and often times the quality of this data is getting worse especially because of AI we love AI but then on the other hand it's kind of muddling some Waters so if you are someone who is interested in data science or becoming a data analyst either of those roles it is such a great area for you to focus on not only for now but to feel confident that what you are spending time on now will evolve and grow with these AI tools and other Technologies in the foreseeable future now there's endless courses on data science and analytics here are two ones that really stand up to me though one is IBM's data science professional certificate and the other is certified analytics professional or cap now I like both of these because you end up with a really great certification and especially for the IBM one it's a great way to have that big Tech well not big Tech but what is IBM Consulting so it's not big Tech but it's big four no it's not big four con IBM it's a great company you're going to have it on your resume now I feel like this one should be number one for how hot it is how hot it is yeah but it's number three right now and that's because there are some that are even hotter if you will I need to find a new word other than hotter that sounds weird but this is cyber security and no surprise here cyber security is coming more and more in demand especially thanks to all the tech coming out so quickly on one hand it's great techs coming out but on the other it really enables people who maybe shouldn't have this technology to have it and that is where cyber security comes in now within cyber security there are so many different areas that you can focus in on that it's kind of like this interesting or exciting time that you can really pick okay do I want to focus on uh reverse engineering do I want to focus on uh more on the security side security within cyber security but there are so many areas and facets to it that are really exciting and this isn't a role that you have to be technical in yes there's a lot of technical roles within cyber security that you can learn and gain skills for but equally there are so many roles on the business side you need to be so knowledgeable about cyber security practices as well now coming in at number two is something that was holding number one spot for a long time just recently got pushed down to number two which is cloud computing this area is still so in demand skills and knowledge within cloud computing is continuing to grow in demand and will for the foreseeable future now like all the topics we have been covering today there is so many different areas that you can really focus in on with cloud computing so make sure to do your own research when it comes to cloud computing but here are two Great Courses I would recommend all right coming in at number one is AI and machine learning and I'm sure that's no surprise especially with our last few years how quickly AI has grew into our everyday lives it's something that we use I often times will Google things or I'll oftentimes use Claud or chat GPT to search things instead of using Google now which is just such an interesting time to be part of now there are so many roles Within These two fields that you can learn about and grow skills within I mean think about the business side of things really understanding the ethics with AI really understanding the business challenges there are so much there and then on the flip side things such as machine learning Engineers are one of the top well the top in demand roles for 2024 so if you are someone who's already a developer or technical individual I would definitely suggest checking that out that being said though this isn't something something that you can just shift right into it's something that people study for years and years so if you are looking to get into these areas it is a really great time because it is so in demand that you might be able to get some of these positions with a little bit less experience and then learn on the job now of course here are some courses that are great for AI and machine learning but just like all of these courses that I'm recommending it really depends on what area you want to focus in on all right if you made it this far in the video I am I love you extra extra amounts because you made it to the end comment if you made it to the End by the way cuz that is really awesome I hope you enjoyed going through this these are some of the top in demand skills in demand areas that will continue to grow and they're one of these things that are really exciting even if you aren't in any of these areas it really helps to be aware of what is in demand and just start learning a little bit on the side it doesn't mean you have to do a full career switch or uh completely leave what you're studying now but just just start figuring out what you are passionate about and growing it that way all right make sure to hit that subscribe button and I will see you all soon oh also how would you like the new camera bye everyone [Music]
