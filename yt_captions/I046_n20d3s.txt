- We spent all our money on videos, and so we have no other choice than to be a portable carnival. I'm gonna be the main attraction standing for 24 hours straight. Let's go set up shop. - Our first station at the
event is Garrett's paint shop. For $5, he will professionally paint you. Our second station is Chris. He'll play any song in the world - As long as it's like five of them. - And not copyrighted. And then our third station
is Chandler over here. The world's best magician. - Super. - Now you all have a
part of me on you. Ugh. And then I'm gonna be the main attraction. I'm gonna stand here
for 24 hours straight. - It is officially 1:22. - It is 1:22. - All right. It's official. - You can get down at 1:22 tomorrow. - I'm still allowed to talk, though 'cause you can't see my mouth moving. - All right, we've been
doing this for 10 minutes, and I'm gonna have to change
up the rules a little bit. I'm able to move my head. - Now, what balloon animal would you like? - Surprise me. - All right. Have you
ever heard of a snake? - You're not giving me a snake. - That's a fish. Thank you. - Let's do this. What's your name? - Matt. - Matt. ♪ Matt is awesome ♪ ♪ He looks like Logic ♪ - You wanna get drawn or do you wanna- - Holy crap. I didn't even realize. I thought it was just
a Town Square statue. - To be real though, he looks like Abraham Lincoln. - You do look like Abraham Lincoln. - That's good. - Dude, that detail is amazing. - Hold on. That's a spit perfect wedding picture. - All right, show it to them please. - Three, two, one. - We're putting up in our wedding. Thank you guys. - So, we kept up this statue thing but to be honest, it
wasn't super entertaining. So, I decided to cut the
second part of this video. It just wasn't up to par with the level of content
I want to produce. To make it up to you guys, we filmed a completely separate video which will be starting now. Welcome to the "Amazing Beast Race." Basically, we did our own
version of the "Amazing Race." I gave these four guys sitting on these mini cars 15 challenges, and the challenges are spread
all throughout our city, and the first person to finish all 15 challenges won $10,000. - Whoa. - All right. - Pick your partner. - Jake, we're going. Let's go. - Joshua, Who do you want? - Run, take your place. Run. - Oh, I'm almost there. - All right, there you go. You should pick Garrett
just to pissed off Chris. - Let's go. - Let's go, man. - Dang. - I touch what? - All right, let's go. Oh, the steering wheel.
Go to the white truck. - We just lost the lead to Dustin. I didn't think you could run that fast. - Challenge number two, go to McDonald's with a working ice cream
machine. That's hard. Okay. All right. - Oh, we play to win. Oh. He's driving a soccer mom vehicle. So, there's no way we're
gonna lose this race. This soccer mom's getting
his kid to practice. - There's the McDonald's,
there's a McDonald's. - Yeah. - Get it, get it, get it. - Okay, here we go. Thank you. And then I have to eat that part of it? I've eat the cone? - Eat 'em. - That's all. - Eat 'em, let's go. - Speeding. That's not gonna pass you. - That's an illegal move. He passed in illegal move. - It's illegal. - What's up Chris? - Hey, I have something to report. We are currently in a
45 mile per hour zone. Garret just passed me
in a double yellow line. - We will punish him if that is true. I specifically said they
must obey all traffic laws. According to Chris, Garrett
broke it. I'm gonna call him. Just because we're
doing an "Amazing Race," You still have to obey the law. I got a report that you're
breaking traffic laws. I have video evidence of it. I'm gonna need you to pull
over to the side of the road for one minute as your punishment. - We are currently being punished for being better than everyone else. - It just hit zero, so we're good. Let's get back on the road. Dude, I think I see Chris
coming up on us. There he goes. - Hey, I got Chris going over the speed limit as well. - You got him going over the speed limit? - I clocked Chris at 70 miles per hour. - All right, I will
call him and punish him. - Hey, what's up? - You were speeding. - No, I wasn't. - Garrett was going 70. And he said, you passed him. - I'm going exactly 60 right now, and he's currently passing me as we speak. The camera can show it.
See, crude set to 60. - You're not going 60. Why'd you tell Jimmy I went
70? I didn't go 70, you liar. I don't know what's going on. - All right. Well, have fun. - You left your door open. - Keep it clean, guys. Keep it clean. - Jimmy just gotta have
his car on the highway. - All right. So, we're at McDonald's. - Hey, is y'all's ice
cream machine working? - Oh, yes. - Could we get two ice cream cones? - Thank you. Eat it on
the car. Go, go, go, go. - Oh, it's says just
McDonald's right here. - There's the other team. - Oh, it's gonna block
them in. Go, get ice cream. - Go, go. - Yeah, whoa.
