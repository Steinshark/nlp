what we've got here is a piece of software that martin polyakov of periodic videos commissioned back in the 80s enabled people a level students to test their chemistry knowledge and if you look on periodic videos perhaps they were running out of storage space you'll see a video where martin and i get this up and running on the bbc micro and actually start it working it was an interesting exercise and we'll have a look later how we can actually get the software off the bbc micro onto something that we can run on a modern computer a pc a mac even a iphone or anything else which has got the right sort of emulator it's relatively easy to look at images and videos and those sorts of things but programs are harder right most images perhaps and this is perhaps not necessarily a good idea um we tend to compress so we can press them so they take up less space and so we've got something like a jpeg we can access it because it's so ubiquitous we can just access it but i shoot raw my slr thinking about it i'm not so certain that 22 years down the line raw files will be that easy to access now chances are i shoot with a pretty common canon dslr so chances are that yes that will still be supported but it's making me think about it actually should i go and convert them into something more convenient so it's counted your intuitive in some respects so your real shooting raw to preserve as much possible quality as you can and actually you might preserve the files for longer if you put them into a compressed format because they're more common exactly so it's best keeping them in both and it's actually the same for a piece of software is that we need to be able to decode the data so to any media we need to be able to decode it and use it now for something like an image file for a video that's a relative straightforward you could write one when it gets to something like martin's chemistry games we can access the data on the disk we can start to see what some of these are this looks like it's a basic program so that's loading that so that's that's one of the programs well let's have a look at some of the others so this obviously looks like the periodic table calcium selenium titanium i suspect this is the one that you had to guess what was in there we could start to see what's going on here and start to see bits of it because we can understand it as soon as you've compressed it you need to know how it's compressed before you can run it so it's a good argument that you should keep your data in an uncompressed format but then of course that takes up even more space and storage is plentiful but it's not exactly cheap so you probably don't want to compress it but if you're going to do that do it in a file format that will be common i mean text files put them inside zip files don't use some weird and wonderful wacky compression format that you've found that'll save you one percent extra on the file size 10 years down the line chances are we'll probably still be able to unzip the zip file possibly not the weird and wacky format that you might have used when it comes to program zone a system like this not only we need to copy the data and the program we also need to emulate the complete system that we're going to run it on so for example if i wanted to get martin's games working on my mac or on a pc not only do i need to copy the data off this disk and that in itself is an interesting issue because i have a five and a quarter inch floppy drive in the bbc micro but i don't have one in my mac and i don't have a usb 5 inch floppy drive in fact that would has take so that there's probably never been one produced you get three and a half inch floppy drives with usb output but not five and a quarter so we still need to find an interesting way of getting the data off now we could find a pc with a five and a quarter inch floppy drive i've got one over there the drive doesn't work unfortunately but we then need to write software to understand the disk format what i actually did to do this is this machine is networked this is on an earlier networking system called echonate which acorn developed which i can then get it onto the archimedes and that's got a three and a half inch floppy disk drive which i can use a pc format to copy it over to the mac so if we look here i wrote this program what this actually does is it reads each sector sector bisector track by track off the floppy disk we get that and we just write it out to a file one sector after another and we store it on the network until eventually we've got a copy of the file sitting on the archimedes in this case it's called chem dot image and chem two data image i then copied them via a floppy disk onto my mac using the floppy drive over here and then i can use a bbc emulator how many emulators can you run at the same time um quite a lot in fact i have a machine running a bbc emulator a mac plus emulator mt4 and an amiga emulator at the moment so you can run quite a lot on a standard machine then that must be running at full speed but you can get things there modern machines can emulate these things pretty well i've taken an open source emulator for the bbc micro called bbm i didn't write it i just hacked it to run nicely on my mac and so if we start the emulator and we can boot it and we should see exactly the same software running on the modern computer but again we're having to take it and emulate the whole machine to run it so when we archive software we probably want to at least archive something that can run the software as well in this case an emulator will be sufficient and you can write these emulators anything there's even a javascript bbc micro emulator which means that we could put this in the web page and then you'd be able to run it off that break key can then let go break wow and it starts up this is really exciting that sound computer was a lot more visceral in those days they made noises and they sort of you heard them going so it's not quite centered on the screen
