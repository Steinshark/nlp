ladies and gentlemen welcome to the first major chess event of 2024 welcome to the first Gotham recap of 2024 of course I am talking about T Steel this is a tournament that happens every single January it's actually been going on for I believe over 70 years it's frequently referred to as the Wimbledon of Chess and the way T Steel works is there are two sections the master section and the Challenger section they both have 14 players and it's around Robin so there are 13 games the winner of the Challenger section every year qualifies for the opportunity to participate in the master section the following year now every single year it's a mix of players from all over the world different ages different experience levels but this year for the first time in a long long time Magnus Carlson is not playing he declined the invitation for whatever reason but also Fabiano kowana and hikaro Nakamura are not participating that doesn't mean you should click on the next video you see in the sidebar because it's still a massive mix of interesting characters young players we have dingly Ren returning right dingly Ren hasn't played since the world CH Championship we have Hans nean Hans demon is the highest seene in the Challenger section he has vowed to win it he has vowed to qualify for the Masters uh the following year we also have J and June women's world champion playing in the master section so it's going to be one of the first times ever that we had the women's world champion and the open world champion playing I me it's going to be very very exciting stuff uh and for today's recap uh we're going to kick things off with the game that Hans demon played that dear Lord somebody has to stop this man also before we get into that I'd like to comment on something I always get made fun of for two things I always get made fun of for not being a grand master and my hair in the next three to 5 years I'll probably be bald I can thank my dad for that but I got a nice haircut I decided decided to shut y'all up and I went and I got a fresh cut and now you can only make fun of me for one thing and that one thing is that I'm not yet a Grandmaster that has not changed unfortunately but guess what neither are you so all right Hans demon playing against Liam uh roik whose last name I believe means like happy which is that's a nice last name uh this was a mauling okay uh Hans up with E4 and Liam played E5 Knight F3 Knight C6 Bishop C4 the Italian uh Liam plays Knight to F6 and attacks the pawn in the center uh and now white plays the move D3 it's also important to understand that like against Bishop C5 you can play D3 as well against Knight F6 you can play you can go for fried liver but at this level they don't do that cuz there's a lot of theory both players have studied it a lot and they know the best moves so Hans plays Pawn to D3 Liam develops the bishop to C5 Hans castles and then plays C3 intending to play D4 at a later moment maybe expand on the queen side here black castles as well now again there are many many many lines this is a classical chess tournament so as you can see they got a 100 minutes for their first 40 moves so games could go for hours and hours in fact I'm recording this video as the game has entered its seventh hour of play so it's going to end in a moment but it is still pretty crazy that these games can go for that long Hans plays Rook e one black plays A5 again we are taking divergences and different paths at every moment we're not going to get into the intricacies of why the pawn is on A5 rather than on A6 Pawn's on A5 because it prevents white from expanding I like that we're not going to get into the intricacies of the pawn move and then I'm going to tell you about the intricacies of the pawn move black also wants to reroute the bishop over here and white wants to uh play B4 so black shuts that down Hans plays H3 that move is self-explanatory you don't want anything to go to the G4 Square you also maintain that in the future you can po potentially transfer your knight via H2 common idea black plays Bishop B6 the idea is to trade the powerful white bishop and open up the attack for The Rook which would be very dumb for white to do because the he already moved his Rook to the center to support the move d4 and support the pawn so I don't know why you would do that right so that's why he goes here he gets out of the way Bishop takes now here's an interesting thing about this position I'm going to give you an interesting piece of information Hans nean played this exact same game already once in his life and he played it in a tournament called the United States Chess Championship okay pretty big tournament important tournament it's championship of America and he played against Fabiano Carana so hza had this on the board before I'm willing to bet Liam knows that because that's how chess works right Liam plays Bishop A7 H plays Knight bd2 we are still following the game niman Carana and the interesting thing about that game is Carana one kowana one kowana one that's hilarious Knight E7 transferring the Knight out of the scope of the bishop so now the bishop is rendered a little bit useless we'll probably have to come around this way uh still following that game Hans plays D4 entire idea was to do that right he's trying to take the center we're still following that game Liam puts the Knight on G6 he transfers the Knight out of the danger zone and now is ready to attack white in the future we're still following the game we're still following the game we're still following the game I'm going to tell you when we're not following the game anymore Knight F1 Knight to F4 it's exactly how Carana played this position putting the night here now judging by Liam's time either he went to the toilet or he's just trying to remember the game we are officially no longer following the game so something happened here all right we were we've been following Neiman Carana now here's the thing I guarantee you Hans nean after losing to Fabiano went home and studied that game for hours and it's not just about the game it's about the decision-making Pawn takes Pawn has been played in about I don't know 15 20 GM games all right maybe about 10 about 80% of them go Knight takes D4 putting the knight in the center targeting the bishop and that's how Hans played the first time against Fabiano he lost that game he didn't lose that game because he took with the Knight he lost that game because he lost that game now he takes with the pawn this is a move that's been played only two times that I could find in the Masters database and here's the amazing thing one of those times was by Fabiano himself so my man Fabiano has had that position that we just saw this position he's had it with black and with white these top level players are so flexible they could play any position now Liam plays D5 I think we've officially left Liam's preparation because he's actually thinking all right and now we've we're still in hans's preparation D5 and now Hans demon plays the First new move the only games in the database here have gone Pawn to E5 advancing in the center Hans doesn't do that instead he takes the Knight and he takes the Knight without even thinking which means this move move is in his notes and what he's trying to do now is quickly develop you you generally don't want to trade a knight for a bishop like this but the idea is to quickly develop your pieces connect your Rooks get the Rook into the center of the board now Liam thinks and takes the pawn he spends 13 minutes officially on his own officially not stuck in the toilet he takes the Rook takes in the center of the board targeting the Knight the Knight drops back Hans plays a very natural move here which is this bishop is not doing a thing so let's trade it and the idea is I want to trade the bishop but continue to pressure you here so you probably have to go here then at that point I'll slide my queen I'll bring my Rook to the center I have ugly pawns but I can't say your pieces strike a big impression but instead of that Liam keeps the tension and he puts the bishop on D5 so he slides the bishop forward because it's defended like this Hans takes and doubles his Rooks relatively normal and as you can see from time spend still in his prep Liam goes here down 35 minutes on the clock and I believe Hans yes this is the first move that he made out of his prep so basically Hans plays 21 moves of prep which he memorized and now he needs to remember the ideas of the position the ideas of the position are to clearly make your opponent uncomfortable by targeting the knight in front of his King because the Knight actually can't go anywhere so F6 H5 the Knight would need to go to the h8 square which is disgusting I guess it could go to E5 but then you would probably lose this Knight or Pawn in the future not right away though Liam plays F5 when you are under severe pressure you frequently try to solve things in a concrete manner you frequently try to play in a concrete way to make your opponent think right and he does and Hans puts his Knight in the center maintaining a 35 minute time Advantage but this is going to come back to haunt Liam apparently what Liam should have done in this position is caged the Knight he should have not let the Knight back into the game he should have grabbed this pawn and like a roller coaster held on for dear life the computer now gives Queen C2 C5 defending white can apply pressure but black can actually fend this off and probably survive but this move F4 is an overextension because it allows Hans to put the knight in the center and I just told you right take the pawn but leave the pawn on F5 this is a major difference because the White Knight re-enters the game and has an opportunity to go there Hans plays Queen C2 and now black is in under severe pressure black is now down over 40 minutes on the clock he plays H6 he is now down 1 hour on the clock and the reason he did play H6 is to prevent the knight from going to G5 had he defended his Pawn Hans would have went here and this is a lot of headaches for black lot of headaches and by the way that Knight wouldn't have gotten there if you kept your Pawn on F5 because Liam overextended because he was under pressure for so long he now suddenly has to deal with this Knight and he's under too much pressure now his position is disintegrating white has tactics all over the board because black kind of tied his shoes together Rook D7 played with 11 minutes on the clock technically the position is still holdable but he goes Queen C6 and he simply blunders take take Rook D2 Bishop can't move cuz the Rook is hanging you can't even defend the bishop take the PA can't take Bishop hangs Bishop hangs game over what a game Hans nean plays 21 moves of his prep that he learned from his game against Fabiano kowana and black he defended to his credit he defended but that's that's life man that's life you play 22 perfect moves and chess is sometimes a Minefield like this you allow one night to just re-enter the game and suddenly that Knight is causing you massive headaches it's a bit of a the beginner takeaway here actually really in the intermediate takeaway is sometimes a pawn does a better job controlling a knight than attacking it the the the pawn attacking the Knight the Knight can zigzag out of the way I'm not teaching Liam there's a reason I'm here and he's playing I'm teaching all of you sometimes it's better to control a piece rather than threaten it because a lot of you are guilty of this Hans wins a game uh a perfect game because he played 21 moves of prep his opponent made it in accuracy and Hans just swiftly punished him and his opponent blundered into this and resigns because there's no way to defend your position I feel like when Hans beats people he takes their soul like some people win long boring Rook end games when Hans Neeman beats you um he takes your soul like that's what he does it's just unbelievable now I got other games for you today all right uh this is a game from the master section and this game was uh they called the police to the playing Hall after this game was done okay so uh Yan pishi Max vadam D4 Knight F6 Yan playing uh typical normal thing here and this position is is a two knights with D4 and C4 generally you'll see a reg gozen like a Queen's Gambit declined you could see a knight bd7 it's a sideline there's a line here that kills the game which is this to what all the top players are playing against each other nowadays and then they each Mirror Image take these pawns but nepom Nishi is trying to beat Max vadam he's 150 points higher rated than he is okay 10 44 but I'm rounding up so he takes on C4 and after this move which seizes the center and then tries to take the pawn back he plays this very provocative move Pawn to B5 the point is that white if white ever takes black will take here and actually black does not mind losing the pawn completely and simply hanging on to this one this is well known this has been played I've played this with black uh for actually it's been popular for some time so white goes here black develops his other Knight they both develop their pieces this Knight comes out of the way to control more of the center cuz the Knight was going to get kicked out anyway it was also going to be a Target right and black basically says look I have this stupid looking Pawn that you can try to go win but I'm going to win control of the center and I'm going to have a very powerful Bishop white plays A3 both guys still in prep as you can see from from their time management white plays this queen C2 move neppo plays Queen D7 white plays Rook D1 clearly his first move on his own plays Rook D1 and you know black I like I said black has a slightly bad Pawn structure but when you're 150 points higher rated than your opponent and you're playing Black you can't win games without taking risk so he plays it like this and now nappo plays this very interesting move F5 I have a feeling by the way that Jan is still using ideas from his world championship match both of them you got to remember when you prepare for a world championship against Magnus or dingly Ren there's a lot of ideas you don't get to use and so this could be one of them where you know he's potentially creating problems for his opponent like if White castles black black could play G5 I'm not saying right now I'm not saying right now but I am saying that you know there's going to be positions where you know you could do stuff like this again not right now but that's kind of the point that is that is what you were trying to do Max takes on F6 right Yan you see look at what Jan's doing Jan is sacrificing a little bit of King safety to try to Target White's position White's got no choice he's probably going to have to Castle but he plays Knight E4 hesitating that black plays Queen A4 so the second the Knight left right the second the Knight leaves the control of the queen side Jan says let's trade the Queens because when we trade the Queens I'm going to bully your pawns over here tough position very tough ramadon plays Queen B1 Yan Castle's long King is out of the center and now I am ready to bulldoze with my Bishop the computer thinks it's equal but practically speaking it's a very difficult position to play with white he plays Knight C5 he's still hesitating he's trying to clarify the position a little bit before he castles he finally castles wow now you will never in a million years be able to explain to me why Yan moved that rook and not the other one like this looks so ugly but I kind of think Yan did not find a good response to Queen takes Pawn like that's a free pun now you might say well what about Rook h8 yeah but you're going to lose other in the process like you could do this but at the end of the day I mean I'm I'm going to strip you of your pieces and then you can say but I have my Rooks pointing at your king and I would say that doesn't matter in chess you you can't just describe things in words oh my Rooks are pointing at the king okay make a move okay do something about it I you can't because you got nothing so that's why Yan plays this right he he puts this Rook here and and maybe he's going to double up like that now it's a very difficult position and and Max plays G3 and he spends 12 minutes on the move and and I it's not an easy position White's best move is Queen E4 potentially and then sending this queen back and then going back to C2 no human being plays chest like that like you can't feels like you're not making any progress and black just got another piece into the attack very very difficult position it also says Rook D4 for reasons I can't explain so I I can't explain that move to you um so he goes G3 he kind of acknowledges the pressure and Deion immediately plays H5 he doesn't need to spend any time here come the Cannons it's still equal it's it's still equal he plays Rook D4 which is the best move but he's down 30 minutes on the clock Yan brings the queen back and yeah I I think you can see where this game might be headed Rook H4 stopping the attack yeah Yan gets rid of the bishop and plants his Rook here and says all right Max it's been been fun I had a really fun time playing with with with you here in the first round of T Steel but um you're in trouble queen1 and now Black's entire plan is revealed Max spends 20 minutes on this move let me tell y'all he could have spent 39 minutes on this Mo it is not an easy position Rook G4 is disgusting because the point is obviously you got to move your knight and then you're going to get destroyed but what's worse about rot G4 is I'm not asking you I'm not asking asking you to take that's not what I'm I don't care if you take or not because I'm taking you you can't take with the Knight you take with the Knight this is not made but I got news for you this will be very soon so you got to take G let me when you when you got to do this you know it's bad Jan's Knight finally gets activated just grabs the pawn on the way out he's just up a pawn but the advantage is like minus three and it's real bad because Queen E4 this is coming in this is coming in like you're getting mated dude Rook G1 and he just goes the other he just goes rook d8 and the idea of Rook d8 is I don't want to mate you anymore I'm good you know what the idea is let's say like you know H3 this Falls this this gets into D2 Rook D2 for example not right away not right away you don't you don't want to blunder your own King but that's the this is the general idea Rook D2 you can't take because of the pin this Falls game over Yan pishi just wins a beautiful game with black gorgeous game and I think it's because of his prep it's because of his prep like like I I think you know he he it's not like he ble like Hans won because he pressured his opponent out of preparation for 20 moves same with nepo nepo got a position that was really interesting really complex Dynamic perfect for his style and he I mean he just melted his opponent it wasn't even close now the return of dingly Ren with the black piece is his first classical chess game in like m nine months all right so he's playing black I mean you can't expect a whole lot by the way he's playing against VD GTI who is a candidate like this is a potential preview of the world championship match if if vidit wins it it wins the candidates right vidit is a dark horse in the candidates with guys like Fabiano and nepo but all right vidit plays Knight C3 wow he's allowing a NSO Indian generally nowadays these guys are not allowing NSO Indians I mean I literally just showed you a game where after these two moves guys are not allowing so Indian no it vidit says let's go and he plays a very complex line F3 trying to play E4 maybe testing testing ding's prep a little bit D5 A3 the bishop goes back generally the bishop is taking but ding says bring it on vided take as much Center space as you want strikes right back at the center with C5 you'll actually notice you know ding's prep here 6 minutes spent 6 minutes so I think he was going in the memory bank a little bit deciding which one he wants to go for and um he plays this one now as far as I know that I thought the main line here was E5 I really like this move with black but it's it's not it's not the best move I think according to to Theory you try to trade the queens and drive in here with the Knight white gets a big Center White gets a big Center regardless so ding gives him the big Center and now plays A6 H6 preparing B5 and he's stopping anything from going to the G5 Square vidit developed some pieces trying to trade castles very very tense position but to to be honest I like it more for white white has a pass Pawn that Ding has to blockade constantly and ding has to rely on peace trades to catch up in development because frankly he can't move his Knight so vidit goes here and just optically white looks better but white is down 20 minutes on the clock ding trades and then ding brings his KN out all right and now Knight D2 and this was the biggest advantage that VD had had in the game by the way thus far it's a great great looking position now black can rely on like these angle Queen trades but dingo's here and uh I mean vid it just look at look at the dominance of White's pieces the Knight is going to go to E4 ding is still trying to make exchanges but another Pawn is going to leave here and I mean I I think vid's got to go for this right like to split the pawn further away this is a passer the end game is going to be a problem like what's stopping him from taking and just bringing his Rook I'm not saying chess is that easy but sometimes if might be you know like I really wonder why he didn't take on G6 instead he played Knight E4 and now he allowed ding to trade like this and he's still building his pressure now ding plays B5 finally challenging the Integrity of the white position right threatening the pawn in the center vidit takes takes he takes on F6 and he grabs the pawn and now he does have free reain but a nice defensive move by ding asking some questions here white defends himself but the idea of Queen B8 was to pressure the Knight and also defend E5 for the fork Queen F4 we go to an end game four pawns each yeah white does have a better structure but he's never going to be able to use this to its full potential because he can't move the pawn or the Knight and you don't you know maybe white can play this for a win he tries to trade the Rooks and now he's going to try to bring his King I think the advantage here is like microscopically in Black's uh in White's favor but but you're too fast like Rook C4 Knight B6 you know you play like Rook a you probably don't want to go to a night end game but it's still a draw even if you go to it's still a draw so Rook C6 V it applies a little bit of pressure but dingl Ren creative crafty and this is just a drawn end game white has a pass Pawn but black is a little bit too active King D5 King here nobody can make progress you can even back up cuz you can't do this the only way that you would lose this end game with black is let's say you pushed all your pawns forward uh you know like H5 and then for whatever reason and you somehow allowed White's King in like like I like that and it even this is a draw because you can quickly trade the bonds so they draw relatively uneventful game good defensive resourcefulness by by ding interesting to see him back we got 12 more rounds of dingly Ren to go so you can't draw too many conclusions from this game but you can draw conclusions from this game this is one of the most Crazy Games I've ever seen uh this is the one that we will end on salm Salah from the UAE Arabic Falcon he probably has the coolest nickname in all of chess if Salem Sal was a fighter can you imagine them announcing him Salem the Arabic Falcon Sal like oh my what a gangster what what a name uh he um he's been over 2700 and by the way his Nick his like his ches LOM username is literally Arabic Falcon like I'm not giving him that name and um his opponent Anon corov also very Dynamic interesting play player these guys are in the Challenger section should show you the level of the tournament we have a nidorf perfect we have two of the most dynamic and exciting 2600 2700 players in the world and they're playing the most complex and combative opening they rattle off a little bit of theory early on F3 black castles salm plays H4 and Salem does not wait to Boogie he sacrifices his Bishop sacrifices the bishop for two pawns and a rook so white gets a rook and two Pawns black gets a knight and a bishop traditional wisdom tells you the Knight and the bishop are better even though the rook and two pawns are an extra point but what's really important about this it's not really about the Pawns in quantity it's about the Pawns in quality okay white has very high quality and coordinated pawns Black's pawns don't do much so black is going to have to rely on the maneuvering of the pieces and the only two pawns that matter which are those which are going to attack White King B1 always a useful move to defend all your queenside pawns and listen my man kabov is trying to utilize those pawns but Salem is dancing around him with his pieces who likes a queen trade here probably white because then he will never get mated and he will use his Rooks like at the end of the day the Rooks matter in the end game and they're going to matter cuz you're going to start taking things and trading right black plays A4 look at CM B3 a well-timed Counter-Strike on the side of the board he's getting attacked takes with the c Pawn they say You're supposed to take toward the center but not if it means getting checkmated all right in chess we have superseding Concepts take toward the center not if it hangs made takes away from the center because his Queen now defends his King a little bit more Queen F7 Knight F5 I told you it's about the quality of the pawns look at Black's pawns black doesn't have a lot of Pawns and they're very very very stuck Knight E8 now black doesn't even have A or B Pawn at all he's down three pawns rook and three versus knight and Bishop rook and three are going to get the job done Queen D4 Knight C5 but black still has to be a little careful But Here Comes white he's using his pawns and those pawns are just of a higher quality Knight takes B3 looks like you're going to Checkmate for example G4 Knight takes there's no mate it it it looks nice there's no mate it looks nice it it it looks really nice there's no mate I I promise you it looks like you're getting mated I can defend myself in chess if you have two more attacking pieces than they have Defenders you might make them I got like four defensive pieces I I got four defense it's just not going to work so G4 and now Salem turns everything around salm starts attacking in this he has a he has a crazy threat here his threat is Knight H6 you thought you were attacking me if you take it's made in the corner if you go here I take your queen with check you can't even take mine crazy Bishop B2 look at this position Rook D2 defending himself at all times Rook C1 complex game wi down a lot on time car above doing a nice job here with a comeback bringing all his pieces Knight E7 creative move can't take CU a mate Knight goes to D5 very complicated look at oh look at kabov kbov finally using those pieces Queen B4 strips white of the bishop now the bishop won't be used as an attacking mechanism the king gets out of the way but Rook cc2 defending the king poking prodding white still creating an attack Queen F7 rotating with the Knight I told you at a certain point the pieces are going to disappear for black now Sal fighting with the Pawns in front of his own King the Knight goes to the center A3 the king is still defended and kbov makes a he's got you know he takes the Knight but the quality of the pieces is not the same the Knight has no way back into the game the black was strong in numbers but he doesn't have the numbers anymore Knight C7 and the bishop is not impressing anybody either Queen B3 and Salam is just moving forward now only one man is attacking G6 sealing the tomb shot for the black king black tries to get a fork but white gets a fork right back winning the rook in the corner Rook F7 swarming in white is a move away from getting mated but Queen takes Knight H6 and Salem has to end this game like the Arabic Falcon would he sacrifices The Rook plays Pawn takes D5 he's now up three pawns but he ends the game in style in this position black starts to take his pawns and Salem ends the game and ends the Gotham recap by sacrificing his Queen for a Checkmate and that is a brutal move because it's not optional it's not optional if you take the queen I mate you if you defend the queen I take the queen and then I mate you anyway and if you play Rook G8 and you say no I'm defend I sacked the queen you got no choice you got to take me you got to take me in Rook C8 what a move Queen C8 is such a imagine playing that take the queen Slide the queen forward press the clock your opponent like I resigned good game what a what a win for salm SL great win in the Challenger section the standings don't matter a whole lot but I'll show them to you anyway uh these are your standings um as we are recording this recap uh Anish giri uh will be defeating xen Jun see that on the on the left side they both have zero points their game actually hasn't ended it's a rook end game but he's winning it at seven hours and I got to leave the house I got things to do it's like afternoon here and I've been sitting all day waiting for them to play but that's what happens in classical tournaments sometimes uh incredible win for Hans nean great start salm Salah cooking uh we got great players on on all sides interesting players players in their teens 20s 30s anybody anybody older in this event I'm trying to think any any 40y olds I think uh Arn Lami might be in his 40s if he's not then I apologize but uh we got many generations of players here very exciting event no Magnus no Fabby no hikaro don't matter tune in again recap coming for two weeks this tournament will last get out of here
