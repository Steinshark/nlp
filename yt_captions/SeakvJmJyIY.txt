[Music] I am so excited for this video mainly because 
for selfish reasons I want to look back on what   were the biggest things that happened in Tech in 
2023 when you take a step back and look at all the   event all the biggest things to occur in the tech 
industry around news and headlines this past year   it was a wild one so this video is purely For 
Your Entertainment and also I mean it's really   interesting and fascinating to look back on what 
were the biggest things to happen in Tech in 2023   let's start with January why does January 2023 
feel like forever ago I mean I know it's about   a year ago but it really feels even longer than 
that but there were some big things that occurred   right beginning off the year first one of course 
you have to understand it was November of 2022 so   leading up to 2023 that chat GPT was released so 
we kept on seeing especially early on this past   year a lot of news around open aai well I mean 
throughout the entire year starting off though   in January open aai signed a multi-billion 
investment deal with Microsoft this deal   this collaboration with Microsoft was finally 
sealed in January so this agreement essentially   includes scaling supercomputers for open AIS 
research deploying open AI models across all   Microsoft products and integrating azur into open 
ai's work close collaboration which I mean when   you look down as to the drama that unfolded with 
open AI later on it's kind of interesting now in   January as well other big Tech was freaking out 
about open aai and Google who was we could say a   little intimidated or scared by chat GPT declared 
actually a code red for AI development now this   was really around Google feeling threatened about 
chat GPT and people starting to use it instead of   Google to search up different topics all right 
let's move into February February was equally   as busy of a month for companies now listen I 
guarantee this whole video will not be covering   chat GPT although it could very easily because 
every month something came out but it would be   doing disservice to you if I didn't share that 
in February you know looking back to January   even a month before how Google was feeling a bit 
threatened by chat gbt in February they announced   Bard to have a bit of rival with chat GPT also in 
March UK scientists were awarded 67 million euro   for breakthrough in Quantum Computing now this 
is pretty cool so back in February scientists   from the University of Sussex and the universal 
Quantum were awarded 67 million after making   breakthroughs around Quantum Computing and these 
breakthroughs really came for a focus on solving   different challenges around medical uh development 
especially around the creation of new materials   and climate change solution so there this year as 
a whole was a big year for the quantum Computing   world and we see this right here there are major 
breakthroughs Happening Now Twitter or X I should   say really managed to stay in the news throughout 
the year especially in March though there was were   two big things that happened the first one being 
that only paid subscribers it was announced on X   will get recommended in the Twitter for you feed 
so this was a big push to really encourage uh   more people to start pouring their own money into 
Twitter help Elon out I don't think he needs any   help but continue to really encourage growth for 
X especially in the financial realm now this had   a ton of backlash a lot of users were extremely 
upset about this and to top it off in March there   was another big thing that really occurred on X 
which was some of its portions of source code got   leaked online this was really interesting I don't 
know if you saw the source code it was nothing too   secretive but it was very interesting the way uh 
learning more about how they were ranking users   on the social platform what that looked like it 
was a big year for for X but March specifically   all right let's move on to April April was pretty 
wild one of my things though that I found most   interesting was around Amazon who in April rolled 
out their contactless payment technology to over   200 location worldwide now if you know what I'm 
talking about this is using your palm essentially   to scan and pay this is not new technology this 
is something they've been working on for quite a   while but it was interesting how this past year 
particularly in April they rolled out across   so many stores the company also signed a deal 
with Panera Bread which will see the technology   installed in two locations in St Louis initially 
so I'm curious if anyone lives there please let   me know if you've tried this out I've never tried 
out this technology I see it online and I'm very   curious about it would you try it out also in 
April open AI released GPT 4 which was a model   that was now capable of understanding images and 
text this was a big step forward for the world of   AI all right let's keep it moving getting into May 
here this is pretty interesting well two things   let's start with the the least interesting out of 
the two one being Montana was the first US state   to ban Tik Tok this occurred back in may they 
finally came out that they were starting to ban   Tik Tok and this ban is set to take place January 
of 2024 now I'm not sure actually let's search it   up I don't think it's going to happen kind of 
Tik Tok ban yes correct actually in November a   few weeks ago end of November a federal judge 
blocked Montana's Tik Tok ban before it takes   place so may there were a lot of stressed out Tik 
tokers out there wondering if they are located in   Montana what is going to happen to them and now 
fast forward a few months not really a shocker the   ban has been blocked now the one that I found more 
interesting is the US drug sorry the US Food and   Drug Administration the FDA gave neuralink back in 
May thumbs up for human trials now this is a big   step forward for neuralink they've been testing 
for many years on animals specifically monkeys as   we've all seen these trials and now they got 
permission to start on humans the company's   goal as they state is to help individuals with 
paralysis blindness disabilities and all through   this chip all right you can't forget in back in 
June which feels like once again so long ago but   hackers actually threatened to leak the stolen 
Reddit data if the company didn't pay them 4.5   million and this was really interesting this 
was right around the time of the change that   they announced around their controversial change 
I should say where they were going to update the   pricing policy to the usage of their API I mean so 
many companies so many individuals use their API   on a frequent basis that this change announcement 
would affect them a lot and Reddit it's all about   this sense of community good or bad but a sense of 
community camaraderie so they were not happy about   this the user were not happy I should say now 
I actually just searched up did Reddit actually   pay the hackers and there's not much news on it I 
have a sense that they definitely did not pay the   hackers but I'm very curious they really shut down 
that news quite quickly as far as you know once it   got leaked out that hackers were demanding pay 
we never really saw an end to this do you know   what happened I'm I'm searching online I don't see 
anything about it I think they shut down the news   for it which I just can't see them paying though 
but June was a big month I mean that's that's a   lot of stress all right let's keep on moving going 
into July there was a lot of product announcements   in July starting with Apple's announcements at 
its WWDC 2023 conference and here are some of   the things that they announced which sound like 
you know we use them every day now but back then   they were exciting and new shiny things so they 
announced the introduction of Apple's Vision Pro   uh which we haven't seen necessarily yet to the 
market but I do think it's coming early 2024 I   believe that's what I read I just don't know 
I can see it being used in classro rooms for   learning purposes I just don't see myself walking 
around my house using it but maybe we're just not   there yet other things they announced include 
the 15-in MacBook Air the Mac Studio and Mac   Pro and also two with the M2 Ultra chip so it was 
it was a big year for Apple then on the flip side   meta introduced Quest 3 this was weeks apart that 
this happened it was both in the same month and   obviously I believe it was meta who announced 
Quest 3 right before Apple came out with their   version of the you know the Vision Pro and Quest 
3 once again I don't know I don't have any friends   who use it I don't think it's really stuck as far 
as the you know average person having a quest 3 at   home I don't know do you use it I'm very curious 
to hear who's using this now August is one of the   slower months I would say throughout this past 
year for big Tech news so you know there's a   few things that happened nothing really exciting 
though to note I would say you know at this time   meta's threads was released and it had record 
signups as far as getting onto the platform   which makes sense they really implemented it in 
a way where you know users that are already on   Instagram are getting pushed directly to threads 
you get this instant High because a lot of your   followers are still following you on that platform 
but it really declined quickly it actually reached   100 million signups though which was outpacing 
chat GPT as the fastest growing platform which   is pretty cool but it definitely didn't stick 
around I think there's a bit more pick up for   it now especially with Europe users now being 
able to use it now similar to August September   was actually pretty quiet I mean other than the 
the typical Rumblings around what is going on with   X what's happening with Tik Tok what's happening 
with uh open AI all of those I would say are very   commonly threaded throughout the year as being big 
news but you know to not just continuously repeat   about the same types of news in September there 
was a lot of news headlines around uh specifically   around the climate and I believe it was because 
in September where was it ah yes in September   actually this is super interesting Global ocean 
temperatures were noted to reach unprecedented   levels so the ocean reached a hotter a temperature 
that was hotter than it ever has been recorded   before and I think through that there was a lot 
of different speculation a lot of different talk   that came out of that you know the ocean being 
hotter than it's ever been recorded and how that   affects tech there was a lot of hype around uh 
socially responsible apps for 2023 um different   ways that Tech could potentially have the power 
to help with global sustainability so this isn't   a specific news headline other than of course the 
ocean portion of it but we saw a lot in September   around climate reporting and then too there was 
this positive take around September I remember   on how AI could potentially help with these 
climate issues we are facing so September was   a big month for the climate all right we head 
into October and things start to pick up again   one being I thought this is really interesting 
China launches in October their first commercial   human space flight program that's pretty cool so 
this was launched and it was the first commercial   human space flight program that was called Tian 
Zao I might be saying that wrong probably am   which is a cargo spacecraft that will be used to 
resupply the Chinese space station the launch is   a significant Milestone they go on to save for 
China Space Program very interesting and you   know this is something I got excited about because 
it definitely has a potential to pave the way for   commercial space tourism in the future would you 
go to space I think I would but I wouldn't be the   first first uh tourist to go maybe you know let 
some others go first and then I'll try it out also   too um with IBM they developed the new quantum 
computer that can perform certain calculations   millions of times faster than existing computers 
so throughout the year IBM really released some   exciting news around Quantum Computing and back 
in October this was something that they shared   as well around a computer that can do calculations 
millions of times faster I don't think we realize   how impactful or how powerful this will be we 
talk a lot about AI Quantum Computing I think   is going to just like take everything to the 
next level uh you know we we see how AI changed   our world Quantum Computing we'll do that but on 
steroids steroids elevated you know what I mean   okay welcome November you know what November is 
going to be or if you don't you will right when I   when I start giving you hints someone very major 
got fired and then rehired right away of course   this is Sam Alman who was fired as CEO of open 
aai back in November and then it was over the   weekend there was a lot of drama that happened 
only to have I believe it was Monday day less   than a week he went back and is now again CEO of 
open AI employees were outraged of this that he   got let go many threatening to quit many who would 
have quit if he did not come back so the the board   really had no choice but to take him back and now 
there are different speculations coming out as to   why he got let go different reports but you know 
at the end of the day I think the biggest thing is   ensuring that that transparency is there with the 
knowledge that you know he has the company has um   and maybe there was a little bit of friction at 
that time with what they were actually sharing   and what the board knew or I think because AI is 
moving so quickly when they hear things about AI   or the potential for it it can get very scary 
very quickly what is possible what does he know   is possible but he's been very vocal about what 
you know not only the good of AI but also the   negative so I don't know I'm very happy he's back 
I think it's a good move all right now December   here we are end of the year let's look back you 
know starting in December was really interesting   this is when Google gole claimed their new or 
shared about their new Gemini AI there were   three models for Gemini later came out about a 
week later a few days later maybe not even a week   came out around how the video sharing what their 
model their AI model Gemini was capable of came   out that parts of it were edited and just not as 
realistic as to where it is today I'll link down   that video or I'll put in the cards here because 
I did do a video comparing Gemini to chat GPT uh   GPT 4 in particular and it's really fascinating 
but I do think Gemini in 2024 is really going   to take off other things that happened was 
Amazon CTO shared his Tech predictions for   2024 and I thought this was really interesting 
to include in this I really look forward to his   Tech predictions every year because they're 
kind of out of the box so two things from his   Tech predictions stood out for me the first was a 
focus on making generative AI culturally aware by   addressing biases in language models now this is 
a huge prediction I know it doesn't sound that big   but how do you train a model to be culturally 
aware that is such a big step for forward with   AI that if we are able to do it that's that's 
pretty awesome another thing he mentioned was   the evolution of Education to match the speed 
of Technology now this is really interesting to   me he mentions that a shift towards industry-led 
skill-based training programs will occur versus   the typical traditional degrees and I think this 
is something that's been really missing from our   education system is it seems as though during 
school we learn a lot of theory a lot of what   if scenarios then we get into the workforce only 
to be faced with these Hands-On real scenarios we   need more of that mix in the Middle where when 
we are in school we're actually doing speaking   in the RO of Technology more Hands-On uh learnings 
that are up to date with what is going on because   Tech is moving so quickly that we really need to 
get our educational system at least a little bit   closer to that pace all right 12 months it was a 
wild ride and I honestly think it was just setting   us up for an even bigger ride going into 2024 what 
do you think leave down in the comments some of   your predictions going into next year hit that 
subscribe button and all right this is my last   video I'm filming for 2023 which is pretty crazy 
it means I can go eat a lot of cookies now bye [Music] everyone
