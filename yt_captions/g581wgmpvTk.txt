you can't have those two at the same time the actual reality is that it's neither of those yeah that's right it's neither of those and it's Christianity as Christianity took hold it integrated the things it could integrate it it it it it kind of let fall to the side the things that couldn't be integrated and it it ended up with a a world that was based on the ancient Pagan World in terms of a lot of the forms but moving using its meaning pointed towards God and towards Christ you know yeah this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic [Applause] World hello everyone I am uh happy to be back with Father Andrew it's been a while since we've had a discussion and so we felt like this would be a great time to uh to catch up with some of the things that we're doing Father Andrew has been publishing a a wonderful podcast called The Wolf on the cross Which documents his visits to Lithuania and exploration of of Lithuania as this this amazing Center where Orthodoxy thrived where Catholicism is there and that is actually what we're going to talk about so Father Andrew had the idea of looking at how the church has dealt with the question of its encounter with other religious Traditions you know the the opposition the the compromise also bringing in all of these types of things so I'm looking forward to our discussion Father Andrew thanks for thanks for meeting with me again thank you very much for uh agreeing to talk to me I I think this is a really interesting topic that does not get a lot of press in our very polarized days yeah and for you also this whole uh Adventure in Lithuania is also a very personal uh encounter like it's a it's a personal Journey let's say it is um I just came came back a few weeks ago from my second visit there and um just to show how personal it is one of the things I got to do in the second visit was I visited the small town that my great-grandfather was from where I had been before but this time I actually get to go inside the Catholic church that is the one Church in that town basically everybody in the town belongs to that church the pastor of that church is the pastor of the Town yeah which is hard for us who live in the west to imagine that um but he gave us a very long long and beautiful tour and one of the things I got to do while I was there is I actually got to touch the baptismal font that my great-grandfather was baptized in 140 years ago and I got to stand in the place where my great great grandparents were married um 160 years ago um or however many it was but uh yeah so it's extremely personal and now I've made a number of of friends that are there that I talk with pretty much every day and and um uh so yeah it is it is um something very very close to my heart so tell us a little bit about what because I I imagine that this provokes some insights and also some research into this question because Lithuania has been such a place of melding and and uh you know things coming together so tell me a little bit about what your insights about how the church deals with yeah so a lot of people don't know where Lithuania is even on the map um so if you're looking at Eastern Europe and then your eye kind of goes up towards the top that where it is up towards the top right on the Baltic Sea right across the Baltic Sea from Sweden it's next to belus it's next to Poland it's next to lvia um and a little piece next to Russia so if you think about that on the map that's actually a really important part of what we're talking about when Christianity splits um you know in the 11th century give or take uh eventually you know Eastern Europe becomes Orthodox later on largely speaking although there's already some some of that going on by the time the split happens and if you look at where the border is between Orthodox East and Catholic West it basically runs right there that's exactly the place where the border is um and Lithuania is interesting in that regard now of course it's Catholic now but it was also the very last Pagan nation in Europe uh it did not become christianized until the very end of the 14th century who um and yeah so that's pretty recent relatively speaking and so uh The Encounter of Christianity with paganism I mean most of us who were know anything about church history we think about the encounter of Christianity with paganism but we think about it a thousand years before that right so it's it's all very nicely in the past it's all very nicely in the books all of that has been worked through you know we don't really even see the lines that much uh you know unless someone's looking for them especially trying to undermine Christianity let's say um but with Lithuania it's very much more recent and um just a few hundred years in the past and uh even when Catholicism becomes the national religion there's pockets of paganism that exist for a while and and this is the thing that I really want to talk about today uh there's a lot of indications of the way that Christians dealt with paganism and the way that Orthodox Christians dealt with being in what was a Catholic majority country so when that christianization began to happen in the late 14th century Orthodox Christianity was already there Catholicism was of course already there so you get these two Christian Traditions kind of competing in the same space for the hearts of pagans um but also simply living with them and being married to them and you know doing life with them right um so uh it it forms a really interesting place to look at this question but I you know before we get into that too deeply I want to just actually talk a little bit about the backstory of Christianity with regards to dealing with other religions because if we don't know that then um what I'm going to talk about in Lithuania might seem weird uh you know it might seem surprising or you know let's let's sweep that under the rug kind of thing but actually it's it's normal it's pretty normal in fact right so you know beginning with with the Bible itself uh just in the Old Testament for instance you get uh The Encounter of the people of Israel with with the Pagan religions of the ancient near easts right uh baale worship of course number one um also there's a worship of a god named sheemish who is a Canaanite sun god um and uh so here's the funny thing like we all know about the sort of polemic against Pagan religion in in the Old Testament you know there's there's all kinds of mocking of pagan gods and and all this stuff that we we love you know it's a lot of fun to read uh we love The Showdown on Mount Carmel between uh Elijah and the prophets of ba you know uh you know with a fire from heaven and so forth but also what a lot of people don't know is that some of the Bale imagery like the fact that he's the rider on clouds that gets used for the son of man in Daniel yeah and in the gospels when Christ ascends into heaven right that's really important it's important to notice that that it's happening in the Old Testament especially because people don't understand for example why we call the thecus the Queen of Heaven because they see that as a title for ancient Pagan goddesses and it's like yes that's it we took it like and not just took it but like we showed you what the real Queen of Heaven is right right I mean okay so sheemish is another good one right so one of the um hypostases of sheemish that was worshiped actually in jerus in Pagan Jerusalem you know was called sheemish Sedaka um so teda or tedak it means Justice or righteousness and so it's the son sheemish means son like the sun in the sky the son of son of righteousness or son of Justice well this gets used in Malachi to refer to the son of righteousness who Rises with healing in his wings and then in the Orthodox church we use that same phrase son of righteousness in our Nativity AP potian to talk about Christ who gets worshiped by star worshippers who now go on to worship the real son of righteousness yeah yeah yeah you know the the the troparion the Christmas troparion is a great example of that exactly where we show how those that worshiped the stars are now worshiping the maker of the Stars basically right yeah and and we're doing it by taking their Pagan language and applying it to Jesus you know so it's again it's in Malachi so it's in the Old Testament so it's nothing new for Christians it's in the Old Testament right uh but the New Testament of course does this stuff too and the there's a lot of examples we could point to but but particularly I like to look at St Paul in the areopagus where right before that chapter before that it says he's really mad because he sees that Athens is full of idolatry right so initially you get the sense of oh okay so when he goes up to areopagus he's going to let him have it he's going to be pical Paul right but of course that's not what happens when he's on the areopagus instead he takes this altar to the unknown God and says I'm here to Proclaim it this unknown God to you I mean that altar was a pagan altar that Pagan sacrifices were offered on I want to invite you all to the very first symbolic World Summit over 3 days we will finally meet in real time in real space and everyone from this little corner of the internet will be there to explore the theme of reclaiming the cosmic image of course I will be speaking there will also be Martin Shaw who is an amazing mythographer father Steven D young of Lord of spirit Fame there will be Richard Roland from the universal history series vper Stamper Nicholas kotar and Neil de grade that you've all seen on my channel here and there for entertainment we have everyone's favorite apocalyptic band The One and Only dirt cor Robins this event will be the chance of a lifetime to capture and embrace our current moment so join us from February 29th to March 2nd 2024 in Tarpon spings Florida visit the symbolic world.com Summit for more information I will see you so Wings andies our that altar was a pagan altar that Pagan sacrifices were offered on right it was not some crypto Jewish altar or something like that this is a pagan altar but you know even more interestingly probably a little less obvious uh he quotes from two Pagan poets uh so he quotes from EP amenities of creit who that line in him we live and move and have our being uh he also quotes from aratus um who talks who says you know and we also are are his offspring well both of these lines are about Zeus like this is Zeus poetry and Paul is saying yeah yeah I'll I'll take that you know I'll I'll apply that to the one true God right so he's he's subsuming it into what he's doing he doesn't look at it as being sort of hopelessly polluted yeah um I this is so important I mean especially when you look at I mean the main objection obviously to Orthodoxy and to Catholicism from Protestants are often these types of things where they look at at at the the the styles of worship or aspects of worship that they can see in the Pagan World they see it coming into Christianity and then they wonder you know it doesn't mean that well they don't have the wonder they declare then that the worship is Pagan but this is something like even in in terms of the revelation of the Tabernacle from God himself you know the structure of the Tabernacle is this the structure of every single Pagan temple in oh yeah in the world a three- tiered structure you know with like the most holy place where you would have that usually they would have the idol there that would be hidden and they would be revealed on certain on certain uh in certain feast or whatever but the structure itself is is a universal structure and so and so it's so the way to see it it's like you could see it in in a bunch of ways which is that on the one hand the Pagan uh Traditions are actually twisting the true faith and now God is twisting it back towards what towards its rightful its rightful uh direction or you could see it that God is able to cover over our sins right he's like okay this is what you do I'm gonna take this I'm gonna make it I'm gonna turn it in its right direction but either way whether it's one or the other you know that seems to be what God is doing all the time which is saving that which is lost yeah I mean it says in the Psalms right that the Earth is the Lords in the fullness thereof but but sometimes people when who have this idea of kind of religious coutis um they would say the Earth is Lords and the fullness thereof except for these parts which are sort of hopelessly not his anymore you know don't don't touch that um yeah so this kind of thing continues right so I gave just a couple of examples from the Old and New Testament I could we could talk for hours about just the Bible um but but Christians continue doing this so um of course as an iconographer you know full well that the tradition of Byzantine iconography owes a lot to the tradition of Egyptian ferial art yeah right like if you look at the the art that was on that was related to Egyptian funerals I mean again these are pagans these are demon worshippers yeah even even the RO Roman it's Roman it's exactly it has that Egyptian aspect to it and then it also has a a very strong Roman element for example the the way that Christ his Blessing hand like would we say that Christ is blessing like this that's a Roman sign of address it's a you can see the Roman Emperor doing it in the first century on statues and so you know this is but it's funny because it the funniest thing about this honestly Father Andrew is that this the same person that can look at ancient Pagan practices and see how Christianity transformed them towards the worship of God will like without non- apologetically have a rock band on stage in church and like and I realize that it's like you know using the language of the culture to and transforming it it and it's not even transformed usually in terms of the the rock band on the stage but it's like the Christians actually did a very deliberate theological ad bringing in of these elements and transforming them like the way that Roman art for example moves from paganism to Christianity you can see it happening you can look at you know the sensual elements being toned down you know the different the these different elements are being toned down these are played up you know the the use of the Halo was used for the emperor for example so now we we we it's a pagan sign that was there before and so then we're like no we're going to reserve this only for the Saints only for Christ and his mother and so you can see the transformation happening but it's a it's not just accidental like it's not just like it's not just like taking a rock band and putting it on stage in your church it's a theological transformation of the Pagan things into the Christian world there's a creative engagement right it's not just sort of adoption there's an adaptation also happening um yeah I mean there's some things that you could point to as being almost adoption at least initially and then the adaptation happens later one really obvious example are uh Christian calendars so the Julian calendar I mean it's not named for St Julius uh you know it's named for the divinized emperor exactly Emperor the divinized emperor literally named for what pagans would have regarded as a pagan God Julius Caesar is a p is a God you know from a Roman Pagan point of view um and it's not just the Julian calendar I mean the Coptic calendar is based on Egyptian paganism um you know now we think of these as being calendars that belong to churches yeah but they didn't start their lives that way um and the churches did not say let's start with something brand new and what's funny is they they didn't really take the Jewish calendar very much I mean there there are elements in the church calendar that are from the Jewish calendar but the basic idea of a solar year for instance a 365 or so days um these are these are pagan things um one of the probably more obvious ways that Christians uh dealt with paganism early on and um you see it in a lot of saints lives is that Pagan temples get turned into Christian churches um so the altars that were you know had had Pagan sacrifices put on them become altars to God or sometimes what they'll do is they'll take the building smash the altar replace that um and but the structure is is you know a pagan Temple like um lots of examples of that the Parthenon in Athens of course was actually a Christian Church longer than it was a pagan Temple but it was a pagan Temple you know now it's a museum but um uh you know there's a number of of well the pantheon in Rome is one of the most also the the most shining biggest example that's still at church now yeah oh yeah yeah so I mean there's there's a gazillion examples of this of pagan temples that become Christian churches and even the Basilica architecture itself was from Pagan civil architecture yeah you know um so it wasn't even for worship it was you know although there's no such thing as secularism in the ancient world right uh so civil architecture is sacred architecture in the ancient world um another one of my favorite examples of course is the classic uh tretis by St basil the great called the address to young men on the uses of Greek literature um and essentially it's his take on how you read Homer and heat and so forth and he doesn't say like that's Pagan don't read it uh but instead he actually says this is the weird part he says you need to master this before you can read the Bible which I mean I Don't Preach that and I would never counsel anybody with that here in 2023 but I mean it's a pretty we do something like that Father Andrew which is that you know it's like I actually made the mistake with my kids at the outset to just like straight up read the Bible stories to them which which which was probably not the wisest thing to do and and I realized that actually fairy tales are a good ramp into Bible stories and so we usually do something like that with our kids is that our kids know the fairy tales more than they'll know the Bible story is at the outset and as they get older you know like8 nine 10 years old then it's easier for them to kind of to to to take in especially those Old Testament stories that are that are rough at the outset um and so we see I think we do something similar with fairy tales that St basil talks about in terms of the ancient yeah um another example of this and this is one that's a little controversial but I'm gonna at least mention it um St uh St John of Damascus he wrote a text called uh the life of saints barlam and joa um and a lot of people say that this is essentially just an adapt of the life of Gama Buddha Buddha the Buddha um I don't know if that's true I mean I've never really studied this closely it may be that he simply took that story and told his story in a way that's reminiscent of it uh who knows I don't know but it's but but there is a possibility that there's at least some kind of influence and that's not even you know that's not the comfortable paganism no yeah exactly very far which is so funny like it's funny we think of demon worship by Greeks and Romans and Egyptians is like we can deal with that but Buddhism like whoa whoa whoa what do we do with that stuff yeah it's freaky uh again controversial I'm not saying that that's where he got it from I I I don't know but you can read about it on the internet um uh some other stuff that's probably a little bit more um provocative but much harder to just uh whisk away um So within Germanic Christianity so this is later right this you know Germanic peoples get christianized later in church history um not until largely like the e8th nth century and as you're moving on because it's moving North right yeah um so a a fun example I like to point out to people is there is a an object called the Franks casket yeah I saw it in the British museum there it's amazing yes it's most of it is at the British museum there's one panel of it that's in France um although I think they have a copy of that panel at the British museum so you can see the sort of the complete thing yeah Frank's casket is really interesting so um you know it's made in 8th Century northumbria so that's Northern England and it's generally believed to have been made by mocks okay um and it was based on the size and shape it's probably a reliquary we're not certain but but probably a reliquary yeah you know uh and it's called a casket but it's it's it's you know it's it's this little box yeah yeah it's a yeah yeah uh it's not like to hold a body but it's the same shape yeah as what we would put a body in and that's deliberate because if you're G to put a put the relics of a saint in something you would want to put it in something that looks like a coffin you know at least that's what most of Christian history has done yeah so if you look at the the uh the images on the Frank's casket um one of them is the three wise men you know approaching the Virgin holding Christ and they're offering their gifts and you're thinking okay good this is a good strong Christians image no problem uh but then you start walking around the casket and you know figuratively of course because again it's just a little box uh on on one side you've got ramulus and Remis the founders of the Pagan founders of pagan Rome you know uh being raised the wol in like Northern England like right it just shows you that Universal history thing that we keep helping getting people back to we should say how many pagans are there in North Umbria in the 8th Century probably none it's probably all Christian yeah exactly yeah so there are Christians making this thing uh there's at least one of the panels that people aren't sure exactly what it is another one is a battle that takes place in Jerusalem and then the one if you look at the panel that has um the three wise men in the virgin on it and the lord it's actually there's it's a 5050 panel so on one side you've got that on the other side you have whand the Smith who is this semi divinized Germanic Smith you know Divine Smith Figure who makes magical weapons uh and that often Gods get Apprentice to so they can become powerful like it's it's it clearly and so it's it's this Pagan image right next to a Christian image on the but it's it's it's it's interesting in the the casket because the Christian image is the image of the pagans coming to worship Christ that's what the that's what the image is yes it is yes it is you know so it's interesting you know this Northern uh English thing and so it's got this Germanic Pagan image but then it also has stuff from Roman history uh all together because that's the cultural soup of Northern English Christianity in the 8th Century yeah but it's it's but it's if you listen to some of the arguments that you've heard when you were younger like that you heard people say you could you had these two arguments one was Christianity is just syncretism it's all just borrowing from pagans whatever and then the other one is Christianity destroyed all the ancient Cults they went in they broke everything and they they ruined the whole Christian world it's like you can't have those two at the same time the actual reality is that it's neither of those yeah that's right it's neither of those Christianity as Christianity took hold it integrated the things it could integrate it it it it it kind of let fall to the side the things that couldn't be integrated and it it ended up with a a world that was based on the ancient Pagan World in terms of a lot of the forms but moving using its meaning pointed towards God and towards Christ you know yeah yeah another fun thing from that same period of anglo-saxon Christianity and I just have to mention this um because I don't know if Richard's gonna mention this in your bolf class you're doing with him but this was something I came across as I was doing transl translation work on bolf um so there's a phrase that shows up in it uh which is in in Old English it's Al Walda Al Walda right and a lot of editors actually um edit this to make it Al Walda to make it a single word Al Walda now that single word means all ruler so it's like pentor right and this is referring to God it's pretty clearly referring to God but if you look at the actual man manuscript it's two separate words Al and Walda so Walda is ruler UL means elves oh yeah so it refers to God as the ruler of elves um which you know adjust the translation a little bit you get Lord of spirits right that's right um so so that's interesting so that's clearly a Germanic Pagan reference you know elves right right elves are just kind of spirits in Germanic paganism yeah but again it's an 8th century Christian writing this yeah um yeah Al Walda um so okay a couple examples from Norse Christianity because I'm comfortable with the with the Germanic stuff um so in the 13th century there's a church built in Norway called The hilstad Stave church the church doesn't exist anymore but it's doorposts still do and they're in a museum now uh but they were on a couple of different churches if you look at the doorposts they are carved wood it's beautiful stuff it's really really astonishing um and it is the legend of seur and faf from The volsunga Saga which again is dramatic paganism um you've got you know sigard who is this sort of semi Divine figure you've got rean who is definitely a Divine figure you've got faf definitely a Divine figure faf of course is a dragon uh you know in the legend you know sigard goes down and kills faffer because rean wants him to so they can get the enchanted gold and uh then they decide to uh they're going to eat him because when you eat a dragon it makes you gives you magical powers and he actually tastes some of the juices from the heart and gives him the ability to understand the language of birds as it always does as it always does um but this was on the front of a church yeah you know I had someone tell me one time when I said can you explain this to me and they said oh well that was probably to lurin pagans so they they would see this and they would come in and and then they and I'm like okay well number one let's imagine you're a pagan Norse Pagan you see this and then you go in and it's clear that this building is dedicated to worshiping some other God like is that really going to work on you and number two there are no pagans in 13th century Norway exactly they're gone for hundreds of years for for for several Centuries by hundreds of years yeah uh and and another example of course from that time and place U well not that place but close to that place Iceland you get the pros which is one of the major sources of Norse um Pagan mythology yeah this is written by snor sterlon who is a Christian again he's never met a pagan in his life because his great great great great great great grandparents all got baptized uh you know so he we don't have any uh sources of Norse paganism that aren't written by Christians yeah and you see I mean and you can if you look at the the the closer like closer to the Mediterranean you see the exact same thing happening you know you know the fact that we have boas's text which is a Christian text written with so much Pagan subtext and all of these Illusions to to these to these allegorical figure the fact that you'll find in the Middle Ages people still invoking the mus is you know these are just things that were part of Christianity and and to try yeah to try to parse it one way or the other is is is is just the wrong way to go and to to say that Christianity just basically infiltrated or whatever no this was a conscious thing when you get to Dante you can see that when Dante wrote his poem it didn't shock anyone it's not like everybody was like oh no look at him he's like meeting all the it's like he's mixing Christianity and paganism it was just like oh wow this is a great you know nice synthesis of what we pretty much think and we've always thought we've always believed for the last you know 800 years or whatever yeah yeah I mean it's funny like you mentioned boethus right so his consolation the philosophy the big major text uh when Alfred the Great does his translation into Old English of eus he adds in bits about uh Giants uh from Biblical and enoic texts to sort of expand out that that that stuff so I mean just talk just think about the layers in that yeah yeah yeah um okay so um I I want to fast forward a little bit um another example of Christian you know and relatively recent Christian engagement with paganism uh in Alaska very famous athabascan Spirit houses which you can see they're not too far from Anchorage um if you ever visit Alaska worth seeing I mean this is a a pagan practice of building sort of little houses over Graves yeah for the spirits to live in for a while um and you know the the Saints the Orthodox Saints who engag with these people in the 18th century uh let them keep that but sort of reinterpreted it you know got them away from creem you know but reinterpreted this I mean you can go see this so if you go there and you see these Spirit houses they have three bar crosses on them yeah um you know it's it's really something um and then another thing I wanted to mention that probably would would freak some people out uh the the the numeral system that we use we commonly call them Arabic numerals right which okay that doesn't sound too threatening but actually they are traditionally called Hindu Arabic numerals because they are Hindu in origin and also then really developed by Muslims so in that by using those numbers we are using a A system that was designed in many ways for numerology and all kinds of stuff like this uh every day I mean we're all doing this so it's it's a system that's a combination in some ways at least how it got to us of Islam and of course Hinduism which is essentially a sort of pagan set of traditions um so that's that's a lot of fun okay so um so okay that's Christianity and paganism there's lots of things more we could say about that but I wanted to talk about historical now historical Christian Orthodox Christian engagement with non-orthodox Christianity with other Christians right again we know full well the pmics we know full well the anathematization of Heretics I affirm all of that right but also what's going on right now it's like it's a little tricky all of it with the cnid of cality or whatever I know like it's all in the air God bless them um yeah yeah so so I affirm all that I'm not a denter um I'm Orthodox but also in our history um alongside that um so there is one there's a feast of the martyrs of Nan um which I can't remember the date of that right now off the top of my head and I didn't write it down but the one of the main figures in that he's often called St arthus now his Arabic name is actually alhar um so where is naan nran is basically Southwestern Arabian Peninsula um and the they were Christians and there was a a sort of a judaizing king named dun noas who came in and uh wiped out almost all of them I mean there were some left after he did what he did and so they are commemorated as Mar Martyrs on our on our calendar like if you're an an Eastern Orthodox Christian of whatever variety the martyrs of Nan are on your calendar St arthus and so forth so what kind of Christians were they in nazran were they byzantines were they Greeks probably not no it was a it was they were mostly what we would call Oriental Orthodox yeah uh but there was also a significant presence of the Assyrian Church of the East than historians um so they're on our calendar these are actual saints that are on our calendar and someone someone might say well you know um uh you know martyrdom you know martyrdom kind of CLE cleans up some of I mean actually we have saints saying that the the blood of martyrdom does not wash away the stain of heresy and yet these are Martyrs that are on our calendar yeah right uh another related figure from this time and place is he's called St Caleb or St elban he is the king of axum so anyone who's been watching your so your channel for a while knows where is he's a saint in our in our on our calendar yeah oh yeah really CA cause he yeah yeah because he's related as he's sort of a protector of these nran Christians um again I mean he's the king of Ethiopia Ethiopian Kingdom which makes him and this is late enough that makes him what we would refer to as Oriental Orthodox yeah again he's a saint on our calendar I did not know that this is amazing information father yeah yeah um so uh another example I I would give um you know St Isaac of Syria yeah not a martyr not a martyr as far as we know he dies in in peace um canonically he belongs the ass what we would recognize as the Assyrian Church of the East than historians yeah now I've never heard that there's anything in his theology or any of his writing that that is an historian yeah but his whole life was spent outside the canonical boundaries of you know what we would recognize as the Orthodox Church yeah what would you do without St Isaac though and his W can't get rid of St Isaac come on through his writings he becomes a saint to the Orthodox church right again what do you do with that yeah um I don't I don't have a theory for this by the way like some sort of method by which you decided this probably the best way to understand it is that it's not a it's not there's the rule and then there's the messiness of the reality right it's like there's the there's the kind of organic recognition of Holiness that the church that the church does and it's like how did it happen I don't know how it happened but there it is and it's it's like don't argue with st Isaac you I dare you to it's like he's he's such an amazing Saint yeah and it's been I mean it's been long enough like there's no there's no going back on this yeah yeah exactly yeah you can't kick him out you know yeah although there are examples where we did yeah so uh one example not talked of about a lot talked about a lot but there was I can't remember which one it was now but there was a metropolis in Greece that some centuries ago celebrated the Feast of Thomas aquinus really I mean oh yeah yeah yeah um in fact I think there are recordings available of his hymns Orthodox h for Thomas aquinus um now is that still happening no it's not but you know he was another another example of someone that threw his writings because there's a whole like Orthodox history of Engagement with the writings of Thomas ainus yeah of course through his writings at least in one place for a while he became celebrated as a saint yeah it did not last and I know there are some like uh for example there's a a pilgrimage site uh are Lady of Walsingham in England that is recognized by the Orthodox and that the Orthodox go to on pilgrimages but that is is from after the Schism it's like yeah it's got an orthodox Chapel there yeah exactly uh that that I think is maintained by an orthodox nun you know um so I want to give one final example before we start talking about Lithuania um but I just kind of wanted to set up these patterns that exist that exist everywhere in church history there's thousands more we could probably talk about um so uh a writer named Lorenzo scupoli is a 16th century Roman Catholic priest and he wrote a book called spiritual combat and it's about I mean it's it's about what it says on the label yeah uh so um this this this work became um very interesting to a lot of Orthodox Christians and in the a uh 18th century St Nicodemus of the Holy Mountain you know the guy who puts together the rudder um and the exarion you know and the ortho Orthodox like the most Orthodox yes yes people look at him as like super hardcore you know anti- everything I don't like yeah uh he takes this work and edits it a little and puts it out in Greek I mean this again this is about 16th century Catholic priest right um and then it gets further reviv IED and published in Russian by St theun the Reus wow so St theun you know does even more with it right so St Nicodemus just sort of edits a little bit I'm not sure how extensive the edits were but St theon's edits were much more extensive that I know um and then you know there's even a sort of set of volumes that were actually put up by consilier press a long long time ago with titles like victory in the Unseen Warfare and sort stuff like this that was a sort of um lame man's version of of this you know like taking it apart and looking at it and explaining it and so forth right so this is a Catholic text that's made its way into the Orthodox church and actually been handled and promulgated by Saints Yeah by Saints you know again no one doubts the Orthodoxy of St Nicodemus no one dos the Orthodoxy of St the and the recluse these are significant Saints of the you know relatively modern period age yeah that's amazing I mean but I think in some ways to me at least what it does is it it it it's I think it it's there to also keep us humble and to be careful you know to understand that God we don't we don't cont we have the Cannons and we should live by them but that also God is not in the box that we think he is God does not you know like we need God and God does not need you could say does not need us in the same way let's say that that that that God is is is manifesting himself where where he pleases that's right that's right okay so let's talk about Lithuania all right with all that background um yeah you know everywhere you go there on uh pretty much every Catholic church and I've even seen some of this in some of the Orthodox Churches although most of the Orthodox Churches there are very Russian um but uh almost everywhere you go you see the The Sun Cross right and um so it's again it's what it says on the label right it's a cross with a sun sort of imagery integrated into it there's lots of versions of this and sometimes you'll see a crescent moon at the bottom which is interesting you know Orthodox Christians seeing a crescent moon at the bottom of a cross we largely might think of okay this is about conquest of Islam yeah but in in the Baltic case it's not you know um the bals are not conquering Islam it exists there but only it's always been a minority you know um yeah so it's the Sun and Moon um you know and and this cross was a pagan symbol it was absolutely a pagan symbol and now you see it on the top of almost every single Church in Lithuania um you know there are no Lithuanian pagans still around although there are some neopagans but that's a newer thing yeah um so lping they're just LARPing anyways God bless them I think that is true um so um so one really interesting um bit of material culture from Pagan Lithuania is something and I'm know I'm going to mispronounce this but you probably don't have a lot of actually you do have some Lithuanian fans oh you do I met some of them when I went to Lithuania that's hilarious in fact when I gave I gave a a year ago when I gave a talk at a church in vnus one of the first questions that someone asked me was do you know Jonathan P it's like well he's Canadian he's Canadian yeah well that means I need to go to Lithuania I've always wanted to go oh you totally if you go I will go with you you to go as your fellow pil let's do it I think you would find it a very interesting place to go um so yeah so there's a figure from Baltic paganism called the uh dvis and what that word means literally is godmaker uh so a godmaker is a Carver of religious images oh there you goh so that's that's what that is uh and so back in the day you know this guy would have been essentially carving idols H right um idols and also then used in actual uh Pagan worship but then also essentially Pagan icons that are used for devotional purposes the house house idols and things like that right right right and um so these are these traditionally were placed up on top of wooden poles um and so this is called I'm I know I'm going to get this wrong too uh coplet stus a coplet stus which means Chapel pillar now is sort of the idea so you can see that word coplet is related part that piece coplet is related to the word Chapel um and so it would be a wooden pole and then on top of it you would have this this carved um statue and then there would usually be a roof over top of it um and then often The Sun Cross on top yeah right um so this uh survives but now if you find one of these things and they're actually all over Lithuania like you could just be driving along and just see one by the side of the road often in the middle of nowhere you know um if you see one now you're not going to find uh dvas or perkunas you know who are these these Baltic Gods you're not going to find them on the c stus um you're gonna see most often there's a figure called rupen Tois so rupen Tois is is Christ um as he's going to to his passion so there's sort of two different poses you'll see him like with his face and his hands like this often called the pensive Christ or you sometimes see him standing and bound you know his hands are bound yeah so this is rupen Tois often called the Pence of Christ that's the most Russian tradition of that too of like in some of the remote places of Russia they have this whole carving tradition with that figure very important where do you think they got it yeah yeah it's probably the same it's from there it's from the baltics um and of course it spreads into it's throughout the former polish Lithuanian Commonwealth so you've got it in Poland as well they've got it in Belarus they've got it in Ukraine um yeah um often then you'll see uh if you don't have rup and to yellis there you'll see um the the Virgin Mary uh you'll see lots of saints especially St George uh is pretty popular um also of course the Catholic St kmir uh who is the the Catholic patron of of Lithuania not an Orthodox Saint but he's he's their big Saint uh he's buried there in their National Cathedral um so related to that you'll also see again the same the Carver the wood carver called aisus which means crossmaker there you go uh and you know the the Lithuanian standing crosses are basically an extension of this uh Deus practice that's the name of the person but I don't remember what the name of the practice itself is but it's an extension of that but it's but obviously focusing on the cross itself right and they can be incredibly ornate yeah you know I just made one by the way oh really yeah uh three meter like nine foot cross with a single mass that that goes into the ground and and it's know goes into three and there's Mother of God and St John the Sun and the Moon at the top and a little roof at the at the top yeah a massive project yeah yeah uh and so sometimes there will be little statues embedded right at the the point where the cross pieces meet usually Christ again often usually the rup to yellis uh but it can be other figures sometimes too and again you'll see these by the side of the road uh they will be placed there sometimes in commemoration of an event or of of people um a lot of Pious people just put them in their yard like so you there be there 10 15 foot tall cross in the front yard you know um and a lot of churches have them in the churchyard yeah as well um so and then of course the the classic you know place where people might have seen these is the hill of crosses where there's uh hundreds of thousands of them and um there's actually a legal limit on the size of a cross you're allowed to place there which is nine meters that's amazing if you're gonna if when we go to Lithuania decide you want to put a cross there just be aware that Li me I love it it's hilarious because it's like in North America you would expect it to be like five feet or something something like some ridiculous small thing it's like well there is a legal limit but you know nine meters don't go beyond that these things Tower over you I mean it envelops you it envelops you yeah and you know this is in many ways this is a spiritual heart of this country and it's not just Roman Catholics that go there although obviously mostly Catholics you can go there and you can see Orthodox crosses there um and and Protestants go there as well you know and um often you see PE writing on many of them it's usually lists of names of people that they want to pray for and most of the writing of course is in Lithuanian but you can see many languages many many languages from all over the world people that have made their pilgrimage brought their cross there um so I mean it's largely regarded as a kind of a Catholic place of pilgrimage but orthodox Christians go there I've been there twice now myself I placed a cross there both times and brought you know two of my children with me they placed a cross there with the names that they wanted to pray for on there you know what is the this hill what is the story about the hill like why why do people go there what's the what's the legend or the story related so there's a lot of there's a lot of different origin stories uh for the hill of crosses but the one that I think is the truest one um is uh so the hill of crosses seems to have Arisen during the Russian imperial period um that's the earliest references to it so you're talking like early 19th century possibly um and um the the there is a tradition that uh there was a man who had a a a daughter who was very very ill and so he was at her bedside every night praying to God to please heal her and then finally um after a long time of this uh the Virgin Mary appears to him and says um take up your cross and bring it to the place that I'll show you and so this man becomes aisus and he fashion this wooden cross and he starts carrying it you know and it's it's a long distance and then finally she appears to him again and says this is the place and so now Lithuania has no mountains so actually the word um uh Kus for for m mountain is just means a hill yeah uh you know so they'll use the same word like they would use Kus to refer to the mountains that we have here in North America but but they know full well that there's no comparison between them you know um so it's a hill and it's kind of a long hill so it's spread out you know o over a ways and has a couple of Peaks to it um and so he places the cross in this hill and then he begins the walk back home and then when he he's reaching his where his home is uh two people come running out of the house to uh to greet him one is his wife and one is his healed daughter who now can not only stand but run you know and so so then it the tradition then grows that you if you're going to go there you bring a cross and it can be I mean people bring crosses that are like this uh everything from this to you know N9 meters smaller ones people will hang from bigger ones so you can find crosses that have like hundreds of crosses hanging from them uh leaning up against them I mean it's just it's just a mess of crosses but a beautiful mess yeah um and then you know it gets especially during the Soviet period the Soviets of course hated this place so they would bulldoze it down or light it on fire um and they would wipe it all out and then overnight it starts growing back because people just come and they Place their cross and they pray their prayers um you know some place the cross there because they're praying for um someone who's ill or praying for someone who has died um some place it because of a happy occasion like the first time I went for instance there's a woman who's bringing along her her boy and says come on let me show you the place where I put the cross when you were baptized you know so so that kind of thing um again it's a place of sort of universal Christian pilgrimage they don't check your religious ID card at the door um you know um so yeah um another one that's probably a little bit controversial from Lithuanian history and and people might not realize it's Lithuanian history uh is the Orthodox St Peter moila so St Peter moila is the Metropolitan of Kiev um and during uh after the the you know the loss of the churches to the to the union um so Kev of course in Ukraine but the grand duy of Lithuania includes most of buus and Ukraine at that point in history and at that point is actually then part of the the uh the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth right so St Peter moila a lot of people pointed him and say he's a latinized Latin textbooks he's a latinized saint so that means you have to deal with what he did we can critique it but um there's actually been you know so some Scholars of course like um father George fosi really critiques him and says this is a latinization and so on and so forth but there's other scholarship that you can read now that essentially says well St Peter was actually trying to do with Catholic theology that was around him and that he had to deal with because he's living in it he was trying to do with that like the early church fathers were doing with Pagan philosophy so I'm I'm not an expert to tell you what the truth of the matter is but I mean this is another way of interpreting him and it's worth kind of exploration so that's actually a theological engagement it's not just sort of material culture stuff it's actually like language and and so forth you know um so that's a really he's a really interesting figure um I want to finish up by talking about a couple of icons but before I do that there's a significant practice that I want to mention so in Lithuania there is a two-day holiday called valines uh so Venus um from the word uh I think it's velis which means Soul so Venus is November 1 and 2 They're All Souls basically exactly it's the the Feast of All Saints and All Souls and uh in the Catholic tradition and the practice in Lithuania on those days is to visit the graves of your departed loved ones so if you go to Lithuanian cemeteries they're not like most cemeteries in North America where it's just rope on row of stones and they've hired somebody to mow the lawn and there might be flowers that people put that die you know whatever um you know there's sometimes there's more to that more than that but I mean most cemeteries in the US yeah I don't know about Canada but most the they're pretty bare yeah in Lithuania every single grave plot is outlined in either cement or Stones so they're like little or or sometimes a fence yeah um and they're all like flower gardens and they're immaculately taken care of and it's not because there's some Gardener can you imagine how much work that would be yeah you know they're that way because the family takes care of them um I went to the cemetery where my ancestors are buried and I went to the grave and we found the grave actually of my family which was an astonishing moment you know um and it's it was immaculately taken care of everything was in perfect Order Perfect order right so so lithuanians visit the graves of their relatives twice a year once on the day that is the an the anniversary of the death and then also at V vainus right and particularly at vainus they will bring candles and place them there and so if you go to cemeteries in Lithuania at night during villain it's almost like another city with all the candles I mean it's just you can see an outline of the cemetery in candles it's just completely filled in with these little flickering Flames um so Orthodox Christians do this in Lithuania on those days even though those that's not the Orthodox Feast of All Souls of The Departed but they do it they visit the graves of their relatives they put the candles there are specific prayers to be prayed uh when you go there now it's interesting there's a sort of Orthodox adaptation that's occurred so the Saturday before the Feast of St Demetrius at the sliki is traditionally a Saturday of souls right we think of usually the ones in Lent but or around lent but but that's also a Saturday of souls traditionally in the Orthodox Church the Saturday before October 26th right so of course most most Orthodox Christians the are on the old calendar so that would mean that it's about November 8th or whatever is is when that or actually it's a Saturday before November 8th which sometimes would kind of coincide with villainous right right right you know because of course Catholics are on the new calendar um so what they do is they visit the cemeteries on vainus and then on that Saturday that's usually right after they go to church and they pray for the Departed in church so they created this hybrid practice you know again they're just they're they're taking something from Catholic practice and they're engaging in it themselves um and there are you talk to to Lithuanian Christians and and a lot of them will say now I don't know if the truth of this a lot of them will say oh villainous actually is is pre-christian yeah um which is believable you know yeah totally believable um so yeah so they make this kind of annual pilgrimage um to the graves of their family and again it's not because it's a feast day on the Orthodox calendar it's it's now those those are public holidays in Lithuania one of the advantages of what is at least still officially a Christian Nation um they have religious freedom but you also get November 1st and second off from work in school you also get you know August 15th off you get you know uh SE uh uh June 204th you know like in fact uh St John's day in June is a it's called yonis is a huge holiday there huge huge holiday right um and a fun little thing I was talking one of my Lithuanian friends one time because we had started to see uh fireflies in our yard I don't know if you have them where where you are yeah um and I asked him I said do you have fireflies in Lithuania he said oh yeah we have fireflies we call them yon Vialis I was like what does yon Vialis means he says it means St John's bug so they literally name the fireflies after the Forerunner there in Lithuania um probably because of the probably because of the summer Feast of year June 24th that's right right exactly exactly okay so I wanna I want to finish up with with Lithuania talk about two different icons um one that a lot of people probably know about and I think we talked about when I was with you uh with Richard when we talked about this documentary The Wolf from the cross before and that's our lady of the Gate of the Dawn I won't go into a lot of detail because we talked about it before but it's worth noting that this icon which is uh on above a gate in vilus the capital uh there's some possibility that it might have an orthodox origin there's some possibility that it might have spent some time in Orthodox Churches but there's no good evidence for that uh even if all of that is true for most of its life it's been in a Catholic Chapel in fact one of the times I went to see it in my most recent trip Mass was going on right in front of it when I went there right um this is the national icon of Lithuania Our Lady of the Gate of the Dawn and it's it's the theot too says she's depicted in Revelation chapter 12 clothed in the Sun the moon under her feet a crown of 12 stars like that's that's the image right and um a copy of this icon was very likely given to St Sarah from absar off and is the famous icon in front of which he prayed and in front of which he died yeah you know given to him probably in Kiev because veneration of this icon spread throughout you know the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth Grand D of Lithuania um you know Orthodox Christians make pilgrimage to that icon venerate that icon it has a feast day on the Orthodox calendar this as far as anyone has ever known Catholic icon is celebrated on the day after Nativity and local Orthodox Christians including the bishop including clergy go and pray on malban in front of this icon on the day after Christmas in this Catholic Chapel yeah right and it is you know it's it's this is the the calendar of the Russian Orthodox church has this icon on it um lesser known and this is one of the visits I made in my most recent stop in Lithuania so there is a monastery near Kus so Kus is sort of the Second City of Lithuania um it's in the center of the country it was for a Time the capital During the interwar period because vilus was held by the Polish uh during that period and so the capital gets moved to konus and uh second largest city so there's a monastery near konus was called pus Monastery so pus was uh built if I as I recall correctly in the E either the 16th or 17th century um and it was built as a Catholic Monastery right so it's built by Catholics for Catholics and um you know this is the uh the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth period and um so Catholicism is the official state religion of the whole Commonwealth of course there's still Orthodox minority a significant Orthodox minority especially if you look at the areas that are now Ukraine and belus but even still in Lithuania proper there were some Orthodox so pis Monastery one of the things that's um made for this Monastery is an icon of the Virgin Mary um and so it's called Our Lady of pus right and if you look at it uh it's it's painted probably by an Italian it seems to have been a gift from the pope um if you look at it it's a very Western sort of Renaissance depiction um you know it's not it's not sensual at all right it's actually very restrained you know um there's a sort of a a circle of roses in the icons so I mean it's not a Byzantine icon at all like a circle of roses like if you put that on an icon you know that would get returned probably you know um and so it's definitely a very Western depiction pagent by Italian gift from the pope for this Catholic Monastery okay and it's venerated you know uh Miracles start to be associated with this icon so in the late 18th century the partition of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth is complete with a third partition and Lithuania becomes part of the Russian Empire okay so um the Russian Empire I'll just say was not kind to Lithuania and in many cases engaged in religious persecution um which if you're interested in that episode four which has not yet been made but episode four of the wolf from the cross is going to be talking about Lithuanian and the Russian Empire um it's not be a comfortable story for a lot of people it's just the reality the Russian Empire engaged in in religious persecution of non-orthodox um and so one of the things that happened was churches and even monasteries that belong to the Catholic Church were taken and given to the Orthodox right and picis Monastery is one of those places so in the um I think it was in the 19th century um it becomes a cath an orthodox Monastery and and um I should mention by the way uh you know the architecture and the interior Decor of this Monastery is absolutely astonishingly beautiful it's really something uh very different from a lot of Western churches definitely different from Eastern churches but it's really really worth looking up anyway um so so what do they do with this icon that's like the alter piece you know so it's a major very prominent image in this church what do they do with this icon they say oh look at this Ian thing let's get this out of here get some good Russian iconography in here you know no they keep it yeah and they venerate it and they take the Catholic feast day of the icon and put it on the rashed calendar so it becomes a feast of the Orthodox Church of this miracle working Catholic icon Orthodox Christians make pilgrimage to it they especially would go on the dorm Mission um the feast day is July 15 it remains on the Russian Orthodox calendar if you go there now it is once again a Catholic Monastery um and uh so it was given back in when Lithuania became independent in 195 I think it was uh from the Russian Empire a lot of churches that have been taken from the Catholics were were given back to them you know and um so it reverts to being a Catholic Monastery and um so here's a couple fun details not only do Orthodox Christians continue to make pilgrimage to this Catholic Monastery to venerate this wonderwork icon that has a completely Catholic origin but was sort of Orthodox for a while the the Orthodox Church maintains the Feast of Icon even though the Catholics have moved it so what you're looking at when you see the July 15th Feast is the old Catholic feast day maintained by the Orthodox Church even now right um yeah so so this is still like you can look this up the Russians call it PESA PESA which I'm sure I'm probably mispronouncing but it's probably pretty close but the name of the monastery is pus you know um and so again this is an example of uh this sort of Horus border yeah right it's you know one could look at that and say ah syncretism you know but what's happening is simply as we looked at the tradition of the church yeah the Bible early Christianity and so forth um so right so so those are just some examples that I I could point out I mean there's there's a number of other things that we could mention like burial practices for instance um Orthodox burials in Lithuania tends to rather than having the cross at the foot which is sort of the Orthodox tradition they often will put the at the head which is you know in the west um and um you know there there's other things you could mention like that um yeah so you know in our life I mean it's like in our life this is at least for my life this is true you know I to be honest like you know you're not going to take take my Christmas songs away from me I don't know what to tell you it's like I love Western Christmas songs I think they're beautiful I think they're wonderful I wouldn't want them sung in liturgy but you're not going to completely take them away from me like you will hear them in my house and we will sing them and we will love them you know so there's some of that all over the place I think yeah I mean like just like let's just look at Orthodox Christianity here in the west uh we've taken a whole bunch of stuff from other Christians largely without um a lot of analysis in many cases right so Sunday school I mean Sunday I thought exactly Sunday Sunday school is probably the most obvious um uh seminaries I mean you know now seminaries existed in Orthodox history before it ever made it to here but seminaries are not the ancient Christian tradition like there are other ways of training clergy um you know you mentioned Christmas carols I mean that's a really really good example Christmas carols and you know it's great you know many many Orthodox in the west will sing the Christmas carols from wherever their tradition is from um but I mean you can still going to hear Joy to the World and Silent Night and you know this stuff that's that's just the English language Christmas Carol reparatory you know yeah um another great example I think of this um is uh the fact that we have Parish membership yeah yeah that's not a thing in MO mostly on the other side of the Atlantic uh in Orthodox Church Parish councils all that stuff bearish councils are another big example of that um and you know something that's dear near and dear to both you and me media yeah yeah using using especially modern media for orthodox purposes the Catholics and the Protestants were there long long before us right um so all right so I mean like what what what's the takeaway from all of this stuff um yeah it doesn't mean that anything goes I think it's important to be careful it's like we're not all saying that all right so then you know whatever like it all it's all it's all but it it's really about hierarchy you know it's usually just a an understanding of hierarchy is that we have we have the the main traditions we have the Cannons we have all of these things which guide us and then we have to understand that those are not like a machine they're not like a computer that runs and that that tabulates it's a it's an organic reality that's connected to the world and and there's room for God to act within that in ways that surprise us yeah I mean you know like so like why does the church do this how does the church do this um the first question I think is easier to answer than the second one but I I should say it's not about putting a stamp of approval on non-orthodox religion obviously not the same Old Testament that uh you know pokes fun at the gods of the Nations also steals their stuff you know uh right so so it's not about putting a stamp of approval it's not right um it also doesn't happen without creative engagement like there are always changes made to the work to make it conform to Orthodox Christianity and it can be maybe a little uncomfortable to see that in process yeah it's not clean it's not a clean thing it's messy process and and you know I've I've studied this and I intend to study this a lot longer but I I haven't found like a theory of it no like this is how you do that well or correctly you know but it's it's still a thing it's it's happening right um so like the why of it right um it's because whatever is being adopted and adapted I think it's important to put those two words together in this adopted and adapted it was seen as being for the Salvation of Christians like it's not about like oh I want to adulterate my Pure or or oh oh I'm some kind of you know liberal ACC humanist um that's not what's going on that's that's not what's going on um it's it's like oh here's something that we can use for the Salvation of people um and like I I I said this in the most recent episode of wolf and Lacrosse um an icon of the theotokos is an icon of the theotokos yeah like it is what it is like it might have been made by somebody that I would regard as as a heretic uh it might have spent all of its life in the hands of people who are not Orthodox Christians but it still is what it is yeah and the church is able to recognize that and does recognize that right um you know you know it's funny we have this saying now from the zeit guys love is love now they don't mean by that what I'm about to say but love is love which means that someone who's actually engaging in Acts of Love Real Love Christian love is doing it even if that person is not a member of the right church that's right it it is real all truth is God's truth I mean St Justin Martyr very famously talks about the the speros logos right the the logos and Seed form that he sees everywhere I mean he's looking at Pagan philosophy and we should remember that Pagan philosophers are not just not a bunch of Ivy Tower academic who never Sully themselves with religion these are actual demon worshippers yeah well also I mean it it's like read the read play folks it's there's stuff in Plato that you would blush at and so yeah you know so the idea that we can read it as Christians and we can take the good and let leave the bad fall to the Wayside is something the Christians did from the very beginning and that we continue to do through a whole history yeah I mean this is you know like this is what St basil says in that text that I mentioned earlier he says be like to be right this is the original be the be uh you know go to the Pagan flower take what you need and leave the rest that's that's what he saids yeah um you know he doesn't say you know Don't Go Near that right and and he's living in a time when paganism is on the Wayne he doesn't have to do that he he's not he's not feeling pressure from the society yeah exactly you know yeah he's on the winning side at that point yeah yeah late fourth Cent I mean he's yeah they're they're they're winning you know um so I I think that you know as if we look at this question of creative engagement um I believe that particularly at this time of polarization that we have so much of that where it's really about lining up all the guns and Blasting the other side which I mean pmic is sometimes appropriate the church fathers do it especially when someone is attacking or trying to undermine the church they I've never seen them do it simply because someone who has a wrong belief or wrong practice just exists you know it's really about it's it's a defensive thing to do they're not being defensive in the sense that we talk about it now but they're being Defenders but they're actually defending against actual attacks they're not um they're not looking for enemies they're not looking for people to debate they're they're actually defending against Real attacks right um and and here's the thing I believe that if we can if we can begin to understand this creative engagement better um not only can we do it ourselves and God willing do it well probably with some stumbles along the way like we're going to make some mistakes uh but we can make them in good faith but I think that this in many ways is a way forward out of the our polarizing it's a demonic Spirit actually the spirit of polarization it's a way forward out of that because it's actually about humility and demons can't do humility um and and it's not I would also say it's not just something that oh this is a good idea for now here in 2023 I think it's pretty clear this is what the church has always done because the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof or as St Paul said you know whatever things are good whatever things are true whatever things are honest whatever things are beautiful think on these things he didn't say whatever things are in this box that I'm presenting you with it's whatever things and he himself did this he took some of these whatever things and and made use of them you know so the same guy who said don't worship Zeus also took Zeus poetry and applied it to God it to God that's right so well thanks Father Andrew this is amazing I mean you know I'm gonna relisten to this just for all the examples there's so such wonderful examples that that can you help us see just to what extent this has been happening and and you're really also bolstering the you know what Richard and I's Universal history position is which is that like you said this is something the Christians have always done that even the Old Testament is already happening um and so we just need to yeah humility move forward with humility and also attention you know and prayer so thanks Father Andrew this has been wonderful and also and good luck I good luck with the continuation of the the wolf and the cross can't wait to see all that thank you it's a big it's a big project bigger than I think we realized but we decided we wanted it to be big uh so we're just going for it I mean it's going to be Nine episodes of two to three hours each so uh we just released episode three so as I like to say at the end of each episode we've got a lot more stories to tell all right thanks Father Andrew thank [Music] you
