ladies and gentlemen Hans nean has done it again Hans nean just played a chess tournament in Croatia called the tournament of Peace a historic tournament that has been going on for many many decades well Hans brought everything to Zagreb Croatia except peace Hans finished the tournament with eight points out of nine a performance rating of 2,946 in the last 10 years that has been ranked among the top five alltime performances in a chess tournament right underneath guys like Magnus Carlson and Fabiano caruana Hans is on fire he has gained like 30 to 40 points he's nearly back to 2700 ELO and in this video I'm going to show you a gangster game that he played against the legendary grandmas from Bulgaria Ivan chiarino that's all I have to say there is no sponsor for today's video the sponsor is is you you you you all all of you incredible people people worth more than a queen worth more than a rook worth more than Knight Bishop King all these pieces we're going to look at this game from Hans neeman's perspective so we can sit for once in the shoes of a competent chess player myself included all right isn't it crazy Hans has a rating like 25 200 points higher than some of you and me so Han's opponent Ivan Chapin played the move C4 this is known as the English opening it is a it is a very good opening uh it is a it's very it's a very historic and positional opening in the sense that it fights for the center in a positional way black will uh White will often times put the bishop on this long diagonal it's not an opening that I recommend for many beginners in intermediate players cuz it's not so forcing and the positions are a little bit too obscure and strategic and long-term and positional for you to play as a beginner because as a beginner you kind of have to worry about like looking both ways when you cross the street right like beginners might leave the house with their pants on backwards but the English is a completely reasonable opening at 2700 level hun plays Knight F6 which is a which is an interesting decision when you look at hans's second move which is E5 so Hans clearly had something in mind here and the thing about the English when white plays C4 is you don't know if white is going to play G3 Bishop G2 or if white is going to play Knight C3 Knight C3 is actually a pretty committal decision for example if black immediately plays E5 white might go here and so white never put a knight on C3 and since white never put a knight on C3 black doesn't have a bishop that targets the Knight on C3 by playing this move order Hans invites the move Knight C3 because maybe against this he's going to play something else chiparo plays Knight C3 so now Hans says all right cool E5 okay so he goes back to playing the central move E5 and we have a four nights English and in this position there have been many games played for example E3 D4 E4 is modern giving up the D4 Square giving up a little bit of dark Square control G3 is is the historic main line and it is chosen in this position as well the idea is to develop the bishop to G2 you will notice white has not touched a center Pawn right he has not e and D pawns are going to wait they're going to either step like this or like this or two right or maybe we just go with the D Pawn we leave the E Pawn at home for a little bit no problem all right and now black plays Bishop to B4 which is the entire reason that I think Hans delayed the move E5 until white went Knight C3 and then he went for this system because I have a feeling he would have done something different you know uh if uh chipino would have done something different if E5 happened on the first move and uh Hans would have done something different if chipu of Play Slightly etc etc etc we just keep going and going right so Bishop B4 and black has a very simple idea black wants to take like black would like to take so in the game chip plays Knight D5 right away and in many lines here black is actually completely fine taking the knight uh and then playing D6 and and building up on the dark squares but black also doesn't have to do that at all black can basically leave the bishop there until let's say A3 happens and you know then you're more than happy to capture because you were going to do it anyway the bishop B4 CH plays this move Knight D5 uh notice how nobody's thinking we're still in the opening life is still good the idea of Knight D5 is to hit a couple of pieces get out of the way of the bishop basically rendering it stupid and this exchange is very bad for white for black excuse me not just because you lose the defender of your Pawn but because after something like this the the C file is is a huge problem so take take that's not an issue but in the future you know white is going to Castle develop and and just the pressure here is going to be really annoying and and white is just comfortably better the entire game so it's really not worth taking the night instead Hans basically says look you haven't touched the center right you're playing in this goofy way where your Knights are dancing and everything so now I'm going to seize control of the center myself with this move E4 right and your knight cannot go there so black says I win space and I win time and I have and I force your knight to the edge of the board right and white says okay I'm fine putting my knight on the edge of the board because you overextended and now I'm going to go here and I'm going to Target this just as long as I don't blunder my king at the same time black is saying I don't care if you take my Bishop literally like like black just castles black says go ahead and take my Bishop because then you lose an act of Peace by the time you're trying to finish up your development suddenly I'm trapping your knight right like your knight is just stranded on the edge of the board so it you know you can almost say like both sides are trying to get something that they want and both sides are kind of you know it's like they're playing chess almost wow I guess that's what they're doing right it's a silent mental Battle of you want this and I want this but I want that well then give me a little bit of this lot of Dynamics at play right so Knight H4 castles and now something very interesting interesting in this position chiper plays a move that has been played like less than 1% of the time allow me to explain historically white has left the Knight here white doesn't take anything white develops black develops and defens his Pawn White Castles and then basically at some point black says you know what I think I waited a long time so maybe I'm going to bring my Bishop back like to C5 right now or I'm going to get taken and then white you know goes something like D3 and then after let's say take take black plays like Knight E5 oh that would be really nice but and then black brings the bishop back to C5 okay like just you know like take take Bishop C and and and the bishop said all right The Bishop's like it served its purpose now it needs to reposition and Target a a certain side of the board historically that is how this position has been played it's very balanced game very interesting game very dynamic position but in this position chipino plays A3 which is a way to play this position that of course is completely logical and yet totally illogical at the same time cuz welcome to 2700 level chess why would you play A3 if the bishop is going to go back anyway observe what I just did right Bishop G2 Rook E8 and then like Bishop C5 or D6 and after a big exchange the bishop goes back to C5 anyway so before black does anything else he's going to reposition his Bishop so why would PV play the move A3 like why would he tell Hans nean exactly where to put his Bishop well it's probably some sort of preparation right when a guy plays something that is surprising at the 700 level it might be good but chances are it's bad like a lot of you study openings when you're 1200 1400 600 a little bit too early at 600 but if you're like 1,00 you're starting an opening there's a very good chance that the move that your opponent played that's not in your opening course or your video is probably bad but if you can't exploit it it might actually be a really good move like if a move is horrible but only because of one reason and other than that it's like winning it's it's a pretty good move at 1200 level because it has to be punished right so at this level it's like well he played something unique which means that worst case scenario it's just equal okay D6 D6 is important because otherwise there's B4 and the bishop will get trapped okay B4 Bishop B6 and something like C5 so D6 is played okay now if B4 Hans can play Bishop D4 he can also go here and never have to worry about this move happening so white castles and Hans plays Rook E8 so Hans has fulfilled the destiny of his opening right he's spending a little bit of time here plays like spend a little time D6 Rook E8 and now the only way chiparo can make progress in this position is either to play D3 trading off Whit's uh Black's very powerful Center Pawn which is very well anchored or be B4 right B4 makes a lot of sense because you take space you can put your Bishop on this diagonal and then your knight can re-enter the game when it's ready but there is the question kind of at all times of G5 can't do it now because you'd lose because Knight takes F6 but there I mean again there is a very clear question of like at some point you know black can trap this Knight especially if it doesn't actually have a of a home to go to so chapar plays D3 SP one minute he plays the move D3 and black really cannot hang on to the center blockade because of the pressure on his Knight also if black makes a waiting move white is going to play Bishop G5 at which point black is in a lot of trouble PP on the pp so black needs to do something right now he takes the pawn on D3 as has happened historically many times in this position chiarino plays Queen takes now that trade benefits white because you remove the blockade and the bishop is strong and the queen is out but the tradeoff off of having no more blockade and a powerful bishop and a queen out is that black has the open E file and black can attack your queen and pawn right so like I said chess is give and take Hans plays Knight to E5 and chiparo plays Queen C2 this position has actually been reached once ever before uh according to the database the Master's database there was between a 2500 and a 2200 rated player and in that game black followed up the very logical move Knight to E5 which attacks the queen with a move that says I've had enough of your knight here please leave see black could develop the bishop but then you still get hit with this move it's very unpleasant because like I already told you taking here is bad because this file is very annoying to open up and black is in you know black black really has nothing they can do here unless black gets a pawn involved but let's not forget that move by chipino lost a little time like he played this opening in a in a very slightly different way and yet it's quite a big difference right it's quite a big difference so Bishop C5 back right in the rather in the opening is is the move that was trying to be uh avoided or rather not avoided it was the move that chiarino he played A3 uh to try to maybe throw Hans off a little bit but we fast forward to the middle game and now black plays C6 so black follows up the very natural Knight to E5 with the move C6 and this Knight has to go somewhere it does sharov goes back to C3 and officially we have reached territory that nobody has explored yet Knight C3 Queen C2 C6 okay in that game between a 25 and 2200 rated player I believe played in Brazil white went Knight E3 which kept the pawn defended but it blocked in the bishop but then of course white can play B4 or B3 and get the bishop out this way in this game we have Knight C3 chip putting in the is daring Hans Neeman to take the pawn on C4 and from this point forward this man Hans Neeman popped off if you don't know what popped off means you're about to find out ship have played Knight C3 and said Hans I dare you to take my Pawn now if hunts chickened out and instead played like A5 protecting B4 we would have gotten B3 Bishop D7 let's say Bishop B2 and a game would have developed where all the pieces were out one Pawn was traded and it was a big tense battle but instead of that H took the pawn so now black is a pawn up clean Pawn the only reason it's not minus one for black is because white has counterplay chiarino came prepared with an idea and his idea was Knight to A4 four the queen now attacks the Knight the Knight attacks the bishop I mean it has eyes on the bishop that is basically the point however if black is able to defend this Knight then you're good against this right you don't you don't but if you move the Knight then of course after take take take not only does white win the pawn back white also has two Bishops white will play here white will put the Rooks on the open file white will be very happy so Hans took on C4 and then he basically just said okay it should be six what's the idea I don't understand like you gave me a pawn now you do have a way to win it back here that you put in of in the game played Rook D1 he spent nine minutes he played Rook D1 the way that he can win the pawn back here is by playing B3 potentially right the idea of B3 is that if the Knight moves you're going to hit this twice but it's not over because Knight A5 wait a minute and that's why hans's Bishop E6 was such a clever defensive idea now you can take take Rook B won defending that pawn against these two pieces because the two pieces would be better than winning the rook and the pawn so just to put that on the board getting a knight and a bishop is very good for white so instead of that black would just have pressure here and for example if let's white would just have pressure on C5 let's say white went Queen E7 oh my God I can't say white and black queen E7 right then here comes the Knight suddenly that Knight comes alive and and and and white is putting a lot of pressure on the position the side with the Bishops wants to make trades even if sometimes it's for a pawn CU if you look despite being two pawns up in this position it's actually white who is calling the shots it's white who's pressuring everything you could be three pawns up for half a second and I take this and then I take the Knight right so that's the idea that is the idea that white has white wants to open up the position but chapar must have not liked something about B3 because he very very quickly decided you know what I'm not going to uh I'm not going to go for this idea despite you know it being a very natural followup like chipino 100% considered this move instead he played Rook D1 and he probably thought I'm pinning the pawn to the queen so the threat is to take the bishop right and now you know black can go here or here and he probably thought Hans is going to play Queen E7 and then I'm going to play E4 or B3 etc etc but Rook D1 was a mistake and it was a mistake because white is now no longer calling the shots this move very naturally brought the Rook out from where it was stuck to pressuring doing exactly what a rook should do right adding more pressure looking to bring another piece to the party unfortunately one thing chipino did not anticipate here was just how much he was weakening his own King when I say that you might think but how is that even because The Bishop's hanging so Knight G4 doesn't do anything it just loses a bishop right you're right yeah but what if Hans demon in this position sacrifices the what Bishop takes F2 he's just giving up the whole Bishop he says you want it take it take it you want it so bad you got to take it I mean if if you don't if you don't take it then then black will in fact play Knight G4 and it's over I mean black will then get the pawn out of the way bring the bishop back play Knight F2 it I mean it's just a matter of time you come here and Fork everybody so Bishop takes F2 King takes F2 but what is the followup I don't understand the queen cannot come help okay so Hans plays Knight G4 and here chaparo walks to the middle he joins forces with his pieces he could have played King G1 but then this move would have become possible you know how cuz then Hans would have played B5 and suddenly it's a very difficult position for white the Knight is hanging and queen B6 is game over for white like game over H3 is possible but then I go here so now you are forked and I'm threatening your knight as a nice little bonus so you you can't you can't do this I mean we we can go on a really long sequence of moves here like let's say Knight takes G2 and then Knight takes G2 and then I take but at the end of it black emerges with a better position so B5 was a key idea and even though white can get a lot of pressure here I mean it's crazy just stripping open the king's position here is a really really really good attack for for black so instead of that Shapino played King E1 which you see stockfish does not like okay stockfish doesn't like it and I got to tell you by the way King E1 does not take any of the pressure off with the move B5 does not take any pressure off with the move B5 because now where do you move the Knight if you move the Knight back to C3 I got news for you I'm still going here and you cannot stop Queen F2 it is Unstoppable you could play Knight to E4 then I go to G1 which is even worse so we were trying to stop Queen F2 before but now we can't even stop Queen G1 so B5 and and and and the entire position is about to collapse for chiarino he needs to play Perfect computer defense and to his credit he actually finds the best move here according to the engine which is Rook to D4 the idea of Rook to D4 is to keep an eye on both horses so if black takes the Knight what you do is you grab two pieces on the way out and now Black's attack is extinguished the black comes in and runs out of attacking pieces and actually white is better now so instead of that Hans Neiman doesn't take the Knight but this is now a constant threat you understand the threat is more valuable than the execution in chess the queen is ready to go here the second the Knight takes its Eye Off The Square the Knight doesn't want to take its Eye Off The Square because then the queen will go there but black can't take the Knight because then he gets this taken so he plays Knight E3 so now black threatens this and has an eye on that and continues to have an eye on that chipino takes the Knight H spent quite a bit of time there right that was a a key moment takes takes and now targeted and targeted and at the end of the day Hans nean does not need to end an attack with a Checkmate he can end an attack with with Just Right Queen C3 which targets the Knight and now just a very simple and straightforward solution to the position of course Hans can take and then he can take of course that is the simplest thing to do here take and take and then let's say this Hans is just a clean Pawn up targets The Rook if the Rook takes he takes on B2 if Queen D6 you win with Rook d8 so Hans is winning and yet he plays Bishop D5 the most precise way to win and it's not taking any of the pressure off of White's throat he got the foot on the neck it is a dominant position you now open up the Rook defending the Knight the Knight is pressuring the white position ready to jump in at a moment's notice the Knight here went there on move six literally Knight to H4 was white sixth move and now we fast forward some 20 moves into the future black is roaring forward the attack and the Knight is still there standing around like a spectator white plays Bishop to e oh interesting so it looks like a mouse slip looks like an over theboard Mouse slip but he's trying to disconnect The Rook from the Knight so if this queen E3 right that's what happens and now Hans slides back to make sure his Bishop doesn't get taken he attacks the Queen the queen goes here and now he takes the Knight now we can all exhale Hans now emerges from the attack up two pawns white could try to win the pawn back right which is what he does in the game so chiarino is now down a pawn but Hans has six minutes that's not a huge amount of time right H plays Rook E5 the idea of Rook E5 is to build Behind The Rook it's to Triple up the pressure cu the king went to the middle Rook E5 is a great move but Rook E5 has a hidden idea which I'm not going to tell you about just yet you are going to have to see it for yourself Rook E5 looks like it stabilizes the board and pressures and you want extra space behind The Rook but there's a key important detail that you might miss in this position chip played Rook D4 and the move he overlooked is G5 and he resigned what the idea of Rook E5 was not just to defend the position and to Triple pull up behind The Rook the idea of Rook E5 was to remove the F5 Square from the Knight and pawn to G5 tra the knight in its tracks you could not play G5 now because black white would play here you would still be winning but the Knight would be free the idea of Rook E5 was actually to restrict this knight from moving to its final safe Square bringing the pawn in front of the king and brutally winning it Hans targeted that Knight the same exact way he targeted the Knight on the other side of the board and I mean it is a mini lesson in and of itself Knights on the edge of the board right Knights on the rim are are Grim are dim or slim or gim all right are uh they the don't I mean the the quality of horses is very different one horse planted itself in front of its opponent's position and wrecked Havoc the other two ponies literally perished on the outskirts of the board and Hans won this game with Incredible Vision on the queen side Vision on the king side and good principal play in the center of the board right like planting the Knight on E3 centralizing the bishop on the D5 square and uh this was just one of many brutal games that Hans detonated upon his opponents in Croatia uh he gained I think some 30 rating points Crossing back to the 2700 rated barrier uh he's currently playing the last chess tournament I believe of 2023 for him which is the London chess classic his first round was uneventful it was a relatively straightforward uh boring draw but he dominated this tournament from start to finish uh and then he uh then he tweeted then he tweeted which I suppose is like a standard protocol now uh and uh I I will show you his uh his tweet his tweet was as follows he said um it was a picture of himself and then it was a picture of Bobby fiser and it said two lone Americans up against the world facing immeasurable odds Victorious 53 years apart at the legendary Croatian chess tournament of Peace Hans said 8 out of 9 2946 performance rating I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the Great and The Impossible and there you have it boys and girls that was the Hans nean tournament performance in Zagreb Croatia Tournament of Peace uh and if it's not clear enough the man's role model is certainly Bobby fiser um he tweeted out a Bobby Fisher quote uh earlier in the event and my only complaint my my listen I I love the Social Media stuff after the games are played my only complaint is that that is a violation of the chess speaking for itself which I'm okay with I mean if we can collectively agree we have moved on from the chess speaking for itself and now Hans nean speaks for himself God bless I am on board the Hans nean comeback train is Right Now full steam ahead uh and then there was like some quote that came out by the organizer the I that allegedly there was a tweet by T senson Norwegian uh journalist who basically said that the organizer said that like we had indications of things wrong with Hans but no reports by the players it was crazy and then people were like so look look uh tldr is that now this is going to be a thing in every tournament Hans plays got two sides of it if Hans does poorly people are going to say well you see he cheated earlier but now he's not and if he does really well people are going to say well he's just cheat so I don't know when this is going to go away or if it ever will go away but uh this is the reality we live in Hans Hans demon just played an incredible tournament I might cover a couple of his other games because you guys do enjoy watching um the Hans demon uh comeback tour and um we will see the chess will speak for itself until it does not I will speak for myself until I do not and that's all I have for you today happy December uh and uh if you want to attend the event in Toronto on December 7th when I'm there for the Champions chest T finals I'll do an event book signing Live guest ELO um tickets are running out so get them fast it's all I have for you today get out of here
