don't need a mentor you need to embrace the power of community I hope you guys are ready for this one I feel like I have a lot to say about this one I feel very intense about this one but I'm also curious because maybe there's some great advice in here now I've heard the advice over and over find a mentor while having a mentor can be valuable relying solely on One Mentor isn't the most effective approach to learning and growing instead let's redefine what it means to receive mentorship to benefit the most people again I have a lot of opinions before I pass judgment we're going to let some cooking happen okay we'll let the cooking happen I'm just gonna slow down I Can Feel It Coming okay let's just cook just cook what does it let's see what does that mean it means that we see mentorship as daily opportunities to learn and grow with people that we may or may not have direct contact with regularly okay I fundamentally disagree with this statement 100 percent uh meaning that I do think that proper mentorship can only exist in which there is part of that whole Aristotle like friendship requirement of proximity it means that we see communities as the most valuable resource resource ship to mentorship again I'm having a hard disagree here uh that we can receive mentorship by interacting with people in an online environments and by seeing every uh conversation has an opportunity to learn something new that we ask questions provide feedback and that we Mentor ourselves as part of that Journey I think we may Define mentorship different here I think that's what I'm reading here I think I I think I'm reading something I think when I hear the word mentorship or Mentor it's somebody that doesn't just simply coach you on simple technical advice but really tries to shape you as a person specifically you the person right General platitudes and pieces of advice don't necessarily translate into your life they're just simply good ideas right hey out working out nice people at your job that's a nice piece of advice right you will be the person that people like they're you're nice to you help them grow you're a good person you're pretty nice at the top all those nice things but is that like really advice for you to grow on that's just a nice thing to say and it's like a nice Community Building thing but is it actually mentorship I would say no it's not mentorship it's like a self-help book why Community mentorship is better than one-on-one mentorship I completely disagree with the statement universally but let's see I want to take a second to Define what I mean here when I say one-on-one mentorship I mean that you have a regular or semi-regular scheduled time to meet with the same person for guidance and opportunity to learn learn I'm not saying you shouldn't do this but I'm saying that Community mentorship or seeing a group of people in your interactions with them as a mentorship is better let the cooking happen let the cooking happen diverse perspectives if you're meeting one-on-one you're limited to that person's knowledge exposure and perspective one of the key advantages of having a community of mentors is the diverse perspectives that you will see and hear different voices and experiences provide a broader understanding of the industry new ideas and let's see new ideas and offer more opportunities the community perspective can come from online communities on Discord or slack meetups or by interacting with various authors through blogs and forums that experience will allow you to hear a variety of viewpoints allowing it for a more well-rounded understanding of tech and best practices Okay so this statement I now officially agree on because look at what we're narrowing it down to allowing for a more well-rounded understanding of tech and best practices this is probably true if you are attempting to learn what tech should you use what are the benefits of tech and all that having a larger group of counselors if you will or people with whom you bounce ideas off of this is true absolutely it's always been true it will always continue to be true um but that is not the point of mentorship if you're if you think the point of mentorship is to become a better programmer then you're doing mentorship wrong supportive and diverse Network building a network can consist of peers experience techies and even experts in the industry and benefit you throughout your career engaging with a diverse group of people in Tech at all stages of the journey allows you to learn from different perspective and also facilitates knowledge sharing collaboration in the form formation of lasting connections that may lead to Future opportunities it becomes an opportunity to peer mentor and grow through teaching and collaborating with others key skills we all need in Tech yeah I mean these are good these are all good things you'll need it will make you a better co-worker if you know how to communicate with people how to help people get over knowledge humps all that kind of stuff I agree with all the with with currently all these statements accessible knowledge what happens if you have a question that determines an important part of your Tech journey and your Mentor is unavailable for an extended period of time having a collective knowledge of a community allows for availability at all times that means you can seek guidance in answer to your questions whenever you need them without being limited by your Mentor schedule so this is where we're starting to get into the side of mentorship that I think is more important I would say that if you don't have your mentor's number right if you aren't in some sort of chat in some sort of way saying hey I have a big life issue coming up and I would love some advice if your Mentor is just like sorry gone for three weeks talk to you later that's not a good Mentor to begin with right and so and I do not think the internet is good at answering whatever this question is if you go into my Discord chat and you're like hey I got a big life conundrum could anyone help me I'd be very careful on the advice you're getting okay uh continuous learning every interaction in a community is an opportunity to learn whether that's active or passive early in my career I worked mostly one-on-one with experienced developers ah and I learned a lot from that experience but I learned let's see but I learned the most when I engaged or actively engaged in a community a lot of what uh see a lot of that learning came from the reading slack conversations between developers I was able to see how they asked uh each other questions they uh the process they used to debug and read different approaches to the same problem communities are a constant stream of fresh ideas and insights you know it's very shocking this article is almost identical to that previous article we read which was about learning after work I want you to kind of take a key concept out of this notice something here that everything that is being done is for the sake of getting something out of it so you know if I was going to be a mentor to all of you you can't have a stream that's always pouring into one place you also need that stream to come back out not every opportunity is a learning opportunity sometimes and a lot of times most opportunities are actually an opportunity for you to pour out right to do the opposite of said learning a supportive environment Community mentorship can uh create a communal support system you might find that other community members have the same goal and you can support each other sustain motivation and get emotional support through the Journey one of the most beneficial experiences I had when I was learning to code was hearing people who were ahead of me in their Journey saying that they experience the same frustrations I stopped feeling so alone and I was able to gain confidence as they shared their stories and advice with me that's very interesting I guess I've never had that experience in the sense that when I was learning I felt so dang frustrated I didn't understand what a method was and what the heck was going on I had to learn Java Java and it was from dytel and die tell and dytel and die teller is like the worst possible book of all time for learning Java and I remember just feeling so confused at what classes were what functions and all the stuff was and I remember just feeling so angry about it but I had no Twitter I had no online Myspace was the only social network at that point and I just simply had to will myself into existence to make me learn this thing right there was no Facebook at that time Facebook wasn't even invented at that time or if it was invented it was only at like Harvard right I wasn't at Harvard okay and I just remember feeling just this vast difficulty hurdle ahead of me but there was nothing except for myself that I you know I never had quote unquote emotional support I don't know it's very interesting I don't know what that's like so I can't really comment on that you know what I mean I strongly let's see uh continuous opportunities for growth I strongly believe in horizontal mentorship the ability to Mentor at any stage we all have our strengths and weaknesses you can always share those strengths to help others Community mentorship often provides these opportunities for growth and development you can contribute your experiences uh your expertise collaborate on projects and become a mentor yourself so I guess one of the biggest problems I have with this whole take right here is that it's it's an exceptionally the problem is is that what I see here I see two things wrong with this perspective the first thing I see wrong with this perspective or let me say it the other way I see a couple things right with this perspective it is very very true that in a plurality of people it is a very good place to see and learn different ideas and ways of solving problems even just seeing one other person's piece of code can vastly change how you see a problem versus somebody just by seeing someone else solve a problem right like that's very true so I agree with this take in the sense that being a part of a quote-unquote online community can do really good things for I think some of your technical abilities for being exposed to new technologies for hearing different Arguments for why things are good or bad but it also has the exact same inverse problem which is being a part of an online community often those communities just due to the algorithm will simply push you into a circle of more uh like-minded people right because you guys are all liking the same thing you're all retweeting the same thing you all become this tight Circle and which almost creates an inverse effect here's the here's the tweet I was trying to talk about right here which is like I make this stupid tweet right the midwit says htmx kind of effectively is just for people who don't understand they're not Enterprise Engineers you can't build anything real out of it it's just the dummies and the high IQ that are actually like no you can and it's it's actually a good thing and then right here you have htmx moves the complexity to the wrong place this take only exists in a world in which he's he's been told over and over again about why you use a very specific piece of technology you only use react you would only use Enterprise trust us we are the best we are the best people we know everything that needs to be done we understand how the web should be written this is the only way to do it because the only way you could come up with this take is that you have to have like a complete vacuum there and I love this response which is ah yes a secured Computing environment where you may use whatever languages tools and environments you would like to encapsulate and deal with complexity a horrifying Choice indeed when compared to the insecure VM with a built-in hacking console that is the browser right like this is such a solid take because that's what it's offering it's like when you aren't in several communities you get a singular piece of viewpoint of why something is good and it can only it can cause the inverse problem of you know Community online mentorship which is community online ignorance right you pool Collective ignorance together because you're all repeat inheriting the exact same talking points over and over and over and over again and so it's just something to think about that just because you're a part of an online community and just because you're a part of a large community it does not matter right it's very difficult to get something you can you can accidentally bamboozle yourself into a local Optima thinking you're actually getting something out of it and you're not getting anything out of it right it's it's just it's just real and the second thing I want to say about this article which is there's a fundamental miss here with mentorship I do not think mentorship really should be designed for a peer technical you know like it's it's not it's not for technical prowess or earning technical stuff uh really really really is best learned online engaging reading articles YouTube videos books right like it's about that that's where you're going to do all that and of course the final one which is time in the saddle building things yourself right that is where you're gonna get all your technical prowess from but a mentor is the person that comes in there and says like hey I've been at the same job as you I've been watching you communicate I've seen all the messages you've sent I've watched you in groups talking I've watched your I've watched your body language and when you talk to people you have a way of making them feel smaller because this is how you're communicating right their goal as a mentor is to help you become like to see your flaws in life right that's what a real Mentor is going to be doing is to see your flaws to see uh the things that you're really doing that aren't like a good and so when you reduce your your your Mentor down to someone who's going to make you technically better you've missed the entire point of a mentor to begin with right mentorship should be about life and life skills it should not be about technical stuff sure you can go find someone that's super technical and you could have them walk you through a problem that's cool that's like Technical mentorship and that's fine right like it's more like technical coaching it's not mentorship it's coaching and you should and you can find those people and you can find somebody and go okay I wanna I wanna do all these things it'll be great mentorship is about teaching uh you things you didn't know you could learn yes mentorship is about teaching you things you didn't know you could learn mentorship is about seeing things in yourself that you can't see you know how easy it is as an external person to see someone else's faults you know how hard it is to see your own faults like I just want you to think about that for a second how much do you see faults in other people how much do you see faults in yourself a lot of people have a very hard time seeing faults in themselves what instead they see is like oh I'm just not good enough right you have like these really abstract broad stroke faults that you see that nobody really Minds having right like you know my big problem is that I just don't believe in myself enough right oh okay that's your big problem we got it we got it that's your big problem I get it right it's like you know like there's no real singing to yourself it's always these really simple one-dimensional uh things and so just just thinking out loud um I don't know Community mentorship I don't think truly exists because at best that means on any character Insight the only thing you're going to get from Community mentorship is someone trying to cancel you right it's just not good you want friends right Community online community is not a replacement for friends friends can help you right friends are some of the greatest mentors friends are also some of the worst people to have in your life so know who your friends are the people that are speaking into your life those are gonna have way more influence on your life the trajectory of your career and everything you know so just a thought I think there's just I think this word is overloaded and I think it's just simply incorrect uh real talk I think that this whole this whole take is just mixing up the difference between friendship slash mentorship and online communities and learning Fred gives his take oh let's go let's go okay yeah um I run a large open source Community communities are awesome for finding like-minded people um I agree that is not mentorship that's actually something totally different it can help you be accountable to people it can help you find like a common task to like work on something larger than yourself those are all great things but that's not mentorship as far as I'm concerned um you can find a mentor within a community it's actually a great way to like the whole thing about open source especially is like we just don't have enough time like if someone comes in super excited um yeah like we would love to help you do a thing that like benefits Astro benefits everyone and then benefits yourself so there is mentorship to be found within communities but it's it's a different thing it's not just like oh great I'm active in Discord and now I'm like becoming a better engineer like no there's you have to still work for it but the community can be a great jumping off point so yeah I think that's where the article maybe like mushes up a bunch of things yeah there's truth to it but that specific Amendment for me it was just the the trading of there was definitely like for me I just see like some sort of like we've become a very online play especially since covid happened and a lot of friendships kind of have fallen apart and become less important if you will uh ever since those days and so I feel like it's really just a reflection of the state of the world and the lack of true friendships and so therefore we do like you should find everything online it's just like well there's things you just can't find online right like you just no matter how hard you try they don't exist right and so mentorship now has been boiled down to becoming a better programmer which is it's not that's not it like that's not the that's maybe a small point of mentorship maybe some very small technical points but all my best mentoring that I've ever had received upon me have been very hard things to hear from people who were close to me and that I did not want to hear yeah you know 100 um and I I am not someone who's ever been like comfortable with like hello like like writing out an email Dear Sir or Madam would you Mentor me please I'd really like that please please like that is always felt super form but some of my best mentors have come through work on open source like yeah you're gonna get like someone's not gonna let you merge a bug or they're going to give you like really good feedback if you find the right one and yeah again everyone needs help so yeah um yeah if you're like me and that feels like super excruciating um the open source or the community is almost like the excuse to go talk to this person you think would be a great mentor yeah I like that I like that yeah because there is definitely Niche mentoring right if you've never worked with some sort of flow with people there can be definitely some Niche mentoring like hey handle these PRS a little bit different hey handle this a little bit different you know like that that also completely exists oh yeah we're like hey you're being a dick and scaring away other people from our community right now you need to stop that's the biggest problems in software for at least that I've seen are people problems so yeah even just that layer of like do you know you're communicating this way because it's not good is super helpful especially early on in your career oh I need to hear it about once a week honestly it's a perennial problem it's like did you ever play golf uh yeah barely I love using golf as a a an analogy jumping point a metaphor jumping point because it is so good uh it just has so many correlations with real life every single time I swing uh my brother-in-law goes keep your head down I have to hear that phrase every single time why do I have to hear that phrase because I will literally never remember it someone has to say it just just remind me to say that thing and even when I know I should do it if I don't have it actively on the forethought of my brain I won't do the thing I should be doing it's like I have to be reminded perennially about all the things I should be doing he also might be like nagging you he's like little bro keep your head down I got this don't worry I'll carry the team we're carrying the team
