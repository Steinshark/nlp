you've probably heard all about how capable the iPhone 11 pros camera is but today we're gonna push it to its absolute limit we've got the beast grip which is going to let us mount a full-frame camera lens onto the phone but we've already done this on past phones in this series so for this particular episode I'm introducing three completely new pieces that are going to help to elevate the video to a whole nother level so first up in this massive package titled great video maker we've got a slider but not just any slider this is an electric motorized slider which means if we mount the beast grip on top of this we'll be able to remotely control it and this means you can do things like time lapses or just generally add a bit of motion to your recording but there's more to make the quality of the footage better not just at night time but also in the day we've got a spotlight which should be a powerful light that can travel long distances but also on that we can control the direction off oh and also in the Box we get a number of coloured pads so later in the video I'm going to attach these onto the light and see the results this spot light is actually made for DSLR cameras but the beasts grip we're using on the iPhone lets us attach it onto that but then to stabilize all this equipment we've had to get hold of a top-tier Manfrotto tripod this is cinema great equipment and it is not particularly portable anyway so I spent a morning just checking everything making sure it all works and it was finally time to take the rig to London to test it so I'm now going to show you my top seven things about this rig and what it lets you capture with a smartphone I think it's gonna surprise you number seven with just the smartphone and the lens alone it's impressive how cinematic the footage is the first thing you're gonna notice is depth of field you get natural DSLR like background blur and this is pure optics there's no software trickery at all but there is a catch the video quality itself can take a bit of a hit the only way we're able to mount these lenses onto the phone is via something called a DOF adapter and to use one you've got to turn off the image stabilization built into the phone and it also results in less light a flipped image and a smaller capture frame you have to use a bit of digital zoom to compensate and a piece of pro software in order to flip the image back to how it should normally be and so it doesn't sound great but the rig also has a few notable advantages plus the accessories we're going to be attaching onto it they're going to counter a lot of its weaknesses so the idea was I was gonna carry this entire setup to central London where I seemed to end up for every single one of these videos and let me tell you it didn't feel very portable at the time but we got there in the end and this brings me on to number 6 stabilization using a tripod of this kind of caliber gives you rock-solid stabilization which means we can just plonk the phone on top without the lens to start with and capture London's skyline and by accelerating this footage it really exaggerated the contrast between the static parts of the frame and the moving parts if we add the slider into the mix things get really interesting all of a sudden you can get these beautiful sweeping time lapses the extra dynamism you get compared to just a static one makes footage way more engaging it was also just good to see that whenever recording with the iPhone 11 Pro I literally noticed zero spots of overexposure it is a really good job creating a balanced image I even try to slide a shot using the phone's ultra wide camera and we managed to fit the entire shard into one frame that's the tallest building in the country if we bundle all three together the tripod the slider and now that lens - you'll notice three things first of all this looks amazing in part due to the accidental black and red color coordination the second thing is that yes this is clearly overkill if you were going to get this much equipment you should almost definitely just use a DSLR to record but the idea here was to see what the upper limit was in terms of what the iPhone 11 pro can record and that brings us onto the third thing the quality because it's pretty high this video is also partially inspired by the idea that a lot of commercials for smartphones that are entirely shot on these devices are done in a similar way it's very rare that a company will literally just take the phone on its own and use it so the message so far is not really that smartphones are now just as good as DSLRs because to achieve this effect you need quite a lot of equipment but we can say that smartphone camera sensors as well as all the software that goes around them are getting pretty great and capable of some stunning footage this lens also has the spin-off effect of being able to pull focus while shooting from the background to the foreground or vice versa and now low-light performance which surprised me a combination of this lump we're using and just a really capable camera on the 11pro meant that even though the lens attachment is limiting the amount of light getting to the sensor alt is still pretty crisp even as the light dips further and further the crispness still holds up even over the iPhone 10's last year this is a marked improvement and we need to keep reminding ourselves here this is shot on a smartphone it was only a few years ago where the idea of shooting video in super low-light like this on a phone was unheard of if you wanted to do something like that go and buy a proper camera but here we are on the iPhone 11 Pro that literally pretty rigged up but still I think it's impressive also just on a bit of a side note if you are enjoying this video it would be amazing if you could consider subscribing I'm really trying to push the boundaries when it comes to tech videos now I also had a play with the color filters we unboxed earlier which sure reduce the brightness by a bit but they create mood and they work particularly well if combined with one source of white light it creates a much more interesting frame than just having plain colored lighting all over and now one of the coolest perks of this beast grip system is interchangeable lenses so for example I could take this anamorphic lens screw it straight in and bam we've got a completely different looking video and I kind of like anamorphic it's this super wide video format because the way it works you'll see that when we shine bright lights into it you get this iconic horizontal lens flare a lot of feature-length movies use this kind of lens it's especially effective at night now probably my number one favorite thing with this setup is photos to which you might be thinking what but it's easy to forget that having a DSLR lens here makes every shot a portrait mode shot yes the images are upside down when you're using the normal camera app but the results speak for themselves there's no software trickery you don't need to worry about edge detection this is real background bokeh to take a look at some of the other ultimate smartphone camera rigs I've made I'll leave some links from this video plus if you haven't already seen the complete iPhone comparison video do check that out as well that'll be linked it took like two months to put together thanks a lot for watching and we'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
