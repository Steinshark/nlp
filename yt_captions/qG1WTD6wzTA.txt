ladies and gentlemen we need to talk about Magnus Carlson in today's video I'm going to be covering a game that he played just yesterday in the European Team Championship he's currently representing Norway and he is their Board number one his opponent was a 19-year-old Grandmaster from Denmark the number one ranked chess player in Denmark yonas Bier and it was one of the most absurd games of Chess I've ever seen Maus take part in it was incredible ridiculous blunderful and I'm going to share it with all of you also I'm currently in London and I just want to shout out the incredible people from here and from all over the world yesterday we did an event at the Conway Hall look at this event we had over 400 people come out and we did a Q&A we did Live guest the ELO I'm going to minimize it just so you can view it but also see my face uh the event was hosted at Conway Hall and um my co-host was Bobby seagull uh incredible man uh hosts a lot of incredible shows uh and he's a mathematician and a teacher and uh just and an author as well and just so many great things this was this was spectacular so drop a comment uh in in on this video if you were there vote each other to the top so the comments are not just Levy never fails to make chess videos and all of this stuff um really just a special time just a special event I must have signed like 300 books took photos with so many of you people flew from Austria from Kazakhstan from Ukraine people flew from like all over from Finland there was people traveling to London just for this event which is just mind-blowing so thank you to all of you who came who have been coming to these events I have one more in London on November 21st and then it's back home to New York but you're all inspiring me to do a World guest the ELO tour and a Q&A and all these I mean it's going to be really seriously 2024 that's that's one thing that we might do so thank you honestly um I'm just blown away by the support like really seriously it's uh it's it's incredible and if you don't have the book yet get it for the holidays uh but for now today we are going to look at this game Magnus Carlson versus yonas beer and we need to talk about Magnus we're actually going to look at this game from magnus's perspective so that you are able to sit in the shoes of a good chess player for once just kidding in many ways you're all wonderful I'm in a good mood today I will not be roasting you and also sitting in Jonas's shoes he's 2630 so he's also a very good chess player so uh this is a actually magnus's 18th game in a row I believe or 17th game in a row not playing a 2700 GM he's been playing in so many chess tournaments he actually hasn't played a 2700 which is wild so Magnus plays E4 Knight to C6 on the first move this's one thing we got to talk about Magnus like this dude is not he's playing some serious openings recently but he is going crazy with some of his opening preparation just trying to take people out of a comfort zone when you have 90 minutes on the clock you have so much time to prepare and right now it's a crazy Information Age of Chess uh that I think think um that I think forces him to play these more provocative openings his opponent plays Knight F3 trying to get him to play back into a King's Pawn right his opponent doesn't just take the center Magnus plays D6 basically saying look let's go P's defense now we are just straight up playing a PS defense uh this is or technically this is called the nich but if this Knight wasn't here it would be the PS defense and white is playing What's called the classical setup with two pawns and both Knights out not playing kings Indian style and also not playing Austrian attack style uh plays D5 after spending seven minutes on that move by the way took him seven minutes to muster up the courage and Magnus actually undevelop the Knight you would think that this is like disrespectful it's not because now white structure is locked you can't undo a pawn move right you can undo a knight move uh and now white will try black will try to fight back with these two pawns so Bishop B2 Bishop G7 both sides Castle Jonas plays H3 reasonable move just trying to patrol anything from coming to G4 and now it's up to Magnus to figure out how to develop his position he plays C6 Magnus is still not thinking so he is up 18 minutes on the clock clearly the opening is some success he also will potentially expand on the queen side with his pawns he's going to decide which way his Knight is going to go he'll probably take on D5 and find a way to develop his Bishop so everything is fine yonas thinks and plays A4 A4 is an interesting move it's a very very committal move but it's trying to take space away from black now black has a very difficult decision to make does he play A5 or not right so just just so you understand like if you allow white to play A5 he might then also play A6 he might play B4 and it's just at some point not right away but it's a big question to ask yourself like do I want to be smooshed by this guy you know am I into that like what what uh maybe I don't like the space disadvantage right so Magnus thinks a little bit plays A5 which is a big thing for Magnus cuz he doesn't really like to overcommit pawns this is one thing that they say he's very delicate with his pawn moves and what that does is it wins control of the B4 square if white plays C3 in the future by moving his Knight then he will undermine his Center and now Magnus is going to travel to B4 where he will have a home for the night it will put pressure on the center defend his position pressure C2 so typical magnesian type of game Knight to A6 Jonas plays Bishop F1 notice Jonas is like spending a lot of time he's spending five minutes you know moving his Rog trying to defend the center then he's UND developing his Bishop because the bishop has the exact same scope that it did on that square and the center is protected and maybe he's going to put the bishop over here right so Magnus arrives on the B4 Square both guys are just sort of developing their pieces to the squares that they think are going to be the most useful for short-term and long-term game gain that is that that is what chess is all about okay so Magnus Maneuvers the Knight to the B4 Square after securing control over it with the move A5 yonas is undevelop for now so that the Bishops can be repositioned and at some point he will use his slight space advantage and then he will advance into magnus's territory right so there we see Bishop to G5 another just just very natural developing move and black doesn't really want to play H6 and like G5 because again uh and by by the way also actually Bishop H4 G5 is not so bad but if H6 is played then he's just going to go back that's kind of the point and you would think what is the difference like you can't attack this anyway well this is a bit of a weakness and by inducing this move you know you these two are quite weak so Bishop to D7 simultaneously defending finding a home for the bishop and potentially putting a rook on the C file from where it will deal some pressure and also you know you never know you never know if this is going to be a weakness or not so Queen to D2 Queen to D2 setting up the battery trying to go Bishop H6 potentially in the future to trade off Black's Bishop which could be Black's best piece Magnus plays Rook C8 so Magnus is kind of getting exactly where he wants now yonas spends some time plays G3 yonas is now down 30 minutes on the clock right 32 minutes on the clock um the move G3 uh and Magnus gave an interview actually after this game so I'm quoting Magnus here he said you know G3 was not the idea that he thought was was the best idea he thought white should probably go for some other things probably more Central based he realized that the idea of G3 uh by white was to move that Bishop that was just undeveloped to G2 where it would support the center and that would facilitate Knight to D4 right now Knight to D4 is not possible because you would block the Queen's defense of the Pawn in many lines so that is the idea of G3 now here Magnus said he calculated C takes e takes Rook C5 you also might notice that Magnus spent 23 minutes on a pawn capture not walk away in the toilet somewhere did not digest something poorly he spent 23 minutes on something and that is because after Rook C5 Magnus was calculating a wicked line and this is just like some of the some of the super amazing uh calculation abilities of the best player in the world and this is all from the interview so in the game he he attacked this Pawn right and he said what I was calculating here in the game this move was played but he said what I was calculating in the game was Knight to D4 to try to play this and maybe go to B3 right put the Knight on B3 which would dislodge the rook and attack the pawn on A5 so Knight D4 and Magnus calculated Knight takes D5 takes takes Fork whoa there's a fork suddenly to the queen and the Rook but now Magnus takes the Knight this all he calculated he he didn't play this he calculated this Rook Tak AK Queen slides out of the way now black is forked not only is black forked after Queen B6 takes takes black is forked again and that's a very big problem and so Magnus couldn't figure out from a distance remember in chess you don't get to move the pieces and then go well actually I want to go back you have to see in the future and here Magnus said he found Rook D3 threatening the pawn which is actually pinned by this queen and if King H2 you get the Knight out of d anger by playing this move an incredible idea Rook to D2 getting to the F2 pawn and the thing is white can defend against Rook D2 like for example there's Rook D1 but after takes takes the Knight gets out of danger that's the most important thing and black simply has a knight and a bishop for a rook and that Advantage is substantial it's a substantial Advantage not to mention that white has a lot of weaknesses so when he played Rook C5 Magnus had to make Knight D4 work and that is why he spent over 20 minutes calculating it and then his opponent went here his opponent went there in like four minutes so you know in chess sometimes you you you do a lot of work uh but uh then it doesn't necessarily pay off so uh let me I'm going to just respond uh to my wife real quick uh because she's she she's back in New York uh and uh I realized they never messaged her when I started recording so I just told her there you go um Bishop 2 E3 I hope you all find somebody who loves you for who you are one day unless you are a terrible person in which case fix yourself first and then you know and now Magnus sacrificed The Rook so we come back from that slight intermission and Magnus with his Rook threatened bulldozes it directly into Jonas's position okay thank you Magnus I'm not going to yell because I'm in a hotel and they're cleaning outside it would be very embarrassing I don't want to scream Rook takes C3 here we go and you'll notice evaluation likes it why is that such a good move well if white plate takes with the queen then after Knight takes D5 the queen is hit and both these pawns are super soft the C file is really weak and frankly the pawn on A4 is weak so Jonas has a queen side that is extremely vulnerable to just getting completely battered for example Queen B3 Bishop F5 attacks the pawn white can try to play very passively but then I will grab the bishop you cannot take with the queen because I take this Pawn so now your pawns are split and then I just play like E5 just have a completely normal game where white has absolutely nothing and has two of the stupidest Rooks of all time so yonas has to go here and Magnus can take on D5 but throws in this move and takes on C3 so Magnus calculates he can sacrifice a rook he can win a pawn so Magnus has uh a knight and a pawn for a rook however he has a better position why this vintage Magnus stuff right like incredible game right this is like everything that we could have you know Ever Ever Wanted uh when looking uh you know for a game of Magnus D5 is weak A4 is weak and uh he's just going to completely easily you know steamroll his opponent yonas plays Bishop to D4 right so he's not keen on trying to somehow save this Pawn it's not really possible if he tries to save this Pawn he will hang H3 he will also just not defend this Pawn not to mention he will probably lose this pawn and this Pawn as well in the future like every Pawn in Jonas's position I don't know why my nose just got so itchy having like some Big Adventures here oh goodness Bishop D4 instead of defending the pawn takes takes takes and now Bishop C4 and so yonas gives away this Pawn as well and both guys make a mistake here both guys they both saw a sequence of moves that did not work both of them had spotted that after Bishop takes H3 Queen to D2 attacking the Knight Pawn to E6 there is Knight to G5 and then this deflecting the bishop there into a fork both guys had spotted that from a distance but both guys were wrong because as it turns out you can walk the king forward not backwards and then if this you actually win the Knight and what happens is you have a knight and like 37 pawns for a rook and uh black is just you know Bishop takes Knight takes and put the Knight on B4 white is just down like four pawns I don't know three pawns four pawns four pawns very very so it's completely lost so both guys actually missed that completely and and so this is actually magnus's first chance he said afterward that he saw this but he saw the sequence with Queen D4 G4 and he just didn't go for it so he played E6 and not only did he play E6 he voluntarily damaged his structure he doubled his pawns but he doubled his pawns because what they do is they create a huge barrier so now it's really difficult to access any Central Square also Bishop C6 is very good and queen F6 is good magnus's pieces just walk themselves to the best squares on the board the the the next you know the Rook just comes over and I mean he's still up 13 minutes on the clock with a completely dominant position this is like vintage vintage Magnus right so Rook A3 is played and the Knight has to move so goes to E4 and now black is just going to enter the position and and ravage it so black is just completely winning like there there is nothing I mean white has more Pawn weaknesses which he cannot defend which is why this whole sacrifice was completely genius not to mention the pawn on H3 is still hanging in case you have been wondering why that pawn is not getting taken same question right here Magnus can simply take the pawn and he said that and I think what he didn't like is maybe something like Knight E2 he didn't like that suddenly his position is losing stability like Rook C2 Rook D5 suddenly the is hanging but then you can just defend it and and and again his pressure is just much better than his opponent like he saw he spawned a bishop H3 but another moment he didn't take he played Rook C4 right so Rook C4 attacks the Knight well keeps an eye on the Knight and threatens the opponent A4 and now yonas played Knight on undevelop 22 looking to go here by the way the pawn on H3 is still hanging for the record just in case you are still wondering uh can this Pawn be taken yes but you know he was worried a little bit about Knight F4 which apparently doesn't work at all because of Knight C3 which attacks the rook and then the Rook comes over to E4 to help as well so Magnus uh ended up instead of taking on A4 instead of he took on C2 which he claimed was very stupid that's what he said he said it was very very stupid to play this move um and he thought here that he could have you know defended his pawn and then done something like this and he was correct so Magnus again doubts himself for like a second or third time right too many options everything looks good you end up ordering something on the menu that's terrible at a restaurant so he takes this instead his opponent plays Rook takes D5 and now again Knight C5 Knight D4 Magnus should just simply come back to go for that pawn and to keep his Knight protected and to keep an eye on this but instead he plays Rook to B2 and the idea of Rook to B2 was just pressure this regroup maybe Rook B4 he should have played Rook C4 so the queen couldn't move because if the queen can move it's going to be an issue and now Magnus blunders and everything changes we had 16 minutes of a dominant performance by Magnus we had well this game was like 3 and a half hours 4 hours long we had 28 moves and suddenly we have a huge change Queen E1 I almost fell out fell out of my chair literally and metaphorically Queen E1 and all of a sudden best case scenario is Magnus is going to draw this game what how's that possible what what did this move change well White's pieces came alive not only is this a threat this is a problem Knight B5 is Knight B5 is coming Rook F3 is coming you could play B6 in this position all of a sudden your queen is booted Rook D6 is falling Queen C3 threatens the rook and the king oh my God it's completely lost queen E1 is ridiculous which is why he had to play Rook here to make sure that white couldn't easily move and then if again if white moved then there would have been something like Rook E4 Queen D2 and okay I mean it's not completely lost but but it's we're working on it you know we're getting there Rook e 2 for example so hitting both Queens but suddenly Magnus has to go here and Rook F3 is on the board Rook F3 is on the board Magnus is on the verge of losing again to a 2600 young Grandmaster or a 2500 young Grandmaster these 20-year olds these 19y olds are just are just attacking him it's plus point. n this is unbelievable Rook F3 after Queen E1 the backwards queen move which opened up the ticket for the Rook to go and move together Magnus is probably going to have to sacrifice his Queen this is otherworldly he could play Knight D3 here trying to get the Rook to deflect but Queen C3 and yes there was Rook B1 check but it actually none of this matters none of this matters he's still going to have to lose his Queen just so you understand like it is it is over if he doesn't lose his Queen it is Knight E6 check or Knight F5 and queen G7 mate like it is over all caps so Magnus has to sacrifice his rook and he thinks he's okay and he probably saw that when he played Bishop C6 Queen E1 he spends 8 minutes he goes you know what I'm going to get a rook and I'm going to get a second Rook what's the problem the problem is he misses the next move and in fighting in boxing mixed martial arts the punch that you don't see coming is the one that knocks you out and in this position Magnus missed the otherworldly Knight to F5 what that is called a clearance sacrifice Knight F5 threatens many things okay among them as something gets into my eye very very theatrical recording like why is I'm in a small hotel room why is there something just floating into my eyeball okay tremendous so level one you are trying to win the squares near the King right you're trying to really just like get in here with the Knight number two queen C3 is a fork and you threaten to win The Rook so if the pawn takes Queen C3 right if you play something like Rook C2 you actually just straight up get checkmated it's it it's literally made so Knight F5 but then okay if that's a threat what about King F5 yes yes indeed what about King F5 well G4 and geometrically anywhere the king moves there is a punishment King G5 Queen C1 King F6 Queen C3 and if you come forward you die so Magnus plays King F6 and is in a losing end game he's just down a full Queen it's not quite full he has a bishop and a knight and two Pawns in fact if you do the math it's hardly full at all but it is a shocking turn of events from what we just had and you give me Magnus here with white against most players in the world I would say he will find a way to win but what a move Knight at five what a turnaround from Yannis beer this these games are a lot less you know it's like shocking Magnus doesn't just destroy every 2600 he place but you got to give credit to these young guys these 19 these 20y olds 25 we just saw in Qatar 2630 we're seeing yonas we saw Valentine dragn 2589 like there is something to be said about the fact that rating deflation is happening in chess the highest ELO players in the world if they get 20 games against 25 and 2600s they're going to lose a lot of points to those guys and that is what is currently happening in chess and now Magnus is playing for a draw or is he what there's more plot twists surely right right he's playing for a draw however if white is unable to do something with these pawns white won't win why well white is up a queen sure but everything in Black's position is protected what if black goes here and puts a Pawn on B6 how exactly are you going to get rid of all of Black's pieces in fact a better question is how are you going to get rid of any of Black's pieces so the way you win this the way you win any endgame right is you get in you take pawns and you make another queen that's the only way and if you trade all the pawns with white you're not going to win black has too many pawns and especially you know now Magnus goes for the pawn A4 Jonas gives a check and in this position after checking a couple of times he has 50 seconds to make two moves because then he gets the extra 30 minutes that's how classical chess works and yonas probably should go for these pawns the computer here gives something like actually instead of even Queen E2 check uh a couple of moves ago uh it suggested that it you know he he he just go for these pawns and give up the pawn on A4 that's very tough to do instead Yas plays G5 which Magnus immediately knew was a mistake because he said in the interview he said conceptually this looked wrong what how could that what do you mean conceptually it's a queen versus Bishop Knight in two pawns end game well apparently according to Magnus and his Pawn play understanding is CL white now is out of forward moves all white can hope to do is grab a pawn it's going to take him a lot more time to break through with the H Pawn which walks into a brick wall if anything you should play H4 because after Bishop A4 then you might have something like Queen E3 King D7 and queen H6 and we just get into a race Bishop B3 Queen H7 but you see this right conceptually H5 G takes G takes white needs to create a pass Pawn that is the most important thing look at this we're going to get into a crazy race the queen is going to go to G7 the Knight is going to go to D3 if H7 is played Knight E5 and both sides are going to Queen but actually it is it is black who is going to win the game that is unbelievable because you have you you have too many threats two queens lose to a Queen Bishop Knight right so so you got to be very very careful but conceptually this is too slow and Magnus knows that walks his King to the other side and basically says all right we have the following position now I'm probably going to lose the race if I take not to mention I'm going to lose both pawns so let me play B5 this is even more important B5 now he could have maybe taken one like this but doing it this way forcing his way through with a pawn he loses the pawn but his King walks up and he can now Chuck everything and just go and there is one more sequence to be found in this game by Magnus if he finds it he might not lose because white is just too slow again I've been telling you white is too slow and the thing the thing is also white is out of Pawns he did it the wrong way he pushed the G Pawn First which is why conceptually Magnus already knew when this move was played it was wrong he needed to keep the H Pawn to be traded and then win the pawn like that yonas misplays it tries to break through like this and Magnus starts running his pawn and now in an absolutely ridiculous defensive stand Queen C6 is coming the pawn is going to start moving Magnus realizes he's going to lose everything and he's going to sacrifice everything for this Pawn to run and in his King getting mercilessly hunted to the death the king will escape and join the Pawn on the other side of the board it's like a movie so here A3 he just goes he has to just make sure there's no Fork he just has to make sure there's no way for him to lose that pawn queen C6 King A5 and now you can take but then I'm going to go so Queen A8 he sneaks behind Jonas's Pawn allowing it to go forward he allows the pawn to go all the way to B7 but now he takes he loses his Knight but the king makes it to the pawn check King B1 the king just traversed literally the entire Mountain but there is nothing you can do and now yonas despite being Opa Queen has to force a draw because Magnus is going to Queen himself you can't let Magnus Queen anymore so Queen here King up Queen here King down you could use the bishop to Shield yourself it doesn't really matter but it's better to even Just Bounce the king it it makes no difference King B2 Queen D2 it's just going to be a draw and that is exactly what happens players make a draw after 55 moves what an absolutely absurd game of chess that was it started with vintage Magnus and I mean it was Magnus can't be happy about this game right that's the thing he was happy because his team won and he seems to be enjoying himself quite a bit at Team events which you know and he saved the game that won the match it was 2-1 yonas was trying to beat him he played in this provocative way it was a in amazing game I mean Magnus finding this idea to swarm the pawn and then I mean just sacrifice The Rook for a positional Advantage not a not a sacrifice that delivers a Checkmate or anything like that uh super stuff like this could have been a game that I'm like oh my God mag play such a brilliant game and then you watch like oh my God what did he what did he do now oh my God Liv never f with mag and you know that would have we would have all rejoiced but credit to yonas who did not go away and traded created some pressure and just activated all his pieces Co and Magnus had like four or five chances to to put some serious pressure he gave Yus one chance Queen E1 undevelop creating multiple threats and then what a br Knight Oh What A Move Knight F5 and an incredible idea to play Pawn to G4 but the game ends in a draw sometimes you're winning sometimes you're losing and then nobody can break through and then and then a draw is is made so uh Magnus still losing points to these 25 and 2600s uh tomorrow AKA today he is playing against uh Jordan van Forest who is uh actually a member of his team or I don't know if like was a member of his team and I think they're good friends that is magnus's first opponent in nearly 20 opponents who is going to be rid 2700 poor guys just battling these 25 2600 GMS that are super hungry to beat him um friends uh this has been uh fun recap and uh London has been quite a bit of fun uh I'm going to go walk around uh and I will upload tomorrow as well if I see you on November 21st at uh sa I keep calling it pancreas but that's not what it's called pancreas King's cross big train station very excited for that and upload photos if we took them together to Twitter to Instagram whatever uh goodbye get out of here
