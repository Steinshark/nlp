- So me and the boys
are gonna spend 24 hours in a rainforest. Ow.
- I'm itchy. - We're all city boys except for Chris. So it's gonna be a little rough. - Yo, I'm already
itching my butt sack off. - This one's gonna be a
little different than normal. We're not using tents. We have to build our own shelter and survive with the stuff on our back. - [Chris] So have any of
you guys done this before? - We did in the desert, but we had tents. You're stuck taking care
of all of us. Right here. - [Chandler] No way, land! - Whoa, whoa, chill, chill. Chandler. Please put your machete away. Put it away. - All right, first thing, need to focus on shelter,
food and water and fire. Fire's the biggest one. - I want to be able to sleep tonight. - We're gonna have to make shelters. - How? - Shelter.
- I'll work on it. - Food.
- Okay. - Water. The water's moving
really fast, you can drink it. - [Cameraman] Where are you going? - Chris--
- Found it. We brought water. - [Chandler] Chris, we're done. - All right, so Chandler,
we're gonna go get sticks. - I might as well be naked. - We have a bottle of
water. We don't need water. - I got another one guys, we're good. - Okay.
- I came prepared. - Chris, we're going rogue. Thanks. He said we could. Before we get too far, I wanna
show you what's in our bags. 'Cause this is literally all we brought. A pillow. - You got a pillow?
- That's nice. What'd you bring?
- Uh... - A poncho. That's not bad. - I got--
- You got a poncho too. Wow, really? Literally
half my bag is first aid. Useless. Rather have a donut. - Why do I have five ponchos in here? - Hey, we got some bug spray.
- I got granola bars. - Really? Whoa.
- Where'd you get that? - Found it. - [Cameraman] Oh, talk
about shelter. Look at that. - Chris, would it be helpful if we went and found more dead trees? - Yes, actually. Very. - Okay. Let's go. So we found wood, Chandler. - Yes, we did. - Chris would carry it
back. There's a bee. - Oh.
- Should we wait for the bees? - That is the bee's wood. That's him. - Awesome. We need more wood. We're gonna take one for the
team and collect firewood. Chris is gonna be proud of us. Can you give me a dry test? (Chandler inhales deeply) Moisture?
- Yeah, yeah. - Okay, sorry. My bad.
- Get rid of that one. - All right, I think we
have enough for a fire. - Bump me. - Chris would be happy.
Let's take it back to camp. - Gosh, we have to go
like an hour back to camp. - Yeah, I know. Oh, we made it.
- This journey is so-- If you were Chris, where would
you put a pile of sticks? I feel like he would yell
and then put 'em right there. - Ah! - Perfect. We're gonna try
not to cut down too many trees 'cause it's not good for the environment. But a hurricane actually
recently came through so there are a lot of
trees that have fallen. Before we start doing our own thing, Chris told us to get water. Chris, what do we carry the water in? - See if you can find some
scrap water bottles around here and fill 'em up. - Okay, we found some bottles. Whoops. We're gonna go find a river. Wait... - I gotta let my river go.
- Sh. That way. - What did you hear?
- Water. Wait, hold up. That way. How's he doing this?
- I don't know. - Here we are. - I told you guys, if you listen
to the ears, you get water. (triumphant music) So what would Chris do? - He said fast moving water
is able to be drinkin'. - All right. I got my water.
- Drink it. Is it gross? - I had gum in.
- Oh. - Water and gum doesn't go well. - Wow. It's actually not bad at all. - Now that we have water, we have to figure out
how to get back to camp. 'Cause to be honest, we were just walking in random directions. You wanna just set up our own camp? - We could build a fire right here, but this place is kind of loud. - Okay, are we going back to Chris? I don't think we're
ready to live on our own. Part of me wants to try
to survive on our own, but part of me also realizes it will suck even worse than Chris yelling at us. - I think you're right.
- So I'm gonna go back. - All right, bye. - [Tareq] Wait Chandler, are you staying? - I really want to go up
there, it's pretty cool. - Good luck, sir. Be safe.
- You too. - Thank you. (laughs) Let's go. - Okay. Bye.
- Bye! - [Cameraman] Are you
not worried about him? - Bye. - [Chandler] Bye! Look at this! We're
about to go explore this! - Bye.
- I love you. Say it back.
- Bye. - Say it back! Hi. This is adventure time with Chandler. I'm on a little rock in
the middle of the water. Look what I just found. Hold on, hold on. Look at this little worm. Look at him. I'm out of water and I have no food. And I'm pretty far away from camp. I don't know how to get back. What is wrong with me? - Hey Chris, I got water. - [Chris] Wait, where's Chandler? - He ran away. Ingest that water so we have
energy to go find Chandler. - It's not even full.
- I drank some. How does it taste? Like seriously, it's
straight from a river. - So where is he really? - I don't know, he ran
away. I really don't know. - [Cameraman] He legit
ran away. I'm not kidding. - Do we just wanna accept that he's gone and out of our lives or do
we want to go look for him? - Well, there's bears.
They're very aggressive. - Okay.
- Chandler looks like food. - Let's go find him.
Let's go find Chandler. Chandler! Chandler. Wait guys, stop moving.
I have a great idea. We have food. - We have Mac and cheese. - Wow dude, this is serious. Chandler! - [Cameraman] Chris,
what are you about to do? - I'm about to go swimming. - Chris, I have a confession. Me and Chandler were gonna
camp here on our own. - So what were you gonna
use for tents and stuff? - That's why we didn't do it. 'Cause we need you.
- Thank you. So is Chandler actually lost? - He literally just went that way. - How cold is that?
- Oh, very. - [Cameraman] Oh, wow. Look at that. - You ready?
- What are you about to do? Wait, no, no, no. Don't
trust fall behind there. - I'm going under.
- Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't, oh, okay. I thought he was gonna trust fall. - Ooh, my man! You know, my wife really doesn't like it when I'm in my underwear. But I tell her, other women
aren't attracted to me. No woman is. She's just
the only crazy one. - [Cameraman] Yo, you look
like Tarzan right now. What you looking for? Uh-oh. You smell a Chandler? - I smell him! Did you know I'm a champion stone skipper? - Wait, are you really?
- Yeah, you wanna see it? - All right. Let's see it.
- All right. - [Cameraman] A big boy. Oh! - Chandler, buddy. You ran away and-- - Oh, I ran away, huh?
- And I got worried. - You got worried?
- I did. - [Chandler] You told
me you didn't love me. - Hug me. I'm sorry. - It's okay.
- We did it. - Yes. We're reunited as a family. - [Cameraman] Hey guys, whatever
happened to that campsite? - It's over there. So we
made it back to the camp. We got our Chan-Chan back.
- Hey. - Chris is trying to start a fire. Jake is being a big dude like normal. - Chris is spinning a
stick on another stick. - Someone's gotta do it and
we're happy you're doing it. So while we were having
to look for you Chandler, we depleted all our energy. So it only makes sense you do
everything from here on out. Everything?
- Everything. Think logical. We need food. Can you find some berries?
- I'll need a weapon. - It's berries, not bears. We got rid of him. it's okay. All right, so we're spreading the wood out and then we're just
gonna put ponchos on it and we'll be good. (mellow music) All right guys. So things aren't
looking good for Chandler. He's getting pale, his pupils are dilated. And seriously, I don't
want him to get hurt. Basically, Chandler was bit by something we think is poisonous. How do you feel? - I feel like my motor skills don't work. - [MrBeast] All right
boys, we lost Chandler. I'm gonna join you guys. - There's a reason why we have
the fire doing a lot of smoke is it keeps mosquitoes away. What's gonna happen if
this log just breaks and falls on us in the
middle of the night? - Right here, this sharp thing will probably go right into your face. This log right here is on a perfect trajectory
right for my face. - [Jake] I'm in between
two logs, so I'm fine. - In between two logs
sounds like a sitcom. You're gonna stick it out with us? - Man I'm here till the end,
brother. I ain't no Chandler. - All you need to do is
sleep with your mouth closed or you'll eat a spider. - I'm scared.
- Don't pull that. - Chill, chill, chill.
- Don't pull that. Ah! - [Tareq] Hey chill, the
bears might actually hear you. Bears are here. - We need to draw our
anti sea bear circle. - Hey, the good news is we
probably won't get a bear 'cause they'll walk over
here and they'll be like, dude, these guys don't even have any food and their house looks like crap. I live better than this.
Then they'll just walk away. - I think this house is pretty good. - When you go to the doctor, do you want a pretty good
doctor or a pretty good surgeon? No, you want the best. - Well, it's not our fault we had to spend half
the day chasing Chandler and then he decided to get poisoned. - Actually, isn't that
your fault entirely? - You left him. - Well, he went the other way. - If a bear came, we'd probably have to run
down the mountain, right? - We'd probably all have to
agree to just throw Tareq at it. - [Tareq] Okay. Wait, wait,
wait, hold on, hold on. - Hey, let's start taking
our safety seriously. We need to set up these anti bear circles. - I literally am not
getting up. I'm sorry. - [MrBeast] We could play smash. - I'd rather smash my head
in with that pole over there. - [MrBeast] All right, if you guys don't wanna take the
safety serious, I will. - [Chris] That's not a good circle. You're already not doing great. - [MrBeast] What, you don't
think that'll stop a bear? - No, I know it's not gonna stop a bear 'cause there's a bear right beside me. (all laughing) - [Jake] Please don't
mess up on the circle. - [Chris] Everybody knows that ovals makes them way more aggressive. - [MrBeast] I've got a
perfect circumference. - [Chris] That's an oval. - [MrBeast] All right, we
have a sea bear circle. - That's an oval.
- It's an oval. - [Jake] Sea bear oval. - [MrBeast] All right,
well then they're gonna be more aggressive. Sorry. - [Cameraman] How'd it go? - I was in there for four
hours and he gave me an IV and just gave me some medicine. He told me to get some rest
and drink a lot of water. - [Cameraman] Feeling better?
You wanna get some food? - Yeah.
- All right. - [Tareq] Chris, what did you find? - I found a millipede, dude. Imagine, it was in this bag.
I was looking for a torch. Dude look, he slithered right down your-- - [Tareq] Hold on. Where
is he, where is he? - [Chris] He's going up in the bag, bro. How's he going up in the bag? Yeah, I'm gonna try and rescue him. We're now doing centipede rescue. - [Tareq] Yo, look at his legs. - You know what the worst
part about millipedes is? - [Tareq] What?
(Chris farts) I hate you. Your fart was so bad,
he had to leave the bag. - [Chris] Look at him,
going off into nature. Like a little nature boy. Go underground and hide, little friend. Don't get eaten by a bird. - What's up guys? It's really late. Chandler is at the hospital and yeah, I guess we're just gonna sleep. - I'm literally sitting
in a jungle right now. There's all kinds of critters out here and I'm gonna go to bed
just randomly out with them. - [Tareq] Okay, Jimmy looks
actually very comfortable. - [Chris] Tareq, are you still recording? - I am.
- All right, hold up. I got something.
- Don't fart. - I'm not! I'm not gonna fart. - [Tareq] You're like a caterpillar just about to turn into
a butterfly in a second. - 'Bout to turn into a naked weird guy. (Tareq and Jake laughing) - [Tareq] Oh God. On a scale of one to comfortable,
how comfortable are you? - About a three. The only thing that feels good is my head. - [Tareq] What about
the rest of your body? - Slowly falling down
a mountain into a fire. - [Tareq] You are so close to this fire. All right guys, good night. I'll see you tomorrow. - [Chris] Oh!
- What? What? - [Chris] That was crawling on me. - [Jake] What was? What the is that? - [Chris] It's a millipede, bro. So I was asleep and some
reason something woke me up and I woke up and there was a
millipede crawling all over me and it freaked me out. 'Cause I don't like things
crawling on me in my sleep. - I'm gonna be honest. If I were you, I probably
wouldn't just randomly walk into a rainforest and try to
make a little fort and survive. I'd use a tent or something. I wonder what Chandler's up to. - All right, guys. I'm in bed. Hopefully you guys don't get bit tonight by those caterpillars. Good morning. I just woke up. I feel pretty good. Hopefully the guys are okay. We're about to go check on them. See you when we get there. - Oh man, we just woke up after probably one of the
worst night's sleep ever. We keep doing these videos
and every time I'm like, that was the worst night's
sleep I've ever had. This one is the new worst. - My body hurts so bad. - These guys are overreacting. I mean, yeah, the ground
was a little rough, but it wasn't that bad. - I don't know when or
what time it happened, but felt that millipede fell on my face. I just wake up and I just go what the. And I seriously considered getting up and not doing this anymore. - How you doing Chan?
- Hey Tareq. - How you feeling?
- Feel better. Everyone's looking at me. - Our makeshift tent surprisingly worked. This log didn't break and send all the other logs onto our face. Which is nice because a log
to the face would've hurt, especially in the middle of the night. You guys heard how Chris
reacted towards the millipede. - Hey, bugs are scary. - Oh, why do you have the knife again? - It just finds its way
into my hand, I don't know. - I think Chandler faked being sick 'cause he didn't wanna sleep out here. - I wish.
- Wanna come join us? - I'm not ever coming here again. (all laughing) - Cleaning time.
- Cleaning up. - Put the knife down.
- Put the knife down. - Just helping. - Chandler, stop having sharp objects. Maybe the caterpillar felt threatened 'cause you're always holding weapons. - I was defenseless with my hula skirt on. And he just came up in
my loins out of nowhere. - [Tareq] In your loins? - [MrBeast] As you can see,
we cleared up the campsite and we're not gonna
leave any trash behind. - Watch out for bugs. Do research. - Almost all these trees were
dead trees on the ground. So we didn't really cut anything
down just so you're aware. Camping is a lot of fun,
but if you ever do do it, make sure you pick up after yourself. It's not good for the environment to leave plastic and trash, obviously. And speaking of the environment, if you're a YouTuber that
wants to make an impact in any way, I want you to
get in contact with me. We're gonna plant a ton of trees, but I need a lot of YouTubers' help. So tweet at me, comment on my Instagram, leave a comment on this video,
just get in contact with me. I need an army of YouTubers. We really wanna make a difference. And with that, I'll see
you Jake Paulers later. ♪ MrBeast, oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast, oh ♪
