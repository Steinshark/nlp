so everybody knows that internet addresses all have dots in them except for the ones that don't wait what fun fact it's actually entirely possible for a website to exist with zero dots in its address like these websites try typing in PN slash or AI slash into your web browser if it doesn't work on your desktop try doing it on your phone and look at that a couple of real actual web pages without a dot in sight but why you already know that the end of a web address is typically something like.com or dot net these are called top level domains or tlds no R they help get you to the website you want but as the name implies they're still domains meaning they can in theory direct you to a specific website on their own if you just typed in something like Com or net with nothing else attached the most common tlds aren't associated with specific web addresses but there are some two-letter tlds that were originally meant to be used by folks within a specific country so like a DOT UK TLD if you live in London and need to make a website for your fish and chip shop but these country code tlds can instead be used for other purposes including mapping to specific websites on their own like in the examples we gave towards the beginning of this video and for you networking nerds all you need to make a dauntless domain work is to link it to something called an address record or an a record that will use the DNS to point the dotless domain to an actual IP address and return you a nice shiny web page why the heck isn't this more common I mean wouldn't it be easy to Simply type in a word or a brand name and immediately get their website instead of dealing with all those messy.orgs and what nots I don't even I don't like those we'll tell you why the internet shouldn't work that way right

as our internet overlords decided to officially ban dauntless generic tlds these are tlds not nominally tied to a specific country like the classic.com and Dot net or more recent ones like dot work or dot crypto but they weren't banned because I can hate fun or convenience they had several good reasons the first is that Dallas domains actually are already in use but they tend to be used on large internal networks that you might see inside something like a large corporation there's actually a long history of users in these situations expecting a local site not an Internet site to show up extending this functionality to the public internet could cause a name-space collision for example if you expected Netgear to lead to both a private page for managing your local networks equipment and netgear's official website because you feel like buying a new router today your poor computer might not know how to handle that it's a similar issue to why the examples we gave at the beginning of the video might work on your phone but not your PC and this fact actually highlights an even bigger problem security because people have an expectation of trust when it comes to their local networks it would be very easy to accidentally send sensitive data to a completely different public site that has the same dot list domain name even aside from that specific risk many systems are configured in different ways to treat local addresses with more lack security and if your PC thinks it's talking to a dotless domain on your local private network but is actually connected to a public domain with the same name that opens the door to Myriad potential security holes and comedic situations finally we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that thoughtless domains would largely break email you see email commonly is sent over a protocol called SMTP and SMTP simply isn't built for DOT list domains it can't even understand them so if you try to send a message to an address that looks like this you'll just get a big fat Return to Sender in reply so it's really not surprising that when Google tried to make another other push to normalize doubtless domains a few years ago icann told them to go pound sand Google wanted to do this so they could register tlds like app and search so whenever users typed in these words they'd get directed to a Google owned website kind of reminds me of that time
