link in the description uh here we go like I said today is going to be late intermediate uh early advance and um my first opponent is rated 1,200 uh I don't know why I put 1400 up here um I should have put 1,00 so we're playing against uh okay E4 uh I've played everything obviously uh let's play a sicilian I never played the Sicilian Defense ever like literally ever uh and um I I you know I kind of want to Branch out a little bit play some different openings the Sicilian Defense is one of the most confrontational it fights for the center with a flank Pawn Knight C3 is um not the most common move the most common way to play the Sicilian is Knight here and a pawn push in the center to trade my opponent could still do that but for now uh this is an indication that they would maybe like to do something else and the stronger you get a chess the better you're going to understand well let's see what they do uh it's most common to Def uh develop the Knight after developing uh the pawn on C5 Knight F3 and like we see there you know the pawn can go to D4 next now there is one drawback of the setup is that now I actually can play E5 whereas if my opponent had just developed traditionally with the Knight and then pushed uh I can't do that but we'll analyze that after a little bit Knight F3 a lot of different Sicilians exist um the most principled is and one of the easiest to know how to play is called the dragon Sicilian uh with Pawn to G6 and Bishop to G7 now we do in fact get this trade and we are in the dragon Main Line uh this is the accelerated Dragon defense we target the center with the Knight and the bishop the best way for white to play is put the bishop out put the queen out hit us with a little long castles and the best way for us to play is to Castle our King this way and then we get into a big fight so Sicilian Dragon very reputable opening uh very easy to play um because the ideas are relatively straightforward the hard part about the Sicilian becomes what if white doesn't play into this position and there is a lot of that in the Sicilian I don't like that my opponent is thinking um and uh but again this is like that early you know early to late intermediate level where you do have to know some of the ideas of your opening and the best idea here is to defend yeah you really never want to go back to the home Square because you've just kind of wasted time right now I'm going to play like I can develop in Castle in general it's a good idea to not allow a knight in the center to get hit with a pawn like it's better to go D6 Knight F6 but in this particular case this move is fine notice that our Knight targets their pawn it is protected but if the pawn goes forward suddenly even though we only have one piece looking at it and they have one Defender after E5 Knight G4 we now have two three pieces looking at that pawn and that pawn perishes so my opponent should probably develop a bishop and pro and Castle or or should develop this bishop and try to Castle great move I mean if I just said that and they did it it's probably good we're going to Castle now um you know they might learn from me they might not they might do something else they might develop this bishop uh but we've we've sort of fulfilled our plans and we're just going to play Simple chess put the pawn out to D6 that's a weird move I don't quite understand what that's trying to do or my opponent trying to play this like a Magnus Sicilian a little bit like I I'm really not sure by the way D5 was also completely reasonable trying to trade uh lot of good options here oh they are trying to play it like a magnum Sicilian wow uh the Magnus Sicilian being an opening where you play Pawn to D4 you trade and then you drop back that's very interesting well now uh we have many many many plans um when this Pawn goes here and the bishop comes out you know we're looking over there um I'm I'm thinking about Bishop G4 I the only reason I would trade on F three is because it damages the pawns and then I can go after and create a forking situation it's not a guarantee which is why the move Bishop to G4 is okay but again you need to be able to explain why you're trading a bishop for a knight otherwise it's just a bad decision for instance if my opponent went there and traded for uh my knight on the next move I would not be able to explain that move right like I don't know why you would do that whereas I'm going where I'm going because because I want to take it might not be the best plan but it is my plan right and so now I can play Knight D4 or Knight E5 and we are sort of starting to see why it wasn't really the best plan because it's kind of very easy to defend I mean white you know can just protect the pawn white doesn't have to lose anything uh but that's chess right that's sort of how it works and if I had gotten you know the chess deck I would have known better no just kidding uh I am hypothesizing my opponent is going to be castling Queen side here uh because the king is so open there Queen E2 makes sense and do we take the bishop or do we like where our Knight is what do we what are we trying to do uh do we like pinning the the the Knight to the yeah that that move doesn't look that bad Rook C8 doesn't look bad a lot of you would take but the art of getting better at chess is if you don't have to take you don't have to take you know you're not under attack so an improving move like one of these two is good let me let let me go out here with the queen what you'll learn in the Sicilian Defense is the queen is a very powerful attacking piece and here it's it's eyeing the queen side where if my opponent's king is going to go I I probably want some presence there that was not the best move uh the best move was probably jumping in to take advantage of the dark squares and the way you learn to take advantage of squares like this like these little nigh Hops uh I'll show you I'll show you um I'll show you as we progress now right away I'm thinking all right I don't even have to hesitate here I have a rook on the C file there's a king on the other side it's a move you don't really have to think too much about so I have a direct idea which is to get the Knight and the bishop for my Rook at which point I will be completely winning because my opponent loses two important Defenders now I do have a great reason to trade Knight for the bishop here and that reason is if I had taken a moment ago I'm not doing damage to the Pawns but now I am I am creating a doubled isolated pawn and right away I'm asking myself what if I just take what if I just attack the pawn like what if I play Queen C5 or queen B4 or queen A6 Queen C I actually cannot tell the difference so let's just go here and I mean how how is my opponent going to defend their Pawn right maybe I could have gone to A6 maybe to C7 maybe to C5 not D5 but C5 and we do have to remember that we have pieces on opposite sides we have Bishops on the same diagonal very easy to forget about that uh but it is true and if my opponent plays a move like Knight D5 I may need to take and then you know we're going to get chaos chaos on the board but once I get in over here I think it's going to be bad news for my opponent I'm going to take double up and I'm going to have you know all these pieces barreling down uh you can trade the queen you also don't have to trade the queen you can play Rook C4 uh but the thing to remember with a move like Rook takes Pawn is uh your queen is defending so if you take with the Rook you got to make sure that you're not getting deflected anywhere for instance I calculated Pawn to A3 which is a very reasonable move and if I had to move my queen far away I would lose my Rook but luckily I have Queen C I mean not luckily it's how chess works right now Bishop A3 doesn't work because I can take and I can take see by the way very very smart move if I couldn't go here like if I had a Pawn on that squ I would be in trouble because I would not have a queen move that saves my Rook if that was the position what I would need to do is probably give up my Rook for the Knight right does that make sense I hope it does now we go here everything is defended we have a battery we're about to have a triple battery on the C file at which point white is white is in trouble white is in a lot of trouble but white might have been in trouble when they volunteered to play so it's okay all right now we pause take a moment we breathe we take a sip of our leftover coffee I can't take that ah but I I do see a tactic here now I might get tunnel vision and play a move like Rook to C8 which is also a perfectly reasonable move but there actually is Bishop to H6 and the the way you would locate a move like Bishop H6 is you should always see the checks and that is a check that move was not useful a moment ago but it's uh it's quite useful now and that is just we're just going to be picking up a rook so that's a straight up pin Rook C8 is next now the only drawback to the move Bishop to H6 the only thing I can like conjure up as a drawback is um the fact that the dark squares will be weak near our King that is a that is a true squares but the relative value of our Bishop is probably a solid three and a half and by the way if you don't have to take that's the lesson in this game don't take nobody can nobody can get in the way so now okay now we should take and now the easiest way to win a winning win a winning position you don't have to do this I'm getting the Knight and I'm getting the bishop when it all gets cleared out when it all gets settled I'm going to be up a knight and I think a pawn uh now we can take one more Pawn I'm sensing the king is going to be very very very worried here and I'm going to go up and over and I'm just threatening a Checkmate that's mate and now the only move is Queen B5 and pre moove that this was a good move but it it should have been played a move prior so that was a that was a good game and I and I think I mean that's a compliment you know myself but we're we're taking a look at how uh you know to to handle this Sicilian Defense and I thought it was reasonable it's a little bit better for white in the beginning uh to to start with Knight F3 because once you allow me to put the Knight on C6 if I really want I can just close the whole center now this has been played and you know this sicilan has many many branches this was all fine but this was bad and you know my opponent if they're going to play the open Sicilian you have the responsibility of understanding what's next and that's why entering the Sicilian is scary for white uh and maybe there's simpler Sicilians out there for example if you're 1200 you you may just like the alipin with a very straightforward plan of just putting two Pawns in the center and then you don't need to worry about black playing uh the dragon like I did in this game or the nidorf or some other thing but you do have to know how to handle the opening cuz if you start going back this opening can sometimes play itself like it is very easy black gets this setup and I went Bishop G4 which I thought was smart and then I traded which I thought was okay this is a slight inaccuracy because it simply allows uh White to defend but now the best move is not this uh the best move as far as I'm concerned is is definitely fighting for these dark squares the computer really likes both of these moves and the way you come up with a move like Knight H5 is you have to think of it like this we traded a bishop for a knight so we lose a light squared piece but they lose a light and dark squared piece we have three pieces fighting for dark squares they have only two this bishop does not fight for dark squares means the dark squares are a little bit better right so we we can play moves like this not you can't play Bishop H6 now but that is kind of the idea but the way I I attack down the C file very thematic In the Sicilian Defense and um yeah Queen B4 is not necessarily the best but it is very simple very straightforward and it's very important how we did it here Bishop H6 Rook C8 this is exactly how you play an open Sicilian Defense particularly a dragon when they Castle on the uh Queen side but a lot of things have to be met you have to play you know they got to play E4 for you to play Sicilian they got to play the open Sicilian which my opponent sort of did but then he didn't play the most accurate way right then they got a castle Queen side which my opponent did if they castled King side the game plan would have been slightly different but that is how you play a sicilian Dragon opposite side castling I thought it was uh pretty instructive let's start the uh the next game I will play with the white pieces my opponent is not online all right let's see um this happens sometimes maybe I spelled their name wrong that also happens recruiting people and you know you might accidentally make some sort of mistake it happens all right that was my mistake that's kind of funny I put a zero instead of an o and a username H so difficult I've I played a lot of different openings uh so let's play D4 let's just play a Queen's Gambit Queen's Gambit Knight F3 maybe we'll play a Catalan with Knight Knight F3 G3 Catalan one of the best openings out there uh you can start with D4 C4 what you know one one just quick little sprinkle of knowledge one of the ways to completely shut down your opponent's tricks like for example they might play The Budapest Gambit you can start with night F3 and now you know you're going to play C4 anyway so the move Knight F3 is slightly limiting because there might be systems where you don't want to play it you want to play C4 Knight C3 E4 but overall it's a very flexible move uh now we can play like Magnus with G3 or we can play C4 I mean both are okay I can start with this this this and then I will play uh C4 later I mean they they're they're pretty similar like sometimes black can play B5 you know but but overall uh it's a Catalan either way you can play Bishop G2 or whatever I'm gonna play a pure Catalan and this is one of the most annoying openings that exist in chess all right it's a battle of will black take on C4 or will black play solidly how are they going to play it um the main line is to capture the pawn and you know white then tries to win it back at 1400 nobody really knows the Cutting Edge theory of the Catalan at 2700 they do like I'm familiar with many many lines here yeah this is a very common move by black to play B6 and now white can continue to apply pressure but actually the move B6 is already a relatively big commitment and you might remember in the last game how we used the the C file um we're going to take now that black has committed to putting the bishop on B7 we're going to capture now because the bishop on B7 will be a little bit stuck right the bishop will be stuck behind the pawn when it gets there and our next few moves are going to be Knight C3 Bishop to F4 Rook C1 and Knight to E5 develop Target the queen side hop into the center use the C file and I mean like the plans of the Catalan flow you know uh they they sort of are are are very easy to implement and sometimes your opponents especially at the intermediate level you you'll feel like you're just melting people um at a higher level people sort of prep like 15 20 moves deep in the Catalan like B6 is already and inaccuracy you will never see B6 at Master Level because for Masters you know they need to capture the pawn and hang on tight and um I don't understand what just happened why did my opponent give me another Pawn you know I I think it's kind of like more instructive if I allow my opponent to take back and just play like that never happened because the truth is this is the best move and I'm just going to be up a pawn but in most of your games Knight A6 will not be played like you're going to see a position that looks like Pawn takes Pawn does that make sense this is the best move but it's not something you can replicate over and over so I'm just going to go here I I don't know why my opponent didn't take the pawn on D5 that was uh why are they not I mean I'm going to do one more move and then if they don't take my Pawn on D5 why is my opponent not taking I don't like I'm trying to just show you how to play with the open C file are they just panicking a little bit like I don't know what's happening like did they think do they think they're blundering I mean I I get it you're playing me right so like you might play me you might get nervous you might do I I don't know is this deliberate why I mean I I'm running out of moves I okay I I guess I will take and take I I don't know I'm so confused um I uh I don't know are they going to let me take again I'm yeah but now I'm just up a pawn I don't know what happened I was trying to give it back all right that was admittedly a bit odd but I I will show you in the analysis afterward I guess how how to handle the the position now the game plan changes obviously because we have two Central pawns so I'm looking down here I'm looking down here I mean we can still play a move like Rook C1 we can play E4 to take the big Center at some point black might go here let's let's let's play E4 you know the the knights support the pawns and we're threatening a fork lot of lot of even intermediate players have blind spots with forks in the center um a lot of people just forget the pawns can walk forward I think my opponent just either got nervous or panicked or I'm not sure I I I mean all I did was take on D5 I I really didn't do anything that special but it happens and then sometimes people are really upset afterward they're like I can't believe I played like that and but it's life it's okay um that's a move so now I'm thinking D5 attacks the bishop E5 attacks the Knight Knight to E5 attacks the queen uh they all look I mean good uh I would say avoid getting blockaded by a knight that's a mini lesson if you can play a move where the Knight doesn't just hop into the middle of everything so we can discard this that's a little lesson for you D5 is fine but the bishop will come over here um I would say you know jump in with the Knight especially if your knight can't be attacked easily like making an improving move like this and then building behind the Knight is very decent also keeping an eye on the things in your opponent's position that are unprotected those two things are unprotected so a move like Queen A4 will have a lot of power behind it uh because then I will win a pawn and then I will try to escape but if I don't get trapped well now I can't play Queen A4 so that's that um I want to go D5 but there's a little tactical problem with that move is that my knight stops having a protector so after D5 my opponent can take which is a very easy thing to overlook uh very easy to blunder that actually so Improv move improving move bringing another piece right this is something we need to we need to get better at as an intermediate just just make a move that brings the piece to the table to the party that doesn't overcommit also I have spent 28 seconds on the last three moves that I've played 28 28 and 23 bad time management but I'm obviously trying to be instructive uh several moves ago I had like a one and a half minute time Advantage if you're playing Blitz you got to sustain that right and uh I'm not the best person to you know don't study my games I spend way too much time Rook d8 is a very reasonable move it's a very good move targeting my Pawn um I mean I'm a little worried about something like C5 but not like insanely worried I think I'm just going to bring another Rook right so now both my Rooks are playing when the Knight moves I will have something this can be targeted with the pawn but then I will push and this move actually kind of sneakily defends that Knight sneakily when I say sneakily remember earlier the bishop could take not anymore not anymore because my knight will be defended could I have joined with a move like F4 some of you might be wondering you know could I have played F4 F4 F5 probably yeah probably I mean you know I I I don't really want to default to that but like pushing Pawns in front of my king but F4 is a very reasonable move to defend the Knight H in fact I can you know I can probably go for it now I uh I can probably go D5 now as well uh my opponent cannot take the B with the bishop but more importantly my Pawn has four Defenders and I'm just kind of making it more safe like a a move ago it was not particularly safe now it's quite safe the bishop will move my knight will will be targeted and then I will need to decide whether to defend it or move it yeah um tough to say like you can defend it but you might get stuck there's actually a really beautiful move uh if if I play Queen D4 it's a it's a big mistake there is C5 um now yeah I'm going to show you know I can play F4 but it's not always a good idea to weaken your king there's going to be potential problems here like Queen E7 Queen C5 this is an instructive move I mean I can probably trade I can I can go back we're up a pawn so as long as trading is not you know causing any sort of big damage we can we can make an exchange there Bishop takes I can use my queen I can use my my pawns to go forward like I can play E5 for example now we we won Connect Four which is quite nice we have a little bit more space in the center a big mistake would be to move the C Pawn now because it would give me a connect five which is bad enough but my Pawn would just be a huge problem for black to deal with um and slowly you know we will we will hunt down the queen side like we'll play Queen C2 which is very typical Catalan style um I can take but then the queen is getting active but and and there is literally no need to take by the way like for instance I can play Queen B3 and just sort of ask what was the idea of this move and the point of this move is that I'm you know I'm getting closer to targeting my opponent's uh Queen side for example I can move my knight and then I'm attacking this pawn and my knight stops guarding this but the queen is guarding it so we'll see if my opponent notices that the pawn is hanging I need to save myself time as well for the scramble I can start pushing through yeah I mentioned how this move would you know might be a mistake this move is a mistake it is very natural here to play a move D6 uh but uh I'm going to show you how to spot tactics from a little while away after it takes Knight takes we actually can take with the Rook because we have a discover check takes and um if the Knight takes on C6 yeah we can take with the rook and Knight to F6 is a discovered attack on the queen it's very important that the queen cannot take the Knight that is very very important my opponent plays Rook D3 Counterattack defended by the bishop so now I will slide out of the way protect my rook and uh black is gonna play fast because they don't want to lose on time Rook here is a trade going take with the Knight or the pawn the Knight kind of controls a little bit more space that is unfortunately uh free and now the easiest thing to do is just to go all the way down so I'm going to play Rook D1 my opponent should make a lift make sure yeah good move doing what you can but I'm I'm still coming down there got a trade great move by the way this is excellent stuff by black trying to survive you got to go here now if you you want to yeah wow wow really impressive this is seriously impressive uh defense here I got to tell you yes now I mean I'm winning but like uh you know I got to I got to hold my nerves here you know I gotta like not blunder a Checkmate or somehow luckily I can tuck away to H1 but oh my opponent ran out of time of course it is losing but my idea here was to threaten Queen f8 and Bishop F3 which is checkm in two so it's checkm in two moves not if this move is played actually but like let's say here ah that also stops it this it's m too Queen f8 Bishop F3 okay that was weird though because I tried to play a Catalan which you know which I thought was pretty reasonable and then my opponent played Knight A6 and Rook B8 which um was gave me a plus4 Advantage I'm really not sure why they did that um I don't know I maybe they panicked uh but uh yeah I mean of course after C takes D5 you know black will go here I will play Knight C3 Bishop B7 Bishop F4 and the best way for black to play is probably some sort of you know C5 or so they they might play Knight B D7 I would play Rook C1 and maybe C5 and like this would be our Battleground we would play this position and in the Catalan what you do with white is you you know you try to hop in with a horse try to play something like Knight to E5 and uh you have long-term pressure on the position with a lot of your pieces it it's a it's a really great weapon I mean it it really is I I would play it myself if you know people at the Master Level didn't all prepare for 20 plus moves like Master Level chess has sort of killed chess a little bit uh and yeah I mean when my opponent wasn't taking back and gave me this then yeah it became a lot easier I don't know was definitely a bit strange I thought I was playing you know pretty well pretty good improving moves and uh maybe I made like one or two inaccuracies but here it's important to spot you know like for instance if if you got a tactic puzzle that was this you were doing puzzles you know you would spot Knight F6 check because it's one of your only checks it also happens to win a Queen by discovered attack now it's it doesn't work if the queen can take so the way you spot these things is literally from back here I mean that that this is next level puzzle solving you know you you you you what I just showed you that one move tactic you're going to get so good that you're going to spot things from five moves away you're going to spot things from this position you're going to say oh if Knight E4 you know C6 I can take take Rook takes because then after Queen C6 there's Knight F6 check like you're going to spot stuff like that that's the next level that was an interesting game I'm going to have black in the next game um yeah I mean if you blunder early I'm I'm going to have to uh I'm GNA have to win uh my next opponent is also not online that's weird please refresh chesscomnews um maybe I spelled this person's name wrong too totally possible hopefully not though here we go they are still not online all right that's [Music] good trying to film somehow to win a chess how to win a chess let's see if I can um maybe send a challenge to my opponent maybe a little bit of a challenge to my opponent I don't know I don't know why that's happening very strange all right I'm going to challenge this person challenge uh dude and I'm going to play this game with the black pieces if this doesn't work then I don't even know what to do okay all right this is not working [Music] um I guess we will have to skip this person I don't know why there are such technical difficulties but you get to watch me struggle for like a minute or two minutes so that's good I will try one last time and if this individual cannot yeah they just cannot figure it out I don't know what's happening all right then I will play the next person okay I think my opponent's streaming this game by the way 1,700 this guy's a Brazilian and also told me before the game that they were going to beat me um so I've played a lot of different stuff I mean I can play caroan I can play uh five let's see what e45 looks like Knight F3 KN C6 should be five um there's a lot of ways to play against the Spanish my favorite way to play the Spanish is to play the yanish Gambit oh my opponent uh played that very fast a counter strike in the center of the board uh easiest thing to do here is probably to just take and you know put a put a knight on F6 so you can also take on D4 it is possible but let's take here and now don't blunder Queen H5 check that would be very tragic and we play this position of course we can play like million different Spanish you can play A6 you can play Knight E7 you can play the Hikaru Spanish which is Bishop to C5 uh the plan here for black is to play Bishop D6 because developing any other way is really difficult if you play D6 the Knight takes which is no good um but Bishop D6 and and and you know you can like Queen E7 and and get rid of the uh the piece A6 is probably also okay uh looking at it but um yeah this is the way you you get rid of the Knight you are just straight up through threatening to capture it now and you want them to take you because then you get the pawn out active Bishop life is good okay cool right just just describe this move uh we can take with this Pawn but then I don't open the bishop so in in in generally in E4 E5 structures when there's a capture on C6 it's better to take away from the center which is counterintuitive to basically everything you're taught now some of you may be looking at this position and wondering do I have a Greek gift can I play Bishop takes H2 check King takes Knight G4 check King goes back we H4 Checkmate on the next move no not all the conditions are met because the bishop can go to F4 and defend H2 and that's tough to see you may look at me and go how do you see that in two seconds it's not I've played chess for 20 years so I kind of have to see stuff like that um I can Castle which is mildly annoying so what I can do is probably try to prepare a long castle with Queen E7 uh I can also Play Bishop F5 Queen D7 long Castle this move to me looks a bit more flexible because it protects my Pawn which is nice and also maybe I can trade his Bishop which I cannot do if I you know commit the bishop to the F5 Square okay solid we will continue to have a big battle defending this Pawn I imagine my opponent will play like Bishop here and maybe Rook G1 I'm going to go long this is a bit of a strange move I I mean I get it I I get you're trying to send me a warning shot but I don't believe that you have anything like A5 is great first of all I can play A6 but second of all what what's the plan when I just say no thank you like I'm I'm not really interested uh I don't know if there is a plan and now my friends now I am going to start some sort of attack over there I don't know if I'm going to go for a Greek gift because I still don't think it works but the attack is looking mighty scary potentially over there I just need to figure out exactly how like Knight G4 H3 okay I keep talking about bringing pieces to help I'm going to bring a rook here my opponent's going to play A6 I don't know what they're going to play after that uh but uh yeah like just you know defend just push how was how was he getting through how's he getting through maybe D5 but D5 you got to look at what's on the opposite sides of each other it's such a shame the Greek gift doesn't work but respect to my opponent who keeps playing every move basically instantly uh listen opposite side castling we just got to go for it you know H5 H4 we're going to just the way he pushed this pawns I'm going to start pushing my pawns over there but he's playing he's playing very well he's playing fast uh the only thing that's kind of keeping me from panicking is that I'm playing a subscriber really like if I was playing a 26 2700 I might be a little bit concerned like oh no you know but see I'm I'm I'm doing what I'm supposed to I'm bringing my pieces my queen is going to help my Rook is going to help my Pawn is far so it's also going to help and unfortunately I don't think you can afford to lose Pawns in front of your king because it now Queen H4 doesn't work because of Bishop G5 but I can go back and that's bad now you lost the defense Queen H4 is going to happen unless Bishop G5 might find Bishop G5 oh no no no no he played too fast played too fast yeah now now it's over played too fast yeah no I mean we got into a very complicated game and I and I think uh I like that capibara kaspar Gary Kasparov I don't know why my opponent is spending the most amount of time in the game on the Move where he's about to get checkmated now maybe I'll rub it in once and the reason I'm doing this is before the game this person said that they would beat me so I unfortunately have to rub it in slightly um now I will sacrifice this bishop and then I will Checkmate them aay okay we got to that that was a little bit I I didn't you know I didn't love that um I uh let's analyze Knight F3 Spanish yanish yanish is very tricky or the schan it's got two names for some reason the idea is that you want to go here and the point is that you it's actually kind of a reverse Vienna Gambit any Vienna enjoyers know that in the Vienna you Gambit your F Pawn to push the E Pawn forward well you do the same thing here that's sort of the point you Gambit your F Pawn to push your E Pawn forward actually you know white could get a very bad position very quickly I mean you play like Queen G5 and you know you take on F5 and suddenly you're just much better as black which is sort of the point um and uh my opponent play D4 which is a good move and then here I played Knight F6 the the engine line is Knight takes here you have like C6 if Queen H5 you have G6 white can sacrifice the bishop but like nobody plays like this I think it's much more human to play this move castles Bishop D6 and um many people here against me play Bishop F4 after Queen E7 black is completely fine and if you take I'm more than completely fine because you trade off your piece so now I have two pieces active right now again this doesn't work because here this looks like mate it's not B F4 so you cannot do a gree gift if at the end the opponent has a defensive move that diagonally or any other way defends uh the H2 Pawn or the H2 Square rather and so this was instructive how my opponent attacked me but but it's what's kind of crazy is black is already much better the computer evaluates the prospects of attacking each other much better better for black it did not uh it did not care to stop this advancement it allowed a yeah but but now that's sort of it and the difference is that now when I start attacking you know Knight G4 all these different moves they're all going to be quite quite brutal I should have probably just gone Knight G4 but I didn't know what to do after H3 the computer really likes shoving the knight in and then getting access to the F3 Square by taking on H three which is pretty hilarious and now we see yeah this is bad news Queen is coming queen is coming something like this Knight G4 and unfortunately my opponent did not protect their King and that was that I mean but that is uh that is one way to play a very very aggressive Spanish with uh with a with a yanish Counterattack uh my last opponent I believe is rated close to 18800 but I think still in the 17s maybe to replace the previous person I can play somebody who's 1500 but unfortunately I don't have any challenges that was weird I don't know what happened 1772 that was when that Columbus sailed the ocean blue maybe that was 1492 I played a Catalan uh I can play a game of E4 and we're going to see what my opponent plays uh maybe we'll just play like a very simple Italian like we don't we don't need to play a Vienna every game it's a great opening but now I can play the Spanish or I can play the Italian which is just a very very very classic basic opening uh the fried liver is very decent but the thing is as people get stronger they start studying it and and they learn all the theory and things like that and so um yeah they uh they study everything so we can just play a two nights two nights with D3 and um we can play C3 this move has many purposes it stops anything from coming in It prepares D4 it also gives an escape uh for the bishop you can Castle the move Bishop G4 is uh is is aggressive and it's quite common but it's it's not particularly scary uh because white you know is not in any danger of the Knight coming in over here at the highest level this is not considered completely accurate because the bishop sort of now has to hide in many lines but it's I mean it's it's completely fine and then what white likes to do here is white likes to play Knight bd2 and then advance and uh and then very slowly and methodically prepare this move d4 so we're going to try to give you a you know a master class in in how to handle the Italian one thing black can do is not castle and just start this pawn attack on White's King but it's if defended properly it is it is not that scary I mean even now by the way there is this very interesting move like G5 and I cannot take uh this move to me by the way and this important you pay attention to what your opponents are doing as well this to me is a move that's indicating they want to go this way which is why I'm now I'm now going to advance over there and tell them you know what if you do that there's going to be a big attack and I might I'm I'm I'm doing this because th this type of Pawn formation is very common in the Joko piano the Italian game uh but at the same time if my opponent you know castles that way now it's could be bad news I mean also this just straight up wins a bishop right so now I I'm thinking for a moment and um I mean there's a lot of like easy moves you can play in the Italian that you don't really change the evaluation too much so I'm going to make a little plan uh I'm going to put my Bishop back on B3 to put my knight on C4 and then to open up my dark Sor Bishop that's my plan I'd like to damage the structure okay luckily I you know I got my opponent to Castle so that's great uh I'm going to continue to execute this plan it doesn't really affect too much and then a big question is do I want to trade the bishop like in many lines trading the dark squared Bishop is nice because this bishop doesn't bother me at the same time I can play here and try to take the Knight and play a bit more like like that um it all it all kind of seems all right let let's go here let's try to damage the the pawn structure for my opponent so that then we can we can exploit it I do think this was the better move and I also think I probably should have unpinned myself earlier because now when my knight you know is no longer protecting if I unpin there's Bishop takes wow my opponent is saying take me take take huh very interesting stuff it's about to get very very spicy here I feel like then I'm going to try to put my knight on F5 very complicated game Brewing here potentially okay let's go let's let's see who's the genius I'm gonna put my knight back and we're g to try to exploit the light squares now my opponent did this so they they can attack me on the king side which it's going to become pandemonium now right going to be absolutely crazy very interesting stuff also that's a weak Pawn so I can kind of sneak an attack onto that pawn at some point my opponent should probably reroute to fight for my my night Maneuvers as well and I do you know we we we want to keep a good amount of time on the clock that we're we're ready for the complications one other thing by the way um one other thing is that G4 is possible in some lines to just completely push back the bishop and sort of shut down my opponent's attack before it can get started uh I can't quite move my queen because then Bishop takes F3 I want to play Knight F5 but then there's Knight E7 so maybe G4 is the way to go just say you want to attack me it's just not going to work out I also have King H2 and King H1 just kind of getting also out of the way of the attack I expect one of these moves my opponent is hitting me from far away with pieces Knight D5 might have been also Knight D5 was probably probably very good because I I don't see an easy way to defend the F6 Pawn now I might play it Knight D5 but there might be Rook G6 would have been a bit more accurate to uh play that move a move earlier G4 if Bishop takes I even wonder if my opponent can sacrifice on G4 ow this is getting this is getting kind of wild now now how about I don't have Knight takes E5 but it is a very cool looking move and I also like B5 still and I still like Knight F5 everything looks reasonable question is which one do I play let's put the KN on F5 I think it's a very nice move I think it disconnects a lot of what black wants and wow the position is very crazy so I'm going to show you some tactics I I can't even fully explain them like I can't I I can mention them yeah so I think now I can play Knight takes C5 because I couldn't do it a moment ago but there I will take the bishop and if Knight E5 Bishop here I can take on on D on on on D7 and then I can take on F6 oh my goodness this is a crazy move Knight takes E5 is there Queen f five though might be I completely missed this move Queen takes F5 defending the bishop and then my queen is hanging I didn't even see that I was trying to be instructive and trying to like explain everything and wow that is uh that is a really wild move I mean if my opponent finds that they're brilliant player they did not find [Laughter] that I got away with one though oh my it's tough to play these series because I want to talk and I want to explain and like I don't always have the luxury of doing that um let's just trade the Queens if I trade I can't blunder any more pieces but that was crazy we got to we got to take a look at that and um the Bishops are opposite color which means the end games tend to be a little bit drawish uh but we're going to do our best to win the game going to play like G4 I have to sneeze what no no now I'm just up two puns opposite color Bishops end game tend to be drawish because you can't really repel the enemy Bishop so you have to just you know work around it now I'm going to seal this position probably just bring some help and these pawns are just too strong I imagine once you have a bishop surrounded by many pawns like this it becomes very difficult for the defensive side which is my opponent because I'm up two pawns um because black just runs out of space when these pawns are and the Bishops are all kind of protecting each other so now what I should do is I should obviously avoid you know blunders but I can start trading very slowly and making my way into the black position B5 might have been slightly rushed but the idea is that after takes takes the bishop is hanging and then I make a couple of Trades um it's the same it's actually Mirror Image position regardless of which Pawn I take but now now we start taking the open file it's important we keep enough pawns on light squares as well because the enemy Bishop is on a dark Square so they can't Target those pawns but we don't want to put every Pawn in a light Square because then the black Bishop becomes a beast just you know conundrum everything is good um if you want to win an endgame that involves four Rooks you generally need to trade one pair so it would be a good decision for me to trade one of the Rooks not both of them could slowly bring our King to protect our Pawn black is going to probably move in the center here but because I control so much space I think life is good F6 is a would F6 would be great I can't play it though because they take so Rook B7 is is on the cards we we opened up one infiltration spot now I can play F6 CU my Bishop is no longer protected and uh F6 is a is a very nice move to play because it completely shuts down the black king So now Black's King is stranded on the back Rank and I just need to oh that was my Discord I apologize um thought I had streamer mode enabled that was not your Discord that was my Discord uh Rook f8 good idea yeah now we should probably there's a lot of there's a lot of ways to win Rook here take take Rook f8 G7 here check uh goes back F7 so like I said trade one pair of Rooks the defenses will go down my opponent wants to play Rook f8 so they're going to trade trade they're going to play Rook f8 then I'm going to play Rook G7 King h8 Rook H7 King G8 F7 check and I'm going to win the rook and resign that allows Checkmate I just talked about this spotting tactics from the move before the tactic trade check and that is made on the back rank due to the king being being stopped that was a that was a instructive game I think lot of instructive moments we're going to start with me missing uh Queen takes F5 yep it is losing it is just straight up losing incredible I did not even wow I'm just better here but I wanted to show this idea kn5 and it completely fails that's so spectacular so this is one of these moments where and you know white was better like white obviously had the advantage positionally there's this moment where you're pinned but you can move your knight you would just lose your queen but you can take something and then take the bishop because you're going to win their Queen but the problem is that after captures the queen captures the queen black gets a full Bishop that's that was that has been the problem and my knight can win a rook but I'm going to lose more material for it uh and uh that's why Knight takes E5 was never working that's why I was playing Knight E3 and King H2 do like I was just playing these sort of positional moves it was by the way instructive how my opponent damaged their structure in order to create an attack on the same side very instructive very nice idea however um here I should have just gone back attacked the bishop put the bishop here and kept fighting for the light squares played like Knight H4 right with pressure maybe played F4 in the future but definitely like Queen F3 and just you know you see what happens like black is stuck black can't move forward because of their compromised Pawn structure they will probably need to start sacrificing pawns which I probably shouldn't even take but that is sort of the concept and that is why when I traded my Bishop on G5 for the Knight on F6 that has an explanation the explanation is I open my opponent's king the second explanation is they they immediately have two weaknesses the third EXP is the light squares are really damaged we just I showed that in the previous game where if you trade a bishop for a knight the color complex strength and weaknesses uh change and um yeah then then I went for this Knight takes E5 and and Knight F5 is uh this is a wild concept where the queen is hanging this queen is hanging and the reason why this works now is because I can play Knight E7 there's a hanging Knight there wasn't the hanging at Knight in the previous version uh which is so insane but I I played this move and was like oh my God there's this you get a knight you hang your queen but I'm hanging my queen and then if you take this my knight is hanging it's I mean it's very complicated stuff like I it's it's understandable to kind of miss queen F5 but the point is that it's a Desperado that's what that's called you're both going to lose queens and there's no way to enter the capture chain or the capture sequence uh and of course you know I should not have gotten involved in any of this this end game is is winning for white but it's nothing special but once you lose a second Pawn it's it's really bad um if my opponent play King G7 I probably would have slow played the position uh but uh this is a very I mean this is a this is holdable for black it's just a pawn and like I said opposite colored Bishops tough to win so uh I went for it at the completely wrong moment and uh yeah Queen F5 was was quite a special move that I sat here going oh my God if they play that uh I'm I'm going to end up down a piece but that was the series I was supposed to play five games I'm slightly I don't know what happened there to the person in the middle that's life but um that's that's that I hope you enjoyed check out the chess deck uh if you would like and uh I
