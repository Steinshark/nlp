I'm not gonna lie to you there's part of me that this just feels so natural like I I love I'm not gonna I love this I love this I also almost hate all software maybe there's just something about building software that makes you just hate software but I love this right I love this and so and I think it's okay it's okay to hate software like it's totally okay to hate software this is obviously a very old Ryan doll so if you don't know Ryan doll has created node.js mistake on the world global warming then he recreated it with Dino Dino uh I would argue I mean you make it the same mistake twice baby uh but anyways let's keep on going uh it's unnecessary and complicated that almost every layer at best I congratulate someone for quickly and simply solving a problem on top of the that they are given the only software that I like is the one that I can easily understand and solves my problems the amount of complexity I'm willing to tolerate is proportional to the size of the problem being solved agreed agreed uh in the past year I think I finally come to understand the ideals of Unix file descriptors and processes orchestrated with C it's a beautiful idea this is not however what we interact with the complexity was not contained instead I deal with DB dbus and the user lib and boost and I O controls and some and signals and violate of volatile variables and Proto Proto oh my goodness protocol protocol protocol inheritance now that's a word I have not heard in a long time and c99 features oh my goodness every now and then I had to do these back porting of features at Netflix and it's like all right I'm working on the product during 2021 now I'm working on the product at 2020. okay things are still good now I'm going to 2019. things are not as good now I'm going to 2018 remember this is a C plus plus television application I'm trying to like back Port some testing stuff so we can do interesting testing and it also that gets to like 2017 and you're just like what the the phone on here C plus plus like these features start disappearing things are starting to get difficult the code base is in way different than you just keep walking backwards and by the time you hit 2014 you're just like in this is crazy this is crazy this is crazy what's going on here nothing fun is happening D package and auto conf yeah uh those of us who build on top of these systems are adding to the complexity and not uh not only do you have to understand the LD the the library path that's fun uh to make uh your system work but now you have to understand node path too there's my little addition to the complex that you must know the users the ones who just want to see a web page don't care they don't care how do we organize slash user they don't care about zombie processes they don't care about bash tab completion they don't care if zlib is dynamically linked or statically linked to note this is so great this is you could just feel it in them right like after you've done this long enough like at some point you're just like that's it what am I doing with my life right and you just don't know what you're doing with your life and this is what happens there will come a point where the accumulated complexity of our existing systems is greater than the complexity of creating a new one when that happens all of this will be trashed I feel like we've achieved a new version with modern JavaScript right now like if you just look at what it takes the thing is is that the Simplicity is Extreme when you look at like modern serverless architectures but what actually is happening is so insane and that if you ever need to leave the serverless world like what you've got yourself into would be so hard to get out of it I look at a lot of these things and I mean I I understand that it's it's definitely it's not a it's not a pure win always it's a win for some people but man we can flush boost and g-lib and auto conf down the toilet and never think of them again and those of you who still find it enjoyable to learn the details of say a programming language being able to happily recite off if Nan equals or does not equal null you just don't understand how utterly the whole thing is if you think it would be cute to learn all the ink the previous set time configuring your window manager or your editor it's killing me oh it's so funny you don't understand oh up the whole thing is no one gives a about g-lib objects oh my goodness I love this I wonder okay so a real talk I wonder if Mr Dahl himself has this exact same opinion now that he's writing Deno or Dino I call it Dino I'm sure it's Deno it is very true I mean this is all 100 True honestly no one cares at the fact that my I have this experience going on in my editor no one cares but I'm curious if he still holds like the same ideas or to the same ideals as he did before I'm I I don't know and so I would love to see him react to his own article that he wrote 12 years ago real talk I think that that would be fun but I do feel his pain in the same sense that you can ex you can extend these arguments all of these arguments you can extend all of them to everything we do from the serverless crap that you have to do to the amount of nonsense you have to do uh even when you're building your own server Docker kubernetings you're doing all this crap just to get off the ground like people build this entire scalable infrastructure and they have like three users it just is like emotionally painful right you like go all out when you could just build the simplest piece of sh like architecture to work with your four users and so I don't know it is all very hilarious I think if if software wasn't a tragedy software would be a comedy it's just a tragedy this is great I'm very happy I read this this makes me so happy honestly some people look at this as super negative to me this is just like the fun of it all right is that we do like there is there is no ideal solution right if we still to this day cannot come up with an ideal solution after what 70 years of software 60 years of software there isn't one and that's okay it's like okay to hate it you can still also love it I just realized I had my keyboard camera on this whole time by the way Kinesis Advantage 360 everybody it's so beautiful do you like that the name is the primagen
