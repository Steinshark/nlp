hello everyone and welcome a little bit of a different format here so in this video we're talking about whether or not exhaust crackles and pops are fake and i am joined by matt moran of matt moran motoring guys thanks for uh chauffeuring me around very kind of you uh matt's a good friend of mine and we're doing this thing called ava's uh automotive video awards and we are in the hyundai veloster n which when you let off the throttle in end mode you'll hear some nice exhaust crackles and pops and so the first thing i want to do is explain why that's done how it's done and then we're going to talk about whether or not in the many cars that do that if it's actually fake and if it's something that enthusiasts should support so my first question to you is do you like exhaust crackles and puffs i love them okay we both agree that the f-type kind of started that we both love the f-type and it just continues with all these yes i love the f-type i like you do and yeah the sound it makes just makes you so happy and we're gonna get back to the f-type because that's a good example uh and and so we we like the sound of exhaust crackles and pops but uh what about fake engine noise piped in through speakers i think it depends on the application to me you know some of them actually use recordings of the actual engine and exhaust but i think it's cooler some others try and synthesize and blend in artificial stuff and i think that is what i dislike more but generally you know my theory is the more sound the better i enjoy sound so as long as it doesn't sound weird i generally don't frown upon it okay so maybe like an artificial example being like the i8 and it's got that tiny little three cylinder and then it has this like meaty interior like engine rev to it and you're like okay something's not really matching up right okay and in my in my opinion generally i don't like faking things and i i understand why it's done because manufacturers they don't want uh to have a loud interior so the consumer demands hey we want our interiors to be quiet and yet you don't hear exhaust crackles uh or engine sounds uh if the interior is really quiet so you know you have these speakers that play those engine notes and then you hear them and you get the noise that you want which is the engine but you don't have you know those the tire noise or the wind noise so i get why it's done okay now how is it done how are exhaust crackles done so the way they do this is actually pretty simple so generally speaking you have your four strokes and i'm sure you probably know this but this is a little uh engineering explained private session so you have your four strokes intake you pull in that air and fuel compression you compress that air and fuel right before you get to the top the piston gets to that top of the cylinder you fire that spark plug combustion occurs there's plenty of time for that combustion to occur and it pushes your cylinder down you make power you go forward feels great everyone's happy now when you let off the throttle what this car does instead of firing that spark before the piston reaches the top it waits so it compresses that air in fuel and then on its way down when there isn't too much time left then you fire the spark plug so combustion is occurring when you open up your exhaust valve and then you get all that noise thrown out the exhaust as perfect example thank you for doing that you know that noise thrown out the exhaust and it's when you're letting off the throttle so it's not when you need power because what you're doing is you're changing where that peak pressure occurs when you when you have that exhaust crackle you're having peak pressure occur when the exhaust valve is open so that pressure just shoots out the exhaust rather than forcing your piston down a little bit forces the piston down enough to you know keep the engine running obviously but that's not the goal of it the goal is to make that noise now with the veloster n and this is why i chose uh this vehicle to do this video with i actually spoke with al uh biermann who is the research and development boss for hyundai uh and i was talking with him about it and he says that the uh implementation of those exhaust crackles and pops in this vehicle in end mode are specifically designed to prevent uh turbo lag so they're done as an anti-lag system so that when you're shifting gears instead of having that pressure forcing the cylinder down and then cutting all power you create that pressure and you have it in the exhaust and by doing so it keeps that turbocharger spooled up while you shift and so you don't lose that boost as you get into the next gear and you don't have to wait for it to keep spooling up so it's a clever reason why they do it and it's a real reason and so when i hear about that i'm like okay this is actually cool uh very cool that's done in a production car and that it serves a purpose and that it sounds cool so it's just like a win across the board to me how does that everything sound so far yeah i mean i think if it's you know actually serves a purpose then that's an excellent excuse to have the fun sounds yeah especially in a vehicle like a velocirant you know yeah it totally fits it is like kind of a rally car you know i i completely agree so we're changing where that peak pressure occurs off throttle and we're having it occur in the exhaust okay so here's where i want to get back to the f-type because the reason why it's useful in this vehicle is because they're doing it to keep a turbocharger spooled up the f-type is supercharged there are naturally aspirated engines that do it as well yes and so in those cases it is not a functional sound that the sound is there for your enjoyment and that is the only reason so does that does that alone because i'm going to go deeper but does that alone matter to you not really okay i kind of feel the same way i mean it's just like humans are animals and we're just kind of dumb animals and we like fireworks and fireworks serve like literally zero purpose but they're fun to look out and they're loud and that's cool yeah so i i think that's kind of why the exhaust thing uh is okay with me but i'm gonna try and provide some more reasons why we shouldn't like it okay so three additional functional reasons of what should you do when you let off throttle so what should happen as soon as your right foot comes off the throttle what should an engine be doing well it should immediately kill fuel why okay obviously yes it saves fuel that's one reason the second reason is those revs are going to remain high if it's injecting fuel so if you're still having combustion occur it's going to make it harder for those rpms to drop so in a manual transmission like this you're going to get a little bit more rev hang as a result of that now you can use the clutch to force the thing to drop so in a scenario where you want to go fast that's the way you do it that makes sense but but the rev hang aspect of it i don't necessarily like and then also you know you may want engine braking maybe you want immediate engine braking so the second you let off and now you're having that combustion still occur you're waiting for that engine braking to actually start so fuel economy engine braking and not having those revs drop quickly i think are three additional reasons why you may not want to do it does that change your opinion at all no because i mean from a drivability standpoint you don't really feel that the engineers kind of work around that or whatever so that you don't at least i never feel that i pull it for okay that's fair it is fair and you're not getting a lot of pressure because remember most of that pressure is going into your exhaust rather than forcing that piston down so it's still able to drop uh you're not you're not producing a ton of power an interesting thing that porsche does uh different from kind of the others i don't think they do much of these exhaust crackles and pops from the factory maybe they're starting to now do you know of any i think the sport exhaust did it for a little bit in some of the like the gt cars and i think the sport exhaust the 911 okay 718. because one of the strategies porsche does is they actually kill fuel but they leave the throttle open and that's kind of one of the big reasons for revang is leaving that throttle open but the reason porsha says they do it is because they want to allow for that engine which is you know it's revving it whatever to keep forcing air through the turbo so it's not pressurized air from the sense that you know combustion is occurring but it's still more air than otherwise would be so they leave the throttle open and they keep forcing a bunch of air through it so that's porsche's strategy which is different and and doesn't have you know those exhaust crackles and pops and still is functional and i'm guessing i still haven't convinced you of anything as far as why this should go away nope sorry well that's great uh let me see if i have a simple man in the box he likes and butts that's fair i i think i think many of us do so all right here's another question then is is an exhaust crackle any better than uh speakers piping in engine noises if it's not functional i think i still prefer it because it's still it feels real yes you know just because there's actually some type of chemical reaction happening it's not just a speaker thing it's not electronic it's it's mechanical but i know that that's probably silly to defend because they're both completely artificial yeah okay well here's something to it so my counter to that is well what about fake arrow right because like fake arrow is actually functional it's actually real they're blocking off ports because they're trying to improve the arrow yet giving it an appearance uh that somehow you know there's all these scoops and inlets the super is a great example it's covered in all these little plastic fake ducts and they do it for aesthetics uh but so it's it's fake but it's kind of real in the sense that you know it's real plastic yeah so or or for example like a like a cvt like cvts now shift gears yeah uh and that's that's not a great strategy like it's a fake shift in the sense that like there really is shifting occurring but there aren't set gear ratios in a cvt uh and i get mad about that i like kind of call companies out and i'm like hey why don't you use the cbt the way it's designed to be used why don't you use uh you know aerodynamics the way it's designed to be used why don't we have exhausts that only make these crackles and pops if it's actually functional but then i i find myself kind of i guess like you feel going back to well it sounds cool so the end yeah i mean i think the fake arrow depends you know that's something comes into subjectivity and taste and yes i mean you know some people for example really dislike the civic type r and the way that those you know they could have toned it down and still kind of had all the same functions i think but then like with the cpt you know i think that does kind of go back to adding more fun because like in the wrx for example you have to get the cvt instead of the manual you still can have a little bit of fun playing around pretending you're you know shifters it's you know obviously yes it's artificial it's actually probably less efficient and less performance oriented to do the manual shifts but to me that goes back to the fun aspect and if it adds fun to the driving experience there's so many bland cars these days if a manufacturer is honestly trying to add fun i can respect it fair enough okay so to kind of close this out uh i i think to answer the original question are exhaust crackles and pops fake i think that kind of comes down to how do you define that and if you define fake as something that isn't functional and it's there for subjective purposes then i would say yes in a naturally aspirated or a supercharged car they are fake in the sense that they are doing nothing it's just a gimmick added to make us happy and in a car like this veloster and you know it actually can serve a purpose according to those who designed it so i i respect that avenue a lot more than the other end but at the same time you know if i were to if i would have an f-type that didn't have those crackles and pops like i'd probably be way sadder yeah exactly it's just it all goes back to the fun that's you know why we all love cars it's for the fun of them you know they don't always make sense in various ways but it's fun and that's why we love them fair enough so thank you all so much for watching matt thank you for joining me i'm going to include a random video of matt's that you should definitely watch if you haven't checked out his channel yet he's an awesome guy i truly respect his opinion what he thinks about cars so yeah i chat with this guy all the time because i haven't done as many reviews lately i think you do a great job with them so if you are more into the review style videos definitely check out matt's channel again
