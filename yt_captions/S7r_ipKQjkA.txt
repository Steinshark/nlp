everyone knows that you can turn on your torch by pressing the torch button but no phone seems to tell you that by holding down you can also adjust the brightness of it when you're trying to get somewhere and you've got baggage in one hand and your Maps app in the other instead of juggling you can actually just double tap and then slide without taking your finger off the screen to look around the map with one hand only if you want to hang up on someone do it by turning on airplane mode it looked like you've lost signal and is far easier than trying to pretend oh hey I I can't hear you very well okay bye I'm gonna try and give you 100 smartphone tricks in 15 minutes going from beginner to Pro to master that's one tip every nine seconds or eight seconds if I carry this intro on any longer if you struggle to get up in the mornings then the alarmy app can be said to only turn off when you take a photo of a specific thing like your cat Milo or with the rise and shine smiling alarm app a nice pic of your smiling face already done five let's make that 10 with five secret WhatsApp commands if you really want to stress a certain word then use an underscore before and after and voila it's italic and mildly aggressive the latest update means that you can edit messages within 15 minutes after sending them you can ask your voice assistant to read out your last WhatsApp message in case you can't use your phone right now you can even set a custom tone to play when certain people message you which I've only just set up last week and it's a really good way of separating chats that you need to respond to straight away and ones that you can wait for the ones that you're never getting back to and probably the coolest WhatsApp trick is that you can create shortcuts to specific WhatsApp chats as their own icon on your home screen well I'm actually doing pretty well for time so far you can in one go delete all duplicate photos to save some storage which is pretty handy if you keep re-downloading the same meme that you know you already have somewhere to send to every one of your contacts look at my memes it's too many you can also search for your unused apps in your storage settings and uninstall those in Android contacts left swipe a contact name to message them right swipe to call them you can long press on the spacebar on IOS and Android to scroll the cursor trust me when you get used to this it's a way faster way of navigating than fiddling with your massive fingers and trying to tap the exact spot you want you can swipe to flick between your existing tabs in both Chrome and Safari and if you want to open a completely new tab just swipe again while you're on your latest app so that's the basics this is where we step it up time for pro level turn your Wi-Fi details into a QR code that you can leave in your house so no guest ever needs to ask you again for your password then scan this one and if you want to go even further get yourself an NFC tag and use the NFC tools app to make one swipe of it transfer across those Wi-Fi beats if you wear headphones a lot and you worry you're going to miss someone at the door use the accessibility sound recognition or sound notifications features it lets your phone listen out for any loud noises on your behalf and just notify you when it hears them instead of just setting dark mode on or off set it to change with the time of day given how much time we spend on our phones this can actually help you with your body's natural sleep weight Rhythm you'll get lots of blue lights during the day which will keep you up and then almost zero at night use tax replacements for long things that you type often this will mean that tiny little trigger words will be enough to enter the entire thing you can take scrolling screenshots to capture an entire web page in one go that's really simple you just take the screenshot as you normally would tap full page and all that information is already there with Google Assistant enable continued conversations it'll listen for a moment after every time it's response under two so you don't have to say the weak word every time this is coming to Siri in the next update too I like this one on an iPhone swipe down on the home screen hold down the stopwatch panel to instantly set a timer without even opening the clock app you tap your dial button to bring up the most recently dialed number in Android's Google Chrome settings you can change the toolbar shortcut to whichever command you use the most so you could make this a quick share button if you're very socially active or just a voice search button if you're more of a hands-off browser you can shuffle your iPhone wallpaper so that you get a new one every single time you unlock your phone I think this is a no-brainer it's customization without you even needing to do the customization you can set a double tap of the power key on Samsung or a double tap at the back of the phone on the iPhone to open your favorite app okay if you don't feel Pro already then I think you will after these Voice Assistant tricks if your hands are occupied you can ask for a system to open whatever app you want to you can ask it to tell me some good news for when you're fed up of well Twitter you guys get to play whatever song you want while you're driving which is pretty handy since it's one of the only times that you can't touch your phone if you're tired or you're trying to reduce your screen time have your assistant read articles aloud for you by using the speak screen command in a way it's kind of like having a personalized radio station that talks about what you wanted to talk about kind of Google assistant and Siri can also both book you a table at a restaurant they can find devices for you and not just phones like Hey where's my iPad looking for boss man's iPad Air 4. it's me hanging your iPad Air for now I found my iPad oh yeah and assistance are perfect for shopping lists because you can add stuff to the list the second it occurs to you and then in one go when you reach the shops pull up everything that you've ever told it to remember on a similar note you can also just ask them to remember this for me for launch shopping things remember this for me what do you want to be reminded about Milo's birthday is coming up added when are you gonna ask it it's Marlo's birthday coming up not to mention that if you ever want to share whatever's on your screen with someone you can just tell it to share this with that person but there's more that we need to know before we can get to Master Level for example iOS control center has a quick node feature that lets you instantly compose a note without actually opening the notes app you can automatically block spam callers using iPhone silence unknown calls or Android's call ID and spam protection but for info that you do want but just happen to miss notification history is how you can catch up with all your recent notifications which for me is two instead of copy and pasting links or files between apps you can actually just drag them swipe to flick between the apps and then drop them enable floating keyboard on gboard to have just a more comfortable and accessible typing experience anywhere on screen tap on a unit of measurement to automatically convert it it works on every app on iPhone and most apps on Android if you hold down on the tabs button on your browser this is the fastest way to either close tabs or open up a private browsing window and this is super Niche improve the audio of your phone by adapting the volume based on your age and you can also increase the media volume limit if you want to go louder it's set at 50 by default so your phone can actually go quite a bit louder than you might assume if you're having a particularly bad day then on an iPhone you can get three fingers involved and with one swipe close three separate apps add the Shazam music recognition toggle into your quick settings so that the second you hear a song that you're like I need that in my playlist you can actually capture it but something that all smartphone users need to take advantage of tricks to save your battery like automatically activating power saving mode when your battery hits a certain percentage using your routines or shortcuts app I've set mine decide every time my phone hits 20 or when you arrive or leave a specific location so for example when I'm at home and I've got charges all around me I can happily use the phone on full power and then the second I leave my phone will switch to just making sure that it lasts by switching itself automatically to low power mode alternatively you can just specifically limit the most power hungry Futures like for example by switching off your smart assistant's active listening now if you like me listen to the exact same Spotify playlist every single time you can save battery by downloading it once and then you don't need to stream it ever again just switching to dark mode alone can actually reduce your battery usage by up to 20 percent and the higher you tend to keep your brightness at the more you'll end up saving versus light mode if you need to hear what's being said in any video but at the same time you're in a library and you need to be quiet you can activate live captions and it works over any app and it actually works particularly well on our videos and if you're on iOS another really handy accessibility option a baked in white noise machine it doesn't require internet you can use it on airplane mode and it lets you fall asleep to all sorts of background noises like rainfall or ocean waves you can set your incoming call background to a video on Samsung devices okay everyone wants shortcuts and Android actually has a whole bunch baked in that they just don't even tell you about so normally if you want to bring down your entire Quick Settings menu you've got to do it in two separate swipes but if you do the same gesture with two fingers instead of one it brings the whole thing down in one go or how you can slide the three dot menu button down on most Google apps to the desired option instead of tapping it then tapping the option that you want Apple's got some time savers of their own though one that gives them a real leg up is that iOS actually lets you display the password for the Wi-Fi network that you're currently connected to by just verifying with face ID since you already have access to it you can tap a link in safari with two fingers at the same time to open it in a new tab also instead of interrupting your workflow every single time you get a notification you can use ios's notification summary feature to only show you the important ones for now and save the unimportant ones for a scheduled time later and now the last few before we Ascend to Tech Mastery like how you can hold down on any app icon on your home screen for a list of time saving quick options I actually really enjoy seeing which shortcuts developers are programmed into which apps we're so cool so cool indeed we have fun if you want to be able to properly switch off every now and again you can set your Galaxy or your pixel phone to instantly Go and Do Not Disturb as soon as you place them face down and if you want to go full on with Focus mode create a routine that automatically activates it when you arrive at your workplace you can even tie your arrival into other apps like for example what my team does is make their phones launch straight into Google Docs when they get here oh and if you're specifically using iPhone's Focus modes as of iOS 16 you can actually set specific lock screens for different Focus modes and they'll automatically change as you switch between them another thing that you might have missed from IOS 16 is that Nintendo switch joy-con and pro controllers are also now compatible and you might also have missed this one you'll be kicking yourself but you can now take photos while shooting videos okay this one's really important it's always worth setting up an emergency contact phones are now designed so that if something happens to you a bystander can call that number without needing your password to unlock your phone like for me I'm severely allergic to nuts so if I ever had a reaction then someone could use this to call someone to get me an EpiPen for example and if you ever find a lost iPhone you can just ask Siri whose phone is this you can use your phone as a digital car key with certain Vehicles via Google and apple wallet and the benefit to that is that you can then remotely share that car key to any one of your contacts dial this code to access your phone's diagnostic test screen where you can test that your phone's features like the display and the speakers are actually working correctly if you send them on a flight number in iOS messages you can directly with one tab keep track of the flight so it's oftentimes quite useful just to send that flight number to yourself if you accidentally dunk your phone in misleading amount of water in there all you have to do is to go to fixmyspeakers.com and it'll clear them now if you have something untoward on your cellular device that you don't want your friends or your family to experience use a screen pinning when you hand it over so they can't leave the app that they're currently in okay enough playing around it's time for the master tier these magnetic multi-head charges allow you to have every smartphone connector available on a single wire so it doesn't actually matter what device your friends are using you can always be the provider of charge use the notified Buddy app to give your phone a makeshift notification LED by lighting up a small group of pixels with whatever color that you want to represent each one of your apps you can set custom messages to send automatically when you decline a call I had a bit too much fun with this one now most people probably know that they can automate things on their phone using routines or shortcuts but real Tech masters use the If This Then That app or IFTTT here's some of my go-to automations on it it can send a text to someone as you're approaching their house to say I'm 10 minutes away it can turn your lights on automatically as you step through your door add songs that you're liking on YouTube automatically into your playlist on Spotify mute your phone the minute you arrive at whatever you set as your workplace it can even log how long you spend in a specific location on a spreadsheet for example let's say you go to work and you want to count your work hours or if you want to keep track of how long you're in the gym for the second your phone connects to a Bluetooth device automatically plays a specific playlist immediately wow but we can get better if you add a Japanese keyboard onto your iPhone you will also have access to a whole new menu of instant emoticons which you can now paste to your heart's content in your private notes which you can now lock away from your Android buddies behind face ID you might have seen my video where I tested them as viral Tick-Tock Tech hats which was really fun by the way you could check it out but one that really surprised me was that you can actually your iPhone using your voice with a loophole in the accessibility settings and speaking of both of those things you can use your phone's accessibility voice command feature to map next to scroll tick tocks or if you're a person of culture YouTube shorts FaceTime can fake eye contact for you since most people naturally look at the screen and not the camera if you tap the power button five times quickly your iPhone will Disable face ID so if someone's trying to hold your eyes open and force you to unlock it they can't anymore you can do calculations in the spotlight search without needing to open up the calculator app oh and speaking of when you are using the calculator you can swipe from right to left over the numbers to just delete a digit so you don't have to hit clear and lose the entire thing Apple music has a karaoke function and it's actually crazy it gives you the lyrics of any song and then allows you to dial up and down the volume of the vocals only so that you can have as much or as little backup as you need well that was a lot of Apple ones but Samsung also has quite a few Master tier tips up its sleeve too with the Galaxy exclusive good lock apps which offer the kind of massive customization that you just can't get on an iPhone like the one-handed operation Plus app which massively expands the gesture controls you've got routines plus which gives you even more if then options in Bixby routines allowing you to do wacky stuff like immediately opening a specific website if you unlock a phone with your fingerprint and then there's registrar which basically gives you the iPhone's backtab feature why are they not advertising this okay moving on chalk is an incredibly useful app because it allows you to help your more technically challenged relatives through a fix by letting you host a video call where you can both draw chalk within augmented reality so for example you can Circle this wire goes here that wire goes there when you're taking a panorama photo you can create a human paper chain by having your subject typos and sidestep every time you take on one of the shots is that a master tip of course it is Bixby Vision basically Samsung's own version of Google lens has a feature that reads a wine label and tells you exactly what shoe to pair it with which is so Advanced but just very strange it's one of the four main options of translate text discover wine iPhone 14s actually have a hidden Easter egg you can set it to play a wake up or shut down jingle just like the Mac and did you know you can actually get the iPhone 14 Pro's Dynamic Island on Android using the dynamic Bird app why is it called the dynamic Bird app but the most Master trick on this entire list has got to be microgesture let's say your thumb is preoccupied this app allows you to control your entire phone using as the name suggests micro gestures I've got one final life hack boat to basically upgrade your entire life long story short humans today have the worst quality sleep that we've had throughout the entire history of humanity and you know this is something I personally relate to because I have been battling sleep my entire life and so about a year ago I decided to get myself the eight sleep pod cover which fits over your mattress like a fitted sheet and connects to this Hub and this Hub pumps warm or cool water through the cover to basically regulate your temperature as you sleep so it means you can fall asleep faster you can have more restful sleep and you can wake up feeling more refreshed plus I have learned so much about the way I sleep with this app it tells you what's good about your sleep what's bad about your sleep and then what you can do better but it's not just that here in the UK a couple of weeks ago we had a massive Heat Wave everyone in the house was like oh my God I need to buy three fans and point them all at me as I sleep I literally pulled out my app set my temperature lower and I completely forgot and it caters to everyone you want to set this thing to -10 or plus 10 degrees you can do that if you're interested then I would say there's very few better things you can invest in than your sleep so if you hit the link in the description I've got us a special discount code of 200 off if you use the code boss
