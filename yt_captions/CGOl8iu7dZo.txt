hello everyone and welcome i am on the media drive for the ford shelby gt500 so this is going to be mostly a technical discussion about this car as last night when they flew us in i had discussions with chief engineer for mustang chief engineer for gt500 and a uh aero and cooling systems engineer so i had a lot of technical discussions about this and that's kind of what i want to dive into and then later on we'll start to get into more of the driving impressions and i'm also going to be driving on the track a little bit later today so starting things off with the engine 5.2 liter supercharged engine has the same bore and stroke as the shelby gt 350 why does it have the same board and stroke well it's the same block and so they have made upgrades for it a few additional improvements due to the fact that this is producing 760 horsepower uh rather than the 500 some that you're getting in the gt350 so the block has been improved and that has then been transferred to the 350 for the 2020 model year perhaps the 2019 model year as well so power 760 at 7 300 rpm you have a red line of 7 500 rpm so you're getting that full power all the way to the end which is great i love it when engines do that instead of just kind of peter out uh and peak torque is coming on 625 pound-feet at 5000 rpm so somewhat up there but this is supercharged so you're gonna have a nice useful torque band across this engine now again this is supercharged so it's a 2.65 liter supercharger sitting on top of the engine it's inverted so that the scrolls it's a root style supercharger are towards the bottom to help keep that uh center of gravity lower so it pulls the air up through those scrolls where then passes through the intercooler and then comes back down into the engine uh of course you know cooling it through that intercooler before it's passed into the engine to help make better power so you've got six heat exchangers up front including for the intercooler they have an additional radiator for the engine so it has the same radiator actually from the gt350 however they have an additional engine radiator on the passenger side to help obviously 760 horsepower is going to create quite a bit more heat so how are they dissipating more heat well the front opening is twice as big as it is on the gt350 which they claim allows for 50 more airflow through it now one of the interesting uh little stats that they gave us on this cooling system is that it can dissipate 230 kilowatts of energy and so they said this is the equivalent of heating 12 homes now when you hear that as as you know just some random pedestrian i guess perhaps it gets you excited you think wow that's a crazy good cooling system but it also reminds you if you're kind of in the engineering background that that is how insanely inefficient combustion engines are and so it has enough waste heat uh to heat up 12 homes while this thing is chugging along so it's a it's a massively powerful engine and with a massively powerful engine you produce a ton of excess heat but they are maintaining that well with the front fascia making sure plenty of air flow gets through it and i was speaking with the cooling engineer he was saying somewhere in the 40 to 60 mile per hour range once you get above that it does not matter you're never going to get overheat you always have so much airflow going through the engine that power is not a concern waste heat is not a concern the thing will stay cool so good to know you can romp on this thing on the track and it's not going to derate you're going to be fine out there as far as the cooling system is concerned okay now moving on to the transmission and i have so much to say about this transmission and i have a lot to say about gearing and i think it's worth kind of creating a unique video just on gearing alone but i do want to have the discussion here so this is a 7 speed dual clutch transmission and let's get one thing clear right off the bat it's fantastic there is no delay between when i press this button and when it receives the command so the command delay the programming delay i can't notice it of course there is a bit of a time required for the shift so you press the button it immediately starts shifting that's what i like about it they say their shifts are as quick as 80 milliseconds which is very good and it is extremely quick um so i i don't have complaints on the gearbox aside from the fact that they are only offering a dual clutch transmission so this is a seven speed dual clutch transmission it's the only option on the g3 350 of course a six-speed manual transmission is the only option and i asked the question you know why only dual clutch on this why not allow people you know the choice of having the manual and they said this is the first time the gt500 and gt350 have been sold together in showrooms at the same time and and they kind of split past they're very different cars uh and so you know that's that's a lot of the reasoning i think behind it is they have a different approach for each vehicle now my complaint comes in with the gearing because this is a seven speed the shelby is a six-speed and the shelby the gearing isn't perfect but it's very very good you hit top speed and the gt350 at 180 miles per hour in fifth gear that's where fifth gear ends so you're at the end of the rev range in fifth gear then you have six gear for the highway in this you also hit top speed 180 miles per hour once again just like the 350 and that's also in fifth gear even though you still have two additional gears and it does not take all of 50 or to get there so fifth gear could have been more aggressive meaning you could have gotten to that top speed a little bit quicker so i wish they would have made 50 or more aggressive and what i honestly wish they would have done instead of having three overdrive gears fifth sixth and seventh are all less than a one to one ratio uh i wish that they would have had one through six be aggressive track gearing because that's what this car is it's a trek menace and then seventh would be your highway cruiser now they said for fuel economy reasons which i know no one's buying this car for fuel economy reasons but you know gas guzzler tags cafe standards that kind of thing for fuel economy reasons they claim that that's why they have that sixth and seventh which are both high overdrive gears meaning you get your rpm really low and so by getting that rpm really low they're giving you the option you know let's say you're on a road that's 55 to 65 you can keep it in that really efficient engine low rpm range let's say you get up to 80 miles per hour then it dips into seventh gear where you can get it once again significantly lower and keep it in that efficient range so the gearing strategy for the last three gears seems to be more about fuel economy than performance and that bums me out a little bit i do wish it was just always as aggressive as possible i'll say this to the end of time i love aggressive gearing this thing's you know in the 50 mile per hour range in first gear it's hitting 80 miles per hour in second gear 115 in third gear and you know at that point like you don't need the rest of the gears unless you're on a track so for street use the gearing is a little tall for track use it seems to fit this thing really well especially because you have so much power and so it's traction limited in those lower gears you don't need a more aggressive gear ratio because you couldn't put the power down anyways does it mean you wouldn't want it so you could slide around and have fun with it you know that's that's the case to be made i think to have those more aggressive options available and have it be a tighter one through six than a tight one through five or a more spread out one through five another interesting thing about this transmission that i forgot to mention so you have gears one three five and seven on one shaft you have gears reverse two four and six on another shaft and they're actually fairly different as far as the clutch packs so gear one has five plates and more surface area versus gears two four six in reverse which use six plates but less overall surface area so i'll show you a little cutaway but it's cool because you know obviously first gear is going to be your launch gear if you're going to the drag strip that's going to be the one that's going to be taking all the abuse and and so you've got a larger clutch pack there with more surface area that's able to handle it so it's a wet multi-plate clutch it's going to be able to run through these you know drag strip runs all day long which is cool to see the difference in the transmission strategy between the different gears and that gear one actually gets a beefier clutch pack to enable it to consistently put down you know those launches because i mean you're really you're going to slip that clutch a little bit on the drag race to allow it to load up that rear and then you're going to kind of clamp it shut and hold it and let it run down the line and so they they really do allow you know it from a design standpoint that that launch to occur with how they've designed the different clutch packs uh depending on what gear you are in moving back from the transmission to the rear differential we get a three seven three final drive ratio with a torsion limited slip differential this is the same thing you'll find in the shelby gt350 as far as the style and the gear ratio and so that is then sending power to those rear wheels of course 16.5 inch massive brake rotors up front these are steel uh they say versus the gt350 these have 25 more thermal uh heat absorption within them that they're capable of so you know this car does weigh more than the 350 this thing's a little bit under 4 200 pounds so about 400 pounds uh heavier than the gt350 and so if you do end up getting the carbon fiber track package you take out about 80 of those pounds but this thing's a heavy car and so i asked ford you know you know where's this weight coming from versus the 350 and they said two major spots they said the transmission the dual clutch transmission is about twice the weight as the manual transmission used in the 350 and then they said when you supercharge a car like this and you add significant amount of power you're just there's no way around it really you're going to add about 200 pounds in doing so so the engine is about 80 pounds heavier but then of course you have to upgrade the cooling system you have to upgrade the drive shafts the brakes larger wheels as a result of having those larger brakes so it's on 20-inch wheels and you know it's a multiplying effect you increase power you increase weight it's just what happens and so you know it's about 400 pounds heavier than that 350 and a lot of that comes from the the dual clutch transmission and the fact that you have to beef everything up to handle the additional power now mentioning those 20-inch wheels those are paired with michelin ps4s bespoke tires that they you know worked out with shelby uh for this vehicle so ps4s 315s in the rear 305 up front massive tires and then if you do get the track package the carbon fiber track package then those are going to be cup twos instead of ps4s interesting thing here the shelby gt350 now only comes with cup twos that's to differentiate it from the other mustangs yet this gt500 in base version is coming with ps4s now i was speaking with one of the engineers who's done a lot of the drag strip testing with this vehicle this thing is capable of hitting the quarter mile in 10.7 seconds uh so very quick on the drag strip and he said there's minimal difference between the ps4s and the cup twos he said on the gt350 when they were running the super sports it was about a point two second difference on the super sport versus the cup 2 and the quarter mile for the gt350 apparently with this gt500 it's very close uh with the ps4s tire versus the cup 2 even though the cup 2 does offer more grip on the track so in a straight line they said they've been able to tweak the tire uh so that it does very well on the you know on a drag strip now i i briefly touched on you know differences between this and the gt350 and it's a it's a conversation really worth having and i think uh you know what many of the journalists are going to say about this car is that you know the the 350 is the purest car and that the 500 is kind of the all-out track weapon and that's an accurate statement and to my surprise it's not something that ford denied so i was speaking with the chief engineer of gt500 and saying like you know look like there's a there's a lot of really cool things that you guys did with the gt350 the flat plane crankshaft it revs to 8250 naturally aspirated manual transmission nice aggressive gearing to fifth uh fifth gear you know and then you have that highway gear i love the gearing strategy there and so there's a lot of good driving purist things that they've done with the gt350 that they have changed with this gt500 and so when i was asking this engineer like you know what's what's your preference uh what what came out is like look if you're the driving purist the gt350 is the car for you and it's going to offer i feel like the more rewarding driving experience what's going to be faster on a track hands down the gt500 so they said they had three goals with this gt500 incredibly fast in a straight line so they wanted to do well on a drag strip hence the 10.7 quarter mile uh the second part was insanely fast on a track so this is faster around the track than the gt350 you know 250 horsepower doesn't uh doesn't hurt and then the third thing is they wanted it to be approachable and i think that's part of this automatic transmission strategy and also some of the gearing strategy with this automatic transmission but it is an approachable car in that you know you don't feel like you're on edge driving this thing even though you do have 760 horsepower it's a pretty refined thing when you're cruising around like we are right now and so it's insanely quick out there but it's also meant to be this very livable machine uh that doesn't compromise in the name of performance so it's it's it does the performance insanely well it does the other aspects really well versus that gt350 which is more shifting its side towards let's make this driving experience as fun as it can be the numbers aren't as important just make it enjoyable and so there is a split there between the two and i respect ford for admitting that and saying you know the 350 is the purest car because i haven't driven this yet on the track but but my initial impressions you know the kind of smile that the 350 sparks uh i get in this when i'm flooring it in a straight line but i don't necessarily get it you know going around the corners i don't get to ship my own gears uh the gearing strategy is a bit different and and i really love the 350 for what it is the exhaust note in this thing is still absolutely phenomenal and there's different options here in different modes that you can switch between so as far as the noise the noise is very good one little thing that's interesting is you don't hear the supercharger and so you know in the hellcat you know 717 horsepower in those mint throttle areas and and mid rpm areas you hear a ton of supercharger wine and i think it's really cool it's completely subdued here you don't hear any supercharger noise every now and then a little whistle from it but rare to hear and so really you just hear the exhaust and the exhaust sounds phenomenal so that's the good news the bad news is i wish they had a little bit more supercharger noise to it now speaking of the different driving modes uh there's a lot of cool tweaks they've done here and so as far as the shifting strategy track mode actually has the smoothest shifts while sport mode has the fastest shift so they wanted track mode to ensure that when it was shifting gears it's not going to upset the car in any way let's say you're mid corner and you're shifting gears it's not going to upset the balance versus sport mode is all about getting that as fast as possible and so there's little different strategies also with the drag mode what they do is they don't have it drop the rpm when you up shift and so it kind of slams into that next gear it's like power shifting and a manual transmission almost to give you the best acceleration when you're going down the drag strip so they actually do have useful meaningful changes between the different modes and different strategies track mode's about keeping the car balanced and getting the fastest time around that track and then drag mode is about getting the fastest time in straight line they actually change the suspension tuning for the rear suspension so when you're in drag mode the magneride will adjust and allow to squat a little bit more right off the line get some load transfer onto those rears and then once you have that load transfer occur boom you're off so i'm going to be on the drag strip later today and i'm going to put a v box on the car and i'll see what times i actually get and so i'll include that kind of information displayed here and also going to be driving on the track later today and i will include you know my thoughts about that as well now i've mentioned the packages that this car has so there's a handling package and there is a track uh carbon fiber package and i'll include a list of what these things include but there was one thing that stuck out to me on both of these both the handling and the track package they give you an oil catch can and to be honest i don't know of any cars out there especially modern cars that offer an oil catch can from the factory i thought that was very strange uh and i'd love it if you guys do know of one's out there now like let me know in the comments i i wouldn't be curious to know what they are but i haven't heard of this in in a non-after-market use and so i thought well wait a minute is it direct injection why are they doing this no the engine is port injection and so you know you're not really need to worry about you know carbon fouling on your intake valve so okay well why did they do this why did they put a oil catch can with the track package and not with the base car well apparently in extremely high g cornering so 1g cornering which this is capable of you know with the cup twos out on the track apparently there are ways which that oil can slosh up from the oil pan hit the pcv and then go into your intake and so rather than having blue smoke dump out the exhaust and cause concern for the driver for that track package in the handling package to have this oil catch can uh so in those high g scenarios if any oil is to slosh up that oil catch can will receive it now the very important question what is this thing like to drive and so we're going to work through the different systems here starting with the throttle pedal now i'm rarely disappointed by naturally aspirated or you know supercharged engines especially when they happen to be large v8s and that is the case with this vehicle so a great response from the throttle pedal and a nice direct feel to it you know you can actually use modulation and get very different amounts of power depending on where you are uh within that throttle pedal range so fantastic response from it you can see it really lifts up the front end there and yeah the throttle pedal is exceptional i really love the way that it feels and we're just driving here in sport mode i also really like the way the brake pedal feels so it's immediate once you start touching that brake pedal you immediately start to brake so it has a nice feel to it not a ton of travel and a good amount of pressure required in order to slow it down i feel like it's going to be really nice out on the track but a nice you know a response from it it's intuitive it's easy to figure out and it allows you to understand you know what's going on with the braking very well i really like both the throttle and the brake pedal feel as far as the transmission yes of course i would like to have a bit different strategy with the gearing and i feel like it actually could use more aggressive gearing this thing seems to be very approachable out here on the street which i'm surprised by you know it's not this 760 horsepower monster that you really can't deal with i mean you can put your foot down second and you contain it you can control this thing and it can put the power down so it's really impressive uh and the transmission shifting itself is quite good no delay between the computer response so when you're asking it hey shift there's a there's a good you know quality there of when do i ask for it and then when does it start reacting and usually especially on downshifts uh reacts very quickly to what you're asking for so i appreciate that about the transmission and as far as the shift quality i like this transmission the speed of it's good the shift quality is good so i'm happy there the gearing strategy i would slightly change so what are we left with well we're left with steering and i'm not super crazy about it i don't have anything really negative to say about it it's just it's a fairly light steering system and so of course there's different modes that you can choose between but overall you know it's a fairly high ratio 16 to one it is direct and that's you know the case that you get with these michelin tires they're very responsive tire so when you ask for something it does it immediately i like that about it it's just that it's a it's a low effort you know kind of somewhat numb feel to the steering itself so overall driving experience i'm actually impressed i came into this you know expecting it to be pretty good but i also came into this thinking i would love the gt350 so much more and i do like the gt350 more however i'm very pleasantly surprised at how much i really do enjoy this one they've done a great job it is an approachable vehicle it is an insanely powerful vehicle and it seems very well equipped to do all the things that it's trying to do which is a lot of different things and so later today i will be on the track with it and trying out the drag strip and i'll provide some impressions about what i thought that was like but overall i've been really impressed with this thing i do like the transmission the engine's phenomenal it could have a little bit of supercharger wine so biggest complaints just being gearing strategy with those three overdrive gears i feel like that's unnecessary i wish there was a little supercharger wine and steering is a little light uh for my taste uh for something you know this big this heavy this monstrous it's a track weapon perhaps a little bit more feel and a little bit more effort required i think could be cool so some quick comments about how this thing performed on the drag strip as well as on the track now ford claims a 0 to 60 of 3.3 seconds my best time was 3.50 seconds and keep in mind this is on a drag strip but also my time is from actual zero miles per hour not with a foot of roll out like the big auto magazines use so you'll likely see zero to 60 times in the 3.2 range from them for the quarter mile ford claims a time of 10.7 seconds and my best of the day was 11.2 seconds half a second off however there was a significant headwind about 20 miles per hour as is evident from the burnout footage you can see the smoke clears quite quickly we're also 2000 feet above sea level so i don't doubt that in perfect conditions the 10.7 is possible but i wouldn't expect to hit it your first time out on the drag strip it's also worth noting that auto journalist superstar jason kamisa came running over to me after i put down the best quarter mile time in our group yelling and asking how much i weigh none of your business jason just try to keep up would you great name by the way one thing worth noting is that there is a significant delay about one second after you release the brake pedal in launch control and when the car actually starts to launch for drag racing this makes the reaction time portion very difficult as you have to release the brake pedal long before you're given the green light this was my second time on a drag strip ever as is evident by my timid face on my very first run as well as my wow reaction the only other time was in a dodge demon and while the gt500 is a second slower on the drag strip it's still insanely fast and it'll embarrass the demon on a racetrack speaking of the track the gt500 feels right at home this was a very flat track we were driving on and yet the shelby was registering 1.3 lateral g's in the corners and up to 1.5 g's in braking the g-forces were strong enough that my neck was genuinely tired after lapping for 4 100 pound car and track package trim this thing can handle the power is constant and never ending the braking is exceptional and i didn't feel any fade i was impressed with the front end grip and also how easily it could put the power down now yes with sharp inputs from steering and throttle you'll find yourself power over steering but generally it's actually a very pleasant car to drive fast i'm not the best driver by any means and i didn't find it intimidating to drive relatively quickly that's not something i often feel about cars with 760 horsepower overall really impressed i love the way this thing looks uh the seating in it is really nice it holds me in quite snug these are the optional recaros they are completely mechanical no electronic adjustment there but they hold me very snug which i do like cloth seats alcantara steering wheel which some don't like because over time they kind of start to go away but i really like alcantara steering wheels the driving position is really good i love the way the front fascia looks on this car i think it looks so cool so overall not too many bad things to say about this this is a phenomenal phenomenal car that is not going to disappoint you when you get in it and i was honestly surprised because i thought the gap of how much i would like the 350 more than this would be larger than it is and i'm truly impressed by this vehicle so thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
