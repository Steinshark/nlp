okay here we go senior rust Dev well as Harrison Ford once said if we would have asked the people what they wanted they would have asked for a faster C plus plus what made me learn [Applause] I cannot believe how good that joke was right right out of the gates that might have been the funniest joke I have heard in an exceptionally long time this man's a comedic genius they have Harrison Ford even getting in on this rust I wanted to write uh uh an operating system in three weeks I first wanted to write my own systems programming language but I thought that's the complicated for people and then I discovered rust and now I just don't mind that it's too complicated for people people say [Laughter] oh this is this is actually really good who's the right tool for the job in the Ross Community we say choose the right job for the tool I'm a regular contributor to 14 projects I actually got the original when I see a C plus plus dab what I see is a futuristic macro yep expansion bounded polymorphism web assembly the problem with mediocrity I let my threads Panic for pleasure those of you coming what does that even mean I don't even know I don't even know what that means why are you letting your threads Panic for pleasure from functional programming languages we'll be pleased those of you coming from oop languages will also be pleased in interpreted languages you need a lot of imagination my magic of self-worth is bound to prevented cves and pony awards did you know that according to Microsoft 70 of all CVS are due to memory leakage in C plus plus you need to worry about memory because of memory errors in Java you need to worry about memory because of the garbage collector in Rust you don't need to worry about memory because you need to worry about borrowing which is the New Concept that in Haskell everything is just cloned I mean what do we have infinite resources in JavaScript this is actually a really funny point because you can still memory leak and rust right it's still it's still possible to do a lot of that you know you can still shoot yourself with the foot but it's very very funny that it's just like yeah we don't worry about memory anymore we worry about borrowing It's A New Concept don't worry don't worry about memory anymore if you need to worry about memory because you need to worry about JavaScript in the C macros were a pain we solved that in Rust now nested macros are a pain I mean there is no such thing as a perfect programming language rust is merely a statically type low level multi-paradigm perfect programming language there's no such thing as a perfect programming language the man clearly hasn't seen dream bird we all know dream bird is the perfect programming language okay it is it is the perfect programming language Fiasco with Tokyo memory safety with locking is you know those I'll go coding tools where you learn the language through Play and games so here we actually teach to learn rust through games although you're not going to play very much if you don't have strong fundamentals in Rust and which part did you write in Rust the front end or the back end no the browser not everyone learns Russ in a lifetime I actually wrote a custom new version of the rust compiler it's a little stricter with arrow handling essentially you're being tasered when you make an error how else you're going to learn low level programming I'm currently rewriting that actually is effectively if you watch Michael Reeves he made a video about being shot by an airsoft gun every time he took damage in fortnite this is effectively that that is literally effectively a Michael Reeves video the color blue to us the main problem rust has and solves by itself is the borrowed Checker references to an object but if you paralyze you need to paralyze manually and that means well in other languages you don't even have parallelization so rust is so good what you don't even have it it's not even a thing yeah you see tracking font llvm's own bugs the disadvantages rust things you can't keep object lifetimes in your head and there is no reward when dealing with large Library dependency graphs is rust good for game development rust is good for everything there are currently five games written in Rust and 50 game engines race conditions are fundamentally you know 2024 is the year of rust I can feel it I can feel it the year of rust is 2024 and you know they're going to be prepared because we're going to get dozens of games for those 50. game engines unsolvable you can't fix what's broke on the OS level unless you're using an OS written in Rust of course again I'm not here to tell you that rust is the best language you should have figured by now the best JS bundler is written in Rust turbo pack 20 times faster than any bundler written in JS that's some undercover marketing right there you can't trust humans but you can always trust the cult at the compiler another superpower of rust testing and rust is cheaper because we're all Geniuses in Rust you need to see the compiler as your friend that helps you with your stupidity map error exists but it's method trade belts were not satisfied [Music] oh my goodness that is my most hated heir of all of them are those damn missing trait air especially when the compiler is just like I don't know I I don't know I don't know you this it's not there you need to do something different whatever you're doing it needs to be different than what you're currently doing oh man or when you know that a method does exist you just don't know the name of the method so therefore you can't even get the compiler to be like by the way you should import this library right you do every single time it's always the same thing it always comes down to using a websocket with Tokyo tungstenite or something like that and then it's like is it read is it next or is it receive right I don't know which one it is and I have to do this thing where I like play it it errors does it air but with also like a hey you actually need this thing and you know do I have the rights you know like it's every single time big list rust requires many horrible programming patterns from other horrible languages Ross will finally unite C and C plus plot encoders from all other programming languages I actually have a macro for the unsafe command it's called trust me welcome to memory management in Ross we compiled the entire company at runtime but of course the normal kernel dab will come across more difficult challenges so this is the the Normie Colonel Dev welcome to rust of memory management just holds up a box just a list of boxes oh my goodness concept that you haven't heard before us in fact actually no one has we have crates trades lifetimes no States is this a joke yeah so these are called trades so it's like no yeah we don't mention Javan here uh rust is imagine you would throw all advantages from all languages together now your code is unreadable but it's memory safe option not maybe in rest this isn't hasker but it could be with a few tweaks memory leakage is considered safe not calling instructors is considered safe because memory leakage is considered safe even if it leaks it never gets referenced again so there's not going to be any crash the program does crash but if the memory fills up you can catch that in some cases well mem forget was introduced to tell the compiler anyways and rust all libraries are archived this isn't JavaScript but we have left pet incidents breaking changes are only introduced in Rust positions we have rust 2015 2018 2021 Edition and this is actually rust 2023 signature edition it's actually signed by Graydon himself well the Fiasco with Tokyo is so a giant handle from a task you spawn can get out of scope now there are two schools of thought some think the task should be aborted the others don't really think at all I will say it Russ is yes yes that was so good right there that was so good oh my goodness yes I was holding my breath okay the joke just kept going and I kept loving the joke I do agree when you lose reference to the handle there is only one then all things top of the hill King of the cast head of the competition for all things C or ASM rust is good yeah for functional programming in Tasker and rust rust is King of the cast yeah they don't want unsafe in my trade just stuff it all into macros the C plus plus cult is bigger but not as organized as ours in Rust Development A lot changes usually when you find a bug you fix it when rust users find a bug they complain about it and get up issues for two years before the project owner steps down webassembly what was the question I believe that was an actress reference that was that was really great that was beautiful in other programming languages the documentation ends with the cookie clicker in Rust it ends with a multi-threaded high performance fully functional web server yeah there are a lot of jobs for us most are for startups to do some blockchain stuff and then go bankrupt in a year I enjoyed a couple of startups like that in the past months all those startups wanting to become unicorns I'm not crazy about that we got this as new merch from our company that's the future of programming Hugo Zula no Dino Wireshark sniff net Bitcoin Solana dough go script gnu Haskell okay you can use Haskell I mean I would like to publish my idea I do love that the Haskell Crossover with the rust folks are just is very high it's like the one you you hear this all the time where it's just like they just  on everything but until Haskell hits then they're like well I mean I'm I I get why you'd want to use Haskell you know I totally get that and a is a crate but crates IO has a 10 megabyte Limit Oh I use ice so ice is the best one it's the most complete one it is very easy to rewrite everything in Rust because to get karma points on Reddit by the way this code actually also runs a lot in a wrapper that I wrote in Rust yeah rust is an interesting mixer C plus plus o camel Haskell Yota JavaScript JavaScript DOTA you guys you can't be upset about JavaScript when you got DOTA floating around in the background DotA dude has pretty eyes not gonna lie I meant list lisp the timer for the coffee no I just finished compiling map error exists but it's methods yes oh my goodness oh the dangerous the same air twice and it just was compiling for the last five minutes for a hybrids approach allowing for productive kernel incrementalism instead of whole project rewrite we'll still do the whole project rewrite I'm actually rewriting Windows to rest this will give it some credit there will never be a rust version 2.0 because the language is perfect technically it means because the syntax is adaptable but the other phrase sounds better took 15 years for case statements to arrive in Python think about it you don't adapt the program to the language in Rust you adapt the language to the program we decided to introduce the heat keyword after a well-managed well-mannered discussion which will make everyone equally unhappy rust is very simple let's make everyone unhappy just that that little tiny Nuance of having to like return error wrapping the thing you know like there's just there's like there's this thing that has to happen that's just so annoying so to learn I'm actually writing an introduction to the language right now it is mainly aimed at readers already familiar with Haskell or o camo yeah nobody knows we're all looking to learn rust come back after you learn Haskell nor me we didn't say it's a programming language for everybody just for the elite but everyone is welcome that is ready to join the cult community community reliability speed productivity pick four why rust it has three main benefits rust versus Java well that's an easy one Pokemon go we have Pokemon rust yes we did and you don't even catch Pokemon just random runtime exceptions we really hate repetitions and rust into into into inner unwrap unwrap unwrap we don't like unreadable coach and rust option RC ref cell there are different types of macros I don't need to go over them right so let's [Music] let's learn another meta programming language called pattern matching I love is that your repo let's start by setting up cargo everyone cares about random Jewels written in Rust everybody cares look at all the startups hiring although it's mostly startups doing blockchain stuff that will go bankrupt in a year I joined a couple of those my job my hobby Ross my ideology Russ my profile pic right yeah it's not a cult oh no my identity rest my profile pic read we're now actually rewriting politics uh to rust I think rust is here to stay forever no more JavaScript typescript coffeescript mocha script variations rust is the end actually we don't use rust we use glue on yeah I'm actually currently writing a bio about my programming Journey it starts with so let's see how we can rewrite your code to rest good jokes in there I swear this has to be his best video this was incredible well done rust guy the name is not this is this following statement's not supported by the rust Foundation rustagin
