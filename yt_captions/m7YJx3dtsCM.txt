ladies and gentlemen welcome back to Tata steel 2023 it's our first Elite chess tournament of the calendar year and throughout this event we've had the same thing that we've been paying attention to over and over again will Magnus Carlson stop the slump he lost two games in a row for the first time in eight years and that's really all he needed it was like an anime moment where the protagonist goes down and it looks like it's all over but good god what have we started this is the round 10 recap of 13 the tournament is nearly at its conclusion and uh as always today I've got a handful of games I will start with the Magnus game uh because you know uh sometimes I put at the end sometimes at the beginning uh but uh yeah I'm gonna give you what you want but I have kept up a theme during these Recaps and the Recaps have all had spectacular games today's games were epic all right um so Magnus is playing with the black pieces against Parham maxulu uh very strong uh Grandmaster from Iran the highest rated chess player in Iran Magnus plays a queen's game decline but it is very rare to play D4 D5 nowadays and the reason for that is that mostly Grandmasters use this move order so that they can go in Knight C3 and then play a nimso Indian instead because normally against D5 in this position there is Pawn takes and this like is called The Exchange variation of the Queen's Gambit declined uh and it's considered to maybe be slightly better for a white tiny tiny tiny bit oh now Magnus wanted that um it's it's not that Parham fell into a trap but rather Magnus is going to surprise Parham and Magnus is at his best when he plays these really obscure lines so Magnus develops his bishop and generally gameplay here goes C6 and castle and Knight bd7 yeah Magnus throws in the move H6 which on its own isn't some groundbreaking concept the bishop slides back and now once again play usually develops via Castle C6 and so on now there have literally been millions of games played in this position at the Master Level it's something like hundreds of thousands okay and as I said play is this and this that is just what black does all right there's not really a whole lot else black can do because black can't really go here the bishop needs to protect two different spots well Magnus plays a move that has been played in less than 0.000 like the last time this was played was like eight years ten years ago in like a correspondence game which is the master level of basically your daily chess games on chess.com um he plays Bishop G4 that's a weird move it's a weird move because it attacks the queen but it destabilizes the queen side so you would think White's best move is just to play the very natural Queen to B3 which would Target this and this and you would threaten Bishop F6 and this but apparently if black just plays Knight bd7 white actually has no real threat because Rook B8 and Rook B2 and position is actually far more dangerous for white so Queen B3 is not going to cut it uh Parham could of course play very solidly with Bishop E2 just trading Bishops Parham also can consider F3 which very much is a move by the way because in a lot of these positions white wants to put a bishop here a knight here and play E4 but probably Parham did not play F3 because he's like well Magnus probably prepared F3 so Parham definitely wanted to avoid magnus's prep so he gave him this check which is most certainly a move and the point is to get the queen out of danger Force black into blocking the check and now just basically develop and argue that this is sort of pointless okay and then Barham was like really Magnus I have no idea what you're doing with your Bishop I mean now you have to go back this way because you can't do this I mean if you do that you're never going to make it to that square because I'm just going to go back and take and I'm gonna go G4 so Parham plays H3 and he's like all right well Magnus has to retreat his Bishop on that diagonal because going to Bishop H5 is stupid so much some extremely peculiar when should be H5 now normally play that move because you can go there and you will take with that pawn but that Pawn's not so Parham goes Queen C2 and now if Magnus makes one more slow move I mean G4 comes and perhaps just gonna win a pawn so what does Magnus do C5 oh boy he is sacrificing a pawn straight up why is this upon sacrifice because if you play Pawn take C5 and black response Bishop takes C5 Magnus uh loses he just loses Queen F6 Knight D5 and if Pawn takes his King side as horrible G4 is coming the game is over uh Bishop G6 and then and then takes the bishop so C5 is a is straight up like he's just giving Parham the pawn now Parham could take and magnus's idea was to sacrifice the pawn for something aggressive but we have G4 now we have takes takes and then you notice Braham didn't take the bishop he didn't want his Knight taken and this and queen takes G6 and this this is craziness I mean Magnus is just straight up down upon but he's got the game under control he plays Knight takes G4 now the rook and the Knight both hit F2 these two pieces stare down this way it's a very complex position Queen E6 check HG Bishop H4 Knight F3 attacks the bishop on H4 this is under Fire rookie seven would win a queen if it wasn't illegal uh and now we have this and Knight takes D5 and Parham Max Hulu is just straight up up a pawn against Magnus Carls up a pawn no questions well some questions like the fact that black has a lot of activity rookie a check and now a very nice move by Magnus uh jumping directly into the white position and basically just asking like where are you going you know like like what are you gonna do here I got I got my Rook here in the center of the board and Parham tries to shove his Pawn out of the way but now the Knight comes to B4 and it really just feels like Magnus is just running circles around the white pieces just incredible control here the Knight comes in check can't take because I'm pinned but I'm trying to run away takes Rook G4 one Pawn has been captured back and Parham just goes all in giving up the pawn on B2 also from one Pawn up is now one Pawn down now if barham's epon could jump here he would be winning for instance this is a winning position for white join pawns they're gonna push but the second you go to E4 of course I'm gonna take so that blockade is so important for black and Magnus just continues with Rook before Rook D1 now Magnus brings his King and now the black king has arrived and the bishop dominates the Knight I mean the Knight just has no access forward it also has no access backward because it can't cross the fourth rank this Knight is neutered 92 Rook A4 and now Magnus plays Rook A3 because that Pawn's not actually defended and Master Class here as the game goes to a rook end game with Magnus up two pawns uh this is resignable here but Parham actually just played it on uh he played it on for a while then Magnus starts sending his beep on it's a completely winning end game because the Rook does what's called cutting off the king all right Rook H6 white can never get close Parham goes for this and we have an exchange of Pawns but this is a very well-known winning end game because the king is on the long side of the pawn short side defense is where you would have needed to defend which essentially is here but because the king is completely cut off on the long side of the board uh black just brings the king all the way down he will get the king over here push the pawn and then he will escape by building the bridge as they call it so in this position Parham resigned because uh the king is now forced out if it goes there then King C1 and this is a very very famous uh building the bridge concept where you're King and Rook build the bridge for the king's Escape King C2 check King B3 check King C3 check King before check and Rook B5 your king dances out onto the bridge and Rook B5 blocks build the bridge and Magnus has won three out of his last four games he is now one point away from first this man was like third from bottom and uh that's what happens you wake up the goat you better not you know you better not miss uh this next game I have for you I'm gonna call this The Hunger Games all right we're gonna go through this game quickly everybody dies in this game all right so whoop I when I use the forward button sometimes it jumps games instead of pieces all right this game by from the Challenger section by Amin Tabata Bay and Thomas beardson Was a Very peculiar slob there's the first trade Knights pawns all right we're gonna go a little bit longer here's another trade Knight for Bishop now Queen A4 King D7 Black's King playing defense but the position is still reasonable Bishop A5 look at these laser beaming Bishops but still black is actually okay um now Bishop for night now Rooks all right now Bishops 20 moves into this game it looks like two 700s who just have a fetish for exchanges you know what I'm talking about you guys you some of you just boot up chess games literally to hear the clicking noise I mean it's much more it's much less it's much more boring to hear that move than the crunching chess.com sound of a peace capture you know so it takes before and you know throughout this game it was I mean Tabata by putting the pressure on black but here instead of just sitting there and and just having his Queen and Rook on beardson says no man Queen trade that is a massive decision why because when you simplify down to Queens and then to Pawns I mean with this many Pawns you best be sure that you're going to not lose okay now in a king and pawn end game two things matter obviously material but that's like obvious four pawns will beat one in equal material King and pawn end games the activity of the king and how effective your pawns can be and in this case the white king is gonna go there and try to break through because otherwise it's just a draw um so beardson did not have to do that and also white did not have to trade like Amin could have played Rook C5 and you know try to get this end game and you know this is just annoying for black but probably losing uh but maybe not and in the game what happened was they all traded and you know that's exactly what Amin did and here uh Thomas beardson made a it's probably not even Thomas right because he's Dutch so it's probably like tomorrow or something Dutch folks you all got wild names so essentially here what black had to do was just chill like literally but by the way don't tell people to just chill in the middle of an argument don't do that but in a chess game you can just chill like just wait the guy's gonna come forward just chill guy's gonna come forward like just chill the guy's gonna come forward you gotta take it like you maybe you're losing like 25 000 moves into the future but I don't know but he he plays F6 and when you make a pawn move like this you are drastically weakening the position potentially now H5 and now when you take yes your king gets back but more often than not when you are this passive in a king and pawn end game You're Gonna Lose so beardsson had to not take and the craziest thing is if you went here white still gets through you know how Pawn sack brutal take and now the white king walks in like the white King still infiltrates because he's so active and there's no way in for black on the other side of the board so uh yeah uh Amin gets in pushes his pawn and I mean black just runs out of moves in this game it's actually kind of nuts they get down to Five Pawns each I told you this game is like The Hunger Games look at this King H7 G6 black is hanging on for dear life and white plays B3 one final pawn move the only pawn move White had because if white goes here takes its White's only remaining move that doesn't lose the game because you either move your king or your pawn and lose the only move that doesn't lose the game the only legal move you have that doesn't lose the game B3 and black resigns because black now has no moves if you take I will take that if you move your king I will take this this is called zuk Swang and uh beardson resigned crazy I told you it's like the Hunger Games this game I mean what a game and instructive you know and a definitely an instructive end game so don't just rush to trade everything I mean things can happen really really late now this next game is a totally different type of hunger game and the game I'm gonna have after this is just complete pandemoniums to to uh two teenagers having a fist fight in the playing Hall literally that's what happened yeah they got up and started punching each other so uh velimir ivich is having a fantastic tournament uh soupy is having a good an okay tournament before this game um but he's missed a few chances he even said that in his interview uh I mean even just crushing I mean he has like three wins and the rest of the games are draws and this game begins with uh a night orph a very very sharp night off and soupy plays H5 which prevents white from playing G4 and then plays Knight bd7 um and Knight b87 is a relatively new move it's what he said and then he transfers his Knight over here and white completely clamps down on the queen side like not letting black move then white does what you're supposed to do in the night Earth which is to jump a knight into the center of the board on D5 and then play C4 and I mean visually from the opening it looked like a totally desperate position for black okay and by the way for the uh Portuguese speaking audience I know I know your mans locomotiva I know I know from the opening it looked like Black's position was extremely desperate I mean it just looked like black was trying but nothing was working I mean white has a dominant positional advantage and if he just moves the Knight and gets the pawns going it's over like Black's just gonna lose because black cannot break through there's nothing here he's trying right okay Bishop D4 from evich now Bishop F1 back we have a trade and the Knight comes back and he just plays Rook A3 total dominance of the third rank B4 is coming and what is super gonna do here like what okay he just moves his Rook right but that's the thing about Chess like you don't just get a good position and the game is over you actually need to win so Sufi plays Queen G4 now white offers a queen trade super is like no Queen trade white plays Knight back to C2 reroutes the Knight to E3 a few moves later I mean he's just like slowly improving his position looking for an opportunity to come in Rook D1 and I mean a lot of shuffling occurs here a lot of shuffling all right now we've made move 40. so the players have made their 40th move and here's C5 finally at move 40 they get extra Rook C3 they get extra time Rook C1 I mean white is just on the verge but soupy is defending very well I mean he's sitting there going my position is bad how are you gonna you know how are you gonna beat me Rook B8 all right now in this position White had a winning idea which is really disgusting his winning idea was to play G4 so oftentimes positions fall apart when they are overwhelmed in this case black is overwhelmed on the queen side kind of in the center but once this happens like if you get overwhelmed on all three sides of the board it's over you just can't and if you take there is Bishop H3 pinning F5 as possible but then there's even like C6 just I mean you're just blasting through the position okay so I don't know if you can hear can you hear the hissing can you guys hear that I'm pretty sure you can let me know in the comments it's so loud in here I think it's gonna stop though anyway instead of that evich takes on D6 and super has to lick look look at the stuff super has to go through in this game Rook C7 and finally evich does in fact find this G4 idea but now it's a little bit late it's a little bit late because black gets a blockade and yes you can take my Pawn on H3 but now soupy starts standing up to the bully locomotiva has arrived B6 all he needed was one move and here comes counter play make no mistake his position is not very pleasant but his Pieces come alive and after you have been oppressed for four to five hours in a chess game you are going to stand up for yourself all right Queen B7 Knight C7 the king is safe now Knight goes back to eight he's just looking for an opportunity again the shuffling begins Rook takes B4 the idea from evich was to play Queen C5 but black plays defense once again super defensive Master Class Bishop A6 can't take because White Queen takes Rook Queen B8 back Bishop back Rook B1 counter play down the B file now look at look at the fact that evich has still been up upon the entire game take take check on B2 Queen A1 Knight D1 if black loses one more Pawn like this one it's over but he has the impregnable defense of the knights these nights on D6 and E8 nobody can touch him nobody can touch him Queen F6 back and suddenly right around here soupy catches his opponent with Knight H5 check and if you take it there's a fork so you gotta go here but all of a sudden soup is back white plays Bishop F1 and super plays Queen E7 which defends the pawn and attacks H4 the engine here gives Knight E4 anyway and then forking the knights with the King that's some Bush like I'm not even if you that is unfinable you are not finding that in a million years six hours into a chess game so evich plays G5 and on move 73 he made one bad move ivich played 72 good moves he played one bad move on move 73. soupy went back with his Knight forward with his Knight forward with his Queen forward with his Knight forward with his Queen forward with his Knight and evich resigned because either he loses the queen or King he won and that's mate long live the horses of Luis Paolo soupy let's go what a comeback that's his first win of the tournament and he gets arrested now he gets to chill huge win for the Brazilian shout out to the Brazilian audience um big win I got nothing against evich by the way I just really I was rooting for soupy if it's just really good all right now uh it's time uh for the two tweets for the two teenagers who actually didn't play a chess game at all and decided to punch each other in the face Umesh d and pragnananda Ramesh Babu I don't know why his name on chess.com is just pragnananda or like chess.com events like they just removed his other name I'm pretty sure he's not like McLovin you know and super bad like he doesn't just go by Prague the Nanda um I think his full name should be there but this is the way the game loaded it anyway they play a uh symmetrical English this was a very interesting line and gukesh has had enough of normal chess so he plays Rook G1 now you would imagine that the idea of Rook G1 is to play the move G4 you would be right sacrificing a pawn black actually has no choice uh if black tries to avoid it this this wins the queen so be brave takes takes 95 Bishop C5 which attacks the pawn and F2 right now any normal person here uh realizes that you know you gotta go Rook G2 but apparently Rook G2 is a bad move we're gonna see that later Queen E2 is played apparently taking here is bad you know why it's bad not because of King D1 because of Queen F2 because you are pinned so Knight F6 wins your queen oh my God so F5 now defends against that in the future Knight back to F4 Rook G2 is apparently a blunder so there is a line here Rook G2 is a losing move when I saw this I was like what Rook G2 apparently is losing to pawn takes E4 now gukesh was not going to take back he was going to go here all right then black would play Queen F5 apparently that's the best move now white has Rook G4 Queen G4 Queen C4 king h8 queen C5 and in this position both guys missed Rook F5 or maybe they didn't miss it I don't know maybe there's Knight D5 maybe there's more to this but then there's H6 which traps the Knight but then there's Queen D6 and then if H takes G5 there's Bishop C3 with Queen H6 oh my God maybe they're both just apps oh but they're just rookie ah yeah that like the computer hated this but it was because both guys needed to see 14 moves ahead they didn't so go cash went here gave up the pawn and castled now opposite side castling usually means we're gonna have a barn burner of a game like it's gonna be a scrap now Prague had to go here and try to trade the Queens off or at least the knights instead he goes back and now kukesh activates his bishop and this just looks scary right I mean it just looks like White's attack is right on the verge all right so Knight F3 Queen F3 Bishop E6 and he just asked the question now apparently H3 is a bad move that's what I'm saying this game was a fist fight all right apparently H3 is not the move like apparently you've got to go here first that's what the computer wants but shut up all right H3 played now we have night we have Bishop back to E5 but apparently Bishop takes F4 first was better because you need to do this instead of that black does it this way and apparently this is a losing move because you have takes takes takes takes takes and White's just up a piece now I guess Prague must have thought he was just losing no matter what happened here um but not necessarily and also uh no I think that's it maybe was it here no that yeah that's basically it I mean I'm basically just Bishop F4 had to be played but like I said this looks terrifying the the this is this bishop that was very embarrassing please uh just forget that ever happened uh this bishop and Rook combo is really brutal so uh gukesh just up a piece Queen Rook bishop and uh okay he has to avoid like you know some attack uh check but the king is safe King is safe and uh I mean you know it it's never too late to blunder mate in one but uh not at this level check blocks King runs a little bit uh but the king is safe and uh yeah it's actually black Quest that need to worry about getting mated and gukash has now won several games in recent days uh he won against Parham he won against Prague this game was a was a wild wild game um and uh it's the last one of our recap Magnus Carlson has now won three out of four guys he has won three out of four now uh today the 26th is a res day so there are no games the tournament will conclude on the 27th 28th and 29th uh as we look to see what's gonna happen is Magnus gonna win all the rest of his games too and win the event that'd be nuts anyway I'll see you in the next video get out of here
