we're going to look at a mind-reading computer slightly more impressively even a mind-reading javascript so it requires the computer to read my mind about a card in this very special deck of cards they're a weird pack i'm apologies to the viewers that's my fault for bringing the wrong kind of cards along but they are just playing cards they're just a funny shape i'll ask you to select five cards just say stop and i'll select the card uh that one this one yeah and now that one this one and then next three one two and three so it should give us uh five cards here now i am going to look at the cards um because i need to channel it to my computer and it's going to then read my mind and to make sure that there's no funny business going on i'm going to ask you sean to enter the cards into the computer and to read out the results so i'm going to put the card on the table and then i will ask you to enter this onto the computer cool let's let's have a look then here's a computer the first card to enter is the three of spades the next card is the two of clubs that's already there and the next card is the king of hearts and the final card is the three of hearts and now i'm channeling my psychic power all right now press read my mind okay hang on five of spades the big moment then come on here we go it read my mind okay all right what's the trick yeah i've put a recording device um secretly in my ear and i can click a number of times and the computer will count no none of that is going on of course there was some funny business going on when i was looking at the cards and i didn't put them down in the order i received them i put them down in a very specific order if you want to have a challenge go through the javascript yourself first and try to figure out what the funny business is see if you can figure out how the computer reads my mind but for those of you who that want me to walk you through it let's do that right now or if you just want to verify your solution the first thing i did was i found out whether or not there was a pair of cards that had the same suit in this case there were two pairs of cards that happen to have the same suit because there's four suits but five cards there will always be at least one pair of cards that will have the same suit this is also known as the pigeonhole principle in computer science because we need to give it a fancy name for a simple principle so i had a choice here i i just went for this pair i could have gone for this pairing and put down a different order but i went for this then i notice that if you have two cards of the same suit they will never be more than a distance six apart from each other if we allow rolling through the end so for example the king and the three have the ace is one higher than the king but then the two is two higher than the king and then the three is three higher than the king so they're actually three apart but in this case it's a lot simpler these two cards are two apart i always put the lower one of the two down and the higher one is hidden so that means that now if i know that it's a spade and i know that this card is one two three four five or six higher than this card because there's always a gap of at most six between them can i use these three cards to denote a number between one and six i think the answer is yes well the answer is yes yes because look at this this is the first combination this is the second combination this is the third combination fourth combination fifth combination and this is combination number six what i've done was i've put the three down i've selected it because the five is of the same suit and i now want to denote the number two so the number two is the second combination of course so we put the lowest card in front then the highest in the middle and then the middle one at the end so because there's six combinations we can always do this now if you want to do this trick yourself and you want to have a quick way of referencing these six combinations and knowing immediately by looking at it which is which you can assign each of these cards a number zero one or two so the lowest card will get the number zero the middle card will get the number one and the highest card will get a number two and then we can read out what is down there as a three-digit number so this is 12 0 1 2. the next number is 21 0 to 1. now 21 is the next highest number in that order the next highest number would be 102. so we make a hundred so there's a one in front then the zero then the two the next lowest number is 120 which is the fourth combination then we have to have numbers in the two hundreds the lowest number in the two hundreds is a hundred two hundred and one and then finally 210 is the highest possible number so that's combination six and we can do this for every deck of cards but what if some of those cards are the same number you know you've got two of the same yeah if two two cards have the same value for example instead of this three we have instead of this two we have the number three now we have two threes well there's one system that um is often used for ranking the suits in the deck which is called the chased chaste system and the reason it's called that is because it contains the letters c h s and d so c stands for clubs is the lowest then hearts then s for spades and finally the d for diamonds so that means that the diamonds is higher than the hearts and that still allows us to then have these various combinations great i'm off to vegas yeah go ahead and read everyone's mind two billion seconds starting from 1970 if we go roughly two billion seconds before epoch we will go to friday the 13th december 1901 so that means that there's obviously a lot of problems with it right first of all the networks are still not quite high resolution enough to deal with 1080 and 4k video
