hello everyone and welcome I created a video discussing whether or not the Tesla semi makes any sense and the fundamentals of that video hold up however we now have new information so many of you requested I create an update hence here we are so we're going to be looking at six different aspects of the Tesla semi starting with battery capacity now in direct response to someone estimating the battery size Elon tweeted the current efficiency is 1.7 kilowatt hours per mile So based on that exchange of tweets if we have 500 miles at 1.7 kilowatt hours per mile that gives us an available battery capacity of 850 kilowatt hours I think this is our best guess what the actual capacity is until we're actually told the real number you can also look at the delivery event in which case it took 93 of the battery to travel 500 miles if you assume that efficiency was 1.7 kilowatt hours per mile then you would get a overall battery size of about 9 914 kilowatt hours I think this is probably our best guess right here at the 850 kilowatt hours simply because of how that Exchange took place on Twitter but either way I don't believe it's going to be that 1 000 kilowatt hour that was initially uh predicted I think it's probably going to be closer to this 850. now Tesla released a video showing this 500 Mile Drive and this is a pretty telling video because you can go through it and look at what speed the driver is going and it's less than I would have expected because Tesla said their estimated range of 500 miles is at 60 miles per hour well if you go through this video and you try and pull out all the segments in which you believe the video is showing the driver at 60 miles per hour or greater it only ends up being about 14.2 seconds worth of the video of the total time of that video being 95 seconds if you take out the parts where it stopped or the driver is taking their bathroom break so if you take 14.2 and you divide by 95 that means only 15 percent of the time in the video based on my estimate are you actually driving at or above 60 miles per hour so most of the driving occurs below 60 miles per hour indicating the overall energy used is less than what would have been used if the truck had been driving 60 miles per hour now many of you asked why I didn't discuss regen breaking in the previous video and two key points first of all we're talking about highway driving here so we're basically staying at a constant speed so the amount of regen you have is very minimal second and what's pretty fascinating if you look at Tesla's graph of their 500 Mile test run as long as you start and end with a relatively similar elevation thanks to regen you really don't lose much energy from going uphill you can basically treat it like flat ground as long as you come back down if you connect a line between the start and finish you can see that even after going up a significant amount of elevation the overall energy consumption is basically the same as if you never went uphill at all since the region puts you back on track once you start going downhill regen is a powerful tool though of course that wouldn't be true if it's a one-way segment that mostly gains an elevation now I want to go back to this video where Tesla is driving below 60 miles per hour so if we go back to our previous video we calculated the absolute best case the minimum amount of energy required in order to travel 60 miles per hour with a full load for 500 miles was 800 kilowatt hours now if all we simply do is change our speed from 60 miles per hour to 55 miles per hour well we have significantly less aerodynamic drag and so that reduces this number from 800 to about 740 kilowatt hours in other words we save 60 kilowatt hours just from that small change in speed so speed makes a huge impact here on our overall efficiency and what the size of this battery might need to to be depending on how far it's going now something very fascinating happens if we analyze this situation assuming that the Tesla semi has an average speed of 52.5 miles per hour which isn't that hard to conclude may have happened based on looking through the video so these two numbers right here are best case looking at just aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance they do not include inertia so truthfully they're kind of unrealistic if we include inertia into the equation and we use 52.5 miles per hour for our 500 Mile Drive then we have a minimum energy requirement of 790 kilowatt hours 790 kilowatt hours happens to be 93 percent of 850 kilowatt hours in other words the exact percentage that the Tesla semi used in the test that they showed us okay but what if you want to drive at a higher speed well my best estimate for the amount of energy you would need in order to travel is 70 miles per hour for 500 miles is about 1187 kilowatt hours in other words if you were to have an 850 kilowatt hour battery pack this would be good for about 358 miles of range at 70 miles per hour at rated load now since most of the country has Trucking speed limits of 70 miles per hour or above let's say we have 350 miles of real world range is that enough well Tesla claims 80 percent of routes are less than 250 miles on top of this the U.S department of energy reports the average class a vehicle's annual mileage is just under 63 000 miles if you estimate 300 days driving per year that's an average of about 210 miles per day in other words while the truck may not be right for some use cases there are plenty of applications where it can make sense now on the subject of range there's a quote from Pepsi who the first Tesla semis were delivered to that has been making the rounds what most people have fixated on is the statement the semis will haul Frito-Lay food products for around 425 miles but for heavier loads of sodas the trucks will initially do shorter trips of around 100 miles some have taken this to mean the Tesla semi can only go 100 miles while loaded with beverages but neglect to read the very next sentence PepsiCo will then also use the semis to haul beverages in the 400 to 500 mile range as well O'Connell said so perhaps initially their beverage routes will be 100 miles but nowhere is it indicated that this distance is limited by the battery capacity there is one slightly more interesting quote O'Connell said that a 425 mile trip carrying Frito-Lay products brings the semis battery down to roughly 20 percent and recharging it takes around 35 to 45 minutes so that would indicate a range of about 530 miles total but again this really isn't a useful statement because we don't know how how fast the truck is driving if it's driving at 45 miles per hour it's embarrassing if it's driving at 80 miles per hour it's hugely impressive so don't let folks convince you that the semi is either good or bad based on these statements released by Pepsi so how much does the battery weigh for the Tesla semi well based on an EPA submission buy Tesla on the 2022 Tesla Model S the complete battery pack weighs 537 kilograms and has a specific energy of 186 Watt hours per kilogram for the entire battery pack you multiply these together that gives you a total battery size of 100 kilowatt hours so if we look at the Tesla semi and we assume a battery size of 850 kilowatt hours we divide that by our density here 0.186 kilowatt hours per kilogram that gives us a total weight of 4 570 kilograms or about 10 000 pounds so our battery probably is about 10 000 pounds or less and I say or less because realistically as you scale to a larger size from a percentage standpoint less of the overall weight has to go to the structure of that battery pack so how much does the Tesla semi itself weigh and how much less cargo can it carry due to its weight versus a Class A diesel vehicle so the average Class 8 diesel truck weighs about 17 000 pounds and in addition to that you can have about two thousand pounds of fuel depending on the setup of fuel tanks so if we look at a Tesla let's just say we have to start with that same number 17 000 pounds just for the truck itself then we're going to add ten thousand pounds for the battery as we calculated previously giving you 27 000 pounds for the truck now we're going to subtract from that to figure out what is our deficit the diesel truck plus its fuel so minus 19k giving us a deficit of about 8 000 pounds versus the diesel now electric semis are allowed to carry an additional two thousand pounds so we subtract from that two thousand pounds and if you're to think about the electric motors and inverters versus the diesel engine you can probably save another two thousand pounds there so our actual load deficit assuming these numbers are all correct would be somewhere in the four thousand to six thousand pound range so how much cargo can the Tesla semi actually carry well they released a video with a maxed out truck carrying 11 concrete Jersey barriers okay well how much do these barriers weigh bear with me as we figure this out from the Tesla semi photo on Wikipedia we can see the tire size on the front tire is 295 over 75 r22.5 from this we can calculate the tire diameter is about 40 inches if we take the side image of the Tesla semi we can see that we can fit exactly three tires across the length of a single barrier three times the tire's 40 inch diameter is 120 inches or exactly 10 feet a standard size of Jersey barriers I checked several different companies for the weight of these and they all listed them as four thousand pounds so if we have 11 10 foot Jersey barriers each at four thousand pounds then the Tesla semis cargo capacity is 44 000 pounds now I looked at what is the typical maximum load for a combustion Class 8 vehicle and that number ranges from about forty thousand pounds to about fifty four thousand pounds depending on the weight of the combustion Class 8 truck so while it's on the lower end of the range it does appear that Tesla semi's maximum load does fall within the same range as combustion trucks also worth mentioning one supplier says you get 12 barriers per truckload so one more than Tesla can carry a four thousand pound deficit which backs up the four thousand pound deficit that we calculated early earlier okay but here's probably the most important part of this video how much weight are Class 8 Vehicles actually hauling around on the road we'll look at three sources ultimately referenced by the U.S department of Energy's latest Transportation energy data book The First Source from the National Academy of Sciences shows the distribution of Class 8 truck weights on the road taken from 15 states you can ignore the lighter end as these are likely trucks with either no trailer or empty trailers the bulk of vehicles actually pulling cargo you can see Falls below 72 800 pounds meaning cargo loads the Tesla semi could easily carry about 10 percent or less of the trucks actually carrying cargo on the road are above a gbw of 77 200 pounds so hypothetically the Tesla semi potentially may not be right for these maxed loads the Second Source within the same National Academy of Sciences paper referenced earlier shows that 61 percent of trucks on on the road are cubed out meaning they're not weight limited but maxed out based on the cargo space required for the goods they reference 30 percent being weighed out meaning weight is the limiting factor with a gbw of 80 000 pounds or above so again hypothetically for 30 percent of loads the Tesla semi may not be the perfect truck for the job finally the third Source the Department of Transportation reports the average weights from way in motion stations for tractors with trailers are from fifty four thousand one hundred forty five to fifty nine thousand ninety one pounds GVW they go on to conclude sources are consistent in concluding that a relatively modest fraction of trucks on the road are near the maximum GVW so what's the point of all this so many folks have concluded the physics of these trucks don't make any sense because batteries are heavy and that's such a binary way of looking at this issue with today's technology probably 60 to 90 percent of U.S load capacities can be handled by the Tesla semi will there be longer routes that the truck doesn't make sense for yeah absolutely will there be heavy loads that the truck doesn't make sense for yeah absolutely but let's not pretend we're going to snap our fingers and suddenly every Class 8 truck on the road is going to be electric there are plenty of use cases today that make sense that we have the technology for the only two real concerns in my opinion are one does it make Financial sense and two do I have the charging infrastructure I need to do it if you have point-to-point Warehouse deliveries with charging yeah go for it but one final comment yes the physics appears sound but while that may be true that doesn't mean Tesla's marketing is necessarily sound they stated you could order the Tesla semi in 2017 and take delivery in 2019. that was not true so if you order now get the part the truck in two years they stated the Tesla semi would have four Motors well guaranteeing it won't break down from Million Miles because it has four independent Motors you can lose two of those four Motors and the truck will still keep going it has three motors they guaranteed you'd have a seven cents per kilowatt hour charging cost we're guaranteeing a seven percent kilowatt wholesale price I highly doubt they'll ever offer that they said the expected base price was a hundred eighty thousand dollars I also highly doubt you can buy the truck for that there are good reasons to be skeptical of Tesla based on their marketing though in my opinion the engineering checks out so my biggest concern continues to be the price while Pepsi States the operating costs over time will pay back it's also been reported that a 15.4 million dollar State Grant and forty thousand dollar federal subsidy per vehicle helps offset part of the costs if this is all a part of the 100 unit order Pepsi placed that's a subsidy averaging 194 thousand dollars per truck more than Tesla initially said they'd be selling them for now not all of this subsidy is just for the trucks but for infrastructure as well such as the charging units regardless there's a very healthy subsidy which is helping to make this decision financially sound so there you have it if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for
