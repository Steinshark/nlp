upgrading your laptop's RAM is a pain but thanks to cam 2 an updated standard recently ratified by jedc that might be about to change cam or the compression attached memory module is a memory form factor created by Dell engineer Tom Schnell you might remember it launching as a proprietary solution in Dell laptops in 2022 replacing the sodm form factor sodm technically stands for small outline dual inline memory module but it just sounds like we're calling them stupid and we are to their credit dims were a significant upgrade when they started to replace Sims back in the 1990s Sim pins could only support 32bit data while dim pins could manage 64-bit meaning that a single dim could do the job of two sims so dim is basically the same thing just smaller around half the size which is why it's primarily used in laptops compared to memory solder to the motherboard board replaceable components like sodm RAM sticks typically aren't as resistant to Accidental jostling they use more power and they take up more space in a portable device where space is at a premium and cooling is already a problem this has led to soldered memory becoming the default at the expense of repairability and upgradeability most users will never open the back end of their device so many manufacturers have decided that it makes more sense to ensure that it works today rather than it be upgradeable in the future but for those of us who'd rather upgrade a laptop that just needs a bit more RAM rather than buy a whole new machine it's a big disappointment so how does Cam 2 address those problems and can it really bring back upgradeable laptop Ram we'll tell you right after we thank Odo for sponsoring this video what can ODU o do for you well if you're looking for a highquality website for your

standardized cam 2 is an attempt to close the gap between replaceable and soldered memory looking at the original Cam and sodm side by side you're probably going to notice one big difference right away the size the single cam component is significantly longer and wider but it's also 57% thinner for an equivalent amount of ram shaving off a few millimeters of height and reducing overall volume Cam and cam 2 can also support up to 128 GB on a single module and have significant improvements over sodium in terms of air flow you might wonder why sodm comes with RAM chips mounted on both sides of the PCB like that if height is such an important factor but this is actually a way of accommodating yet another technical limitation of the format sodm uses an edge connector which means that traces for the chips nearest to the connector need to zigzag in order to keep them the same length as traces to chips on the far side that increases both the time it takes the motherboard to communicate with those chips and the risk of Distortion and cross talk between circuits as traces get longer you need to increase the space between them in order to manage that risk therefore a double-sided PCB is the best way to save space given the other constraints of the design even worse due to these same size constraints and timing issues the wires from the CPU wind up traveling under the sodm module and connecting to The Far Side leading to a minimum Trace length of 7 1/2 CM Cam and cam 2 on the other hand use a land grid array connector similar to a typical CPU because it has connecting pins across its rear face rather than on one Edge all the chips are now significantly closer to the connector and the motherboard further cam 2 comes in configurations for two single channels or one dual channel in part due to this connector change cam 2 will also need to be screwed down in order to ensure it maintains consistent contact which has both advantages and disadvantages it reduces the potential that the component might come unseated due to jostling but it also adds the need for a screwdriver like this one from LTT store.com rather than just easily slotting in like a sodm likewise depending on the design of their device some users might need to replace their existing cam 2 with a new one when they want to upgrade rather than simply buying a second sodm and plugging it in another reason why some companies are pushing for cam 2 now is so dim actually has a speed cap of around 6,400 MHz most Main extreme sodm designs haven't hit this ceiling yet but it's a future problem that cam is solving today with a proactive design that places the module in closer contact with the motherboard on the level of electronics and materials Cam and sodm are extremely similar meaning that they'll likely be similar in terms of price to Performance and software interoperability now as for power efficiency the cam 2 standard also comes with both ddr5 and lpddr5 sl5x Designs while sodm is limited to the more power intensive ddr5 in order to prevent anyone from accidentally crossing the streams which may lead to a total protonic reversal the slots for ddr5 and LP ddr5 versions of Cam 2 will be physically distinct to prevent one from getting plugged into the other the option of LP ddr5 might mean we'll see more upgradable RAM even in relatively small devices like tablets or single board computers it's unclear at this point whether cam 2 is truly the default laptop memory format of tomorrow but thanks to this new ratification by jedek it will likely gain interest and become cheaper over time Dell is of course a major backer of the new standard but Samsung and Micron also announced plans to incorporate cam modules in upcoming products even prior to the ratification of Cam 2 wow maybe we really are in the best timeline but one thing's for sure you are the best viewer for watching all the way to the end wow thanks for watching like the video if you like if you liked it dislike it if you disliked it one of those uh goes with one of those check out our other videos comment below video suggestions don't forget to subscribe and follow techwiki okay
