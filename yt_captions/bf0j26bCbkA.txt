Moldova is a small country in Eastern Europe one of its poorest it is also immensely corrupt over the span of two decades politicians made the businessmen Rich then after that the businessmen became politicians and took the whole state for themselves one man in particular accumulated immense oligarchic wealth he controlled the entire country behind the scenes until it all came tumbling down in this video we're going to take a look at how the rich ate Moldova but first I want to remind you about the newsletter sign up for updates and new analysis the full scripts of selected popular videos and more the sign up link is in the video description below I try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show the Republic of Moldova is a landlocked country wedged between Romania to its West and Ukraine on its north east and south most of the country's land lies between the pro and the Easter Rivers its official size more on what I mean later measures about 33 800 square kilometers or just slightly smaller than Taiwan the land is mostly forested Hills and steps the weather is quite nice with moderate Winters and warm Summers the Earth is Rich and plentiful it has Europe's third most arable land per capita so forty percent of the population Farm their most well-known export is wine with a prestigious wine culture that dates back to the early 1800s and at its agricultural height during the Soviet years Moldova produced 30 percent of the world's tobacco and 20 of its total grape Harvest Moldova has a long and complicated history let us run through it but I'm going to skip over a great deal of things we can trace the modern Republic to the principality of Moldova founded in the 14th century there were a vassal state to the Ottoman Empire in 1812 the ottoman signed the Treaty of Bucharest to settle the russo-turkish war of 1806 1812 in it they seeded a large portion of the old principality over 45 000 square kilometers between the rivers prud and nister to the Russian Empire can the ottoman seed of vassal State questionable but details right the Russian Empire held onto this area for a century has the best Arabia government region the name likely comes from the founder of the nearby principality of wallachia basarab one the remaining parts of the old Moldova principality those west of the river prod would join the aforementioned wallakia later in the 19th century to form the kingdom of Romania after the Russian Revolution the moldovan lands between the pride and the nister passed between various countries first they declared independence and joined Romania has greater Romania the Soviet Union never recognized this in 1939 the Soviets sealed a non-aggression pact with the Germans depriving greater Romania of their only Ally against Soviet expansionism the Soviets promptly demanded bessarabia which they got in June 1940. thusly the Soviet Union founded the moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic its second smallest Republic or SSR Stalin is known to have aggressively persecuted those exposed to non-communist systems he subsequently purged the country deporting and executing thousands as part of its ideological cleansing process the rest of Romania aligned with the Germans and the axis and reinvaded the area in 1941 as part of the German invasion of the Soviet Union they held it until 1944 when the Soviets retook control the Soviets retook a land devastated by War a massive famine collectivization and another wave of deportations followed soon after the moldovan SSR was dominated at the top by ethnic Russians and ukrainians ethnic moldovan speaking the moldovan language never really entered the higher rungs of power that is unless they were from the region between the nista river and the moldovan Ukrainian border called the transnister or transnistrion this region fully integrated into Russian culture their population is about 50 Russians and ukrainians but with a sizable moldovan minority it was moldovan ssr's most industrialized region providing 90 of the area's power despite taking up just 12 percent of its land in the late 1980s tensions between the ethnic moldovan majority and the Soviets led a series of strikes across the Republic two opposition organizations came together and created the popular front like many such fronts it was composed of a hodgepodge of people believing different things some advocated for Romanian reunification others for State sovereignty and yet others communist reform in late 1989 a massive popular front rally Drew 500 000 people demanding full sovereignty and the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1990 they won the most seats in the Moldova Supreme Soviet and broke the Communist party's Monopoly on power in May 1991 the moldovan SSR renamed itself to the Republic of Moldova a few months later in August they declared its independence from the collapsing Soviet Union the popular front leadership had long advocated for reunification with Romania and began making moves towards it they adopted a flag with Romanian elements on it they loosened border controls between Moldova and Romania but this move towards reunification alarm moldova's ethnic minorities about 35 percent of the population including those in the pro-russian transn area thus in December 1991 those guys declared independence 2 leading to a brief war that ended with a ceasefire in July 1992. Moldova failed in their goals for a while it seemed inevitable that the new nation would quickly merge with Romania but the moldovan people blame leadership for this military blunder as well as the deteriorating economic situation and voted them out nation building is never easy like many of the other post-soviet states moldova's challenges were daunting their transition involved a wholesale remaking of their identity economy and government all at once the first thing was to address the ailing economy which was collapsing faster than a diving peregrine falcon this brought a sense of emergency to the situation the new moldovan economy was shrinking an average of seven percent a year and the country experienced hyperinflation in the first six months of 1992 the monthly inflation rate was 75 percent worse yet for the moldovan people the government at the start had no way to adjust salaries and pensions to these new prices so by the end of 1992 79 of all the moldovan people fell into poverty adding to this problem moldova's most industrialized area transnistra was de facto independent and Out Of moldova's Reach to stabilize things the new government announced that it would transition to a functional market economy by 1996 such a system would have two key things first liberalize trade with the prices of essential Goods like milk eggs and bread set by the market and second the privatization of State Property shares in the state-owned firms as well as Land from the collectively owned and state-owned Farms would be distributed to the people the government moved quickly to implement these reforms hoping that they could get through this shock therapy fast as possible and be the better for it the country had to do this amidst immense tensions between its various ethnic groups like many of the post-soviet states the moldovan people struggled with their new identities the years of Soviet oppression and Rule cultivated strong anti-russian feelings among some people but many moldovans still support closer relations with the Russians like the transnistrans I mentioned earlier and then there is Romania some nationalists still advocate for Romanian reunification pointing to history and the close similarities in the Romanian and moldovan languages and the Romanian government has before said that it cannot accept that moldovans weren't Romanians but as I mentioned Romanian nationalism has its own detractors too and thus there are people strongly for moldovas continued Independence perhaps with aspirations of eventually joining the European Union it is all very complicated and these complex multifaceted feelings cause great cleavages and governance other post-soviet states like Belarus quickly fell back into authoritarianism again but moldova's weak State terrible economy and deeply divided people prevented a single Authority from rising to political power at first throughout the 1990s the moldovan government experienced several competitive elections and peaceful transfers of power in the presidency and Parliament two incumbent presidents stepped aside for their successors their first president Murcia snig order in 1996 and then his successor Petru luchinski in 2001. in addition the moldovan media was openly critical of the government and other branches managed to curb the president's Powers an apparent check and balance for instance in 1996 the Judiciary struck down a presidential attempt to fire a general this intense political competition might seem a good thing we all want more competition right modern Moldova when the official Channel stopped working then people resort to informal relationships like Clans and patrons a parallel structure planting the seed for unparalleled amounts of corruption as a result of all this the moldovan people's situations did not improve throughout the 1990s many economic relief efforts came years too late inflation would not Abate until 1994 when the government introduced a new currency the moldovan low and salary and pension indexing would not come until 1995. the legislation for the privatization passed in 1991 but did not start until 1993 due to political squabbling and a lack of funds and much of the execution was bobbled they distributed shares of state-owned companies to the workers and the people but the company's managers had inside knowledge of what was to be distributed they either bought shares at obscenely low prices or simply pilferred the best assets for themselves the agricultural land during distribution was similarly botched quantitative statistics might imply it to have been a success 1.5 million citizens received 1.7 million hectares of land but the reality on the ground is not so certain first it also started late most of the land was distributed in the 1998 to 2000 period and second workers received plots without consideration of the land quality and fertility one guy might get a plot of great Vineyard the other guy rocks on a hill sometimes multiple people got the same cow or tractor sometimes the plots were not connected together and again smart people in the know took advantage of their positions in the Land Reform scheme to assemble massive Parcels of fertile land just like the old Collective Farms of the Soviet age but now owned by private individuals so all in all the state privatization schemes failed to achieve its goals it enriched a certain select group of connected individuals creating a class of oligarchs meanwhile the citizens stayed cripplingly poor by 1997 moldova's GDP had fallen to just 35 percent of what it was 10 years earlier over 50 percent of the population still lived in poverty less than two dollars 15 cents a day many turned to the black market which contributed 70 percent of the country's livelihood a 2000 poll found that 91 percent of the people were dissatisfied with their lot in life and by 2005 20 of the country's population had emigrated making personal remittances one of moldova's biggest sources of income in 2001 BBC reported on the growing number of moldovans willing to sell their kidneys for money Moldova continues to deal with a bad organ trafficking issue so what happens when the people are unhappy things change but not always for the better in 2001 the Communist Party of Moldova led by their first Secretary Vladimir varonin surged back into Power by winning 49.9 percent of the vote and 71 of the 101 seats in Parliament they won these elections by dodging questions about their past Legacy and playing off the Nostalgia of the good old Soviet days promising free health care and closer ties with Russia they remained the only post-soviet Communist party to have recaptured power of the Soviet collapse once in power they Consolidated rule using their strong and disciplined organizational base inherited from their experiences back in the Soviet days in his first term Ronin tried to tilt the country towards Russia for instance an attempt to expand Russian language learning in schools and a potential deal with Putin to resolve the transnation issue however considerable pushback domestically and abroad thwarted these plans during the next presidential elections in 2005 Ronin proposed to bring Moldova into the EU Moldova back then had about as much a chance at EU membership as I have at Taylor Swift but the platform nevertheless was genuinely popular the Communist Party won 46.1 percent of the Parliamentary vote and veronin assembled a coalition to stay president this was good for veronin because power is quite enriching the 2000s was a decade of theft and Corruption party politicians gradually infiltrated what was left of the moldovan economy and enriched themselves and their families mostly by transferring public assets over to private hands Vladimir's son Oleg headed a business Empire in banking construction Railway and more Olex companies receive Rich government contracts over 2 000 in veronin's eight years in power he is arguably moldova's first billionaire veronen also struck good relations with the businessman named Vladimir plahotnyuke soon I'm gonna mess up this guy's name a lot but so be it became one of his closest advisors the hot New York's background is difficult to pin down the son of a teacher he first worked as an economist for a foreign company in 1991 to 1993. in 1996 he began exporting wine to Russia five years later like as you do he became vice chairman of one of moldova's biggest banks Victoria Bank by the end of the 2000s Moldova counted 70 billionaires and their total wealth accounted for 138 percent of reported GDP blah hot nuke alone was worth two billion dollars making him the richest man in the country in 2009 the Communists lost power again in April of that year the country held parliamentary elections polls showed the Communist winning 49.48 of the vote and 60 seats but tens of thousands of young people poured onto the streets arguing that the results were rigged since the protests were organized on Twitter two years before a similar undertaking in Egypt the incident was called the Twitter Revolution Parliament failed to come to a resolution and dissolved sensing an opportunity plotniuk and another colleague defected from the Communist party to the nominally european-oriented Democratic party of Moldova he quickly dominated the party despite emerging completely out of nowhere the moldovan media didn't even have a photograph of him to run back in 2010 but with his wealth and resources the guy owns his own Media Company he rose to become one of the country's most powerful leaders at the start the politicians enriched the businessmen now those businessmen are entering politics themselves now why would they do that for the next five years shared power with his Coalition partner Vlad philat another moldovan billionaire he got rich from illegal trading with Romania and then bought State assets while serving as the state Secretary for privatization when the Communists came into Power flat founded the liberal Democratic party of Moldova and resisted their creeping authoritarianism now he served as prime minister officially the two are partners and they in fact needed each other in order to ensure a parliamentary majority and keep themselves in power the two between them carved up the country's government into their own fiefdoms for instance falat controlled the financial regulators and the ministry of economy which was in charge of foreign assistance funds blah hot New York solidified control of the Judiciary and law enforcement this proved to be the crucial weapon to bring down his frenemy it all started when flat when after blahut nuke after news emerge of a December 2012 Scandal during an illegal hunting trip at a national park called paduria dumenasca various senior members of the Judiciary had attended this hunting trip again illegal during then which a young bystander got shot and killed they tried to cover up the incident but news got out flat made his move by moving to force out the country's prosecutor General a member of blahut New York's Clan in response blah New York launched a series of anti-corruption drives and the uneasy Alliance fell apart falatz Gambit failed to pay dividends because in November 2014 an even bigger Scandal dropped it came out that three moldovan Banks were taken over and forced to issue nearly three billion dollars of bad loans about 15 percent of the country's entire GDP the money was laundered through various shell companies ending up in various Latvian Banks when those loans were never paid back surprise surprise the banks collapsed the moldovan national central bank then secretly bailed them out to pay for this secret bailout the Ministry of Finance was forced to issue a billion dollars in 25-year bonds the moldovan people will have to pay for this theft for over a quarter of a century the moldovan currency devalued by over 40 percent causing inflation to explode the sophisticated scheme masterminded by an israel-born moldovan oligarch named Ilan Shore was dubbed the robbery of the century in the moldovan media opposition parties called for Action over one hundred thousand people protested against corruption the biggest such since Independence Shore was arrested and implicated for that in exchange for leniency prosecutors stripped the former prime minister for lat of immunity and arrested him for corruption the oligarch's assets were seized and he was sentenced to prison with no one left standing in his way Consolidated power he tried to formally become Prime Minister but was rejected by the president who said that the guy did not meet the necessary criteria of Integrity ouch it is a bit poetic that the quintessential backroom power broker powerful as he was can't make that final step into the Limelight fundamentally the man was profoundly disliked with a 95 disapproval rating and just a two percent trust rating to get 95 disapproval in such a divided Society I'm not even mad that's amazing the hot Newark was now the richest and most powerful man in Moldova with a fortune worth over 30 percent of the country's GDP or 2.2 billion dollars his clan of family members and Close Associates control state-owned companies financial flows and four out of the five countries TV stations by the mid and late 2010s the moldovan people had lost trust in their government a September 2016 poll found that 80 percent of people felt their country was going in the wrong direction for three years plahot New York had truly captured the state controlling the media Judiciary and more he attempted several times to solidify his power for good reforming quote-unquote election policies in 2017 to create a shadow voting system plot New York's party is nominally pro-european but the oligarch ultimately doesn't have a particular ideology that he stands for for instance in 2016 he backed Igor dodon of the pro-russian populist Socialist Party as president of Moldova so really cares for just one thing then abruptly he lost it all in February 2019 Moldova went to elect a parliament and to form a government major winners included the pro-european acum alliance basically the anti-plate New York party dodon's pro-russian Socialist Party and Plato New York's Democratic Party the fourth significant winner was the Sor party which is led by Ilan Shore yes the guy who did the Billion Dollar Bank theft I think that says something about moldovan politics anyway no party won an outright majority resulting in a hung Parliament this lasted for a while until somewhat unexpectedly acum and the Socialists joined forces this might seem a bit surprising since especially dodon is pro-russian and first rose to power with plahotenuse backing but it is said that dodon's patrons in Russia forbade an alliance with plahotniuk afraid of losing their influence over the Socialist Party is such a thing were to happen so despite their opposite leanings the two reluctantly worked together to throw plotniuk out of power This Strange New Alliance strangely backed by the EU us and Russia formed the government in June 2019 with acum's Maya Sandu as its prime minister did all he could to stop this he literally cut the power to the Parliament building the night of the announcement soon after he had the Constitutional Court invalidate the government and reinstate the old one that was unprecedented and resulted in two governments vying for power at the same time after sustained unified International pressure though the Constitutional Court reversed its decision a week after making it acknowledging their bias the Democratic party gave up power and plahotnyuke fled the country Moldova started off with a tough break the year spent in the Soviet Union left the country ethnically divided it struggled to make it through a three-fold transition in governance economy and national identity these divisions helped bring an oligarch into power and it helped that oligarch capture the workings of the state for his own financial gain an entire nation had to come together to evict them coming up on five years after blahnuk's fall Moldova remains a profoundly poor and corrupt Society a lot of time and effort will need to be invested to reverse the damage from Decades of poorly executed policies and bad people all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the Channel Sign up for the newsletter and I'll see you guys next time
