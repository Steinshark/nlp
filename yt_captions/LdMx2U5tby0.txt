- This is extreme hide and seek where the last one of
you found gets $60,000. We have an abandoned city
with dozens of buildings (upbeat music) and thousands of hiding spots. (upbeat music) There's unlimited places
for you guys to hide. And you have 20 minutes, go. - Give me that. - [Jimmy] $60,000, blog everything. 60 grand Chandler. - [Chandler] Okay. Bye. - You could buy a lot of stuff. - [Chris] Wrong place. - [Jimmy] You probably should hide outside of this house. - Every man for themselves.
No turning back now. - [Cody] Going down. Now we go to sleep. - All right, we're hiding. I got to go to the bathroom Off to a great start. - Not going to lie, I'm already
tired from walking around. - You have one minute left. - Oh, we have one minute left. Oh my God. How do we have one minute left already? - One minute? - That was a lie. - [Woman] Stop scaring me like that again. - Today is the day
Chandler breaks the streak. I think we find Becca first. - [Becca] If you find me first,
I'll be really disappointed. - [Chris] Dude, that's a lot of money. - Whoever wins could literally buy a car. - [Becca] This hole looks good. I think you could actually hide in there. What do we think? Is that whole for Becca? - You still have a minute left but Albert Einstein
said time is irrelevant. So we're going to go. - All right, I still
can't find a hiding spot. This is turning into a nightmare. - [Mary Lisa] I found
this very creepy thing and then if you go like this, completely incognito. It's very terrifying. - [Jimmy] Ready or not, here we come. So we just left the house and as we said earlier,
this place is massive. I can't believe we got
an entire abandoned city all to ourselves. We need to figure out a plan because this is literally an entire city. I say, we go, that way. - All right. (soft music) - Hey, I made it in the tree, actually. I'm sweating, it took me freaking forever. I can see everything. - They're somewhere near here. - Yes. I sense them. We're scouting the woods. We're scouting. Wait, I think I saw
someone up there running. I don't know who it was. - Go, go, go. - [Jimmy] I saw someone run to the- over there. Who is that? - [Chris] Yo, somebody? (heavy breathing) - Knock, knock. I'm tired. - Ooh. This is a cute
little house, to be honest. - I hear noises. No! No! No! - [Becca] Why are you out of breath? - [Chris] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, no! (yelling) - Oh, we found her.
That's who I saw running. Becca, no. - Arrested from the biscuit. I was just trailing behind you guys. - Am I the first one? - Yeah, you were the first one. - Well, we got to take you to jail. - All right. - This way. Welcome to jail. - So, sorry. I didn't
mean to find you so early. - You're the reason
she won't win 60 grand. Chris, you ready to
ruin some other dreams? - Yeah. - Attention. Attention. Becca has been found.
One down, nine to go. - [Jacob] Becca. - Chris, we got to go ruin other dreams. - Becca just got found,
literally five minutes in. - That means there's nine of us left. That means I'm doing good. Okay. (laughing) - Becca, come on. The only other girl. Be better. - I'm starving. - [Domino's Chris] Thanks
for choosing Domino's, this is Chris, how can I help you? - I would love five pizzas. Jake, what'd you want? - [Jacob] Bread bites! - Two orders of bread bites. Thank you. - Doing my best to climb this tree. - Oh! Karl's been here. You know how I know it's Karl? It's a Sonic The Hedgehog pendant and a DVD of Meet the Robinsons. - Karl, we found your pendant. - [Karl] Be careful. - I'm going to smash it against the ground if you don't get out right now. - [Karl] I'll buy two more when I win. - Yeah, but now we're about to open the sealed Meet the Robinsons. (yelling) Hey Karl, react for us
one more time like that. The camera didn't get it. - [Karl] You just want to hear where I am? - Duh! Wait, he knows us. - You're so smart. And you can hear it, so you're near. - Let's go. - I really hope they didn't ruin all of my copies of Meet the Robinsons. What am I going to do with the 60 K? Well, I just broke a few of my crayons, so I'm really excited to get new ones. Very sad about that. (leaves rustling) (intense music) Is he toying with me? Do I need to leave? - [Jimmy] This literally looks like a house from a zombie show. - [Chris] There's somebody
in here, a hundred percent. This appears to be boarded. All right. (soft intense music) - [Jimmy] You see anybody? - [Chris] Hello? - [Jimmy] Hey! - [Chris] Hello. I'm surprised there's nobody back here. This is a good spot. - [Jimmy] You can see
everything from up here. We got a wide view of the city. - Hello? Are you here? - [Domino's Chris] Uh, yeah. - I'll be there in a sec. All right, pizza's here. Going stealth mode. All right we're good. (intense music) Thank you. Here, take everything - Dude. I think it's Chris. - [Chris] What? - Someone literally ordered pizza. - [Chris] Hold up. Are you serious? - Hey, look. - [Tareq] You hope its just a- - [Jimmy] Yeah, he's going back to hiding. I just love how we're
upstairs in this building and I look out the window and I just see someone
run out at pizza guy and go boop and grab pizza. - Got a bunch of pizza. - You didn't get to compete. How does that make you feel? - Like a winner! I can't lose. - Every person you find,
I'll give you a grand, before midnight. - All right. Jimmy said I get a thousand dollars for every person I find- - Before midnight. Chris, let's split up a little bit. Of course, whoever bought pizza put it out in the front of this house. Tyler, I know you're the
one who bought the pizza, you're the only one dumb enough. - Yum. - All right, this is how
we're going to find people. Get your pizza. If all of you would please
remove your backpack and unzip the second zipper
and enjoy what's inside. - Let's see what it is. Oh, this boy got the hook
up with the Scooby snacks. - Scooby snacks. A
Twinkie, but it's crushed. That's upsetting. - Shut the front door and slap me silly. We got Scooby-Doo snacks. - [Chris] The reason why I'm a seeker is because I'm so good at hide and seek, I would never get found. - I'm out, I'm out. - All right, we're just going to go out side that real quick. (indistinct) them woods again. Time efficiency. Dude, if this was Call of Duty we would already respawn by now. - [Tareq] Yeah. - What? What are you laughing at? Is there somebody back there? - [Tareq] No. - I don't know. You just started chuckling and the joke I said wasn't that funny. - I cannot believe that. How did he not see me? - Oh, this is a good area to hide. (intense music) - What? How did he not see me? Oh my God. (intense music) (leaves rustling) - Hey. - Hey. (laughing) - Did you rustle? Was
it you I heard rustling? - I farted. - I knew I heard some rusting. Did you get out because of a fart? - Yeah. - [Chris] I have found Cody. He farted while I was
walking near and I heard him. I don't have any handcuffs,
but I'm sending you to jail. He can hang out with Becca,
who also lost 60 grand. I'm sorry I found you. I'm going to go ruin more people's day. - Do it well. - I didn't find anyone
in the South quadrant. I heard you found Cody? - I found Cody over there. (distant yelling) (intense music) - We're not letting them get away. Chris, you do the back search, I got front, alpha delta. - [Chris] There's so
much furniture in here. - [Jimmy] Why would they scream? - [Chris] 'Cause it was Chandler. Or was it Tyler! - [Jimmy] Wait, did you find him? - [Tyler] Oh no. - [Jimmy] Wait, why'd you scream? - I thought I saw a bug. - [Jimmy] Okay. So you were the one who
got the pizza, right? - Yeah. I ran across the
whole field, like twice. - Alright, Chris got Tyler. Chris is making them stack. Every time Chris finds
someone, he gets a grand. - Good job man! - You gave my child money, man. - That's awesome. - Now we're going to escort you to prison. - They were so close. - [Jimmy] We bring you
a new friend, Tyler. Attention! Tyler is now out. - [Mary Lisa] Wow, Tyler, you've changed. I thought you were better than that. - I'm not. - That is three people out. Seven remain. We're coming for you. Everyone listening,
there's still six people standing between you and $60,000. - [Mary Lisa] You should just back out now and save yourselves the time. - Jake Weddle was literally
hiding right next to me and they didn't even find him. - All three of them got Tyler
and he didn't rat me out. - I'm guaranteed fourth,
if I'm the next person out. So this is great. - I'm just sitting on a porch right now. Just taking a nice sit,
enjoying the sun a little bit while we still got it,
it's about to go down. It's going to get real cold. - I'm going to venture out into the world. I've been hiding here too long. All right, we're out.
We're out in the field. - [Mary Lisa] Oh my God, yes. Thank you. Oh my God. - I'm so tired. - It's time for drastic measures. You have 10 minutes to move 50 feet from your current hiding spot. I don't care where it is. And we will be looking, so move quietly. It's extreme hide and seek. Not fair hide and seek. - We got 10 minutes. I got
to move at least 50 feet. - 50 feet. Chandler, you good? Chandler, you didn't
figure out how to get down before you got up there? - [Chandler] No, it's
going to take me 10 minutes to get off this tree. - [Jake Weddel] Here,
just jump. I'll catch you. - I got out of the tree, 'cause they said we had
to move in 10 minutes. (rustling) - New hiding spot underneath the house. I'm tired. - So they have to move. Chris, let's get ready. - Did you hear that? - I heard you. We heard you. We have our first victim. Yeah, I heard something.
Someone's in here. I'll check under here. He's not under the house, Chris. No one's under the house, I checked. I want to go over here, I
want to get more of a view. Chris, Chris, Chris, come here. There's a house all the way at the end. Oh there he is, there he is. There's two. Chris, do you see it? - [Chris] I see him. We're about to get a two for one deal. - Whoever's on the end of the map, we see you and are coming in hot. - They're coming. Oh God, they're coming. They're coming. - [Viking] Are you serious? - They're running this way. - [Chris] Look, look, they're running! - Hey, keep going. (intense music) (laughing) - [Chris] There's Weddle! - Hey, we see you Weddle! - [Chris] I see Mary Lisa! - [Jimmy] I got this one, you go that way. I see you! - You got me. Jimmy. Road ends here. - [Jimmy] Hands where I could see them. Don't move. I'll be back for you. She's somewhere over here. - No wait, you can go in this house. - [Jimmy] Oh my goodness, what was that? - [Chris] I stepped on a rubber chicken. (screaming) - [Jimmy] Oh my God, it's you! - [Chris] I caught you, sorry. - It's okay. - [Chris] I'm so sorry. - It's all right. - I'm so sorry - Chris, you're a thousand
dollars for finding people, you giving that up if she
tells you where Chandler is? - Tareq, look at me. - [Tareq] I can't. No, no, no. Wait. I just looked somewhere.
It was a car driving. - Here's the deal, Tareq
looked at that house. - [Tareq] Yep. - Someone's in it. All right- - [Chris] He smiled and laughed and then he couldn't look at me. - Alpha delta, we got
the house surrounded. Reveal your location. - [Jacob] Oh crap. I just saw Chris. Ah, dang it! - [Chris] Oh darn! - I hate you Chris. - [Chris] Darn! - Why'd you have to do it to me? - [Chris] I'm so sorry. - Now I'm oh and seven. - [Chris] I'm so sorry. - I'm sorry mom. I disappointed you - Dude, I just went on a victory spree. - Victory Royale streak. Come on prisoners. - If delivering pizza's a crime than lock me up and throw away the key! - I expected better in myself. I'm the smallest one here. - I have an important announcement, loser! - More important of an announcement, there's six of you, which
means there's four left. Attention, there are six people out and only four of you remain. So I hate to keep you guys
here, but it's protocol. You have to sit in prison
until we find them. I'm sorry about that, so. We're going to go do our thing. - All right, made it to my spot. It's a tree. I'm inside of a tree. This could be the end of me. - We going this way, baby. Okay, I'm at home base. Might as well just take it. There's no place to hide in here. I'm hiding under a bed. I'm going to win. I'm going to get the 60
K and pinky ring gang. In between three people and 60 grand. I can freaking hear Weddel. Hold up. They're right there. - [Cody] What do you
give if I give up Karl? - The going rate, right now for bounty, is a thousand dollars. - [Cody] All right, he's
in that house right there. - Karl, this feels a little unfair, so I'm going to count to
30 and you better be gone. One, two, three- (yelling) seven, eight, nine I should have called it 30 seconds. (screaming) - [Karl] Oh! They ratted me out, those freaking jerks. I'm going to tell mom. - Four, three- - Two, one. Karl! Where he go? - Oh, he's long gone guys. Wait, hold on, hold on. Hold on, Hold on. - Hey Karl. Karl just is FaceTiming him. - Hey boy. - What is that behind you? - Nothing. - I know where that is. - Point it at the cloud, so
we can't tell where you are. - [Chris] Oh, wait, there's a chem trail. There's a chem trail. I just saw it. - So based on that cloud right there, he was looking at the
right side of that cloud, which means, dude, we
should be FBI agents. We shouldn't. - We're going to test
if Karl's in the area. Sonic the Hedgehog really isn't that good. Sonic the Hedgehog kind of suck. - He wanted to reply.
He's in the vicinity. - [Chris] He probably went
through the woods bro. He books it. So we just heard some rusting. (loud exploding) - We heard someone in this building, okay. Flashlight me. Let's not let him get away. Wait, I see someone. Who is that? I see you. - [Viking] Jimmy, wait! - [Jimmy] Wait. - [Viking] Yo! - [Jimmy] All right, come on out. - [Chris] What a spot. - Attention survivors, Chandler was found. - [Mary Lisa] Chandler, I expected better. - Let's let everyone roast him, even though we didn't find Chandler. - [Chandler] What are y'all talking about? (laughing) Did you hear what they just said to me? Mary Lisa expects better from me. Didn't you get out like two hours ago? - Ah, syke! We didn't find Chandler. But it was funny hearing you guys dog him. Wow, you guys hate Chandler. - [Chandler] See how
it is guys. Thank you. - All right, we got to
escort you to prison. All right, we bring you guys a friend. (loud booing) Three people remain. Jake the Viking has been found. This is not a prank. Karl, Chandler, Ben, you three remain and are fighting for $60,000. Good luck you three. Remember,
only one of you win $60,000. Give me my pizza. Let's go. - Jake the Viking just got out and that means there's
only three people left. I can do this. Hopefully
I do not get found. - So it is pitch black out right now. This went into the night. So we brought the world's
strongest flashlight. Point it at the woods. Oh my God. Hello contestants, we
are back out on the move. Wherever you are, you need to
move at least a hundred feet. No, lies', go really far. And while we're at it, let's go ahead and shut
down the first zone. Since there's only three of
them and this city is so big, we have to start eliminating some spots, or we'll never find them. - All right guys. They
just told us to move, so I got to get up and go. I'm literally laying down
in the middle of the map. I'm hugged up against the building. I don't know if they're
going to see me or not, but hopefully they do not. - [Jimmy] I see a faint light. - [Chris] That is a very faint light. - [Jimmy] Do you see that Chris? - [Chris] Yeah. - [Jimmy] Chris, look, look. We saw a light off in the distance, we're going to go over there. We're coming after you guys, over and out. Dude, this is so scary. All right, I'm going to
go check out this house. - [Chris] Dude, I feel like I'm playing a horror video game right now. This is scary. - [Jimmy] The camera shot
I'm getting right now is so creepy. You stay here, I'm going inside. Come out, come out wherever you are! No one's back here. That
would've been a great spot. That house was clear. Next one. (intense music) (laughing) Oh, that's Chandler! I
thought that was Ben. (laughing) Yo! - How did you turn the corner
and immediately see me? - You did so good. Where
were you hiding man? - In the top of the tree. - Wait really? - Yeah. - I told you someone was in a tree. So here's the problem though, the two people remain are Ben and Karl. And as you know- - Don't you do this. - Chris loves Karl. - Yes - No I don't, I hate Karl. He's so gross. - I need you to follow Chris and make sure he's not cheating. Because if Chris found Karl, I feel like he just would ignore it. I'm going to need someone
to keep Chris accountable. - Honestly, part of me does
not want to play anymore. Part of me really just wants to go hang out with other people. I've been by myself this whole time. I'm so lonely. - [Chris] We haven't been
looking in enough trees. I just have a feeling man. - Did you see someone? Found somebody. - Did you really? He has to be pranking me. Who do you think he found, Ben or Karl? - [Tareq] Ben. - What if it's Karl?
Chris will be heartbroken. - [Chris] Oh no. Who is that? No! No, Karl! - Karl! - [Chris] Oh my God! - [Jimmy] Karl, no! - I'm sad. I need to hug somebody, please. - Karl, you okay? - Yes, I need a hug. - You just lost 60,000. - I sure did. Those numbers are real. - [Chris] I'm so sorry, Karl! I'm so sorry. (pained yelling) - [Jimmy] We have lots
of news for you guys. There's eight of you. So if we're bringing someone
else, you know who wins? Who do you think won? Ben or Karl? - Ben. - Karl. - Ben. Ben, Ben, Ben - You guys think Ben won? Then I hate to break it to you but, (loud cheering) (sad music) (yelling) - Welcome to jail. - Ben, you are the only one hearing this, you're the winner. Please return to prison. - Oh my God. - We have- (laughing) - We have $60,000 in
cash waiting for you Ben. Come on in and collect your money. (loud clapping) (indistinct loud chatter) As all these people, who
suffered for an entire day watch, please collect your $60,000. It's very heavy. So Ben, enjoy your money.
We'll see you later. You guys are all released from
prison and the video is over. Make sure you subscribe. Goodbye. - [Man Singing] Mr. Beast, oh! Mr. Beast, oh!
