what can i say kind of called this one didn't i uh we predicted this bloodbath okay it's why i'm wearing red i mean honestly a few hours ago this shirt was pure white but it's been bad in the markets if you're a big clout holder if you're clowder stephen clowder um you're not having a good time okay it was kryptos fire fest look they promised influencers they promised the world and they delivered on pretty much nothing today it's almost like a post-mortem listen they're still holding on they're still holding on by a thread but the writing's on the wall ladies and gentlemen and we're going to talk about it right now let's get into it ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla the internet detective and today we're talking of course about big clout guys it was worth 177 when i covered it in march remember that was around when they launched the current price of bitcloud is 73 giving you an roi if you invested of negative 59 percent which i think is just swell some of the best you see these days uh ladies and gentlemen just remember and this is really important let's bring down the board here um this is a coin here that was backed or should i say platform they call themselves a social platform decentralized social media they were backed by some of the biggest brains in the world the guys who are on top figuring out what the next trend is you got people like a16z chamath the winky twins they all collectively decided that it was a good idea to trust the guy their leader who goes by the name of diamond hands well turns out it actually wasn't now there are about a million metrics you could measure the um failure of big clout by not the least of which is the price but i think the worst metric for them is clout ironically enough ladies and gentlemen this is a um graph of their search terms and as you can see they've just slowly sort of been sliding into obscurity both on google and more broadly people just aren't interested in it people really just aren't talking about it the way they used to and i think part of that is we'll start with the failure why it failed i think part of it's due to the rocky launch where they just stole a lot of people's identities i don't know if you guys remember that they took the top like several thousand uh public profiles took their twitter profiles and just threw them on the site and let people invest in them before people even knew they were being used on big cloud which led to some pretty ironic results like right now even now the top creators of all time on big clout are people who have not joined bitcloud that's right ladies and gentlemen the number one invested profiles are elon musk and naval who both thinks that little clock icon have not joined they have not okayed their likeness and their public persona to be used by big cloud to make money but here they are the number one and number two it's completely absurd and i think that their vision of like this decentralized um social media which i actually think is kind of a good idea i think it really got overshadowed by this hustle for money because look i've spent a lot of time on big clout just looking at what people are saying i don't have any big clout but i i just like watch just i'm interested what are people talking about and honestly it's twitter but worse i mean on twitter yes everybody's self-promoting but on big cloud everyone's self-promoting so you'll invest in them so you'll invest in their creator coin that's why anyone's on big cloud or why most of them are on big cloud they're so they can get rich on bitcloud so everything's like about like self-promotion times 10 to the max and it's just kind of cringy it's like just everyone's constantly pitching to you and no one thought of like the normal users experience you know like non-famous people you have to get them on board why are they gonna join when everyone's constantly like chilling to get your money i don't know it was this really weird thing when i realized that that's what this had sort of become kind of had bad incentives from the start a bad launch but ladies and gentlemen since this is a postmortem i also think there's something else we all need to look at here um and that is what big clout did with all this money they've made remember from my last video we talked about a wallet that big clout got that got basically 200 million dollars in bitcoin from people who were trying to invest in their silly new idea and they successfully raised all this money but i think the question is what are they doing with that money well according to decrypt this is from several months ago diamond hands did an interview with them they're talking about at the time it was only 170 million dollars and stash i know kind of a joke right but anyway diamond hands assured decrypt that neither he nor big clouds developers would use it to pay themselves saying their financial incentives are instead tied to the success of the big clout token so basically they have now it's like 200 million dollars uh all this money sitting in a bank a bitcoin wallet and they said guys trust us we're not hey hey trust us don't worry we're not going to do anything with it and that's of course when they were telling you guys they were decentralized they're a decentralized organization where they control the keys to where all the money is right that's how this works but i think we have to watch these guys because i think they're gonna do something with that money they're sure not gonna let it sit there forever and um just recently they started moving a bunch of bitcoin out of it they have before but i think this is the largest amount they've moved out since they moved out 599 bitcoin out of this wallet with all this money by the way 599 bitcoin is about 28 million dollars ladies and gentlemen um so yeah exactly chump change for these guys so i tried to trace down where someone was going here we go i put put together a little map here this is the wallet so where all this money was they as you can see they sent 598 bitcoin here to this wallet over here um and then that wallet was then sent that same money over here we double click on that and then as you can see this wallet now sends uh bitcoin to a number of different addresses 221 bitcoin here 360 bitcoin here but anyway the point is we have no idea where this money's going or ultimately what it's being used for that's the great thing about having a founder who's anonymous right is uh you don't know what they're gonna do with the money that they've raised and you can rely on their promises all day that supposedly they're not gonna take a paycheck but we have no idea what they're gonna do with this money diamond hands apparently said that they had uh plans to do use the bitcoin stash for good but he declined to say if such good would come from donating the money to a save the whales style charity work oh boy or from starting a foundation to promote the big clout token which other projects have done in the past guys we don't know what he's going to use it for that's the point and the other point is that 28 million dollars just got moved from that wallet and i'm sure a lot more will get moved soon as well because frankly ladies and gentlemen big clouds days may be numbered here they started really high as we said huge launch because everyone thought these huge influencers were on there turns out they weren't really and the ones that were just wanted to make a a quick buck off their followers and then it just kind of stagnated and then now the coin is crashing so uh with that happening it'll be interesting to follow that wallet and see where that money's going um but ladies and gentlemen that's basically all i wanted to cover for this is let you guys know what was going on i gotta say kind of call this one hope you guys didn't lose money thank you so much for watching save your clout and i will see you guys in the next one
