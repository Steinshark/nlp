money laundering is one of those things that most people don't think about many people are not quite sure what exactly it is and why it's a crime in the first place but a lot of people can see real estate prices in specific cities in hong kong australia london canada and the united states going up and up and up so much so that locals can no longer afford to buy a place where they've grown up another thing is that people notice that such places have a lot of rich chinese people living there ergo not too hard of a mental task to connect the two together why is housing so expensive damn foreigners and all their fraud money coming in well in this video i want to talk a little bit about chinese money laundering trends and put a little bit of i suppose clarity on why real estate is so important to the housing price equation but first i want to take the time to talk briefly about a new thing that i've committed myself to working on not an ad thing or anything kind of like it but i want to direct your attention to the agenometry email newsletter i've tried a few things on and off over the past few years with regards to expanding things beyond just the youtube channel most of it haven't really gone anywhere but recently i've gritted myself to working on one thing and trying to stick with it previously the newsletter was just me sending out the occasional script or the like to an older video but i think that this newsletter can be a lot more than that newsletters in the future will have more information outside what can be found in the video including maybe sources some additional commentary and maybe the occasional collection of interesting news links for the latest newsletter i just finished up one uh newsletter recapping my ipo analysis of a chinese ai company megv i went pretty deep into the hong kong prospectus and learned a whole lot especially in regards to its super close ties to jack ma and alibaba so yeah i hope you'll find it worth subscribing and i'll hope to try to make it worth your while much thanks money laundering is the act by which criminals make illegally gained funds look like as if they were acquired legitimately you turn dirty money into clean money it is most as closely associated with acts like fraud human trafficking or drug money where there is profit making criminal activity there is likely money laundering in the 2008 report issued by the people's bank of china 44 of dirty money in china comes from either two sources management fraud or financial fraud this is as opposed to other countries where dirty money comes largely from drugs or human trafficking the chinese government reports that the largest source of laundered funds out of china are tied to what is called politically exposed persons these are essentially senior politicians or officials entrusted with state-owned resources or private resources moving those assets out of china for their own gain one example of a pep is a deputy mayor wonzo who took 30 million dollars in bribes and used that money to purchase new york real estate through shell companies she was only caught when she tried to evict a tenant from the property i've looked at a few more of these high-profile party members convicted for corruption in previous episodes other examples are of high level managers embezzling money from the companies they work for one top level exec for a chinese beer company fled china for the united states after stealing millions from his company some of that money went into a two million dollar miami condo the style of these officials is to first resettle their kids and family outside of china ostensibly for university education what not it's a concept called a naked official and to illustrate it let us look at the story of a man named dio changming a regional president for china's bank of communications bokom the mainland's fifth largest bank two businessmen had fraudulently borrowed a total of nine billion rmb 1.4 billion usd from bocom's guandong branch the loan documents looked fine on the surface but the companies receiving these loans did not exist the financial statements were falsified leo at the time had directed two underlings to make these loans he caught wind of the ministry of finance and its probe and bocom higher-ups sniffing around and fled the country in 2007. he remains at large as one of china's most wanted criminals while leo was rising up the ranks in china's financial industry he first moved his wife and two kids abroad to the united states in 1998 the three lived good lives in the united states with a large real estate portfolio valued at over 10 million dollars it's rather unclear where that money came from according to the new york times but chinese officials seem to have a good idea in 2018 the family uh the three so two kids and one mother visited china to see a dying grandparent and found themselves unable to leave held hostage so to convince their father to give himself up to the legal authorities that was 2018 and i haven't heard anything about how that got resolved fraudsters and corporate criminals wanting to move their money out of china look to put it into countries that don't have an extradition agreement with china common locales include canada australia united kingdom and of course the united states china is the biggest international buyer of american real estate with a preference for california new york and michigan commonly targeted cities are san francisco new york city and of course the british city of london real estate remains ideal for chinese money launderers because transactions in that space absorb huge amounts of money yet at the same time remain extremely informal the real estate market in the us uk and other places in the west is highly decentralized critical anti-money laundering features such as reporting thresholds and ownership requirements are missing thus a chinese naked official can bring money to the united states to buy a property and then resell it to another buyer laundering their dirty money and injected it into the clean economy in 2016 the average real estate purchase by chinese national and u.s property was 936 thousand dollars but we should keep in mind that these are generally expensive real estate markets in general california new york et cetera so it's natural to pay more price is not necessarily the way to figure out a potential money laundering event generally aml anti-money laundering investigators are looking for several other factors is the buyer a shell company with the actual final owners obscured from the public are the buyers using unregistered proxies and real estate agents to buy the property and pretty critically are they paying upfront all in cash buying real estate with anonymous shell companies as the panama papers showed unfortunately has turned into somewhat of a global trend making it harder to tell between is legitimate and illegitimate uses in the united states half of all 2014 real estate transactions over 5 million dollars were purchased with shell companies in 2015 uk authorities investigated 180 million pounds of london real estate transactions over 75 percent of such transactions were done with shell companies this abstract influx of dirty money into legitimate markets has very real consequences for ordinary people like you and me dirty money real estate purchases have real impacts on the market because the buyer is attempting to launder their cash out as soon as possible they are often willing to pay more than what is quote unquote the healthy market price now at the same time i don't want to kind of to sensationalize the impact the real estate market is a very complex organism there are a lot of factors resulting in that final price chart going up and to the right i can just imagine the comments right now quote stop blaming foreigners and build build build or quote look at wall street and their hedge funds buying up houses from the ordinary guy yes mr commenter you are also right all of that is also true private equity funds are buying homes by the thousands nimbys make life for every silicon valley and new york city renter and potential home buyer and yeah we need to rezone certain areas for residential living and yeah americans need to stop building huge mcmansions with huge lawns but like potatoes in a soup money laundering adds to the overall mix when clients are offering and paying twice the listed price in cash the market is not free it's being artificially distorted and thus is not built on top of fundamentals and because the very goal of money laundering is to evade detection the impact on the market is not easily measurable i'm apt to say that impact is underreported or maybe you're just one of those people who believe in the super ultra free market and say that a transaction is a transaction even if it's illegal i really don't have anything to say about that that's mostly on you but it also has real impacts on kind of construction as well because money launderers are great clients it causes home builders to focus on constructing luxury homes and apartment complexes rather than affordable housing money launderers don't often live in the homes they buy so you just got these empty luxury high rises dotting your nice city traded on paper but never lived in while everyone else lives in a three bedroom with four roommates the optics and perceptions of these actions are also just as important politicians can easily turn these trends into racial and citizenship issues with the goal of acquiring political power and the media has jumped on these trends as well in sydney australia for example just 30 percent of respondents in a survey believe that chinese investments in their city's real estate market which if you're not aware are going bonkers right now are being done above board the rest are either not sure or believe that illegalities are happening think about it 70 of people believe or are not sure that illegalities are happening this presents a big opportunity for future political exploitation and that is a real problem so money laundering is a crime that happens when different bodies don't communicate with each other so what are we doing about it the chinese financial authorities admittedly have been getting better at closing off the traditional ways that criminals take money out of the country better and closer relations between the regulators and the regulated have resulted in better oversight chinese banks now have robust anti-money laundering departments with the specific goal of rooting out suspicious transactions and new aml regulations are coming online in the chinese securities cryptocurrency and insurance sectors known to be useful for moving money out of china insurance especially regardless money laundering in china remains a huge hard problem in 2012 alone chinese banks and other institutions filed 29 million suspicious transaction reports just five offenses were convicted and eight arrests made think about it 29 million suspicious transaction reports eight arrests the us in contrast saw 1.5 million transaction reports and 1110 arrests in the same time period and this is partly a paperwork problem china's aml systems run on what is called a rules basis is the transaction for example larger than a thousand dollars report it as you might guess the biggest issue with using this approach is that once you know what the rule is you can easily evade it it also generates a lot of paperwork the us and the uk on the other hand have been transitioning out of this regime towards what is called a risk-based system rather than looking at every ten thousand dollar transaction you look at who the person is and what business that they're conducting and what industry they're they're doing it in china has not yet moved to the style yet and you know the result is there the west has their own work to do as well financial regulatory authorities have been trying to expand oversight into the real estate space but this is happening very very slowly literally on a state to state basis the reason is because real estate is a huge market in the united states and industry professionals which include real estate agents and other organizations are loath to accept this more complicated regulation but there are real benefits and i think what's happening but i think it should be done somewhat most importantly countries must communicate and work together to help shut down money laundering like i said money laundering is something that happens when countries bodies regulatory agents everything they don't communicate with each other the problem is china's recent tensions with the west have made this much harder but some form of common ground should be or can be and should be found because i feel that both parties and both peoples have a lot to benefit from it alright everyone have a good evening take care of yourselves see you later
