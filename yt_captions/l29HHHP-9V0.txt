okay so oneplus have just announced an affordable 400 phone and you've got reaction to this news is probably why do i care because it's fair to say that the vast majority of 400 phones aren't particularly exciting but over the last month oneplus have been teasing details of this phone at an achingly slow pace one spec at a time acting as if they were about to reveal god's gift to mankind not a mid-range smartphone but here's the thing it worked they've created more buzz than i've ever seen for a product like this so much that they've managed to completely sell out three separate waves of blind pre-orders that is people who've effectively paid to book the device before they even know what it is it's crazy talk so the question on my mind now that we actually have the device is is this special or is this just really clever marketing for an average mid-range product so this is the reviewers kit nice hefty package and if we slip it open it's pretty simple three official cases we've got a black sandstone a blue sandstone and clear and that leaves us with the retail box what you would get if you went into a store and bought a oneplus nord this is a fancy box especially for a category of phones that most companies don't put a lot of thought into there's at least some soul in this the first thing on the inside is the oneplus note itself and below that your insert with a welcome letter a further insert with some manuals and stickers and a pretty wacky looking case and then right at the bottom a usbc charging cable and a warp charge 30t adapter it would have been cool to see these in the new blue and black color theme too but and here's the phone okay so we get it it's got fancy packaging but what about the phone itself is this actually special honestly i think it is and it actually only takes a very quick side by side versus a competing android phone to see why take the oppo find x2 lite it's probably the most similar phone to this on a hardware level both have a quad camera set up with a 48 megapixel main camera both have an upper mid-range snapdragon 765g chipset and actually both have a 6.4 inch display with an identical 2400 by 1080 resolution but to be really honest i think the oneplus nord demolishes the oppo for two reasons first of all that i think oneplus has picked the right components and secondly that oneplus has really thought about the user so what do i mean by that well the reason why 400 phones are often not particularly exciting is because for this price companies can't afford to build exclusive technologies for them the way these phones are made are literally by looking at all the parts available and choosing i'll have that display for fifty dollars i'll have that camera for thirty dollars i'll have that battery for an extra 10 and so on so almost every one of these mid-ranges is just a different cocktail made with the same selection of ingredients and the nord is no different pretty much every part you see on this phone we've seen somewhere else before but oneplus has made good choices that's to say that in pretty much every category they've picked about as good a component as you can get for the price these displays have the same resolution yes but this one has a smaller board around it and a hole punch camera that's a little less intrusive than that notch they both have the same chipset yes but because of the 90 hertz screen refresh rate on the nord it feels faster oppo has a single front camera oneplus has dual front cameras one of them a normal wide-angle lens and the second an ultra wide angle the note has 5g it has a big battery it has an in-display fingerprint scanner plenty of ram and storage you get the idea nothing feels particularly lacking except for maybe audio it doesn't have a headphone jack and the single speaker is not the best but this is commonplace with mid-ranges so for the money you're getting components that are at least as good as the competition in a lot of cases better but to be really honest i don't think that that alone is enough to justify the whole month of teasing that oneplus gave us thankfully though there is something else it's the fact that you feel as a user that oneplus has really kind of thought about what you want and this sounds kind of self-explanatory i mean every company wants to make the best phone for their users but you really get the impression when you're using this that oneplus haven't just tried to fill out a spec sheet like most mid-rangers do they've just tried to make a phone that's good and the way you can tell is that there's a whole number of things going on here that aren't immediately obvious until you've bought the phone like the fact that they've added seals around the openings to protect against splashes they've made software that's in my opinion more inviting than a lot of the competition see i actually like oppo's color os i think it gives you great granular control but if i had to guess i would say that 90 of users especially here in the west would prefer oneplus solution it's not perfect but they've managed to make a software skin that feels quite burdenless visually simple but with all the core features still there and then for cameras they've added optical image stabilization which i don't remember the last time i've actually seen this on a 400 phone because of this whole fact that it doesn't really show up on a spec sheet but when you're using the phone you feel it it makes a big difference to the quality of the camera experience but i actually do just want to talk to you about this for a second because oneplus is selling this as a flagship camera and that's only just about passable as maybe being technically true yes this has the same main camera as the flagship oneplus 8 which sounds brilliant but do you remember that this was also the same sensor as the one in the oneplus 7 last year and the fact that the three other cameras here the eight megapixel ultrawide the two megapixel macro and the five megapixel depth cameras are not high-end sensors there are good macro cameras out there this is not one of them that said while calling this a flagship camera is a bit of a push for 400 you will struggle to find better by using a camera sensor that oneplus is already very familiar with this comes out the box with a whole year's worth of refinements and tweaking and the result is a camera that has polish it's pretty similar to what apple did with the latest iphone se they basically re-released the iphone 8's camera from a few years ago with more advanced up-to-date image processing which is a concept might sound like you're actually getting cheated a little bit but in the end the results were good and you were getting that technology at a lower price than you'd ever had before like the nord this camera doesn't feel cutting edge i'm not blown away by the clarity but because of the refinement it's reliable it handles dynamic range consistently well it gets good colors and oneplus has fixed the overly red looking video that their older phones used to produce this isn't a full review i've only had the phone for a week but it's enough time for my solid first impression and even the front camera is one of the better ones out there it deals well with harsh backlighting and given that it is a 32 megapixel sensor it's pretty detailed too and i would consider the ultrawide icing on the cake it is a good option to have but it still has some distortion and a lower quality output the other thing i noticed is haptics and i actually came into this ready to complain about it because before i got my phone i was reading through the reviewer's guide and i could see the inside the phone only has a basic linear motor pretty much the same thing that you'll find in the oppo and to give you an idea of what that feels like listen to this now this might not bother you but having used flagship phones with tighter higher quality vibrations i can say for sure that haptics help and they're probably the biggest giveaway for a phone that's tried to cut corners but i was kind of surprised to see that they're actually okay here and it's not because they've used a high-end motor it's just that they've spent time tuning what they did have i'm not 100 sure what they actually have done to it whether it's just turning down the intensity or whether there's actually more advanced tweaking going on but the point is that as a user it feels good and these haptics have been subtly integrated into the software to add tactility when you're using the navigation gestures when you tap that shutter button on the camera when you're using your fingerprint to unlock the phone as well as seeing an animation you feel something although on the note about fingerprint scanner it's good very few errors and it's one of the fastest i just wish it was higher up it's not a particularly huge phone so you can still manage with your thumb but there's usually a bit of stretching involved compared to the flagship oneplus phones the snapdragon 765g chip does introduce some limitations i could still play cod mobile at a smooth 60 frames per second but on medium settings and compared to the flagships the slow motion video isn't as slow just due to power limitations so that is pretty much the naught but let's just come back to that original question is this phone special and the way i would round this off is by saying that yes and it's also a really clever strategic move by oneplus more than ever before people are flocking to buy phones in this mid-range segment and i think the nord is a great answer to that most companies they have like six different mid-range phones at any one time and they scatter their resources and effort between them but oneplus is just making one phone that's targeted squarely at the middle of the mid-range market and they've devoted all resources into just making a device that impresses people and i say that because it's very clear that that's what oneplus is trying to do the nord isn't trying to make a quick buck this is oneplus trying to build fans because they're delivering things that other competitors at this price just don't everything from the free stickers in the box to the subtle attentions to detail to the minimum of two years of major android updates they've promised make it very clear that oneplus is trying to win customers for the long haul anyway my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one you
