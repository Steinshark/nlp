and I think the key thing to home in on is that disagreement doesn't have to be disagreeable it may and it if it does it may get into the zone of hurting people's feelings but as I've mentioned to more than one student in my teaching career I don't mean this to be offensive but I care a lot less about your feelings than I do about your Pursuit Of [Music] Truth [Music] hello everyone watching and listening today I have the pleasure of speaking with the sitting president of a think tank conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation Dr Kevin Roberts we discussed the operations and practical utility of think tanks the state of progressivism in the academic environment how mult multiple generations of students have now been rendered incapable of facing adversity while claiming to fight it and why intellectual combat is not something to shut down but to Champion Against All Odds so you know I was much older than I should have been as an educated person to understand what a think tank was and how they operated and you know I'm probably not as clear about all the details still as I might be I don't know anything about their history or I don't know who set up the first one I don't really know exactly who draws upon them and why and what effect they have on public policy at the local and state and National level and so maybe we could start by just having you give everyone watching and listening a a good description of what a think tank is and to put them in context before we start talking about your Think Tank and specifically great question at at its base any Think Tank whether it's on the political left or the political right or in the center starts with research it it it may focus on a certain set of public policy issues the purpose of that research is a little bit different maybe even a lot different in some cases than the research that you might do as a professor that I was doing as a history professor and that is the purpose of the research at a think tank is to affect the outcome of public policy some think tanks will only focus on the Arch other think tanks as I'm we'll no doubt discuss will use that research and then hire people to go Advocate that is to say that they're lobbyists to directly influence the outcome of public policy whether that's at the federal level in the United States obviously with Congress and the executive branch at the state level or even at the local level so they are to sum up quasi academic institutions in fact many people will leave Academia strictly defined you the university to do work at a think tank although there are many people who are professors full-time at universities who do project or contract based work for think tanks I I understand as a concluding point to to this definition of think tanks broadly that the United States has the most robust vibrant system of think tanks across the political spectrum of any place in the world so about how many high-end think tanks are operating in the US and are they predominantly a conservative Enterprise or a liberal or a progressive Enterprise is it distributed across the political Spectrum it's it's fairly distributed across the political Spectrum although in the last generation or so say the last 25 or 30 years the the proportion of high-end think tanks of which there are maybe a dozen maybe 15 in the country the proportion of them who are on the political right has increased and and I think that's a result of the conservative movement maturing if you will many if not most of these think tanks are based in Washington DC although a couple of them are based elsewhere in New York there are some think tanks on the right including one that I used to to lead that's based in Texas there there's a growing number of state-based groups that are affecting not just their own State policy but also federal policy so well it also may be that that there's been a need for conservative think tanks to emerge because as is well known on statistical grounds rather than merely being a consequence of a conspiracy theory there are virtually no conservatives in Universities at The Faculty level and certainly vanishingly few in the social sciences and the humanities which is where most of the research that pertains to policy would otherwise be conducted and so you could imagine that the establishment of private and Enterprises that are devoted towards research on the conservative side might do something to redress that imbalance and I understand that Heritage Foundation of course certainly plays that role do you think that's also contributing factor to the emergence of the conservative think tanks in the US it's it's huge in in fact not that that my story of of how I became president of the Heritage Foundation is the most important or the most instructive but that example that you just mentioned of Professor who are politically conservative in the social sciences and Humanities being in small number is something I lived out you know in fact when I was in graduate school at the University of Texas not known for its political conservatism out of a few hundred graduate students in history I was the only conservative I was aware of of those of us who were teaching assistant 60 70 of us I absolutely was the only one and so it was no surprise to me when I had my tenear track job at a Southwestern public University that I was the only conservative in fact as would no doubt surprise you in the entire College of Liberal Arts and Sciences there was only one other right of Center Professor I was aware of out of a couple hundred faculty and so the relationship between that fact that reality and the emergence of a growing number of conservative think tanks is very direct because many of us have said forget the the mistreatment which is not an overstatement of conservatives in the social sciences and Humanities and public policy we're just going to go directly or work directly for these public policy organizations especially those that want to work on higher education policy or education policy r large so I'm going to ask you a bit of a Meandering question um it's partly a description of how I became aware of political corruption in the social sciences Enterprise so I train trained as a clinical psychologist and a clinical researcher and that's actually a very different discipline than social psychology and so social psychology is at the intersection let's say of sociology and and psychology um it has to do it focuses on the effect of group affiliation let's say on psychological processes and it's a radically leftist dis subdiscipline and I would say it's quite corrupt and one of the ways I discovered that corruption was by beginning to investigate the technical structure of the belief system that makes up progressivism or left-wing thinking especially leftwing authoritarianism and as I delved into that I learned much to my shock I would say that there was an insistence among social psychologists and then everyone that was influenced by them that there was no such thing is left-wing authoritarianism that authoritarianism in and of itself was only a conservative phenomena and a right-wing phenomena phenomenon and um that and I I really couldn't understand that at all you know because the evidence that there's left-wing authoritarianism to call it compelling is to say almost nothing I mean you could make a very strong case although it's a vicious battle that left-wing authoritarianism has been responsible for more misery and death in the 20th Century than right-wing authoritarianism it's a you know it's a rough contest but when you have someone like Mao on your side on the left it's difficult to defeat him on the brutality scale and you know social psychologists didn't begin to admit that there might be such a thing as leftwing authoritarianism literally till 2016 we did some of the first research in that area so one of the things I'm wondering about is what if you can pull yourself out of your conservative proclivity let's say and your role at least in part as a lobbyist what did you see when you were operating within the university system that indicated the danger of an academic system dominated not only by liberal individualists let's say but even more particularly by so-called progressivists what did you see that doing to dis say you could speak more particularly to history for example sure well I'll I'll start with with an anecdote from the time when I was a young tenure track but still untenured Professor which which and you understand the the vulnerability I had especially given how outspoken I was in this episode but then I will also speak to something that has happened in my field which is early American history but in particular African-American history and and for people who are listening to us I'm decidedly a middle-aged bald white guy which means that I could no longer according to the the powers that be in Academia be a specialist or an expert in African-American history but let me start with the aforementioned anecdote this was uh about roughly 20 years ago I forget the exact year but President Reagan had had recently passed away and my colleagues in the history Department decided now remember as I've mentioned a few minutes ago they're they're all big Libs they decided they were going to host a symposium about Reagan's Legacy and they were going to spend some money to Market this around our campus and you know Prudence probably suggested that I just keep my mouth shut but I just thought while I don't think anyone's perfect Reagan was a great but not a perfect president there simply was not going to be a fair objective assessment of his legacy of as president of the United States and so I I talked to my other conservative friend the other conservative in the College of liberal arts who was an economist and I said well let's go join this panel of four historians and let's offer a a balanced opinion those four other faculty members had no reason to do anything other than proceed with their conversation but because of the uh the scheduled appearance of the two of us as conservatives they canceled it and they canel it because as you know well from your own experience they they can't stand the disagreement and and and frankly although they wouldn't admit it I think they were fearful of the facts that we would bring to the table and and so that if that anecdote is helpful it's helpful in this way that is just emblematic of everything that's wrong with University but in my field what has happened is that someone say today in their early 20s who wants to go to graduate school in history and wants to study americ American Indian history African-American history the history of a particular culture if they themselves are not members of that particular culture they're not even going to be allowed to study it and so I was beginning to see the evidence of that when when I was still in Academia and I saw that in terms of research grants I saw it in terms of class assignments that was given by my history department and and Jordan This was mild I mean it was a kind of thing that was just a mere annoyance but it's now become systematic such that if my own children came to me and said dad you know we want to go study such and such field in history or political science or anthropology barring just a handful of schools in North America I I would have to discourage them from doing that right right right okay so I want to delve into that a little bit too you know so I've spent a lot of time thinking about thinking about its nature and about its relationship to free speech and its relationship to conflict and disagreement so let me lay out some propositions and you tell me what you you think about them okay so the first proposition has to do with why you should think at all now people will avoid thinking because it is difficult right it's it's it's technically complex and demanding and so there's reason right there not to engage in it it's emotionally challenging right because if you already abide by a certain principle and then you go at it even in your own imagination hammer and tongs and you start to shake the foundation then well that exposes you to cognitive entropy and that produces anxiety and that's very well documented in the Neuroscience literature so there's every reason not to question your own presuppositions on the emotional side so it's difficult and it's emotionally demanding and then on the social side if you're thinking with someone which basically means that you're exchanging verbal ideas then there's the possibility of eliciting disagreement and the emotional unpleasantness and possible conflict that goes along with that right as well as the fact that if you expose yourself to someone who thinks differently than you they can challenge your presuppositions and make you anxious and leave you bereft of hope so those are all the reasons you shouldn't think and then you might say well given all those reasons to not think why should you think and the answer to that the best answer to that I've ever seen is implicit in the ideas of Alfred North Whitehead Whitehead said and I think this is true from a biological and evolutionary perspective that we learned to think so that we could allow our inappropriate thoughts or impractical thoughts to die instead of us so you could think of a thought not so much as a description of the world but as a virtual a fragmented virtual Avatar you send it out in an exploratory foray to see if it can withstand any trials and if it can't then you dispense with it now and there's some cost to that the emotional cost and so forth but the advantage is you don't act out the stupid ideas and die and so the I'm I'm laying this out for the listeners and Watchers so that they can understand why CU you might they might be thinking well do you really have to engage in contentious disagreement at the academic level if you're a thinker why can't everyone just get along and the answer is well some ideas are stupid and impractical and it's better to kill those suckers before they make themselves manifest in the world and in order to do that you have to be disagreeable and offensive now no more than necessary you know I've really seen a difference there for example between the North Americans and the the Brits because the Brits at their best their education system teaches them to engage in like blood sport cognitive combat and to do that in a very civilized manner right so that they keep the argument within the domain of rationality and abstraction it doesn't spill over into interpersonal conflict and part of what universities were supposed to do was train people to do that right to think critically to think in a manner that risks disrupting themselves and their interpersonal relationships without that spilling over into actual conflict right and to replace conflict with with thought now we seem to be dispensing with that and interestingly enough so there's a bunch of things I want you to comment on my experience in Academia and in the broader political world has been I have never talked to someone who is conservative once and tried to set them up with a potential combatant and had them refuse to participate or refuse to associate with that person and that has happened to me well trying to set up conversations dozens of times with people on the left I started I saw that starting at about 200 10 at the University of Toronto that's it just sort of crept into the discourse so well so maybe I could get you to comment on the necessity of combating thought but then also I'd be interested in your ideas about why this proclivity to cancel seems to be so manifest on the left you'd expect there to be right-wing you know tightly bound right-wing thinkers who were also inclined to cancel and shun but that hasn't been how it's been manifesting itself at least for the last 15 years well the intellectual combat is essential at at the University level in fact the the the very atmology of the word university it talks about or or or is based on the unification of thought it doesn't mean the unanimity of thought it means that there has been a process in place by the way I agree with you exemplified by British institutions and and British Scholars on the left and right toward whatever capital T truth is and in American institutions especially since the 1940s and accelerating in the 70s that there's basically the absence of that in fact the opposite of that so that if you go and you say that I I want to do intellectual combat you know somehow you're committing some grave sin inside the American Academy but it's essential because that's where we refine our own positions and I I'll just use an example of of what think tanks do just to go back to to that question the think tank at its at its height I would argue is one where of course it's going to have a particular set of positions that it's taking publicly but the process of arriving at those positions inter internally is one where there is as I like to call it here at the Heritage Foundation creative conflict and and am I nearly two years here in almost every meeting that I have with our policy people I asked them well what would the competing the alternative position be and what case would we make for that what evidence would we Marshall for that because first of all we we need to question our assumptions but secondly given that the reason we do research at Heritage is in fact to effect change in public policy we ought to be better prepared for the attacks that will come but the to your second question very related which is why it is that in in on the political left there is this absence of of uh of that kind of conflict I think it's because ultimately the most radical part of leftism is one that undermines truth very actively they've they've sort of lost as as Yates would say in his famous poem they they've lost the center they there's nothing cohering their their mode of thought and if you look at what's going on in the political right something that you've been talking about and researching more in recent years there's a very healthy sometimes kind of fractus debate that's going on about particular policies about the relationship between the individual and the state those can be a little frustrating sometimes in terms of political outcomes but on the intellectual level they are important and they speak to the vitality the intellectual Vitality of the political right right now starting a business can be tough especially knowing how to run your online storefront

analytic study that showed that there was clearly a set of ideas that were associated with one another that you could identify as political correct authoritarianism so it wasn't just some right-wing delusion that that coherent system of ideas existed and then we looked and we did that by asking a very large number of participants a very large number of political questions and then subjecting them to statistical analysis so so that we could see which opinions clumped together and how and so there was a liberal contingent of ideas and a conservative contingent and a authoritarian left-wing contingent and so then we looked at what predicted that and the best predictor was low verbal intelligence and I think the reason for that was that the ba the radical leftists basically offer a unidimensional solution to a very complex problem which is that all human motivation can be uh reduced to power which is technically Incorrect and Preposterous and also an extremely harmful uh what would you call it a harmful um insistence but it's very easy to understand and it does provide for Universal explanatory power and then but we also found that the personality trait agreeableness was also a predictor and agreeableness is associated with compassion and the thing is you know if you engage in the blood sport of critical thinking you do risk hurting other people's feelings right at least in the moment now there might be long-term advantage to that for both players as there often is when you settle a fractious issue say between wife and husband or between family members there's some combat that's required to set things straight but then you get an you get an interlude of Peace afterward it might also be that the the radical leftists are also temperamentally predisposed to avoid conflict because as they do say themselves they prioritize compassion above all in fact they make it a universal virtue let's say and they don't understand the necessity of having to at least however irregularly tolerate periods of emotional discomfort to set things straight so you know I've been trying to puzzle out I mean liberals they don't like borders because they're high in openness they're creative and they're low in orderliness so they don't necessarily find satisfaction in keeping things in their proper place so that's part of the reason they have a hard time drawing borders and distinctions you know so it's why the moderate leftists I think have a hard time contending with the radicals but then there's also this proclivity to prioritize emotional Comfort over everything else even in the moment and that isn't commensurate with healthy debate of the discriminatory kind that has to occur if you're going to refine your ideas you know and then that does expose people in the way that you already said you know if you formulate policy and you don't hash hack the hell out of it in intramural debate within your own institution and you launch those ideas out there in the world they're going to get torn into shreds you bloody well better be Your Own Worst Enemy when you're thinking so that you're well protected against what the actual World social and natural is going to throw at you another reason to think well it it it is and and two two things come to mind at least initially the first is I think as I listened to the last part of what you said in in reference to public policy I think one of the frustrations that Americans presumably Canadians and and and Brits and many people around the world have with politics is the absence of what they perceive to be a real debate right and and this this is true on the political right there's a frustration among Grassroots activists who are conservatives in the United States about the absence of a real debate whether it be about specific policy issues or even about the sort of social economic cultural Di di agnosis of the malaise that has beset the Western World people especially younger voters who have a certain bias increasingly towards center-right politics are looking for those men or women who are candidates for elective office who are at least asking the right questions even if they may themselves decide that they disagree with that person's answer they just want the questions asked and and as we then focus on public policy I don't know how public policy organizations can be prepared for the media that their Scholars do the testimonies say for example that our Scholars at Heritage do without having a just a vibrant internal process of disagreement and I think the key thing to home in on is that disagreement doesn't have to be disagreeable it may and it if it does it may get into the zone of hurting people's feelings but as I've mentioned to more than one student in my teaching career I don't mean this to be offensive but I care a lot less about your feelings than I do about your Pursuit Of Truth your your the intellectual rigor that goes into not just the the particular field that we might be teaching in your case the behavioral sciences and my case history but even more importantly your relationship as a human person as a citizen of the poity in which you live to everyone else to the state itself and and ultimately to sum up here I think one of the problems with radical leftism is that this radical emphasis on the individual creates a radical emphasis on the individual's feelings okay so so let's delve into that a little bit too because the thing is that radical emphasis on the individual is predicated on a very strange acceptance of what constitutes the individual because what you see with the henis radicals is their insistence that their immediate emotional or motivational whim defines their individuality right I want what I want right now and no one has any right to stand in my way now the problem with that is that it's a pretty low order conception of what it means to be an individual it's also extremely immature and I can speak about that technically so the more immature you are the more or you are ruled by motivations that want to attain gratification right now regardless of medium to long-term cost and so actually what happens is that you as you mature and you learn to quote delay gratification which is an oversimplification you learn to subordinate the demands of immediate motivational and emotional states to long-term social harmony and your own long-term well-being and that requires a sacrifice of that immediate gratification so the one of the weird things about the left is that the individual who they make sacran is an individual defined by his or her subjugation to their own honic motivations that's a pretty low order conceptualization of the self right and so I don't I don't see it as a true individuality as all as well and then on the feeling front see one of the things you're trying to do with students at a university is to make their ident their conception of themselves as an individual less dependent on their unconscious aums so you know take take I saw this very frequently I I'll take an example that might not be obvious given the tenor of our conversation I took a very biological approach to psychology in my lectures and it wasn't that uncommon for me to have a very fundamentalist Christian Student student who had been raised in a household that insisted that the theory of evolution was incorrect and that the world was you know relatively new 6,000 years or 4,000 years old and their my insistence on an evolutionary approach especially combined with the fact that I also gave Credence to let's say the judeo-christian tradition was very hard on them and it was partly because their faith and their vision of themselves and their vision of the future was predicated on the assumption that you couldn't have that Faith or that Vision Without accepting a non-evolutionary account of creation and that was where their feelings came into it right because by upsetting that presupposition they be that risk exposing those students they risk exposing themselves to anxiety and hopelessness so it's not feelings per se that at stake it's the automatic and unquestioned assumption that the Integrity of your psychological that your psychological Integrity rests necessarily on the acceptance of certain axioms now when you go to university those axioms are supposed to be questioned now and what that implies is that you help the student replace their self-conceptualization they stop seeing themselves as the static adherent of a set of dogmatic beliefs and they start to see themselves as someone whose stability is partly predicated on their ability to dynamically transform and to learn and to engage so they become more of a dancer than a than a rock let's say and a good University can guide them through that process so they don't identify with those dogmatic ideas to the to the same degree they can detach themselves from the ideas and that also can help them allow the necessary death of their stupid ideas to occur without undue psychological suffering right right and that's the debates you have in seminars and so forth are practice for that right under relatively civilized conditions where the stakes are comparatively low and now we've insisted that everybody become a you know a delicate Snowflake and that you're never to step on anyone's toes and all we're doing as Greg lukinov has demonstrated quite clearly on the clinical front all we're doing is removing the possibility from our students of exposing themselves to the sort of challenges that would actually make them strong we actually making making them weaker more hopeless and more anxious by by protecting them in that manner and and we've been doing that long enough that those hypothetical students although you've you've had real students who who fit that profile as I have have become members of Congress they've become members of United States Senate and so they lead with their feelings they lead journalists sure they lead with with the belief that you can't even ask them a fair but difficult question and that of course is is exacerbating the problems that we see in the political sphere but I I just want to respond to your excellent example of of you leading with Biology in your lectures and encountering a student who who believed that the theory of evolution was incorrect as you may remember I I've LED I founded and then LED another College of faith founded a k through2 school and there because it was a classical great book school and we had our particular Faith dogmas as a Roman Catholic school we made sure that our students were in classes that were questioning those assumptions even about our faith before they went into apologetics so even for someone who is a a very devout member of a particular denominational faith it doesn't mean that we should be hostile to the hard questions about what we believe in fact speaking as someone of Faith who believes in the mysteries of my faith we we we ought to really encourage that and so that's a way of saying that even for those of us who are politically conservative you know perhaps religiously conservative as well that we ought not develop the same hostility to this creative conflict these questions about our the assumptions of our belief that the left of course personifies every day well I think you could make a very strong case that your genuine faith is actually directly proportionate to the degree that you're willing to allow that Faith to undergo the most stringent of challenges I mean if you have to hide away and never be you know called to account for what you presume there's no faith there there's just there's just a blind abandonment of reason and the necessity of hiding from reality in order to keep those axioms intact right I think this is partly why for example there's a powerful bibl bibical injunction in the New Testament to do what you can to even love your enemies which is a hell of a thing to ask you know but if you understand that one of the advantages to adversarial enmity is the refining of your own beliefs then you can also understand how it might be possible if you could manage it to welcome the most Dreadful of challenges in the hope that see I thought about this in terms of you know you remember in the in the Genesis story when Adam and Eve are barred from Paradise God places cherubim at the entry to to paradise and they wield swords that are on fire that turn Every Which Way and I've been thinking about that image it's very dramatic and Powerful image and a strange one and it also begs the question of why God would do such a thing and I think the answer is this is that if the goal is re-entry into something approximating a paradisal state then obviously everything that isn't fit to be there has to be cut away but that also indicates another issue which is that if you confront an adversarial enemy and in their adversarial argumentation they can demonstrate to you where you're weak and unworthy even though that'll be painful because you have to let that go and that might be a lot of you the net consequence could be that what grows as a replacement in consequence is much better for you and for everyone else and it does seem to me that that's an evitable it it follows the same logic in some sense as the necessity for critical thinking itself you know you have to think critically so you can put your ideas to the test and this is also why free speech is so necessary in the same manner you're not good enough thinker to think up all the objections to your idiocy by yourself you have to allow other people to call you out but the net benefit of that in principle and this is what we hoped in universities obviously is that if you exposed yourself enough to the eradication of your stupidity then what would be left would be something much more solid and flexible and dynamic and adapted and sophisticated and beneficial and productive all of that and I think all of that's solid in terms of psychological Doctrine so that's partly why it's so appalling to see the universities take this false compassionate turn and Hyper protect their students instead of you know trying them by fire so to speak it's solid as as psychological Doctrine it's also solid in terms of of Doctrine in in Civil Society right because what happens is that especially with with the Advent and popularity of social media going back to your your principle about thinking at its base eliminating those really kind of dumb thoughts that we have inappropriate things that should never be put into practice people aren't thinking but they're exercising their free speech in a rather messy way on social media and then so ironically to kind of come full circle in our conversation their feelings are hurt because in the absence of their thinking which would eradicate some of their dumbest thoughts they are posting ideas some of them are elected officials at very high offices maybe even the president of the United States or the vice president of the United States and their feelings get hurt because of all of the the the the push back that's created as a result of how dumb their comments are all of this goes back to what's lacking in our secondary schools our elementary schools our universities which is creating not just the habit of thought but creating the physical space I mean literally the classroom where this is practiced and where our our feelings become harder to hurt because we've had a lot more experience mentioning some kind of dumb thoughts and people explaining why they are well we're also in the community there we're also in a community there this is one of the things that's quite different from the online world you know like and and I'll ask you how your think tank is constructed because of this so if you're in a seminar let's say there's the possibility of developing interpersonal relationships so that would be a means of communication and potential friendship that would iterate across time and that broader container that's community-based can help butress you against the fractiousness of momentary disagreement right you can think this used to happen politically too when people actually lived in Washington instead of just sojourning there as say as Congressman you know 40% of congressmen sleep in their offices now so it used to be that you could have a scrap with the guy across the aisle and then go for a beer with him afterwards or meet him on the golf course or you know go play baseball go to a baseball game with with him and his kids and a lot of that's disappeared from Washington the problem partly the problem with the online discourse is there's no community of reciprocal interaction that binds people together at the same time the expression of their random opinions divides them and so I wanted to ask you about that on the think tank front how is the Heritage Foundation actually set up how is it constituted how often do you people meet how do you establish the preconditions for fractious thought while maintaining the social the underlying social community and keeping people United in Vision let's say as they move forward well our first rule to your point about being in person and and being living in community is that any conversation that may have a difference of opinion which at least in our Think Tank would be many has to be in person that we're not going to have that conversation via email we're not going to have that convers ation by phone we're also not going to have that conversation via video conference and because we the purpose of our research isn't just to write a white paper but for that white paper's ideas the ideas of the author to actually take shape and ultimately become law we have to do that work in person it's it's very difficult to advocate for these ideas without being in the office of a member of the house or a member of the Senate so that's how we live out that first rule but the second rule is that as long as the debate doesn't become personal everything is fair game the assumptions the principles the applications of you know what we would call the the permanent things Timeless conservative principles to our particular circumstances and and I will say in the last two years at the Heritage Foundation in part if not in large part because of getting past some of the co nonsense we're really living that out in a vibrant way in fact we often have friends you know whether they're Financial supporters or just supporters of of Another Kind who will visit and and they find it remarkable at the intensity of the debates that we have here while also recognizing the third thing which is that for us culture is everything by that we mean internal culture that is to say that when you walk in the doors here we want this to be the most cheerful place in Washington DC I understand that's a low bar but for us our cheerfulness our Hospitality goes hand in hand very fittingly as you know with our willingness to be engaged in a very intense debate with our friends and colleagues you've heard us talk about how important it can be to have a VPN to protect your online privacy but choosing a VPN you trust is equally as important now we like to do our research on our sponsors and only recommend Brands to our listeners that we believe in we can say with full confidence that expressvpn is the best VPN on the market here's why expressvpn doesn't log your AC AC it online lots of cheap or free vpns make money by selling your data to advertisers but expressvpn doesn't do this they even developed a technology trusted server that makes their VPN servers incapable of storing data at all expressvpn now uses lightwe a new VPN

hour sessions they've been released on YouTube and we did one 8 day session and then we broke for 6 months and did another 8-day session and one of the things we did we brought together nine people and we kind of knew each other but not that well and um there was a wide range of opinions on the panel from moderate left to pretty socially conservative no real Progressive types but certainly people on the moderate left and um we found we we were really attempted to be hospitable to all of our guests so in addition to having the seminar lay itself out for two hours each evening I hosted people continually at an Airbnb that I rented there and we barbecued together and I rented people some jet skis and we had some fun and like each night was a party and at the same time that that was happening I was also while we were walking through Exodus and through other elements of the Old Testament and I was struck by the immense emphasis in those texts on the absolute sacred nature of hospitality right as a duty and I came to understand thinking that through but also watching what was happening with this seminar was that if you're hospit to people and this is partly speaks to the necessity of an actual localized Community then they begin to trust each other at a fundamental level there's a core of consensus and Trust there Mutual regard for Mutual well-being that then enables experimentation to take place at the cognitive fringes in an atmosphere of trust right and humor and so I've really been struck in Washington Washington you know I've been talking to people there people involved with the Presidential Prayer Breakfast and one of the things they've said repeatedly is that the Civil Society in Washington has broken down in the last four decades partly because of virtualized communication so people don't have to be present partly because under n Gingrich there was incentives for congressmen to spend more time in their district and less time in Washington which might have had some benefits but also helped under the Washington Society because of the difficulty in having congressmen bring their entire families to Washington for what can be a relatively brief career right they have to disrupt the career of their spouse for example and so one of the thing and so many of them as I said don't even have apartments in Washington now they don't make friendships or establish social relationships even with the people in their own party much less talking across the aisle to Republicans for example if they're Democrats so that so okay so now you said at the Heritage Foundation that you have fostered an atmosphere you know you said it with a bit with a bit of irony um because it's a low Bar in Washington but that it's a very cheerful Enterprise and so what do you think you've done right to Foster that atmosphere the atmosphere that enables robust debate to occur without it degenerating into ill will well the most important thing is that we our our mission which is focused on revitalizing self-governance in this country and across the world is very unifying and motivating and so the people who want to work at Heritage are people who are are animated by that and in our selection process of how we hire someone whether at the junior level or the senior level is not just about philosophical or political alignment but it's as much about cultural alignment that is to say a lot of the interview process is focused on how this potential colleague is going to to fit into our process of creative conflict and and that creative conflict as we've discussed being something that never swerves into the personal and is so focused on on the ideas and and our love for the ideas but I also want to mention that that's very much related to your excellent and accurate point about the the sort of demise of Washington Society I mean I've heard from so many long-term members of the Senate so many long-term members of the house and these are stalwart conservatives who don't wake up each day looking to compromise with the left they say that they and their spouses have seen a a huge deterioration in even members of the Republican Party spending time together now as you said there are certain benefits to that you know being home in your District or your state but there are also benefits to the people who do the good work in Washington DC and there are some to having community and and I'll just give you an example example that is uh that's self-critical when I first got here about 2 years ago I was always talking about DC being a terrible place to live and no doubt there are parts of DC that are but at the same time sometimes in the same paragraph I was encouraging relatively young conservatives to join our presidential transition project which we call Project 2025 and one of them mustered the courage after one of these talks to come up and say Kevin you know those two things don't go hand inand if you want people to leave their communities their Hometown you know their their lives if they as they have established them wherever home is and come to DC and in your words tithe two or four or eight years to the next conservative Administration maybe Heritage needs to spend some time helping to revitalize that Society helping to revitalize that community and that was a really good constructive criticism that we've taken to heart because of the culture that we have here at Heritage yeah well well it it points to a broader problem too I would say on the conservative side practically and philosophically I mean there are plenty of reasons for conservatives for example to engage in the kind of dialogue that we've been engaging in in this conversation for example to uh level substantive criticisms at the universities as institutions and of course we've taken the odd Sid shot at the Washington establishment let's say in the political process per se and that's very problem atic on the conservative side because the progressive Mantra is that all institutions are so corrupt they should be demolished and replaced and to the degree that conservatives engage in incautious Social critique it seems to me that we play they play we play to the degree that I'm a conservative into the hands of those very progressives right and there BS another question too is but you know you're it's a matter of of drawing lines always a matter of drawing lines where and and how to include and exclude now you want to produce a culture that's hospitable and unified but that's also capable of fractious debate and you said that precludes for example hiring people who are of the progressive left how that how in the world do you think you manage to determine when it is that someone has ideas that are sufficiently different and novel so that they can add to the utility of the fraces debate but not so disruptive and novel that they violate the tenants of the community and that would allow if you answer that that would also allow you to expound on the central ideals of the Heritage Foundation you said revitalizing self-governance is part of the Heritage Mission and I assume that the people you hire have to accept the validity of the central message at least right there's got to be some core Axiom that unites everyone but how do you differentiate well how do you solve that conundrum and what do you think what is the Central Access around which the entire Heritage Foundation rotates let's say what are you guys aiming at and why yeah great question especially as it relates to hiring people which we've been doing a lot of over the last last couple years because of growth the the focus of of Heritage in terms of policy is that we need a much more limited federal government and and not just because limited government is an end unto itself but because it is a symptom of flourishing by individuals who are living in community who are also of course enjoying greater self-governance but in terms of specific policy that we're looking for there's the typical list that people would expect that if you're going to have a more limited government you're going to have a fairer and Taxation system that's probably lower states are probably going to have more author to make decisions that are closer to the people they're governing there's a certain belief on the foreign policy side that America should be strong although in the Heritage View that strength needs to be more restrained and less expensive and less adventuresome than the the neocons of of the last generation we're arguing for and we also believe to speak about not surprisingly to you the policy I care most deeply about in education that every dollar that Americans spend on government funded schools should follow every child to the school of his or her parents Choice that's just a a brief smattering of the specific policy issues but they all if you think about it speak to the preeminence of the individual in his or her community working at the local level and eventually the state level having great authority over the federal government and so ultimately to to be succinct about this the Heritage Foundation exists to devolve power from Washington back to the States and ultimately back to the people themselves now if you pause and think about that there's room for a lot of differences of opinion at least at the very least differences in priority right and so to your question about people coming in uh job applicants coming in there's going to be some difference of opinion but what we're looking for is the the absence of a disagreement on some of the core principles and now I'll speak to I'll speak to them uh probably the best the the the best summary of these in addition to to Heritage products would be the historian Russell Kirk's great essay on the 10 principles of conservatism which emphasize things like continuity prudence and change Community if if if someone's wanting to work at the Heritage Foundation and they don't understand or appreciate those or they don't have a concern about what I think is the greatest problem in in America today which is fatherlessness the deterior ation of the family and that if we if we fail to address those on the social and cultural and maybe even policy fronts that we're everything else we're working on is almost mooded then there's going to be a philosophical misalignment but there's also still even within that uh that set of of positions that we have opportunity for great differences we have some economists here who are going to say that as it relates to the so-called family policy public policy Arena that the only thing that we need to do is to make sure that we're ending the disincentives to marriage and family formation and American tax law there are others of us who might more uh commonly be called social conservatives who say there may be a role for the state whether it's the federal government or a state government as the nation of Hungary and nation of Israel have done to actually proactively Aid marriage and family formation for for the sake of saving Society all of that to say because we're a think tank in the interviews with policy people or perspective policy people we have these conversations and it has become in the last several years in conservative public policy pretty easy to far it out when someone's not completely on the reservation if you will and and perhaps the most common conundrum that we have just to give a a precise example would be on the nature of the free market for so many years I mean my entire upbringing uh to be conservative was to believe that the free market was some sort of alter that in fact free market belief was tantamount to being conservative and while the free market is a good free market is a symptom of a healthy Society Healthy Families good public policy it isn't the end unto itself and so I mention that example because it's the most common conversation that we have internally when we're interviewing po Cal policy uh colleagues but also when we're having conversations internally about how to help the American political right navigate this reality that so many leaders of the so-called free market aren't even in the free market themselves the most leaders of Fortune 500 companies actually hate conservatives and hate conservatism the Heritage Foundation is I would like to think leading the way and beginning to resolve that conflict okay well I have a bunch of questions about that so the first comment in question I suppose is one on the Strategic front so I think the conservative mve movement has weakened its argument for the decentralization of Power by aligning that argument too closely with libertarian neocon and free market principles because it often devolves into a like a a a proclamation that a government that's too large is too dangerous which I do believe but that's not the crucial issue as far as I'm concerned that if the government was smaller the tax burden would be less if the tax burden would be less that would be better because people should be economically free and they should be economically free because well the free because the society functions better when the free market is as untraveled as possible and so it's kind of a in some ways it's an an a Rand philosophy of you know rugged individualism conjoined with libertarian admiration for the free market now there are some problems with that one you pointed to and we'll get back to that later I think when we discuss neoconservatism one is that the free market itself is probably not the only basis for an equitable and just and moral polity it's not the thing that's at the bottom and I think that's where the libertarian types have it wrong and I think there are are good reasons for that but more importantly the there's a better reason to discuss the necessity of devolving power down the hierarchy to lower levels the first thing I would say is it's not power when we shouldn't use that language because that's the language the leftists use it's meaning and responsibility and those things are aligned and so what happens and I've really found this idea striking a chord with audiences that I've talked around the world is that if you deprive people of local responsibility you deprive them of all the meaning in their life because the meaning in their life is actually a consequence of taking responsibility for themselves taking responsibility for their marriage for their family for their local community for their business enterprises for their town for their state for their country in that order right and then maybe to God and responsibility obtains at every one of those levels that's the sub subsidiarity idea of course but the purpose for that is that if you devolve that responsibility down the hierarchy you re-instill the meaning in people's lives the meaning that sustains them through catastrophe and so because you got to ask you know well why why should the typical young person listen to a conservative who says well you should take more local responsibility because it sounds like a lot of work a lot of Duty and something that's not particularly hedonically gratifying but if the answer is well if you forgo that responsibility you have nothing to sustain you when you suffer and you forego the possibility of formulating the extremely tight and reciprocal social interactions that buttress you through life and you deprive your life of intrinsic meaning then that seems like a very bad idea for you and I found is very striking everywhere I've gone to talk if I make that connection between responsibility and meaning the audiences fall completely silent it always happens because no one see we haven't had a good discussion about the relationship between meaning and responsibility in in the West for like 60 years right since the mid-60s it's been a long time it's been a very long time people assume that there's no meaning outside of a kind of a narrow Hedonism or that there's no meaning at all and that and that's a very dismal that's a very dismal set of propositions and it is a weak place in the Progressive Enterprise because sustaining meaning is found in responsibility and really in self-sacrifice or at least the sacrifice of the narrow self now this this insistence that you your Enterprise has on this subsidiary vision is that grounded at least in part in Catholic Social Doctrine because that principle of subsid it is okay you want can you elaborate on that a bit sure and the Heritage foundation's non- sectarian but we're animated by the judeo-christian intellectual tradition and as as we discussed earlier in reference to education I'm Roman Catholic but the the the effect of subsidiarity on heritage's mission of course long predates me we've been around 50 years and it's just because it's it's a vital part of our Western intellectual tradition as as you explained so well and I think it's it's an excellent way given the conversations on the political right right now to talk about the issues we're discussing here about meaning and responsibility it's related very much to something that has become more common parlance in conservative circles which is to say that the reason we want a more limited government isn't because of some uh doctrin belief that the free market is always better than government that's not the case it's because there is an inherent dignity that comes from work or are put more broadly there's a dignity that comes from responsibility and therefore we have greater meaning it's no surprise to me that you've gotten that wonderful response in all of those talks when you when you emphasize those points because people not only know that that's true just intuitively right naturally the second thing to come back to my my constructive criticism of of free marketis conservatives myself included years ago have done a very poor job of taking advantage of that great vulnerability of the political left that you identified which is this very issue because our response to that for 20 or 25 years was well the free market will take care of it pull yourself up from your bootstraps read read on Rand it's all going to be okay just work a little bit harder well in reality that isn't true in the first place but this is really key it's especially not been true since the mid 1960s with the illn named war on poverty because what that has done is actually a eradicate for two generations of Americans the meaning and responsibility that every human person should have therefore in order for just to kind of swerve into the sidewalk level as I like to say if conservatives are going to succeed in safety net reform and so-called welfare reform we first have to get better at talking about the limitations of the free market and the necessity of conservative principles conservative political Dogma to be associated with our long tradition of living in community which actually has a longer history in conservatism than even free market principles we talk about pre-born a lot on our shows here at the daily wire we believe in their mission and we know you do too who wouldn't want to help mothers and their children in crisis pre-born is reaching into the hearts of women by allowing them to hear the hearts of their babies and introducing them to their precious lives it's a Divine connection that doubles as a baby B chance at life everyday pre-born network of clinics rescues 200 babies lives but it doesn't stop there your gift of $28 for a free ultrasound goes directly to Women in Need and pre-born doesn't take any of that money they independently fundrais for their team to continue to make a difference they offer mothers maternity clothes doctor's visits and the help they need all gifts are tax deductible and will go directly towards saving babies lives to donate just dial pound 250 and say the key word baby that's pound 250 baby or donate securely at preborn docomo that's pre-born docomo well that also points to a place where social conservatism and the more free market end of conservatism the libertarian end could be unified right so okay so let's let's concentrate on responsibility for a moment so I'm going to speak about that psychologically so someone young might be thinking well why should I bear up under the load of additional responsibility and I would say well if you responsibility is going to be a challenge it means you have to determine that you are going to lift something that you haven't yet lifted and then you might say well why should I do that and the answer is something like so you get stronger and better and so if you decide to take responsibility for yourself then you put yourself through the paces that will dis you enough so that all your idiocy and bad habits all the ones that interfere with your ability to take care of yourself disappear now often students do that to some degree when they go off to University because they have to learn how to live independently right which is a big part of what university does and that burns off the remaining childhood idsy that they've carried with them right that dependence on their parents and maybe the dependence over dependence on their initial peer group so they have to mature and the whole the utility of taking on responsibility is that you confront yourself with necessity in a manner that forces beneficial change you know and you might say well why does it have to be forced and the answer is well you know we don't know how much situational privation and necessity has to be there to motivate people to develop now you could take on just exactly the right amount of responsibility you know so it would feel like the challenge was optimized right but that also that optimized challenge is also what puts you in the zone of proximal development and forces you to expand your horizons and so you adopt responsibility you can care for yourself then you can care for other people better but that also does genuinely make you a better person in that your domain of competent action expands in precise proportion to the amount of responsibility that you've been willing to undertake voluntarily right and it's not surprising that that's associated with meaning so the conservatives can sell the leftists can sell rights rights rights which is what they've been doing forever and the hedonic self gratification that goes along with that but the right can sell the deep and abiding meaning that comes with the hoisting of voluntary responsibility and that is that's not a free market argument right it is not free market is a consequence of that exactly the free market isn't going to work and this is where the social conservatives have an edge too and I think this is becoming increasingly obvious in the absence of that underlying ethos of responsibility responsible conduct you can't have a free market because people have to be able to trust each other before the free market can even get going and you can't trust your responsible people that's the precise rub and and and I will tell you that any any uh leader in a public policy organization has certain things that he or she does every day every single day either directly or indirectly I'm dealing with that tension on the political right because part of what what heritage tries to do beyond the the research and advocacy that we do is is also play at this plane where you and I are having this conversation on the the intellectual level and and when we do that what we're arguing for is is I like to say an unhyphenated conservatism we're we're we're all of those things but when you're all of those things you're not trying to be you know something to to everybody we're talking to our audience on the political right it means that you're also going to be aware of the limitations of some of the things that are Goods like the free market the free market is good but there are many higher goods and and as we've talked about chronologically speaking which is which is what I try to do almost every day in reminding more free market oriented friends on the right is you have to have that healthy Society you have to have as I often like to put it healthy families you you have to have this this moral system in place to even give birth to the free market it was the the monks of salaka in the 1200s who first came up with this concept and even Adam Smith himself I think would be very very comfortable in this this exchange that you and I are having about the lack of privacy of the free market as it relates to human Goods yeah well that's a matter of putting everything in its proper place right that's and and it is an open question how far down the hierarchy of axiomatic Primacy the free market rests but yeah and the more libertarian types they're going to say it's right at the bottom and Ein Rand is a good exampler of that right for her the free market is the god out of which all other Goods emerge but I think the Adam Smith conceptualization the classic British liberal conceptualization for that matter is much more accurate which is that once you have a society that's essentially predicated on the judeo Christian axioms one of those being responsible self-sacrifice and the trust that emerges from that then you can instantiate a free market and it can serve a it can serve a governing function but it can't exist see I think the same thing is actually true of science this is something I want to talk to Richard Dawkins about because I don't think the scientific Enterprise itself the scientific Enterprises predicated on the idea that the cosmic order is good that we can investigate it that we can understand it and that if we do that that will be good those are all axioms of faith in my estimation and they're also specifically judeo-christian axioms there's a bunch of axioms of faith that are embedded in the judeo-christian tradition that are also presuppositions of the free market like fairness in weights and measure and and honesty in mutual exchange right because like the free marketers have a hard time dealing with a simple question like if I can screw you over and make money doing it why shouldn't I that's it's an IR Rand principle right self-interest is the most important thing and and the other thing just to introduce this to this wonderful exchange that is so true about the free market in the 2020s is that what what most Americans think of when they think of the free market right now rest it's it's it it almost requires collusion with what heritage would call big government right and so what what I try to do all of us at Heritage try to do when we're talking about the best aspects of the free market is to place the emphasis not on those companies that are they're actually seeking regulatory favoritism actively by agencies in DC don't put the emphasis on them instead put the emphasis on small businesses on entrepreneurs in America who actually are the ones creating the jobs they're much more in line with this proper understanding of where the free market Falls in that list of of of axioms for the conservative Dogma yeah well one of the places that the left and the right the more socially conservative classical subsidiarity right could be aligned and I see this emerging in people like Russell Brand and Joe Rogan right is that there's every reason to be Su skeptical of towers of Babel rather corporate or govern or government yeah well the thing is is that once something gets so large that it can capture the environment in which it's supposed to thrive then it presents a danger and it doesn't matter whether it's a corporation or a government and that means that all of us left and right alike like the the lefties are always saying oh my God big corporations and you know looking at the behavior of the pharmaceutical companies for example over the last 20 years you can have some sympathy for their perspective and then the Libertarians say oh my God big government and neither of them seem to notice that the unifying horror there is Big right it's out of control big and the danger of regulatory capture and you know one of the things we're trying to puzzle through I started this organization I'm involved in the origin of this organization called The Alliance for responsible citizenship and we're trying to work through these issues of subsidiarity but also expressing great concern about corporate gigantism and fascist collusion at the highest levels of the what of the hierarchical Enterprise right and the true fascism I would say and so how have you at the Heritage Foundation grappled with this issue of the danger of regulatory capture like what what policies do you think should be in put in place I mean like in on on the YouTube front for example I mean it's one Corporation now that controls the primary communication Network for 7 billion people and in the main they've done a pretty damn good job but YouTube's got a bit heavy-handed on the censorship front as has Facebook you know colluding with the Biden Administration as has come out in recent weeks how do you guys grapple with the problem of emergent gigantism say within a free market framework how do you conceptualize the solutions to that problem well three things come to mind the the first is and and I don't mean this to be just sort of academic Think Tank speak it's it's really important on the on the political right for us to be doing this as a first step because of this 30 40 year long held position that the free market equates to conservatism and that is to remind people that regulatory capture is a result of soall quote unquote free market leaders going to government and asking for favorable treatment the second thing which is more substantial in terms of of what we do on a day-to-day basis is through our project 2025 roughly speaking it's a a presidential transition project where we're coming up with the policies including deregulatory policies for the next conservative Administration but it's also one and this is vital that as important as the policy is we're recruiting 20,000 people to go into the next conservative Administration and if that happens then you're going to see across the board from the Department of energy to the Department of Education which we've written the plan to completely destroy we we need that eliminated by the end of this decade to completely starting from scratch with the FBI what this public policy organization the Heritage Foundation does isn't just talk about those things and we don't just come up with the plans we're actually recruiting the men and women who will put that in place hopefully as soon as 2025 but the third sort of kill shot if you will the that that one bullet that will be really helpful to ending regulatory capture is schedule F reform it's the civil service reform that will give the next president of the United States power to fire the bureaucrats who are part of the problem but if that's all you do and you don't take the first step which is to explain on quote unquote our side you know the sort of business free market side that we have to call out those businesses that are asking for this kind of of treatment then we're not going to solve the problem okay so I have two questions that arise from that um one is on the presidential candidate front VI gramas Swami has made comments about uh the destructuring of the so-called managerial deep state that are akin to the proposals that seem akin to the proposals that you're putting forward part of Trump's attractiveness was his promise to do that so let's leave that aside for a moment I want to return to Rand and Rand for a minute I've just been rereading out the shrug which I do uh oddly enough about every 15 years years and I figured out one of the core problems with her Doctrine it might be the core problem so she assumes that self-interest is the appropriate governing principle but she never really defines what constitutes self-interest and that's a big problem so because you can have narrowly hedonic self-interest and Rand actually wanders into that territory because her protagonists RoR and dagy tager and so forth do have and express quite continually their right to do whatever the hell they want whenever the hell they want to and that they should be guided by no other principle in some sense than the gratification of their own desires but that's exactly what the hedonists on the left say and so this begs the question of what constitutes the individual whose self-interest is at stake and where ran makes a mistake is she doesn't understand that there's a set of constraints that operate on what constitutes individual self-interest interest so you're you don't exist just right now you exist out say decades into the future and in an attenuated form in your descendants and what that implies is that every action you undertake right now has to be bound by the necessity of not betraying that sequence of future selves and I don't think there's any difference in a game theory from a game theory perspective of the collective that is you across time and other people so I think that enlightened self-interest and social interest are exactly the same thing and I don't think that Rand understood that right is that she seems to believe that there's this internal self which is the part that's self-interested that's almost like the internal self the radical leftists insist upon being able to establish such things as gender self-identification right that's 100% autonomous and unmowed that can operate itself as a autonomous governing principle it's almost like a deity and it's a it's the same it's the conservative version of the same mistake that the radicals on the Progressive side are making I think that's exactly right in fact you talked about you yourself rereading Atlas Shrug I do that with about the same frequency and the last time I did three or four or five years ago it's because I had a a junior colleague at the policy organization I was leading prior to being at Heritage who was a capital O objectivist and and I thought well let me let me reread Rand and see if I'm missing anything and be a good colleague a good Mentor and I realized this actually sort of come full circle rereading Atlas Shrug four or five years ago ironically is what made me realize my own deficiencies in thought about the free market and a couple of other shilas of of the right which is to say that so many very thoughtful men and women who are devotees of Rand make the mistake that she's making and they haven't thought through the consequences of that as it relates for example to regulatory capture and so the exciting thing this is all very troubling on kind of on an intellectual level but the exciting thing is that we're finally having these conversations on the political right and the exciting thing for us at Heritage often referred to as a legacy organization is that I wouldn't say we're necessarily driving those conversations but we're very active participants in them and that is to the extent that we've got credibility with people on the center right in America it's it is L we're lending that credibility to that conversation which must happen in order to achieve the public policy ideas that we've had for a few decades well the way that Rand Maneuvers around the complexity of those questions say with regards to regulatory capture is that she attributes to her protagonists a kind of a vague nobility of character right so that it's distasteful for roor and tager for example to engage in any plaintive negotiations with government agencies right it's beneath them to ask for favors from government but she never establishes why it's beneath them right it's vaguely associated in principle with their self interest and their implicit heroism but it's very difficult to derive that heroism from that narrow self-interest and I think the reason it's difficult to do that is because it doesn't derive from that narrow self-interest it derives from the necessity of a higher order self-interest that has the community as an intrinsic part of itself and she's very weak on that front right because her characters taggard is a good example and so is work Works in a very unhappy marriage and dagy taggard is single those people aren't Bound by like they're all Noble individual Heroes who stand alone they're not well situated in happy marriages they're not as couples well situated in functional families and she's almost rouso she's almost rousan in that regard she seems to regard any form of higher order social involvement as an impediment to the Noel Noble strivings of the disaggregated individual and so it's very strange to see that dovetail with the more radical ideas of the progressive left that's definitely a flaw in her thinking right both both from the perspective of characterization but also from the perspective of Ethics it's that narrow self-interest that's not the that's not the highest self that's not the true self it's just the immature and impulsive self and she tries to make that Noble and it's not Noble it's just immature so that's exact I think that's why her I think that's why her work never hits it's like Rand is not dovi right there's a shallowness about her work that's I like reading it it's exciting it's adventurous it's a romantic adventure you know and it's got a strong hero narrative element but it's definitely not literature and I think the reason for that is that her characterizations are too they're too simplified you won't be expecting this reference I'm sure but I grew up reading Louis LaMore books you know written in the 20th century but they were 20th century versions of the of the western dime novels of the late 1800s GRE read them as a boy and every time I guess I've read atas Shug three or four or five times I don't mean to be too offensive toward Rand followers but we've established that feelings are okay to hurt um the her characters are just as flat as the great heroes in Louis LaMore novels who showed up in these Western towns and they were rugged individuals right and there as a as a 10 or 11year old boy those were good things to read in the same way that there's a certain value to reading rand's work but it's not literature it's certainly not dovi and in the in the Great Book schools that I've LED Rand had no part of the curriculum and and I'll just make this final point if I may on on this thread the way this plays out in conservative politics and by that I mean not elected officials but to some extent the donor class but these are these are thoughtful men and women most of whom have made their their own wealth themselves is that they think that those characters from Atlas Shrug are the model but in reality I mean almost without exception as I think about these men and women in their own lives they are living out that higher order thinking or set of values far better than Ran's own characters in other words they themselves these devotees of Rand personify the limitations of the book uh it's it can be hard to explain that to them because they're they're so committed to this mode of thought but the the point is the more of those devotees of Rand who come to grips with those limitations the quicker the American political right will be able to resolve this conundrum we have about the community and about the free market yeah well I I think I think that your characterization of Ran's books as sophisticated Cowboy stories is exactly dead on because first of all she was attracted to that rugged American individualism not least because she was an escape from communist hell and so she had a reason to Hero worship that that pattern of rugged individualism and it is associated in a genuine sense with the with the Great American Dream which is a real phenomenon and and something to be reckoned with but but but the fact that her characters and and some of her characters they're almost literal Cowboys I mean in in in Atlas Shrugged I can't remember the gentleman's name but Wyatt that's his name he's even got a cowboy name Wyatt he runs a sequence of oil R oil rigs and oil Explorations in the in the frontier State of California right and he's definitely a cowboy in every sense of the word and and so are the rest of her male characters and so um you can also understand that that admiration for rugged individualism has a place if the rugged individuals are already nested inside like a stable couple and a stable family and a stable community and so forth if all those preconditions are met then you should go out on your individual Adventure but if none of them are met if you're that sort of cowboy you're almost indistinguishable from a psychopath and so yeah so that's a big problem it's the same problem on the free market side right the free market doesn't work unless it's embedded in an underlying ethos and that rugged individualism doesn't work unless for exactly the same reasons unless the underlying pre preconditions of stabilization already in place and it's very much related to to the the excellent point you made about meaning and responsibility right because part of that responsibility you know part of of of Freedom properly understood not in a in a randian way is the the moral duty that's conferred that that for those of us who emphasize the natural law over you know what the left liks to talk about rights that moral duty is to the community it's to the other as much as it is to our ourselves and those those two things more often than not can actually not be intention they can they can be resolved and exist harmoniously and it's it's in that Gap just to be kind of simplistic here where properly ordered government a properly limited government exists as I like to tell people the Heritage Foundation is a conservative not a Libertarian public policy organization we see a very proper role for government and and we look forward to getting it back into that box well I would say mature identity is the balance between the interests of the individual and the interests of the extended individual and the collective that Harmony that Harmony as well is what people mean when they say sanity like sanity isn't something you carry around within you sanity is the harmonious balance between your interests and the interests of you in the longterm and other people it's actually the manifestation of that balance you know and I'm going to say something in favor of ran too because there are elements of her thought that are subtle you know so if you say that the individual has an obligation to the community then that obligation can be twisted and bent by people who will use moral guilt as a cudgel and she does a nice job of outlining that so she tells a story for example of a of a factory that decided to run on the principle of to each according to his need and from each according to his ability and she shows how that and that that was foisted upon the workers right so the so she shows how that immediately degenerates into a competition of victimization and slavery to that self-described victimization but she fails to make a distinction between me being burdened by force with the needs of other people and me taking on the responsibility as a voluntary choice to address the needs of other people and so that would be the difference between being a slave let's say and having a family I mean you're both working for in both situations you're working for someone else the good of your children let's say but in the case of a well constituted family you're doing that voluntarily and that makes all the difference it makes all the physiological difference too because a a burden undertaken voluntarily is much less stressful physiologically than the same burden foisted upon you involuntarily the data on that are very clear so she does a nice job of insisting that whatever responsibility is undertaken has to be undertaken voluntarily but that's also the same as that call to responsibility that we were discussing earlier she makes a she makes a a great reminder about that and and I think again to kind of swerve into what we do every day or every week at the Heritage Foundation what we try to do is acknowledge these tensions in in in our movement a broad intellectual movement resolve them in a way that allows people to have the creative conflict But ultimately we're not just having those conversations right we're trying to to do that to resolve those tensions so that we can develop popular support for Public Policy Solutions and and and I would be remiss if I were not to say that rather than just being headquartered and supported here in the Imperial City of DC we're distinctive if not unique among public policy organizations on the right because of how we're supported which is hundreds of thousands of people across the country I say that not at all to make a fundraising pitch but to explain that we are as I like to say the everyday Americans Outpost and so it's I mean it's highly highly improbable that the Heritage Foundation would be captured by these these excesses of the nation's capital I I I mentioned that in reference to what you said about Rand because I think she herself would appreciate that greatly about how we work even though we obviously have some some points of contention with with uh some of her her key points yeah well that was actually another thing I was going to hassle you about maybe I'll do that to close I mean there are clearly dangers and and I'll talk to you about this more I think on The Daily wire side of this conversation there are clearly dangers posed to educational institutions and other institutions as a consequence of taking Federal money government money and I think that that proclivity for universities to accept Federal money has now finally corrupted the scientific Enterprise itself and because it's it's gone downhill in quite a catastrophic manner in the last 10 years um I know that you've had quals to say the least about accepting government money but then the same accusation can be levied let's say against conservative think tanks who derive their funding from gigantic corporations how do you avoid becoming an instrument of the same regulatory capture that you that you protest against now you just said quite clearly but I think it's worth reiterating tell me your funding model and and how Heritage has protected itself against capture let's say by the by the Giants of the corporate world well in in two ways the first is from the very beginning Heritage was funded primarily by small donors uh we have a membership model and the the average donation given to Heritage each year is I think $82 as it was in 2022 we do have some individuals who make larger contributions that obviously but we receive very little I mean a miniscule amount of corporate money that's always been the case but it's especially true over the last few years as Heritage has sharpened its criticism of regulatory capture so the that inoculates us uh you the the membership model that we have but also the explicit position we have not to receive corporate money from most businesses we we receive a little bit of that but it it's tiny and of course this is coming from me because when I was at Wyoming Catholic College we like Hillsdale and a few other schools decided that the Department of Education could keep its money we didn't want to be captured by their idea so in other words Heritage has always had this philosophy but I've underscored it because of my hostility to that entire system okay so two two closing questions the first is how has heritage managed to fund itself successfully given its unwillingness to rely either on government or corporate money I mean that's a lot of sources of money go on how have you appealed to Ordinary People let's say and why has that worked and and along with that maybe you could explain to everyone what they would have to do in order to learn more about how the Heritage Foundation operates and to participate in that if they or at least to learn more if they if they chose to chose to do so thanks for asking those questions on on the first one we have been one of the few organizations on the right that has has perfected a particular model of most importantly the work that we do in DC it's it's not for our sake it's not for the sake of the researchers the policy leads but we really see ourselves as the advocacy Organization for the everyday American and when we're able to report successes in that realm which we've been able to do a lot and convey that to individual Americans through direct mail and all the means that organizations use to raise money it's been extremely successful for us over many many years the second way is or the answer to your second question is you can go to our website heritage.org there you will see most importantly the research we do also we're very good or we've become better at giving individual Americans talking points sort of messaging that's linked to that that research because we don't just want them to read the research we want them to be part of the solution right we're not just here ourselves to do the work and then ask them to support financially what we're doing a vital part of our business model and it speaks to the success that we've had is having individual Americans participate in what we do such that 10 years ago we founded we created our own kind of campaign arm Heritage action for America which gives our Enterprise the ability to do more direct lobbying more involvement in particular campaigns most importantly it also is is the kind of currency that elected officials understand which is the ability to as is the parliament in our work key vote a particular vote on a particular piece of legislation yay or nay and hold those elected officials accountable they don't like it but between the research that we have the hundreds of thousands of supporters we have and the power of that scorecard that we keep we've become very influential in DC as I like to say we're sort of the the people's Advocate Behind Enemy Lines okay okay well let I'll close with a question on that front then um there are a number of candidates for president on the Republican side I'm have no doubt that your organization is watching that completely surreal race intensely are there particular candidates or how are you working with candidates so that your plan to to restructure the corporate deep State or the government deep State dovet tales with their campaign offers is that happen happening formally does it happen informally where do you see an alignment of interests or a conflict of interests for that matter great question it happens both formally and informally formally because of our tax designation from the IRS we can't endorse in in a political race and so we don't but that doesn't mean that we don't have any influence over it and the influence that we try to have over it I think we are is in ideas and policy and so I mentioned a couple of times earlier this project 2025 the the policies and and and Personnel for the next Administration we have shared those policies with all of the major conservative aspirants and for that matter a couple of candidates left of center including RFK because we are ultimately nonpartisan in our Tex designation the informal part of that is we provide policy briefings to any c candidate who accepts our invitation for that we've made that invitation across the political Spectrum this year I personally have have done the briefing for a handful of the I guess more likely nominees for the Republican nomination there are a few candidates who are probably misaligned with Heritage but those who are highest ranking in the polls are those we're closest to I will say this the most important thing for the Heritage Foundation and our members as it relates to 2024 is not just that the most Conservative candidate who can win the general election becomes our standard Bearer it's that he or she even before they take the oath of office on January 20th 25 is ready to govern in the most aggressive ambitious audacious way to destroy the Deep State and devolve power back to the individual Americans that's a good place to bring this to a close so for everyone who's watching and listening thank you as always for your time
