this is kind of you know how we have done panels in the past and it of course will be a bit chaotic um for the audience there is a q a panel where you please ask your questions that's my preferred source of questions which i will address to to the audience which is now here online and there's also a chat which i will react to if there is no questions um andre has and this is like a new thing this evening that um his kid needs to go somewhere or he needs to needs to get them from somewhere um so if andre needs to needs to leave and drops out that's okay um and so if you have any questions about andrea's talk we might you know want to to do that now um he said yeah if there are no questions i have a question i've been dying to ask andre since your 2019 cpp con keynotes um i guess it really talks to the the different levels that you've talked about and where you kind of hit it right out of the park so it was the moment when you played a joke with the live transcriber person when you ran down and faked that kate had told you off and that really you had meant to say shed load instead of shitload um and i thought oh i never went to say that you never meant to say that and then your next slide was a picture of a shed which kind of gave the game away that it was this phenomenally intricated intricate um very very subtle very clever and that was the point at which i realized just how far there was to go in terms of being a keynote speaker can you tell us anything about the behind the scenes or i mean i did afterwards have a point with the transcriber and she actually showed me what she saw what she heard and you even she's i think she said he's playing with with me right isn't he it was just such a magical moment i guess my question is can you reveal anything about the behind the scenes and and how you finessed it so well i only spoke with kate so kate was part of it the transcriber was not and uh i was very happy that she took it so much in stride and tweeted about it and everything so um that was luck so the transcript the the transgender part was was luck and um i always think of uh you know kind of just to generalize this a bit i think um it's very important to have a strong opening um i was alluding to these uh these studies about um the first 30 seconds and it's just amazing like you know people like you know when they say oh you know he gave me the look or she gave me the look or you know somebody gave me the look or whatever like the game like this uh clear information there's an interest or you know some romantic sort of some uh friendship or respect or whatever that doesn't come after like half an hour no it comes after half a minute so because within the first like seconds of getting to know someone in any in any capacity there's a there's a very strong um impression forming and that's gonna just last uh and if you if you manage to do to um do something like really like engaging within those uh initial seconds that's um that's very so i have another talking which i'm not sure you so you've seen that i put like a slide with like very complicated assembler on the on the like my first slide is like just a weird assembler code like oh what does this do it's a famous algorithm and it's like random assembler like doesn't do anything at all of any interest to anyone but it's just like people like oh what the hell what is that is that sorting is that what what's happening there you know so uh you gotta capture people's uh interest in some way um that's gonna be uh they're gonna feel engaged and i gotta be here because this interesting stuff is going on so i'm glad you enjoyed that the shed load thing that was fun now i remember i also wanted to ask andrea a question um so when when i prepared my lightning talk for today i've noticed that of course i you know due to time limits i pulled one that i already had and i updated it and i noticed it's five years old and things have changed thanks to the pandemic and uh speaking now is so much about being online and suddenly all the subtle things you can do on stage are taken away from you so what are your thoughts about speaking online oh huge topic so first of all i just wanted to give you props for uh the laser thing because like a big thing that people don't real many speakers don't realize it so that's a huge one um i got this um um i'm gonna peddle a product i'm sorry i got this logitech presentation whatever whatever which puts like a spotlight on the actual screen so you still install it like as a device driver and it kind of takes over your computer and kind of whatever sense uh information about you to rush or i don't know but essentially it puts the spot on your screen and uh it allows you to highlight and have the highlight present in the video transmit you you got that right awesome so i think that's that's a very important uh point so there's a big um shift when you talk online so i've i've been doing a bit of it and uh i took inspiration from jimmy kimmel the comedian like jimmy kimmel the comedian the guy with the late night whatever show i'm not sure jens like or europeans would know that he's a kind of a guy in america who does his talk shows at night and one time he hosted the oscars so during the like the height of the pandemic in 2020 he hosted the oscars and then he does an interview with him how did you do it because it was weird to just be there kind of being kind of uh engaging and entertaining and whatever online in front of nobody literally right so he said i put in my mind that i'm a radio talk show host and that changed everything for me and you know since then i decided to do the same for for my own talks when whenever i do this i'm imagining i'm talking like there may be an audience of like you know one ten a million people but there there's absolutely no direct contact with them right now so i get to talk and i get to make an impression on them it's up to me but it's all kind of it's an indirect way of communication and that works miracles for it for your mindset um online um another thing is i notice there's a lot of fatigue that builds in both the speaker and the audience and i'm seeing nods among the other speakers so i presume this is a kind of a common thing it's just like you know like i'm i'm sitting and at the end of my tongue my feet are tired i have no idea why it's like i've been running a semi-marathon right it's just crazy uh for some reason the way psychology works is it's very tiring to do these things online um and uh what else i'm gonna redirect this because i'm sure other people have their tidbits of experience as well chandler it's your it's your answer right now because i know you have a few thoughts uh sure i i don't like speaking online i miss i miss the the in-person stuff um but you know i think i think some of the things that really helped me was getting a really good camera um actually paying attention to how cameras work how how the lighting is going to work one thing that i also really like is trying to think about uh the the camera box right and so uh i like to talk with my hands see me give a talk on a stage like i'm moving around all the time i'm gesturing how do i make gestures that are actually visible because like usually i gesture down here where you can't see my hands it's like now i have to have them up by my face but also not like in front which is just that doesn't help and so trying to think about that uh the other thing that uh is works really great for things like panels is a standing desk so that you can like move around stand up like you don't get quite as fatigued but you know these kinds of things i think a lot about um it's still not my favorite though personally i like i like i like a stage one of the things people don't think about i think is is when you when you have a stage and you're giving a talk on a stage sure it's a stage there's a lot of pressure it adds a lot of stress but you get to get off of the stage at the end of your talk and like no one pays attention to how relaxing it is to step down off the stage and you're not on a stage anymore and you're just like hanging out with people whereas here you don't have that there isn't you don't get to step off of your stage you're always like you've got this camera drilling into you and so you're always on it doesn't it doesn't have the same kind of gear shift effect uh and so so in some ways that's the thing i miss the most i just did two live conferences one in april and one in may after saying i wouldn't do online talks anymore and then i found that that re-energized me enough that i agreed to do an online talk i find online talks way more draining than in person ones and you don't get the same energy back from them but maybe if we like live in a hybrid world now it'll it'll be okay we can alternate between them as long as i get my dopamine once in a while yeah i think it's fine if you know but for for a lot of speakers this will be the new normal right this is that's just how the world is now and so you're not all going to be able to to speak on stage on a conference anymore because that's just how things now work with the pandemic and i see that there's a raised hand by claire yeah so that's just reminded me um so it's only beginning of 2019 when i started speaking at c plus plus conferences i had something uh approval test library i was contributing to and we didn't have any documentation so i decided to write a talk to learn how to use it basically what i hadn't accounted for was just how much energy you get from people in the audience and there were a few people that i'd met before mainly through include c plus plus i didn't necessarily know them but they sat in the front row and they smiled at me and they made eye contact and they nodded and if they didn't understand something they frowned and it was just gold dust it gave me energy it gave me feedback and that's what i really really miss from online talks and so if you're a new speaker and you haven't had the opportunity to speak in person it might be really frightening the thought of it but it turns out that in practice we it genuinely is a friendly community chat to a few people in the breaks before your talk and things like that and you'll find this massive massive well of support in front of you and really really helping you out so it's worth making eye contact with the audience not just to see if people have got any questions but for that energy and support and kindness that you'll get back and it will really really help you out okay and let me look at the audience questions um so there's a long way from a freshly born idea to a perfectly practiced ready talk i'd like to hear from you what is the best moment on that path to submit the talk if ever there was a it depends it's that question um i i have a talk that i haven't been able to give yet i literally sat up in bed at four in the morning grabbed my laptop and opened powerpoint because i could not sleep until i just got some of this out of me and that was probably the best moment actually on the journey of that talk because it's really hard to turn it into a talk i can i can give but i have to give it somewhere someday um all the way to the far end of the extreme when i did the what do we mean when we say nothing at all where i was not sure it was a talk until i came off stage after giving it at cppcon um okay yeah it is a talk good that was landing with people i'm not i'm not making this up it's that that is a real useful thing to have talked about for an hour okay good because actually lately all my talks i feel that way like maybe everyone knows this or maybe it's no one knows it not even me um every step of that journey though should be fun really um you should you should like it it's work but it's also fun it's what we do okay just an aside i i i quoted your talk today that specific talk today just like few hours ago so so yes it was definitely a very good talk um so so when i i i want to kind of answer that question while simultaneously sort of answering also hannah's question so so they're kind of related it's it's sort of like how how do you pick what to talk about kind of thing and and and when and i think sometimes you kind of have to leave answering that question to somebody else you have like maybe you have several ideas or you don't know what's interesting so so one of the ways you can do that is you can ask somebody like these are two things i want to talk about what do you think is interesting especially people who know the audience like the people who tend to go to this thing like you you need to figure out what is interesting to them but in the end you might just say i'm going to submit two talks to this conference and they have to choose you might want to tell them that you only want to do one other than two or you might end up in an issue where where you get like i i think psy got four talks accepted and seemed to be gone so but but but you don't have to make that decision yourself you can actually give that decision to somebody else yes that's that's why i have the voting and i i have speakers actually ask me like what talk do you want for your conference i'm like this like you said just one like one thing you really have to be careful about and something i learned during the pandemic is not to trust the speakers because they're usually biased uh crowd and um if you think you know the audience of a conference that's a huge trap to fall into and that's that's why i went from having an um program committee where basically the same guys every year look at the talks and think what's interesting uh to them i asked kind of the audience to to do the selection or do a pre-selection and then we can still you know do some fine-tuning because we would like to have the talk from patricia kate or andre on the conference even if some some people submit really so i think that the action question was like what what is the best moment and i think the best moment for me is always when i have submitted the talk because that's for me the beginning of the journey um have in mind that there is not the speaker submitting a talk and they're like okay talk has done that submit it's the other way around we submit ideas and then start of working on on the talk to to which which we envisioned and sometimes our motivation is to you know oh we want to learn that and then the pressure is to to get the talk ready and we learn that and then we are able to present it and there's very very very very many other reasons but yeah i i would agree with the room here so i usually submit talks on an idea level so i have a title i have an abstract i talked with two or three friends about and then i just submitted and i usually like also these voting in conference these days so if people choose one of my i don't know two or three ideas and then i will work it out in the one month to the conference that's usually the best way for me so of course i could work out three full talks before i submit it but i think it's better to have just more ideas and then have the people choose what will be presented in the end and work only work on that i have i have another pro tip that i remembered now so my first year uh when i was speaking i i submitted talks to four conferences and then i thought i had to give like a new talk at every conference so so i submitted four different talks to four different conferences and they all got accepted and and and so don't do that you can do the same talk again it's fine just like the the audiences are often like totally different and if somebody by chance have seen your talk it's often multiple tracks it's fine they'll go see something else so so because you i'm like optimistically for me and i and i've been hearing this from lots of speakers like it might i will spend about an hour per minute of talk at least and that's probably maybe twice that so so you have to you have to to to ration your time if you're going to spend two weeks full-time job making a talk you don't want to do that like seven or eight times throughout the year because you're gonna struggle having to do your like day job so so so you can reuse your talk you can also change it up like refresh it but but it's fine to do the same type talk multiple times uh so be be careful i i would like to um i have i would like to respond uh actually to that as well i just that's how i ended up doing two talks of uh an hour and a half in cpp now for being there the first time this year which is very stressful but that was awesome that was really fun um but i just want to address the previous topic on uh speaking online so it's not it's sort of a meta comment it's not a direct uh answer to the question but i've noticed by uh i mean since i'm also involved in organizing our meetup group that uh speaking online is is really helpful for new speakers which is awesome i mean i would be i mean i i gave my first talk in 2019 i would probably be very happy to give it online instead of in front of an audience because for a new speaker i think it can be a great you know a half step towards uh giving a talk and and that's an awesome thing so i personally i try to use this online platform to encourage people that usually wouldn't have the courage to to go on stage so so that's an awesome upside yeah i think that's also a point i i probably want to make i got slightly annoyed at uh one moment last year at meeting embedded because there was a speaker we had with a special speaker but i heard a dark bark in the background i was like ah but then then i suddenly make click in my head and i was like wait a minute this is this is the speaker from africa and i just heard a dog bark in africa and this is what you know what we would never get to otherwise when without having those online events because there are so many people who are not able to to travel to anywhere and get get their talks approved because maybe they're not that proficient in english and that will you know not get you promoted by the by the committee and otherwise like that they don't think that traveling that far is an option for them or other people so i think that the whole speaking online uh thing is new and it will find its ways um but it's also a huge chance to to include folks which are either you know not able to to get a visa to to travel be it i mean even like you know you could have a person speak remote from the the city where you're in because they don't want to go to to the conference for health reasons or maybe they cannot because they have kids or any any other reason um it just opens a whole new door for us to hear new voices and that's actually really awesome um i agree that's why i really i really work hard to keep our meetup also at least partially online and i agree it's really it's really a great opportunity [Music] for me one uh unsolved question remains a little bit so beyond speaking online how do we get people motivated to participate more in an online setting so a lot of conferences have like really cool environments like gather town or other things where you can walk around and talk to people but only a few people use it actively and if you are like in a personal conference there's much more exchange and talking to people and this has gone away a little bit in the online setting and i i don't know if we have found a way yet to motivate people more in an online setting to interact with one another i hate gabaton i i don't like playing conference online that's why i did not choose gather town last year even if they had the offer of uh you know book your conference date with us and you get a 70 discount trust me that was the best offer in town you would not be able to get anything cheaper than gather town last year um but what what i wanted to have is like a website where the conference is on where people can click on and yeah part of the online experience is that people are less less online and also speakers are less accessible but that's why i think that like purely going online will this other thing will happen which will be happening we will return to onsite conferences um but on the other hand um i i run a user group which is only online and always will stay online and we have one format which is some of you already saw that the lounge and there we have an event called tool fair and if you like if you've written a book have a tool or have a project and just want to host a table for an evening come host the table and people just join your table and have a conversation and yeah so we had a guy present the book kate co-wrote with them um i've seen some other book authors come i had some companies go there and we also have a job fair if you're looking for a job that's also kind of working out and i'm looking for other formats or kind of other things to do there i've been thinking about uh presenting proposals there in that format just having various tables with proposals but i wouldn't need proposal outsource to kind of volunteer for that such an evening so that's probably something which we did which we do in the future um i wanted to uh uh make two brief comments one one i definitely think that we're headed towards both not all online not all virtual but just a lot of both um but other thing just going back to something that involved mentioned about people who who and actually something andre mentioned has talked about being confident uh something i just want people to realize that i i can't speak with the other speakers here but i hope folks realize that like i'm terrified when i'm presenting like like like completely terrified uh like and and even getting ready to present like like kate says you should enjoy every minute of it i kate i applaud you do every minute leading up to a talk for me is is like grueling and and awful and and it's stressful but i think a lot of people have this impression that it's like easy once you've like done a bunch of talks and if you're good at it it's like oh yeah it's just no big deal it is a big deal and like it is all fake every every indication of confidence when talking is a hundred percent fake at least from my part and i mention this for two reasons one don't feel bad if you don't have high confidence that's actually normal and two you can fake it and you should and like that's not a bug that's a feature right i just it's really immoral i'll take that into their heads it's totally morally it's okay to fake it's there's nothing wrong about it it's like totally fine just fake it even if you don't make it just fake it one of the things i've been doing a lot lately is to challenge the oh i threw these slides together on the plane narrative you know um along with the demo where the speaker says out loud with their mouth why don't we try this out uh let's see i think i'll make a rectangle here like like they're just thinking of it on the fly and it's a lie they always make a rectangle every time they do that demo every time i have literally stood in the back of the room with the 17-page demo script making sure the speaker isn't going off target when they were a new speaker in a corporate situation and i know exactly what they're going to do but they're pretending that they're making it up and i think we do everyone a disservice when we do that like i practice my stuff everyone who talked about demos and talks all said you gotta practice we're like somehow leave the impression with newbies that like when you're a natural you can just get up and yabber for an hour and a half and hit your time exactly and all your demos work but you made it up that morning no it is work i i have i have a thing that i used in the beginning and it's easier for me to talk now than the first few times it i was like so so there is like yeah i'm still like destroyed like before like i can't watch other talks or i i do watch other talks but like there's like a whole section of my brain that just can't concentrate until i'm done um so so and and when i'm done i you can't talk to me because my brain is there's like nothing there it's like static it's like i'm i'm i have no brain anymore uh but but i had a trick on on like getting over the nervousness uh when i'm on stage and it's very simple i i'm a nerd so if i talk about something that i find interesting i forget about the whole thing and i get like all excited about it but it doesn't help it doesn't help with the beginning and so so that's where i i'm still failing like the andre test because i i'm like i don't know i don't know my name i don't know how to say hello i'm like there's like a 30 sec the the the magic 30 seconds it doesn't work and then i'm also like the last part it's like hanging up i don't know how to hang up either so i'm bad at the k thing you know so it's like but the middle part if you're really excited about the thing or you find it really interesting you can kind of forget that you're on stage and you're just getting really excited about the thing and and i use that to to kind of bridge that terribleness and and today it's easier than be previously but but it's a it's a tip that i used a lot so talk about something and i think who who was it that said that i mean maybe it was tina who said talk about something you're excited about because that makes it easier awesome the the flip side of that is don't do mercenary talks i like you know i i spoke to a speaker once and he's you know he was advocating some technology and he said you know he told me like in confidence i just hate that technology is like terrible and of course the talk wasn't that great because you know and he would he would be the first to admit don't do mercenary talks if you're excited about something just do it otherwise just declining it's okay to decline an invitation it's totally fine to have nothing i have no you know subject good i don't have anything oh and by the way so uh in relation to um uh was that um the first speaker right so she said you know don't find things all right so if you this is interesting phenomena if it starts sounding completely trivial to you it means you have the competence you know like you know like if you like when you go like in grad school or like you know projects in another grad school i you know whenever i have something interesting and look into it a lot it becomes like oh everybody knows this because i know so much about it so that's a good sign that you know i know so much but actually it may be trivial actually that's a good sign that you have accumulated a bunch of expertise in that particular thing i i just want to say i have le i've yet learned to say no during my career i don't know if that's like for you know talks or organizing stuff or whatever i i think it brought me to a good place but i might i might need to learn i saw your talks you're far you're far from falling into that extreme of giving like mercenary talks you're not you're not there by any means so don't worry about it like you know there's absolutely no reason that that's a good time to say that andre have gave me my um andrea and kate uh and john uh i think yeah um i i got my first time speaker workshop from them so thank you it was awesome it was really inspiring and kate you're still glad kate and andre are you still oh it was awesome you're still people that i inspired to be able to to speak as so at some point thank you you know i think all speakers want to help other people become speakers you know i think we all would love to have like a little line of ducklings behind us um i remember pushing someone to do a talk and watching him chandler mentioned coming down off the stage walking those three steps and he had this look on his face which i knew it was like i didn't die it wasn't awful i think they liked it oh he is hooked he is one of us now you know that moment as you come down those steps and it was okay you keep coming back for more of that and we all want to help other people join that club and you do not have to focus very hard before we will drown you in help to join that club and it's like amway multi-level marketing everybody wants to you know inspire others to do the same and i think you don't have to be like the most confident and extrovert person in the world to do it yeah so i'm buff by far not a confident person and i enjoy giving talks and i also come to enjoy talks where things go off script in the middle yeah so you prepare and you prepared you think you have everything written out very well but there will always be like 20 people in the room who are way smarter than you and spot mistakes and start discussing discussions and that can also be a lot of fun and this can also be a very good talk if somebody points out that something is very wrong what you what you just talked about and i enjoyed these talks as well so i think confidence yeah can be a thing for some people but for me it's like i have an idea i love i want to talk about it if someone knows more about that or corrects me and this becomes a big discussion also a fun talk i just had a bit of a flashback to a series of articles that fred tango wrote um a couple of years ago and i've posted a link in reply to andre's question in the q a and i've also posted it in the main chat as well i haven't managed to find a link to just before i found a search that shows them in various different ways but a very very good series of articles highly recommended so i i have to hendrix's uh thing so i'm so people don't believe this about me but but people who know me very well know that i'm extremely socially awkward and and and but the thing is when you're on stage it's not a dialogue so so a lot of the the socially awkwardness of a personal interaction where you have to figure out what to say when a person said something and have like the appropriate pause or know when to talk and all of those things or you don't have to you have and and if you get really nervous like especially in the beginning where i i i got a lot very nervous i forget what i wanted to say and and so a lot of people comment on my slides i have lots of pictures and stuff but i'm also very dyslectic and and when i get nervous my dyslexic is really bad and so i can actually get to the point where i can't read uh when i'm very nervous and so the reason why i have like all of the pictures and stuff is because i look at the pictures and then i remember what i was going to say here so if i don't have to read the text i can just look at it and go like oh yes this is this is the part where i do say the thing and and if i lose my way i use the slides to remember where it was and so so so i kind of use it as like a crutch and but at the same time it became like a thing where people remember my size because of all the pictures but the pictures were initially for me to not get lost or or when i get lost to find my way again and so try to figure out like what you need to do that and and even if you're socially awkward in the social situation you might still be able to do a talk because it's not a social situation you know the other thing claire talked about how audiences are kind and andre talked about it's your stage and they assume you know what you're doing the pauses patricia in deconstructing privilege are amazingly great and i came up and i remember i told you this after talk i'm like that's some of the best silence i've ever seen and you're like i was trying to get my composure back so i could keep talking but that's not how it comes to the audience to the audience it comes like let that sink in you think about what i just said this is important inside your brain it's apparently very different but that i i was i was i was i was i was so close to to crying and so every time i had the pause with me just taking a breath so i wouldn't cry because i hate crying in front of people so so so all of the pauses was because that that was a really really scary talk to do and a talk i never really wanted to do and the only reason why i did it was just because i didn't want somebody else to do it so in that way though the pauses were accurate right because what they signaled was this is a super emotional moment sit in this yes and they were so powerful it worked yeah yeah but i didn't i didn't experience it that way and that's also that like like that's one of the things that might is i think andre's mentioned like watch videos of your talk because if you especially if you wait a while so you don't remember what it like it's not that close you wait like a few months and then you watch the video then the way it looks is is is totally totally different than how it felt and so so one of the things i would say it to to not say how you feel like don't say i'm really nervous right now because probably people can't tell those it's like so don't say how you feel even though you feel it's like super obvious like everybody can tell because most likely they can't and so so just just continue and just no matter how you feel because how it looks afterwards for some reason is totally different than how it felt doing it i i totally agree and i'm i'm always i i don't watch my talks a lot because it's it's hard but i'm always really surprised that it wasn't a disaster and and just one more thing that i wanted to say i always envy the audience that i can actually read code because when i when i give talks i mean i totally relate with what patricia have said it's so hard to focus and and yeah and like with the stress and everything it's so hard to read yeah that segues into a point uh that um um like patricia brought up with you know her dyslexic dyslexia reaction and kind of gets worse during during a talk you know they say the camera adds 10 pounds for me that's like 20 but that's a different topic so um it's not only that but the camera decreases your iq by 25 it's like it's really you're acting in an inaugurated state you're you're you're partially like incapable of thinking i remember during one one talk i had to convert like from meters to feet i couldn't do it i just you know that's like what's 14 times six in the middle of a talk a speaker they can't do it they just can't do it right you're in a state of impairment so you gotta account for that so you know uh it's it's really a state of high stress and and uh impairment and very difficult to keep your wits together doing it's a good thing your pa the past you have created the slides to help you with that exactly so the slides are good oh look at cats slides are a good uh you know um hansel and gretel the breadcrumbs to kind of remind you of where you go and where you are and when you were supposed to go you know yeah i think that's that's good advice to not do math on stream or in a talk like you know i was just mulling over what kate said earlier about there are lots of speakers who are keen to help other speakers get going and um [Music] you may not know this but a number of conferences have a support mechanism especially for new speakers but not just for new speakers so they will invite you to send any proposal in before the deadline and then people can give you feedback and help you improve the proposal and it turns out that's a fantastic way to get feedback to even start speaking and then i mean i first took advantage of it for cppcon so i think that was my third conference talk i had one person who was kind of my mentor and it made a huge difference just from sharing slides and just a little bit of online conversation just that perspective from someone who wasn't really close to what i was talking about and then as a bonus it was someone that i recognized when i went to the conference it was another person to talk to as well so you know if you're thinking about speaking and you don't have colleagues or friends who can give you a hand then maybe look for a conference that provides that sort of service and thank you to those experienced speakers who do give their time to help other speakers out it's really appreciated so i i i was uh i was also thinking about the question from from yan uh i don't know how to say your last name i'm going to go with norwegian pronunciations it's going to be bought um because uh uh jan asks and because there's a there's a we're kind of we're not speaking in one message we're kind of saying things that contradict each other and and and so so andre is it has spoke about this in his talk that make sure that you know what you're going like the material or the area really really well um and then i think tina said you know you can challenge yourself and try to talk about something you don't know very well and as you're doing the talk you're gonna get into the material and and and and i'll even like make it worse and make like a third perspective and that is that you as an individual can can um make a twist on on something that somebody else might know better than you so so so so like andre said there might be somebody in the audience that know knows this specific topic better than you but you might have a unique perspective so so maybe you have experience with this thing in a specific context and and that makes that that that rendering of that idea unique to you and so so it doesn't have to be that you have to be the the world expert or except for andre andre also always has to be the world expert so so i i'm sorry but you are like you're on a pedestal it's far far down you can only disappoint basically but for the rest of us portals it's it's you can you can bring your own personal twist on something that is is unique to you and and that's that that makes it special and that makes you the expert because you're you and so nobody else is you uh so so that's that's a kind of a way i don't know to balance it or make it worse but to those perspectives so i'll try and actually blur like actually bridge the gap here some i think that that one of the key things here is uh to andre's point you do have to like develop a certain level of just competence to carry a talk forward but the key thing to realize is that doesn't actually have to be the like the confidence you had when you started the talk has to be the confidence you have when you give the talk and you can always scope down or narrow your talk so that you can kind of be be sure that you've gotten the competence for your talk you don't have to have that level of competence for everything around your talk right uh and so so what patricia said right like pick your idea your key insight and then you're going to be a super competent speaker on that insight because it's yours own that steer into that so that you're even more competent by being closer aligned to your unique insight right because the the the greater the gap you can you can get there the the the greater your kind of competence covers the subject of your talk the better you can give that talk but you don't have to do it by like only talking about really simple stuff or like you know waiting until you feel like you've got the wizard hat or whatever whatever like no no no no you don't have to do that you can just pick the topic and and then it fits right and then it all comes together and it's still going to be super valuable to everyone else awesome i i just went to two talks that were how we did blah that person is a total expert on that they may not have done blah correctly but their talk was accurate they came and told us how they did the thing and you will meet that bar fact who knows more one one thing that that is a danger uh if you are a very um you're an expert in a topic is that and i think andre also mentioned that or or someone mentioned that uh that you think that everybody else knows what you know and and so when you are that super expert in something you can easily make a talk that nobody understands because nobody is at that level so you're totally talking over everybody's heads so so that is so that is the danger of being like super expert in your topic you you you kind of have to run it by other people so that so that they can ask you the questions i don't understand this but what is this word or they have to to give you that feedback because you you can't really relate really well to the level that you need to be at to communicate the topic and so so so that's that's all there's also a danger that way kind of i have to run away replies a bit oh it's so you all are so awesome this has been great fun uh uh but like keep exciting and it's great seeing you so i think like when we're talking about this topic i always have in mind like what role you have to fill and i think that it's extreme you always should know that it's okay to say on stage that you don't know okay because somebody will ask you a question you don't know and trying to explain something on stage you are not sure about is really um bad but on the other hand like i i agree with what was andre said but on the other hand um android probably is also giving talks with the expectation that he is the expert and that he answered has to answer every question and i remember like talking to scott myers and he's like uh oh everyone thinks that i'm the expert and that they that i know like all my books and all the standard and that that all that knowledge came from me but in truth i i know who to ask about something and all of that is like a big big network of people behind me and i'm the guy who writes it down and has questions and asks people or sometimes you know and so don't don't be afraid of admitting that you don't know something or that that that is not your area of expertise um [Music] and on the other hand um when you're preparing a talk you you you look up a lot of things and you get more confident and you should reach of course uh the level of confidence to confidence to present your slides of course um so that there's a particular truth in there um um i'll relate that yes um is there gonna be a recording of this very panel and the talks that we had uh yes i got a couple of questions okay i'm recording um this panel which is a bit experimental because i've never recorded this this tool this setting so um i will see what the recording looks like how it sounds and i probably then uh do some editing and record uh do like you know that and put it on youtube later so i i need to take off now um thank you very much everybody for thank you for coming awesome this was really really really nice i mean i hated my my own talk but i loved everybody else's so thank you to talk about andre now he's gone i was i was going to say this with him here so um i attended his training that uh kate was also one of the trainers on at cppcon in 2019 and it was really very very worthwhile um i possibly made the mistake of buying a ticket because i really wanted to do it and then finding out that speakers if there was space were able to attend free but it was i was it was okay i'm glad i spent the money but it really stuck with me andrew's comment about uh something like if somebody asks you a question and the answer is i don't know then maybe you haven't succeeded and yeah referring back to earlier comments about his level of expertise but from my perspective some of the best things i've learned about topics that i've talked about has been questions that people have asked and i haven't known the answer and sometimes someone else in the audience will chime up chime in and other times somebody watches the video and lets me know and those insights it was actually worth spending all the time writing a talk on a topic i was interested in anyway for the extra things that i didn't even know that i didn't know but i learned about them directly sometimes over the following few years very occasionally i'll get a comment because of a video on youtube so i really really strongly think that it's very okay to be asked an interesting kind question that's a genuine one not a point scoring one because you can you can gain so much from it and and sometimes you can just ask the audience so so so so if somebody asks you a question and you go i i'm not sure about the answer is there someone here and especially at the people's boss audience that audience there it's like there's probably the person who wrote the paper on that and they're probably here or you know so somebody who reviewed the paper so so so and then when somebody said oh this is the answer and then you just repeat the answer and then you look smart it's like it's like yes this person over here said the answer and now i said it on youtube so now i sounds fine i was i was in a talk i think it was cppcon but it could have been the predecessor going native and someone asked a question the speaker didn't know and laptops started flipping open there were multiple people who had the standard on their laptops in the room yeah got the answer and then like you say the speaker repeated it but i'm just thinking look how many people have the standard on their laptop i have found my people so there is a story which i only heard because i did not attend that talk and that was prior to when c plus personal was the boostcon and they had a guy present on the c plus bus exception model and this guy was you know had prepared his talk and got so confident that he would now tell the experts what's wrong with that and so he started his talk but there's like the the tradition of debating during a talk at cpsc and boostcon and um what is this name um one of the founders of boost was in the audience which is also the the main author and kind of the the brain behind this exception model which by the way is right and so this evolved into this this guy being lectured by the author why the things she has no no it wasn't her but it was um herb is not connected to boost by the way um no one also knows scott um not being indoors no no no no um i'm bad with names he works for sean now dave abrahams right dave abrams dave abrams has been known to to debate people and talks and um to to be quite knowledgeable about the standard and so this guy uh came to basically the conference from dave and gave a talk about uh what's what's wrong with the thing that we have on the standard which was like debated forever probably also on the standard so um he had from the moment he started basically the whole room against him and he didn't realize and he was so overconfident that he submitted the talk prepared came there and i don't even know if it's published but i i heard as well as like legendary that uh there wasn't just just a debate about this and um so if if if you're building up confidence also try to to you know not lose the grounding and uh make sure that actually what you're confident about us is right i i have uh not not so that bad but one one thing that i i i i've seen uh is is if you uh people who go and say i'm going to do a talk about programming language for ex-programmers and so you're doing that at the ex-programmers conference and and then you tell them you spend a large part of your talk talking about how terrible their programming language is so i've seen this done multiple times and so it it it has as ended up in in one specific piece of advice is don't insult your audience uh and because these people are they they chose to come to your talk they are and have now dedicated you know 60 minutes or 90 minutes of their life to sit and listen to you talk you know be nice to them and that and and being nice to them also extends be beyond like don't don't don't don't insult them but also you know be nice to them but also try not to waste their time they they they it's very hard for them to leave like in a virtual conference it's easier but in a physical conference you kind of made the decision to sit in this role and you're kind of trapped here now so so make sure that you you you understand that all of these people have all together dedicated like weeks of time combined to to listen to what you have to say and and and try to to respect um to respect that we do have a question about you more which i think is interesting what would be some pointers on using humor during the talk some speakers like andrei insert many jokes during the talk tony fun aired even made a whole talk in reverse but at the same time it feels risky and easy to go wrong and just not hit the right key so i guess i can't talk about an example here be specific but be really really mindful of the code of conduct with any humor avoid visual humor that could be offensive could make people feel uncomfortable [Music] just don't do it you can't know other people's lives and experiences and what might seem like an innocent joke to you about you know some historical thing or something like that may have a real you know might kind of be a visceral pounding in the chest to someone who has a bad life experience or a different cultural background so be sensitive if you really think your joke is funny try it out on other people um [Music] and if i could go back in time in the situation that i'm thinking of i actually would have asked a question at the end to try and raise awareness of that particular speaker about trying to think about the impact that they would have on other people by what some of the audience thought was a very funny talk so sorry that may not be the answer that you want but that's quite a strong memory for me i i think you're totally right claire i i just i just had this situation in it a week ago um where someone used a really offensive analogy uh they were talking about a particular technique being given to a particular set of programmers and they said it was like giving a razor blade to a baby that's like there is nothing good about this analogy like first of all you called those programmers babies you made us all imagine something gross what's wrong with you you didn't like this wasn't even needed you just happened to throw that out as an aside while you were discussing the history of the feature right the people who do it well they do it so gently um i don't think it's a coincidence that tony's so good at it and he's canadian canadians are famous for being able to be funny without being cruel or at least you don't think we're being cruel at the time um in case of doubt don't if you're like hmm this joke is kind of borderline should i go with it no i don't have to hear the joke no that's my advice yeah andre andre has talked about like having his one of the things that inspires him is stand-up comedians but again andre is like over in the showmanship kind of of category of speakers and and for me i'm not funny if i'm funny it's not planned like it's an accident and and and and but i do i'm very like a part of my culture is is self-deprecating humor so so if i i i do like joke about things i i will do that constantly i will joke about myself uh because it's it's not a personality trait it's a cultural trait but but it means it happens all the time but it's it's not intentional i never i never have intentional jokes that i might like because of andre i i went to the training ad that claire talked about as well uh with with andre and with kate and and andre had like a big focus on the like the beginning which i find very hard and one of the things that he talked about is having some kind of story or something to start with and and and and so you can have a story make it kind of personal do something and then you could have like some kind of funny thing but i would say even self-deprecating humor can hit other people if they relate to you in that aspect right so so it and but at the same time it's it's super hard to like when you're on stage you get your brain doesn't work properly and you will do and say things that you you are going to cringe over later and or just listening to yourself like sometimes i listen to uh like if i'm gonna do a talk again i will listen to myself having done a path in the past and and half of the time i'm shaking my head going like patricia stop it no stop no laughing no you said it again you did the thing don't do the thing it's it's even if i know it i will still do it again because i'm nervous and it just comes out so yeah i i would say it's hard to be intentionally funny unless you're you're like you have that stand up comedy thing in you and and come on with almost no stand-up comedy is funny anymore it basically is about like kicking somebody else uh so so be careful about like humor especially when you start speaking because if someone like andrei uses a joke on stage he can be very sure that he nails it but imagine trying to tell a joke and you know starting to laugh before you're done with a joke or not not getting the intonation right and suddenly the the sort of thing it gets like really weird and it will also like draw you off from from your your speaking mode and there's so many things that can go wrong even if the joke fits you can go for like a visual joke when you might want to make a point like there's some comics on the web which like really resonate maybe with the topic you have like i i had this talk about burnout and i wanted to communicate that i'm not a doctor and there's this funny sign from the simpsons doctor uh where they're like basically you know um and i was like this is kind of my generation simpsons they understand it it's not a real doctor and the sign says if i kill you you don't pay and i was like this kind of resonates for me this is this slide so like i'm giving this talk but please understand this is not like the 100 the advice from a doctor so if you find yourself in this talk and then please um understand that you might want to see a doctor and get professional advice and that is not the intention of the talk to give you professional advice and on the other hand of course it's um with keynotes i think if a keynote speaker doesn't offend like someone in the room they didn't do their job well because they try to do everyone like you know everyone okay but that's not what a keynote should be but on the other hand they should not insult anyone so doing doing doing a joke on stage um the other thing i've been watching in the last decade is especially with i don't want to say boomers but this was older speakers they often have a different kind of humor than the younger part of our audience and also that is true for younger speakers which might not have the confidence to tell a joke on stage but they might you know just have the confidence to do it and then it's a joke which is funny for their peer group but everyone else is like more like and i think that's the the worst part which can happen is you tell the funny joke and no one laughs is a christian asked around like how do you know kind of what is offensive and not offensive and and you don't like you are a person we are raised in cultures that have all sorts of bias and and nastiness and we've been steeped in that stuff since we were born so we are all full of bias and and weirdness and and jokes we laughed at 10 years ago that we don't laugh at anymore we all have issues to deal with so so the only thing we can do is when someone tells you that thing that you said that that hurt me and to to take that to heart and say oh wow and and learn and and try to do better and and not become like defensive and blah blah and you know just just and believe people when they tell you that that it hurt them and and then just try to grow and it's it's painful and it's hard and and and then you watch maybe or read something that you've done in the past or at three o'clock in the morning you remember that thing that you said to somebody 20 years ago and and it's it's but it is a process where where people and and the only way we're going to grow is acknowledge our mistakes and try to do better because if not we're just going to end up being the same person same ignorant person for the rest of our lives so so so the only we have to kind of live in the discomfort of of trying to unlearn stuff that we've had pushed into us since we were we were babies i completely agree and i just want to say because i'm not a native english speaker for example for me i used to use the word guys for a group of people and i was just not aware of of the context i was i was completely oblivion to that and then someone a very nice girl came to me and told me i think it was in cppcon 19 probably that this word have context and i've been really really um trying very hard to avoid this word and use folks or other um words because it's important to me to not you know um i mean i am the international simple plus community is important to me and i am there to communicate and i'm not there to communicate badly so so i think i mean just to print the other side or to say that it's okay to learn and i agree with petition we should definitely try to do that and keep in mind we're all like i think a lot of the a lot of us is from different cultures and so on so yeah i i have kind of building on that of being i'm speaking english as as but not having it as your first language there's there's so many nuances and cultural subtexts and things that that you don't know as as as as a non-native speaker and and and people are often very self-conscious about their accents uh but the i have the opposite problem and and so i want to to point out that having an accent can be a good thing because if you have an accent you are signaling to the listener that this is not my first language if you have a very slight accent people will expect much higher competency in cultural uh issues and subtext and nuances to words and you are still not a native speaker but they will expect so much more of you and and and so that's something that i struggle with because yeah like like involved it's not my my native language and and there are lots of things that i don't know and so i had um this happened a few years ago uh where some native speakers uh uh mentioned several i was i i i used twitter to learn about other people and so several people talked about the word uh females uh that they that that they felt that this was was a very negative word and i didn't understand like what is what is the difference because for me this this is not uh i don't have the gut feeling about words that you have as a native speaker that you have in your own language that you can say this word feels right or it feels wrong i i don't have that gut feeling about things and so i basically i just asked on twitter i asked people have said this i don't understand why can you explain it to me and then and lots of people explained to me and then i could try to relate it to my own language and and and in my own language we also have a way of describing gender but applying it to animals and i would not use those kinds of words for people so i could do that one uh also a bunch of people said uh it's like in star trek with the with the ferenge when they say females and i hadn't watched star trek but i you know i had a whole pandemic to watch star trek but but also people also explained to me that there is a difference between using it as a an adjective to say a female programmer or using it as a noun to say a female ah and and that also was a very good distinction for me so so it's okay to to to not know things and you can you can ask people if especially if you have trust with people because sometimes people will like they they think when you ask a question you're actually being you you're just asking questions but you're just kind of trolling them but if they they trust you and you ask it in good faith and people believe you lots of people will help you and to to figure out the distinction because for me that was a word that i struggled with um yeah so i just learned so thank you it really is a gift if someone will come and tell you that joke that little aside the particular adjective uh you gotta explain it so your girlfriend can understand it um you know you think it's natural and simple and then someone tells you it's not then that's a gift and we've probably all had someone take us aside for a moment like that at some point and when i look back on those moments i feel grateful that someone was brave enough to come and say hey maybe you didn't even notice but you know um and and that someone will do that it you may not feel like saying thank you in the moment because you feel defensive you feel like i didn't intend to hurt anyone so therefore i obviously didn't um but you know you have been given a gift of a piece of knowledge that is not issued to us at birth and you know that xkcd about you're one of the ten thousand for today you know like it did it might not be diet coke and mentos it might be not saying guys like you're you're one of the people who's going to learn that that hurts some people and why and what to do about it instead and i don't feel bad that you didn't know before i'm delighted to be the person who gets to tell you and i completely agree yeah and the thing about saying thank you that's one of the things that i think is easier uh online like if you have if someone dms you on twitter and and they they they they say the thing that you said in this this tweet it something it's sufficiently asynchronous that you can you can force you or you can you can get a habit of saying thank you even before you you can get there like you're still in the oh my god i messed up you saw me mess up i feel terrible i feel like defending myself all of those feelings that is natural and you're going to go through you can still you can actually say thank you and then work out the feelings later and so let's do that um because i want to say thank you to all that are you know still here and those who already left um this room is going to time out in three minutes so we can keep talking a bit here but i would say then maybe you know if if you want to stay around be my guest we can have that conversation for another hour in the lounge and um yeah i feel like organizing today was was really um nice and there was actually one question which i remember from jonathan i don't know if jonathan still is here he was asking like how did we manage that we didn't overlap so much and i organized this and i kind of got the right talks i guess is something where i as with the view on lightning talks don't don't care so much about i think like if if we want to reinforce a good point and people like do two different talks on the same topic from two different views we're probably gonna learn a lot more from that than when we just tell someone to pick a different topic and so i i did care a lot for that people choose their topics and speak about what they're passionate about that we get a lot of things covered and so starting talks are also going to end up in youtube it does not matter if you heard something twice today because on youtube maybe only heard once so i'm sorry my headphones got drained from electricity but i hope you can hear me uh i just wanted to say um like so to what patricia have said then i agree i mean i'm in this business i think because i'm very curious i like i love learning new things i just want to say that the experience of learning new things cultural uh wise is really awesome for me at least i mean it's not just you know the opportunity to work with people from abroad is one of the things i love the most about c plus plus and and and this is awesome both on the technical level and also on the cultural level so so yeah i totally look at it as as an opportunity brilliant it's been a really fun evening thank you very much indeed for organizing it yes really really good yes thank you that was awesome thank you thank you for for coming forward and volunteering and finally i had the problem to get mail speakers for tonight because there was already so many women volunteering i didn't have to worry about that so diversity-wise this this evening has really been known and i see kate is trying to join again for the last 15 seconds but she didn't get through okay so i guess we're gonna go to the launch and good night weekends okay everybody wave and smile bye-bye
