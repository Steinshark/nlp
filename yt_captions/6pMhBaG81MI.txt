mr beast how do i go viral oh that's easy to go viral you in this video i interviewed mr beast collected all of youtube's data and created a super smart ai to find viral ideas instantly oh you shouldn't have are you talking about me no not you check it out hey google give me a viral video idea okay here's one i only ate try not to eat challenge food for 24 hours okay it's a work in progress so the reason i put this all together is to answer one question how do you go viral on youtube and maybe more specifically how do i go viral on youtube we're gonna throw the whole joe rogan kitchen sink at this thing start from raw data work our way up to ai and finally talk to the king of virality himself in the hopes of answering that single question how do you but mostly me but also you go viral to answer this we have to rewind the clocks back a few years to may of 2019. i just built a bot to collect trending data from youtube and i found that it was quite biased towards tv and old media in fact you might have seen my report in the news this youtuber called coffee break made a video exposing the trending tab now around that time youtube promised to fix trending and make it more fair to creators but to keep them honest i continued to harvest their data like my name was mark elliott zuckerberg in fact not only did i continue collecting us data i expanded my operations to collect it all across the world and after another year i found that not only had youtube kept their promise and made trending more fair also nobody cares about trending anymore so i just didn't release the video but it got me thinking now that they fixed a lot of problems with trending could we use that data to learn how to go viral because it turns out it's kind of hard to measure viral because what's viral for me is a million views if mr beast gets a million views it's the worst day of his life because of that we're going to use trending on youtube as a rough measure of virality it's not perfect it's not even close but it's the best guess at what youtube considers broadly appealing viral content so let's jump into our findings so here's what i did i plotted all the data on a giant chart of who trended how often how many views they got when they went viral and here's what my new year of collecting data showed the most viral creator trending 168 times in the us who was canadian linus tech tips give it up to him for stealing our jobs the second most trending 165 times which is almost every other day was espn and eating their way to third and fourth rhett and link with good mythical morning and good mythical more and then coming in fifth place it was the sports talk show skip and shannon undisputed now the question is what do all these successful channels have in common not only do they upload fairly often but they also all appeal to very broad categories who likes tech everybody who likes sports well everybody who likes food challenges me but also everybody which means our first lesson is if you want to go viral consistently you have to choose video topics that appeal to large markets which is kind of obvious but didn't stop me from making a video about my obscure data collection hobbies so that's number one but then if we look globally beyond the us we learn something else see if you didn't know different countries have different trending tab selections and this time i wanted to measure not only how many people went viral in the us but went viral globally who is the most viral creator around the world i found that the number two creator globally was mr beast kind of no surprise there but coming in number one beating him out narrowly was kpop that's right bts we're number one for the year i collected this data and that sort of makes sense right because music is a universal language that can be enjoyed by anyone plus k-pop low-key slaps okay so it's not surprising then that the top five most global trending videos and we're talking individual videos here they were all music videos which again reflects how easily music can cross barriers that regular language just can't and that brings us to my number two takeaway the world is changing and youtube is a global platform so it's not just about appealing to what's viral in the united states but a global audience as well now it's clear from this data going viral is hugely based on the broadest topics and getting the right ideas but to be honest i'm only human and i could try to sit down and think of good ideas myself but why do that when i can build a robot to do it for me but i mean why stop there why should i even build the robot at all when i can barely code so instead i found a much smarter guy than myself eden meyer to do it for me he's an ai youtuber who should go check out link below but it brings me to a third lesson of going viral sometimes your ideas are a little too big and you just need to ask for help that's alright i really have no data to support that but it just kind of seems like good advice and once he finished putting all our data into a super smart ai we ended up with this check this out maxwell hey google give me a viral idea okay here's one pets versus adults react to drunk versus spent toys that's the best you can do that's terrible but wait it's thinking give it a second hey google give me another viral idea okay here's one the best smartphone you won't buy you gotta admit that's not bad yeah it's okay but even a blind ai can find a nut once in a while what i don't know that's one of your human sayings right no the saying is it's a blind squirrel that finds a nut once in a while what do squirrels have to do with this nothing look you get me all messed up here look here's here's another one okay one more time i'll prove it to you that this isn't just luck okay google give me one more okay here's one i hydro dipped my diamond play button and now i'm in hell honestly the truth was slowly dawning on me that even if i could get that ai to give me great ideas all the time i realized they're based on what's gone viral in the past and i wanted to know what would go viral in the future and so with no other options i called up mr beast and i finally asked him the burning question that everyone's wondering right now i found out that globally you were the number two channel right behind bts wait really bts doesn't even post ever how does it feel to be the number two most viral youtuber uh in that for 2021 no 2020. oh well i don't count that year i only had one channel back then that's that's lame i want i demand a recount yeah yeah the date is still coming in on 2021 okay we'll get that next year okay but seriously thanks for coming on i really appreciate it and i guess my big question is how do you go viral consistently do you want the hour-long answer or the super short answer uh whatever the true answer is i guess can you say it is it short is the true answer short i ca the thing is like i can give you a high level or the we'll give you a high level so essentially for us the way i like to look at it is if if we if i spend me and my team spend like 10 times more time than everyone else brainstorming ideas which would probably at this point spend a hundred times more time than everyone else uh we spend half a million to a million dollars video whereas normal people are spending like a thousand or ten thousand is an expensive video now and we just you know sometimes we're filming for three or four days like 10 hours a day you know 30 40 hours of filming plus months of setup whereas most creators probably film for a couple hours and set up for a day i think for us you know by always doing all those things it just distinctively sets it so far apart that it's basically in my head it's like why would you not watch it you know what i mean so is this just the meme of like quality content like quality over quantity but then you're doing the quantity too though it seems like you upload relatively a lot yeah well so that's where well i guess man you're about to make me just start a college class here on this yeah so essentially yes at the end of the day if you boil it down what youtube wants is they want people to click on a video and they want to watch it like at its core that's what it is now you can like draw little lines and go as deep as you want and to how to get people to click and how to get people to watch i mean essentially by studying the algorithm you'll learn that you're more studying human psychology right what do humans want to watch what do they find enjoying not because anytime you say the word algorithm just replace it with audience and it works perfectly like the algorithm didn't like that video no the audience didn't like that video no you know because literally that's it if people are clicking and watching then it gets promoted more and that's all that's literally all the algorithm does is reflect what the people want 280 and if you deny that you just make terrible videos that are trying to find a scapegoat like uh i mean there's a reason everyone loves youtube and you know spends hours every single day on it so so far in this video i've talked a lot about finding the right idea the right title because that's what i have a lot of data on but that just gets people to click there's this whole other side and people have tried to copy your thumbnail strategy copy your title strategy but you're a master of audience retention as well of keeping people on the video i guess it's delivering on the video but how do you hold people for so long and what are other people doing that's killing their retention oh gosh where do you begin i mean we'll start at the beginning essentially your title and thumbnail set expectations and at the very beginning of the video to minimize drop-off you want to assure them that those expectations are being met if you click on a video where you know uh of his where it's like tether is a scam and then at the very beginning he starts talking about literally anything else then you're like oh this is bull this isn't what i clicked on but if at the very start of the video you go tether is a scam and i'm going to teach you why then it's like okay you match the expectation so at the very beginning match the expectations and then you want to exceed them so you want to assure people that what they clicked on that's what they're getting and then blow their mind and be like but you're also getting even more that's how you you lower drop off which a lot of people sometimes it takes like 20 seconds to really meet the expectations and so you lose like that's where you're going to lose everyone everyone's videos start like this and then it levels off so you want to reduce the amount of people that click off on the audience retention graph i hope you're popping up graphs while i'm saying this so so it's easier for people to visualize but so then once you get it to level off it's just how do you keep it level until the end of the video and that's where you you want to have you basically want to remove every dull moment you probably want to find the 10 most critical people you know make them watch the video and just roast it you wanna i personally i enjoy i enjoy having people watch the videos and watching them there's some things you can do where like you basically pay people to watch the videos on frame and then just have them record it and i love just seeing like when they pick up their phones and when they get bored and like you know certain things like if i just talk to a camera for 10 seconds without a cut like a lot of people will just like get bored or they'll lose interest so like having a b cam and a c cam and just you can just talk for 10 seconds but three seconds in cutting to a b cam and then a c cam like now it's more interesting even though it's essentially the same thing and not that crazy but you want to have good pacing typically having a payoff at the end keep some right last sleep circle wins 10 grand if there is a low moment halfway through you're going to watch to the end because you want to see who wins the 10 grand um so having a good payoff at the end i mean dude i don't even know i i could talk about this for like hours but yeah i feel like so many creators don't think about this they just start and they just kind of ramble on i know i've caught myself doing this a minute has gone by i haven't done anything i'm just starting to get in the video and you see that in the retention graph you just see that huge dip and i have to remind myself to go and like re-go to these principles but obviously you've given a lot of advice to other creators but i know firsthand there's a difference between hearing something and doing it what piece of advice do you find yourself repeating over and over to creators and they're just not getting it oh boy a lot you know so here's a fun story i actually i mentor this one guy just for fun i started uh he was a friend medium-sized youtuber he was doing like i think he was doing twenty thousand like he tenth a month in revenue like ten thousand on one channel and like eight thousand a month on another channel and um this month he actually just had his highest revenue month ever uh he did four hundred thousand dollars in revenue um and just by like listening to what i i taught him i know we were able to like 20 x's revenue uh and i was just like with me just once a week just telling him he was an idiot and what to do uh and i do that for a lot of people i just counsel people for fun and help them blow up their channels a lot of times people oh boy it's like they think their videos are better than they are honestly and they don't jimmy tell them i mean they do and and you have to like you have to that and they have horrible friend groups because you really are like the type of youtubers you hang around and so like a lot of times i'm just like what you're saying is wrong who told you this they're like oh this guy this guy and it's like well they're wrong it's not true and so it's getting people with the right youtuber friend group that aren't [ __ ] and will actually tell them when their content's bad and like actually roast it and and help them get better in a nice positive way and then usually it's hiring an editor honestly uploading less videos and just making them better it's much easier to get five million views on one video than 50 000 views on 100 videos takes way less effort to get 5 million views in one video so it's like applying a lot of these principles like that and also getting it where it's content that they enjoy a lot of people aren't willing to put in 10 hours days because they don't like what they're doing so it's finding what they enjoy because it is like a long grind like you're doing for years not months so if you don't enjoy it then you're going to burn out and that so like that's usually the first thing it's like figuring out like what are the things you're currently doing that you don't want to do and like let's figure out a way to get someone else to do it in the next five months so you actually get out of bed excited and i always thought you were the type to like you're like making sure like okay i got to get to my point in like 10 seconds and then i got to get like the like the outros well i mean that's but that's stuff you can you do later and you can do that no matter what the video is you can do that right it's like i mean we've done videos where i've ran from the military where i buried myself for 50 hours where i mean everything even back in the day like q and a's that have gone viral or or other stuff like you can make anything work but at the end of the day it's got to be like interesting to the audience original and just good you know what i mean and if you hit those like you can figure out a good intro and outro you know what i mean yeah one of the things i think you're doing better than anyone is growing a team um i think you're creating the infrastructure around you to make videos which like i think a lot of youtubers are like solo acts and they maybe pride themselves on that but you're crushing it with doing your thing how much do you think your success is just being a talented youtuber versus the team you've been able to build well it's hard because being uh it's like it's a weird balance because i would never i you know i used to save up a dollar a day like the my first microphone i had to save up for three months to buy and you know we didn't have anybody it was i had a single mom raising me and my my brother and sister so um it's like that relentless obsession of youtube and reinvesting got us to that point and so building the team to lev like if i didn't know how to go viral it doesn't matter if i had a thousand employees it wouldn't not give you so it was i think for me it was it was good that i got a really strong foundation on how youtube works and how the style of videos i wanted and everything before i scaled up the team if that makes any sense i just want to make sure that's clear because i've seen people try to build the team without foundation and knowing how to do well and that it you know it just oh that's interesting yeah they try to build it before basically it's ready to be like and so that's what gave me the confidence to hire people and that's why i'm able to run my company at really thin margins because i have faith and i i know that if we film this video it will do well just because i've spent a decade of my life hyper-obsessing over youtube and i have a good pulse on it but if you didn't have that then you wouldn't know like you wouldn't be able to spend 4 million on a squid game because you might lose 2 million bucks and then you can't pay your people so it's like but anyways yeah it's i don't even remember the original question but of course yeah if i didn't have these people i i couldn't do half the stuff i do i mean we we have in my opinion the best people in the industry working here and i love them to death here's my question if we took you took your brain right now and put it into a guy with no money and no subscribers so you can't give away money you can't make a million dollar giveaway video how long would it take you to get to 1 million subscribers probably three months maybe four from zero easily three or four months like if that's all that guy was doing i mean like let me think i would probably just walk across america that would get me on the map and then just do something earlier yeah some some other zero dollar uh extreme challenges get some attention take that money i don't know maybe make a line of paper clips i think those are cheap and stretch it across the state or something and then i i you know um something you know that i'd try to swim from like europe to africa that would be a cool stunt or something i've thought about this before that would pop off dude a thumbnail of me just swimming in the middle of the ocean like i don't want to do it now because they're easier stuff but i would do it like straight at your mouth it's like four four miles or something no big deal yeah but then you you know imagine a title i swear from europe to africa like that would pop off uh or i swim across the ocean or something i mean yeah easily like i could figure out a blueprint and then i'd just suffer for four months and then i'd have a million subscribers i always wonder what are some ideas because you have like at this point you have a brand you have a whole thing i'm sure you think of ideas all the time that just don't fit what you are for whatever reason what are some like killer ideas that you've had that you're like it just doesn't work i can read yourself i've got like 9 000 video ideas sitting here i i just want to hear sort of like what pops in your brain so even if it's like even if you don't think it it like i just want to think like what are you brainstorming i i rode a roller coaster without a seatbelt i don't know why that one's there um uh i wouldn't do this one but i made a homeless man a millionaire uh fly first to fly around the world one's a private jet uh i i can't read some of these uh uh i survived 24 hours in the world's deepest cave would you rather have half a million dollars or a private island last leave haunted house food's under k i opened a restaurant that only served money that's a funny one i opened a free tesla dealership i heard real criminals these feel like mr beast videos though they're very like this is free this is the twist this is first to do this gets it i mean that's what we're on idea 5443 i mean i don't know it's just like random ones i could uh scroll up complete this race 100k here let me scroll up uh i bought the like we legit just seven oh my gosh that's insane wow so is that what you read now instead of a dictionary you just read that now and like look for ideas well so i i have some friends that help basically what i found is like yeah like i you heard the dictionary story i work well off inspiration and so i found it'd be better just to kind of have people come up with ideas roughly and then i ingest them because dude half those ideas aren't good and i wouldn't film but then when i read them it inspires me and i'm like no first the finished race 100 like that's too simple but first person to climb a mountain wins 100 grand is good and so i like when people just give me inspiration and then i just what makes one good and the other bad i think running a race is like people have done that it's like generic it's whatever but like first to climb mountain and like a thumbnail of someone climb inside of a mountain and the thought of someone climbing a mountain is extreme like the that's adrenaline it's interesting like to me climbing a mountain is more interesting than running a marathon with all this data your your brain is sort of a tuned algorithm itself of like like evaluating i think it's so interesting watching you evaluate like titles actually i was curious how do you think that that title what i told you earlier how to go viral feat mr beast will do do you think there's a better title um i think how to go viral featuring mr beast i think that would work i think a lot of like colin sameer's video i mean got five million views and um yeah i think my face can pull some views so i mean what's your most video like a million two million three million three million yeah then by those standards it would do pretty well like i've seen plenty of videos from my face to pull a couple million views so i think you would be happy with it but if you're trying to get like a 50 million view video i don't i don't think it would work you know like how does the equation change this is the point of the video hold on this is the heartbeat of the video how does the equation change from like hey i want to get a cute little i know for you it's like that's five million views how do you go from that to like i want to get a 50 million view video what is the difference in the way you think about those two things you need something hey original how to go viral is probably it's not something like super original you like you need a really strong opinion probably like you need to say like like what you're saying is like i like bananas and what you need is bananas are the best goddamn food on the planet like that's the type of opinion you need like you need something like how to get a hundred million views on youtube not even that that's not strong enough you need something that makes people go what the [ __ ] you know and like click you know what i mean dude i want to click whatever video you're selling me right now dude yes that video that's what i want to watch yeah but that's hyper specific to you but you see what i'm saying it needs to be extreme it needs to be like how to go viral that's not gonna cause someone to go damn if i don't click that i'm not gonna be able to sleep at night you need something that legit will have people be like what the [ __ ] did he say in that video what the [ __ ] i need to know you know that is how i describe to some people like um what makes of like like a really great video is you feel like the feeling of i can't look away that is a very specific emotion that is most videos do not have like like the vast major you like you very rarely run into a video where you go i can't stop watching so i recently look i'm just gonna be honest here jimmy i also brought you here for a bit of a confrontation i recently heard you refer to your warehouse as a 10 million dollar studio and i don't want to get lawyers involved but uh you know i had it first and this isn't really a question as much as it is a legal threat so do you have any comments on that well i think we actually paid 11 million so i can just change it to like what the 10 no you can take the 10 title i'll take the 11. it's just 10 sounded better i'm calling bts right now dude i'm going to call bts and ask them these questions are you tracking other languages or just english i'm tracking around the so whatever appears on all the different like yeah so this year you represent this year because we're trending in espanol now with the espanol channel and gaming and reacts are always trending so that's a huge thing i wanted to ask you about actually is i've taken notice of that i um is that a 2021 thing yeah i mean that was like four months ago it it's gained three million subscribers a month for like like it's insane you've never been growing faster no i mean like we think i think we did 20 million subscribers last month across all the channels oh my gosh yeah that and probably two billion views now and it's just going up month over month because once you have 40 channels if they're all pulling 100 plus million views a month it gets pretty crazy well so back to the viral thing pull up mysteries gaming and espino that that's that answers your question right we didn't promote that channel that that first video on that channel got like a hundred thousand views now read off how many views it's on now it's got 10 million views exactly all organic from the algorithm it literally in the second video got like a hundred thousand views day one i think as well and it's on 11 million views because and these these are dub videos these aren't even the original hot like best quality versions of them but because these videos had 70 percent retention despite being dubbed they had really good thumbnails and they were just interesting [ __ ] even though it's a completely different language on a brand new channel with no promotion they still went super viral and that's where like i hate when people are like well the video only does well because you're popular we can go into new languages with people who have never heard of me and still get giant 10 million view videos just because the videos are good that's the big thing that i'm trying to break down in this video is understanding that's the science of virality that i'm talking about is forget about the brand name forget about people are so focused on oh you only can do that because you're mr beast you only can do that because you already have a million subscribers on my main channel like one percent of my my views are from mexico or uh whatever it's like a very none of my views are from south america right and on at mr beast espanol 1.3 of my viewership is american and it's all mexico colombia argentina these are people who literally have never even heard of me before and these videos are still going super viral it's all about it's just about they didn't have access to you before now they can be given 70 retention videos of you and you just pop off because of it exactly and it's not because they know who i am it's just because the videos are good they just are they're interesting they have good retention they have good pacing you can't find them anywhere else and you know the last the thing i want to leave people with is people think it's like oh well um it's all like ctr and stuff like that but a big thing that everyone underestimates is it's what what was your experience with your last video if people loved your the last video of yours that they watch they're more likely to watch your next one and that's something that people take for granted because like we'll you know we'll get trending and i'll notice a comment from someone like we'll just pull it in like edward jobs right and everyone jobs will comment oh my gosh i've i've never seen mr beast before this was really cool and then you can search their username like three hours later and they'll go oh my gosh i just watched eight videos like where has this been all my life i just watched him give away a hundred thousand dollars play a million dollar game a hide and seek to the world's largest lego tower do this this and this and it's because see that's the effect you want most people when they watch for the youtubers watching this when people watch your video they go okay that was good but like that's enough of of you for the day like it was it was all right right where's what you want is them to go holy crap that was crazy oh my god what's that holy crap that was crazy oh my god and they just and they watched ten videos not one and they need like a week break because it was so ah that they have to recharge you know what i mean that's that's what you're going for that data can't describe and like i don't i've never heard anyone talk about that but that that is it that's how you get these high view counts because people watch 10 videos not one you know mr beast thank you for coming on the show listen let me be honest i've always wanted to hang up on a uh on a on a famous person before so uh bye i was about to try to beat him oh wow i felt as good as i thought it would honestly what a rush well big thanks to mr beast i hope you guys learned something and i'll see you in the next one
