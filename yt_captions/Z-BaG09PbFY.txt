have to do is buy low and sell high guys you could have made a killing on camping world holdings now obviously these magic stock systems never really work but i thought i'd point out that uh marc jacobs wikipedia page says uh this article may have been created or edited in return for undisclosed payments a violation of wikipedia's policies and requires some cleanup because it's not neutral so i don't know if that tells you anything but there you go okay next ad we got on the save the kids story which incidentally guys if you don't know about our challenge we're trying to get to a million subs by december 31st we're going to give 10 000 to charity or if we hit it by christmas we're going to give 20 000 to save the children the actual charity right now we gotta talk about this ad which we got from an eight-figure amazon seller guys what could tom wang the eight-figure amazon seller want from us the coffeezilla audience let's watch on a wednesday and apparently i've sold close to three thousand dollars in sales on amazon already now i know what you're asking tom that's in sales how much money are you actually making with putting into your pocket right an average amazon seller makes anywhere between 30 to 40 profit margin so if your sales let's say bro if you think jeff bezos has let you walk out of the door with 40 you got another thing coming dude hey he didn't even let his ex-wife take that much okay you think he's gonna let you take 40 percent mckenzie bezos didn't even get that so there you go right for me as well as a lot of amazon fba sellers as well by the time i roll out of bed a few hundred dollars has been deposited into my bank account i get up i go to kickboxing class i walk my dog and by dinner time another few hundred dollars has been added to my bank account even though the money is good the best part of this is that you get your time back selling the dream here sell it beautiful okay but the question is if you could do it why do you sell a course in this training you'll get a step-by-step tutorial on how to get started and a crystal clear idea on the front end work you need to do it's 100 for free it's 50 minutes of pure gold content bra it's

breakthrough call where he will sell us a what looks like a thousand dollar course there you go that's what 100 free means now guys all right well it's good to know that the gurus are still advertising on my channel even after i asked google to not play get rich quick ads during my videos uh that's a setting you can toggle actually in your settings but um apparently it didn't work because yeah the they're still getting through boys like they're honestly spending ad dollars on the most woke audience on youtube to fiona's flowers business is blooming hey small business insurance yo we're getting a state farm ad dude what am i the super bowl hey this feels good dude that's nice that's moderate high quality wait what now there's skye rizzy things are getting clearer i feel free

psoriasis all right here we go last ad already understand btc and you're already using coinbase but you're struggling to wrap your head around if d5 nfts and the rest of this space whether you're in it for the tech or you're here to take advantage of the largest wealth transfer event in history bankless is the resource that you need say no more fam i got you okay i guess they just want my email the ultimate guide to defy nft's ethereum and bitcoin join 120 000 others on the bankless journey they call themselves the ultimate guide to crypto finance five actionable newsletters every week or practical okay whatever why are you advertising to us are they just making money from selling their lists i have no idea i have no idea who these people are i think if i've learned anything it's that uh the coffeezilla audience is extremely targeted by a lot you know hey i'll say it nicely uh a lot of crypto platforms a lot of uh well i'd say normal ads you know we had some normal ads in there some cool ads and we had some definitely scam ads but frankly i'm not too worried about you guys i think our audience is definitely more skeptical than your average consumer about uh people promising you to to get rich to make you rich off the greatest wealth transfer in human history whatever buzzword buzzword so i'm not worried but i did want to come down from my high horse from my ad block privileged life come descend and live among you guys for a bit so i knew what you guys were going through just bear in mind i've tried to stop it so i guess what i'm saying is you guys are right there are definitely a lot of scam ads but either way that's basically it thank you for watching and i will see you tomorrow in dayton of a coffee still christmas this part of the story
