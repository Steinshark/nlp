okay i'm just playing he may have mistaken it for an external hard drive or maybe a thunderbolt dock but no this is actually a powerful pc given the size of course now most small form factor pcs are sized to be built around a cpu cooler but streetcom said screw it let's just make the entire case the cooler that's right this is a completely fanless case at this size question is did the fancy engineering that they had to put into this puny passive powerhouse make it a complete nightmare to work with we've got our heat pipes and we're going to find out nzxt wants to make building a custom pc easier and with nzxt build you just set a budget see how the computer performs in your favorite games and build takes care of the rest use the link below to get your own custom pc today [Music] the streacom db1 max looks exactly like its sister case the explicitly non-max db1 but there's one big difference the max variant uses not one but both sides of the chassis as heat sinks for the cpu or really apu is there's no standalone graphics card here nor space for one that increases the total heat dissipation of the fanless design from 45 watts up to 65 but it creates an interesting problem getting heat from the apu to the left panel slash heatsink is straightforward enough endeavor a couple of these u-shaped heat pipes a bunch of thermal compound and another heatsink to spread the load but how do you do that for heatsink that's located on the opposite side of the case you know around the back of the motherboard well that's where some clever engineering comes in these u-shaped heat pipes bend around to the back of the motherboard and contact the right side plates as well now before we get to what is surely the most finicky cooler install ever there are some concessions that need to be made to get a fanless pc under six liters of volume that promises some serious gaming chops and it starts with the motherboard asrock's x300 tm itx this isn't a uh run-of-the-mill itx board no this is thin mini icx it's the same footprint as itx but adds a 2.5 centimeter i o shield height restriction if you stare at it long enough you can start to see how the design differs there's no fitting desktop ram in this thing so sodium laptop memory sticks are used instead we have a couple of these here and uh where is the usual atx power input there isn't one this board is powered from 12 volt via a little four pin up here or with a quick jumper swap like so you can feed it 19 volts via a barrel plug on an external power supply like we'll be doing here we have this boy here what makes this build actually work is the small wonder that is amd's ryzen 7 5700g apu the rated tdp for this thing is 65 watts which is actually precisely what this case is rated for too even though tdp isn't really a useful number these days as chips can boost for as long as they want as long as there's headroom it flaunts eight cores and 16 threads that can boost up to 4.6 gigahertz and there's eight cores of radeon gpu baked inside that should give us ample gaming performance but we'll see that once we get this whole shebang together let's go over what we have here so we've already talked about the cpu this is the motherboard itself we went over a little bit but let's let's take a look at the more typical components of it right here we've got three usb 3.2 gen one type a ports and a gen one type c port we've got audio in and out it's pretty standard it's nothing special a serial port it's kind of interesting i appreciate it but yeah it's whatever we've got two hdmi 2.0 ports but only one of these is going to be accessible because one of them's on the other side check that out that's i don't think i've seen that before that's thin mini itx for you i think i would have given up that serial port for uh two hdmis but that's just me uh let's see two soda imports these are gonna be used for our crucial ddr4 3200 kit these are about as fast as we can reasonably expect out of sodim's i think i took a quick look around and i couldn't find anything faster unfortunately that's just kind of what you have to live with on a low profile system like this but you also get two m.2 slots one is a 2230 for your wi-fi or a very small form factor 1.2 ssd and you've got a full-size m.2 ssd port up here as well the ssd we're going to be popping in here is a crucial p5 we're just going to be using collins bench drive to speed things up you probably want to have something a little bit bigger and or faster depending on what your use case is i think this is just a 512 gig this is all you get and um yeah that's all the components i guess it's not going to be a very complicated build at least not as far as component density goes that i guess leads us to the fun bit it's time to put it all together installing the cpu is pretty easy but you're going to want to pay attention to the little golden triangle here to tell you where to put it because this is a very weird orientation for this socket but if you orient it just right it should slip right on down there and you're good to go now the ram is a little different than you might be used to i'm not sure how many of you might have installed sodium before but basically you got to get it in underneath these clips because they're in the way there we go aligned up with the notch slide it in then push it down until you hear a click ssd is the same as any other ssd you might install an m.2 socket now you just align the ssd with this notch here and then screw in the screw you don't want it too tight you just want it to hold down these screws are very easy to share off if you tighten them too much okay and that's it for the build yeah that's it bill's done um you know we could run the system like this actually it wouldn't run very well it might shut off but you know we could do it let's get in the case i mean i was kind of hoping we didn't have to do that but that's what the video is about so yeah okay let's get into the case what am i looking at here this obviously is going to mate somehow this is what looks like the motherboard tray well clearly i need to read the instructions at this point so give me one moment okay so i need to install the cooler first which i think is in this box here that that looks for all the world like uh like a water block almost except no it's not the heat pipes slide into this thing so it's not like putting anything in here like water or air or anything the heat pipes just kind of live here the lengths to which people will go for a small pc am i right am i supposed to be using thermal compound for this yes oh this is gonna be miserable yes just came back from vacation and this is what i'm doing all right let's get some thermal compound on that cpu and get this uh copper shim on it apparently that's what we need to do there's not a lot of thermal compound in one of these it's enough the cpu though but i already got some of my fingers because of this application method so i'm wasting a whole bunch of it do we have oh man i've got it all over me already this is just one packet i need so many of these this here shim just goes on like that i guess it just lives there so how much do you think this case costs uh [Music] i want to say 300 dollars that's that's way high high would you believe me if i said it was 125 us dollars really no i wouldn't because you're getting the cooler and you're getting the case and it's like all these different parts i mean it's miserable to build but like that's that's less than i thought it would be oh i got a thermal compound everywhere now but as part of the adventure we're gonna be here a while yep please better instructions if you're going to save money on assembly costs the bet the least you could do is you know make it very clear what goes where and there's your cooler presumably oh god how am i supposed to do do you need assistance this is oh are you having fun yet anthony have a blast wait how am i supposed to i think you should only go till this group protrudes through the net whatever i do it needs to be even ish oh god the board is bending like real bad actually not bad oh i'm like oh okay so we got these spring screws so they'll stop you know they'll stop when they need to no instructions unclear motherboard taco this is my favorite build ever i feel like i'm not making any progress on this build just like everything i do is like just a drop in the bucket you know i'd say you're solid like 65 of the way to turning it on well you didn't have to crush my spirits like that would it help if i said that you're more like 69 of the way there nice it's done i hope i actually put that jumper to 19 volts let's give it a shot yeah it's heating up 36 37 is it actually gonna boot though it booted it booted isn't it amazing that we needed a thermal camera just to know whether the computer was on or not that's pretty great like you press the button and literally nothing happens okay t die is 48 47 okay it's going down uh let's hit it with uh what should we hit it with it doesn't like that but the cpu temperatures still seem pretty good the motherboard says that it's at 115 degrees i don't believe that for a second that's a false reading gpu temperature says that it's at 38. it looks like 10 fps uh it is seven but of course this is like 4k i could probably stress it a little harder if i went for the lower resolution this is mostly stressing the memory at the moment uh let's hit it with prime95 let's just burn it gpu temperature is at 58 cpu temperature is currently at 61. yeah now it's thermal throttling what's going on so the motherboard is currently thermal throttling us pretty hard look at that all that work and here we are getting thermal throttled obviously people aren't going to be running prime95 all day but this is a little disappointing considering that the chassis itself is fully capable like this is not even hitting anywhere close to a high temperature it's in the 60s the chassis is more than capable of taking this amount of heat and yet we're thermal throttle based on the motherboard the vrms are just burning up we went and grabbed an 80 millimeter noctua fan to kind of point into the case and uh see if that makes a difference and sure enough it does so you can see the exact moment that we put the fan on it it's like kind of like stopped thermal thermal throttling why is the motherboard at over 100 degrees because the vrms have no cooler that's what the problem is the vrms don't even have a passive heat sink so they're not getting any cooling whatsoever there's no airflow inside the case the only reason we're getting anything out of this is because we're putting air over the vrms but the thing that gets me is that streetcom sent this board they sent this specific board yes like it's possible that there's a an issue with the sensor uh possible that talk going could have done something that that is possible yeah i'm not above saying that i broke it do you want to like break contact street com and be like hey have you guys seen this happening i can do that all right here's the situation the asrock x300 tm itx motherboard we installed this guy right here gave us some weird performance under synthetic loads the board was throttling far before the case was even being pushed close to its limit so we pulled it all apart slapped a knock to a u12s onto it and lo and behold yup those vrm's are toasty over a hundred 130 degrees our goal is to test the case here and with it throttling this way we were unable to do so to rectify that we called our friends at asus and snagged well one of these an asus pro h410t and equipped it with an intel core i5 10400. it's spec to the same tdp 65 watts and it doesn't cook the vrm's nearly as much as the asrock board let's give it a go in blender so starting off cp temperature temperatures going up to about 70. we'll see how high they go though because this is entirely passive remember so there's there's nothing to kick in and once it hits the thermal soak it's just going to keep getting hotter until it throttles that's the idea anyway we're at 100 degrees on all the cores now and it is in fact thermal throttling it's getting kind of toasty now it actually it actually does feel warm warmer on this side than this side though that's interesting all right let's see how toasty this thing is actually getting so on this side that i said was a little bit cooler it's about 39 maybe 40 degrees in the hot spot there yeah roughly 40 degrees if you move around to the other side yeah like 43 degrees how about that i was right what are we looking at right now looks like we've dropped down to 3.6 gigahertz still at 100 degrees celsius what's the power draw right now 57 so it's not looking good for the 65 watt claims that streetcom made here we are looking at a 43 degree hotspot back here so it's risen by three degrees at least since the last time i looked at it oh wow the heat i can feel the heat coming up off of it it's pretty amazing actually and like here's my hand i don't know if i can yeah you can kind of see it it's kind of glowing off my hand on the bottom there it's such a cool concept you know it's just there needs to be a little bit more efficiency in the thermal conduit like the contacts you know like you've got heat pipes you're putting in with thermal compound like that's not going to be as good as a soldered heat pipe into a aluminum block and unfortunately that seems to be what we're seeing here like obviously this is heating up and it's transferring heat pretty well but not well enough we went from 65 watts at peak i think to 53 52 watts towards the end of the run there and now we're sitting at 4 watts idle so unfortunately i mean it worked you could run it this way but i wouldn't recommend it it's 100 degrees the downside to running the cpu like this is that it's an intel cpu with an intel igpu and the gaming performance is frankly crap compared to the ryzen 7 5700g we saw about 55 fps in rocket league at 1080p with everything turned to performance settings if asrock pushes the bios to fix the issue on this motherboard that would be perfect amd's igpu performance makes for a much better gaming experience but given that there are no other em4 thin itx boards out there and we don't even know if a bios update can fix this issue we're hooped so where does that leave us we're a bit disappointed that the amd setup throttles so badly but it does game well in a normal use case and a build like this isn't meant to be a render farm if we were to temper our expectations around running full bore then sure this is a cool little case but honestly the limited options for thin itx compounded by the difficult assembly makes
