so unless you have been living under a complete Rock in the past few months it's pretty clear that getting a tech job has been pretty hard recently layoffs have been at record levels AI is coming in which is understandably prompting many people to ask is coding even a good career anymore so while it's very easy to see the headlines and get emotional I think it's always very important to stay rational so in this video I want to give my very honest and sort of thought out logical explanation for whether coding is still a worthwhile career to get into because obviously over the past few years they've sort of gone through this coding Gold Rush where everyone was getting into coding because it seemed like the easiest way for literally anyone to just make six figures straight out of University or even without a University degree at all so while it's not as easy as it was in the past let's see what is the state of the coding industry today and whether there are other industries that might be a better opportunity today but before we properly talk about all of that let me just tell you one thing if you want to learn to code and this is the career that you want to get into do you should absolutely still learn the code and I'm going to tell you why because it's not necessarily easy to see because it's easy to get sort of Lost in the weight of these like news these like Dooms like all these kind of things but really like when you zoom out in the big picture the real question I want you to ask yourself if you're considering quitting because of like all these things that you're hearing what are you going to do instead really think about answer that question what are you going to do instead that doesn't have the same downsides that the tech industry has right now of it being difficult to get in and it potentially being harmed by AI which again we'll talk about that in more detail later I've worked in a couple of Industries in my career basically before I discovered Tech that that that was the career that I wanted to get into I worked in banking I worked in Consulting I've did a few other things and let me just tell you that in all of those Industries it's just as hard even not harder in general to get in so if you quit coding to do something different you will probably find that either the pay there is going to be significantly lower and or that it's going to be just as hard to get in you're going to have to learn potentially even more like something like banking Consulting LW these other like high paying Industries you're absolutely going to need the degree for those kind of Industries whereas for Tech while it obviously helps you don't even need it so the biggest problems you're going to face if you're trying to break into Tech is that number one you don't have the Real World skills that you actually need number two you have a terrible resume that is terribly formatted that if you're sending it to a company they just going to assume your terrible because the resume doesn't show that you know how to highlight your skills in the proper way and number three you don't have access to employees most difficult part about breaking into the industry right now is that these company is getting so many applications that if you're just sending out applications via LinkedIn or something like that it's really really hard to stand out because they're probably not even going to get to your application and so before we move on into discussing a bit more about the tech industry I wanted to tell you what is actually the best and fastest and easiest way for you to actually get a job job in Tech right now and that is going to be something called course careers so first you'll go through a fundamental software engineering curriculum that is taught by Tech with him then you can choose a specialization based on what you want to specialize on like for example front end backend devops and all of these specializations are taught by actual real world experts like for example web devil simplified for the front end one and course creers outside of providing this course for you they have created this full employer portal where employers are going to go in and have a pool of essentially fully pre-qualified candidates who have passed the course careers curriculum which means that people like Max for example who went through course careers landed a 70k tech job without even applying for a single job himself because he was just approached by employees directly from the course careers platform and throughout this process you're going to get unlimited mentoring from people who have actually done it from people who have worked the jobs they you want to work and because I'm an official partner of course careers I'm actually going to be offering my services as well for this mentoring so you can just pick me and have me help you essentially and at the end of it they're just going to make a resume for you you just have to plug in some information and they're going to just spit out a fully optimized resume for you and then at the end of that you get access to the employer portal where you get direct access to Employers in a way that you simply cannot get anywhere else so if you're interested what they offer is a free introductory course to software development which you can get started with down below by clicking on my link in the description of course you still have to do the work of going through the program and actually taking this seriously but if you do they have an entire company whose only goal is to help you get a job as fast as possible so go check out that free introductory course Down Below in the description and after that you can decide if this is the right path for you so I feel like most people don't quite know the fundamental reason why it's so hard to get a tech job right now and once we understand this it becomes easy to see that this is not a permanent thing but it's actually just a temporary thing and the jobs will come back eventually so to understand this we need to look at two graphs which I have drawn for you with my amazing drawing skills really it's just one graph that is represented in two ways and it's this one we have interest rates and we have hiring so when interest rates go up hiring goes down interest rates up hiring down okay why does this happen when interest rates go up that means that for a company to borrow money or to access funding it's going to be more expensive because interest rates are the price of money why is this important when it's important because for companies and especially tech companies one of their biggest expenses is going to be employees so when money is expensive so when it's more difficult to get funding they're going to be hiring less people over simplification that's broadly how it works now why is this such a big deal especially in Tech compared to other Industries well if you compare a tech company that builds an app of some kind to let's say a boots on the ground restaurant a restaurant obviously also has employees just like this tech company but the restaurant is going to have a ton of other costs as well like rent the cost of the food that they're buying whereas for our tech company especially like a startup 95% of that cost is usually going to be employees it's going to be Engineers because Engineers are pretty freaking expensive for tech companies specifically the first place and pretty much the only place for them to cut down on cost is going to be employees and for a restaurant as well if the restaurant wants to keep operating at at all they cannot really fire all of their waiters because then they just can't run the restaurant at all right for a tech company a specific feature of a tech product like an app software website whatever is that it can keep running with far fewer Engineers than it took to build the thing what does it mean well it means that when hiring is cheap so when it's easy to get access money what tech companies are going to do is hire a ton of Engineers to build a ton of new features so that then when hiring becomes a expensive so when money becomes expensive they can get rid of all those Engineers who already now built the features because it takes a lot less Engineers to maintain the features and to maintain the company that it takes to build them which is why the tech industry tends to be extremely cyal in this kind of way so when interest rates go up hiring goes down so that is the core reason why there are so many layoffs right now what does this mean well it means that once interest rates go down again which will happen soon like no one knows how soon it's going to happen but most likely it's going to be within the next few years at the latest could even be like next year who knows it really depends on the economy so we need to pray to Jerome Powell or whoever the banking heads are to do that sooner than later but the jobs will come back if you look at the Historical graphs of the interest rate and you match that with the historical graph of hiring and layoffs it will match pretty well now what about the people who are talking about oh AI is coming to take our jobs Etc now look if we get a day when AI takes away programming jobs the world that we would have to be living in at the time is so different to the world that we live in today is that you not having a tech job is probably going to be the least of your problems because if tech jobs are taken away literally almost every other job besides like physical jobs like building buildings would have been taken away as well the point is that reality where AI has taken away programming jobs is a reality that we cannot really predict like this is such a different reality anyway there's really no point basing your decisions based on that potential outcome which leads us back to sort of square one of just asking yourself what do you actually want to do do you want to get into coding do you want to get into banking do you want to get into law whatever you actually think you would want to stick to for the next 10 years that is what you should do so let's go back to looking at the tech industry and fundamentally comparing it to the other high paying industry obviously there's a million Industries in the world but a big part of why people get into tag is because it's so high pay coding is one of the very few fields in the world where just with a 9 to-5 job you can build some serious wealth if you stick to it and you climb the ladder the other careers where you can do that banking law Consulting they all require you to work like 12 hour days like seriously I work for one of the biggest consulting firms in the world and it was the worst thing in the world I had to work for literally from 9 to 9 every single day and that was like a non normal day not even a busy day with tech you can make this kind of money while just working 9 to5 you won't see this in any other industry again as someone who's done this I've been a software engineer I've been a banker I've been a consultant the work of a softare engineer is so much more chill compared to these other high paying industry as a consultant you're always working you're always got meetings on your calendar you got these stressed out bosses that are screaming down your neck as a software engineer you're just sitting there with your laptop you got some bug that you have to solve today like well I'm not saying it's an easy job but comparatively speaking to the honor industry where you can make the kind of money you can make in Tech is a very freaking easy job because you also have a lot of work life balance which gives you time for life if that's what you're into or like a side hustle or something like that I literally ran this YouTube channel with like full-time work hours while I was working my 9 to5 software engineering job because I had the time for it I would not have had the time for it if I was an investment banker but of course it's not a perfect career no career is there's going to be cons the obvious con is if you don't like coding don't get into coding that's really what all of this comes down to do you want to code or do you want to make PowerPoint slides do you want to do excel do you want to sell real estate what do you want to do that is what you should do but a few things to consider about being a software engineer is that number one as a junior developer the kind of things you'll be doing are probably not as exciting as you think they will be like I had a lot more excitement building all of my own coding projects when I was learning to code myself and the cat of projects that I now build on my own than I ever did for the corporate job that I had that's why I left my corporate job quite early because I wanted to do something more exciting which is why I went to building my startup and that's a whole another story but if you're looking for something very like high Pace exciting something where you're building big things as a junior you're probably not going to be doing that you're going to be doing stuff like configuring some files you're going to be fixing minor bugs things like this so just understand that and the other con is that it's not the most social job in the world software Engineers tend to be the kinds of people that just want to sort of stick to themselves like I remember when I was working my job we had these daily stand up meetings like out of 20 people in the meeting maybe two people including me would turn on their camera like they literally colleagues that I worked with that I still this day I don't know what they look like because it was a remote job and no one would turn on that camera and it's just not the most social kind of environment maybe I was just unlucky obviously depends on the company everything like that but I had this colleague of mine who I was really close to and she was an extremely social person and she had transitioned from being a consultant to a software engineer and she wanted to go back from being a software engineer to a consultant specifically because she didn't like just how unsocial the job can be so that is something to definitely consider but barring those two things it's a pretty great career still and you shouldn't let these shortterm fluctuations in the economy determine what you do do what you want to do if you like coding you should learn it and don't overthink it but just understand that right now it is a bit more difficult but the jobs will eventually come back it is just unfortunate that we are in a bad economy right now and specifically today it is simply not enough anymore to just learn basic HTML and get an amazing job you can get an amazing job pretty quickly but you need to learn a bit more than you would have in the past obviously if you go through a program like course careers they're going to give you all of it and they're going to help you get that job after that if you don't want to do that that is completely fine as well but that is going to be your fastest way to do that so like I said before if you're interested in checking that out and you want the fastest way to break into the stre like many people who have gone through the program including some of you guys are now doing then you can check out the free course careers introductory course Down Below in the description which is going to give you a bunch of info about the industry beyond what I talked about here so you can continue from this video by at least watching that mini course and then if you decide to move forward you can do that and remember with my lick you get $50 off so go check that out thank you for watching the video keep coding I'll see you in the next one
