there's a good chance you've heard of Oppo they're a Chinese smartphone maker who set their sights on the West but in order to truly break into new markets you need a flagship product to lead the charge enter the Oppo find x2 Pro their highest end smartphone for 2020 and it's exactly what a flagship phone should be it's less experimental and a little bit more just Oppo taking everything they already do well and dialing it up to the next level in fact looking at the spec sheet it genuinely makes you wonder if they've just gone and topped the $1400 Galaxy S 20 ultra first off though let's unbox it and I gotta say this is smart phone packaging done bright it's got a kind of fractured gemstone aesthetic you really feel like you've sunk down some hard cash for this phone which is about right really the find x2 Pro retails for around twelve hundred euros nonetheless I've seen a lot of phone retail boxes this is top five and there's quite a lot of fun stuff inside taking the lid off that textured finish continues underneath there's your typical insert which has instruction manuals and a sim ejector tool and plus a clear and also lightly textured TPU case although you really not going to want to use it because of how nice the finish on the back of the phone is it gets better underneath that and of course the smartphone this beefy unit you're looking at is a 65 watt charging brick and following that there's a separate box containing some actually nice-looking wired earphones and inside the box a USB C charging cable so one thing becomes very clear when you take the plastic peel off the phone is textured at least it is on the ceramic version of the phone if you watched my dear smartphone makers video not too long ago you'll know that I specifically said that this is the kind of finish we need plus because it feels nice but textured because it adds grip and reduces the fingerprint problem I'm just gonna pretend that Oppo answered my prayers I would say this well the texture looks like it's really coarse it's actually not it's very slightly ridged I would have almost gone a little bit more but it's still enough to make a difference with fingerprints are still visible because it's a black phone but they're less than they would be without texture and the phone also avoids any kind of sticky clamminess that you can get with plain flat glass it also looks kind of icky almost in the right lighting like it's a liquid surface of sorts I think they could have done something crazy if they'd combined this with a gradient finish but hey it's nice also it does have ip68 water and dust resistance and it doesn't have a headphone jack just on a bit of a side note if you are enjoying this video a sub to the channel would be incredible no bear in mind that my point of reference here is this ludicrously expensive Samsung phone I'm surprised I'm saying this but the display is comparable both have a quad HD plus resolution which is kind of become a standard now but the new race is to do with refresh rates and here Oppo has a leg-up see the galaxy s 20 ultras display is absolutely balls to the walls fantastic but it does have one catch if you want to use its super fluid 120 Hertz display mode you've got to turn the resolution down at least for now it might be fixed in an update Oppo has no such limitation 120 Hertz and quad HD plus in simultaneity it's stunning but I should caveat this by saying that I personally wouldn't use both the max resolution and the max refresh rate leaning more towards saving my precious battery there is another cool finger op who has developed a technology that can add frames into the videos you watch to make them appear smoother I was trying it on a quad HD HDR video on YouTube and my god all of this put together is just phenomenal to look at as expected it's rated as an A+ display by display mate which is considered the current authority on screen tech and it's also all paired with stereo Dolby Atmos speakers both friends have bright panels and actually side by side if you pulled up a white page on each it becomes pretty clear that the Oppo can actually go brighter but that's likely because Samsung equips their phones with auntie Claire coatings and I still side with the colors of Samsung - either way you're getting a hole punch somewhere on the phone and I don't know ah pers is on the side Samsung's is in the middle I'm pretty indifferent but I'd be curious to know which position you guys prefer I got to say that Samsung this year tone down the curves on the sides of their displays and I didn't quite expect how much I'd enjoy that this find x2 Proust over quite a deep curve on it but again that's personal preference you probably assumed this anyways but I should also just reiterate that to use the find x2 Pro doesn't feel cheap the companies paid attention to the small things too like having a ridged power button and good quality soft haptics not the absolute best I've used but good anyways you're probably wondering what on earth is going on here well I spend a bit of time with the find x2 pros camera system and my current conclusion is that it's an improvement where it matters see I'm someone who like seeing good specs on a phone don't get me wrong but with cameras in particular it's really hard to get a good gauge on how the specs actually translate to the image quality so on paper it kind of seems like Samsung is going to rinse the oppo and hang it out to dry but that's actually not the case both are using new generation sensors for their main cameras Samsung's is 108 megapixel opposed is 48 but they're both going to end up with a 12 megapixel output the both phones also have ultra wide cameras and zoom cameras but I'll come to this the find x2 pros photos are great it can actually capture 12 bit color which should in theory allow for even more accurate captures than the 10 bit and 8 bit standards we've seen before it's got good dynamic range and while I haven't had the chance to do any kind of in-depth comparisons against the galaxy s 20 ultra I did take some shots on both at multiple different levels of zoom my first observation was that actually the ultra wide camera on the Oppo is better and this is cool I like the idea of having a consistent level of quality between all the lenses on my phone in going into the main camera though my preference flicks to Samsung its image processing does an amazing job of controlling the bright spots in the light fixtures and this advantage becomes even more clear at five times zoom if we focus on those pictures at the side for a second though you can actually see that oppose zoom detail is higher than the suppose it 100 times space zoom galaxy s 20 ultra but you can also see that the camera HDR needs some work then again I am using pre-production software so there's a good chance that can improve of course I also tried night mode photos on the Oppo and as expected they're good I wouldn't call it a Samsung killer the ultra actually takes better photos in ultra wide normal and zoom configurations but it's comparable except when you use tripod mode with the find x2 Pro where you attach it to a tripod or lean it against a solid surface and it will just capture for 30 seconds straight the results are staggering but I want to test this in more detail first what's interesting though is that you can tell oppose ultra wide sensor is better because the image looks completely grain free in the preview but Samsung's software processing is just impeccable so even with a less capable all tried sensor it can do more I do realize this isn't an auto versus Samsung video but I'm just using the s20 ultra so you guys have a point of reference the find x2 Pro also takes crispy 4k video at up to 60 frames per second with impressive stabilization and noticeably snappy focusing speeds you get that kind of professional DSLR background blur too thanks to the large sensor anyways the other thing that Oppo has traditionally done well is charging and yeah they weren't messing around here the find x2 has two separate stacked battery cells which allow it to charge completely in 38 minutes from empty that's nuts and a fair margin head of the hour it takes to charge the s20 ultra although that's hardly a bad time either I say that but I'm personally definitely in the camp of people that prefers battery life overcharging speeds I normally keep my phone charging overnight and then I expect to be able to use it for a full heavy day without worrying about always hovering around the main socket so charging speed is cool if you wake up in the morning and you've forgotten to charge overnight but more often than not it doesn't really affect me so I would actually side with the s20 in this battery category with it's beefy five thousand milliamp power cell compared to oppose four thousand two hundred and sixty million per one that's only just what I'd call acceptable for a phone with such a battery consuming display it's also worth just mentioning the software because Oppo have a shiny new coat of paint with color OS 7.1 I wasn't always a fan of color oh s a few years ago I would have said it's tolerable but far from ideal but nowadays it does feel like Oppo is listening the customization is at the center here tons of interesting live wallpapers and granular control over the way your icons look not to mention it's got a fantastic dark mode that literally coats everything you turn on this mode and all of your main applications now have a fresh coat of paint and one that saves battery the phone has new animations like when you uninstall an app it fan off snaps out of existence and you notice it in things like the weather app I can see why people don't like the way color OS looks but it's becoming tough to argue that it isn't polished no I'm not a huge gamer on my phone every now and again a game comes along that I'll play but even then the chipset is really important to me I'd say it's my third priority after battery life in camera because you've got to remember the chipset also impacts these things as well as gaming frame rates and just how generally responsive your friends gonna feel with that in mind then these two phones are the best of the best snapdragon 85 chipsets they both start with 12 gigs of ram and ufs 3.0 storage but one interesting and quite important difference is that the base model of the oppo rocks in with 512 gigs of storage Samsung's is only 128 and if you wanted to bump that phone up to 512 that sets you back $1600 or 1549 euros so while the Oppo is far from cheap it is around 350 euros cheaper than an equivalent s20 ultra opposed storage isn't expandable but with 512 gigs you probably fine and of course 5g is there on both if it applies to you so what do I think I think the Oppo is fantastic there's a few question marks surrounding camera optimization which I'll hope improves in an update and how well the battery will hold up over time but as a first impression I can't help but be excited by this one and I think it's a real contender for a galaxy s 20 ultra beater thanks a lot for watching
