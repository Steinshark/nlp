ladies and gentlemen welcome back to your favorite series on planet Earth guess the ELO in this series my subscribers bravely submit their chess games I analyze them and then I try to guess what playing strength they are we are 70 plus episodes into this series and it's been a while since I've uploaded an episode so I'm back with a very special one in this episode I did guess the ELO live live in a theater because you see one of the biggest suspicions about Guest the ELO is that I'm a huge scammer I'm a froster all right I know all of the ratings of the players before I see the games themselves well this time I was challenged with five games that I have never seen before I didn't know how they were submitted who submitted them and I competed on stage at the MIT Sloan Sports conference against feta Master James KY International Master Danny Ranch on the right side Grandmaster Robert hessen in the center the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team Daryl Mory and I'm going to show you highlights from the stage and guessing and we are going to jump into the games right now now you may not like this format and uh that's fine I I've been doing a lot of guesta Elo live in theaters while traveling for my book as well uh here we go okay so this was game number one the MIT Sloan analytics Sports conference fan is playing with the white pieces this is a FIV minute chess game and we opened up with D4 it was D5 it was a London so I guessed 1100 black played Knight C6 Knight F3 Bishop to F5 E3 E6 so far so good so far not a lot of information but this move on the second move by black already putting the Knight out in front of the C Pawn right away gave me anywhere from 800 to 1400 like the tail ends have been completely narrowed down right so we have Bishop 2 F5 E3 E6 Bishop D3 Bishop D6 and this next move gave me some more information about this position Knight E5 kind of like a aasal move like sort of jumping into the middle anytime you see these Bishops you really want to avoid taking you'd like to slide back um we have this trade and now black just gets really hostile all right the blatant disregard for King safety is definitely on display with G5 and F5 white plays H3 which is not a move that makes a lot of sense but they're trying to safeguard their Bishop Knight to F6 F3 is also not a move that makes a lot of sense but I guess they were trying to stop this queen E7 Knight D2 castles and now now we have Knight takes C6 losing the game on the spot this move was played with the intention to open up this and go Queen A6 however Knight C6 makes very little sense because if we back up two moves this bishop is protected two times so basically what happened in this position is white unstrapped the gigantic weight all right that was being strapped in and then they proceeded to drop a massive piece of Steel on their own face okay they un strapped the safety harness and they completely allowed the bishop I mean it's really incredible stuff the bishop was overprotected and now it can be captured and black didn't see it so again I'm thinking like 900 okay I'm thinking like around 900 white plays Queen A6 but Black's King is actually shockingly safe in the center of the board and white takes to try to open up the king and white takes a pawn but now black spots the Counterattack so again I'm I'm looking anywhere between 900 to about 11 or 1200 here King F1 G4 look at this attacking the king the King has opened up oh we lost the pawn we lost the pawn we're going to lose everything black doesn't see it now the position is back to equal the queen comes back to play defense Knight E4 is a horrendous move it's mate Knight E4 is trying to threaten mate but they completely forgot about this Pawn take so did white and Rook takes H7 is still possible and it's mate because the king is cut off so if the King goes there this is mate and if the King goes there it's oh my God Rook H7 white goes here are losing the game on the spot right back Queen E3 and now Rook H7 is no longer a winning move because King C8 you cannot go there cuz it's illegal G3 now the way you win this position is before you take the pawn you give a check so that on the very next move you take with a check you want to make sure every move is a check it's a very common tactic instead we have this but black is still completely winning King D2 Queen F2 check the King goes running the King goes running all the way up to see oh my God this is completely nuts it's going to be a draw no draw Rook takes H5 Rook B8 and now white is winning again Rook H7 check King C8 The Rook is hanging boom Queen B4 check very nice rook h8 and white has won all the Rooks is there more drama is white going to blunder a Perpetual no white safeguards the king queen A8 check Rook H7 and it's just a matter of time Rook D7 is Checkmate and the game is over that was very very crazy so it started out as a relatively straightforward and peaceful London white played 95 not really a move that makes a whole lot of sense right now besides traded black got way too aggressive white proceeded to completely weaken the bishop and blunder at a move later nobody noticed but then black got in and opened up the position like this black blundered Checkmate black blundered Checkmate again white didn't see it now white is completely lost and uh black is completely winning and black ranan out of moves that were useful and then black lost both of their Rooks so I originally thought it was around 900 but because I knew it was a Blitz game well I decided to adjust my guess a little bit and here's what happened what do we got 130000 okay okay last last we're going to let Levy go last he's the he's the world's expert on this darl you're the one you most that's not 1050 suck at back suck at back 97 2 okay and Levy you said 972 yeah I said 1120 okay this is fascinating because Levy is the closest wow what's the rating the rating is 1209 it's close between you and ky ky was second so James guessed 1300 Daryl Mory guessed 1050 Robert hes I mean seriously disrespectful stuff out here 972 although I did just tell you I also thought at first it was three digits uh but then I decided to adjust my guess and I said 1120 and the player with the white pieces was rated 1209 so I was uh 89 points away I was on the under actually James KY was 91 points away but he overestimated so it was close but I I I I the reason I made that call uh and you normally don't really get into my brain as much uh when I'm recording kind of live on stream is I I thought there was enough control in the game there was enough control now that may shock you because of these ridiculous moves but that's kind of a tough tactic to Spot while your queen is hanging so I sort of forgave that then there was a bunch of logical moves and then you know the big mistake again was the sort of continuity with 2 minutes 56 seconds I thought maybe they were 900 but I just thought white did a good job with what they had and with what they had they had pretty decent survival instincts and then they you know took their chance when they saw it again and and and then it was smooth sailing so that was game number one uh and I was closest but it was close I mean it was not you know it was not a perfect guess uh and so 1209 and so now we move to game number two and this game was hilarious so in this game we have E4 we have D5 it's a 10-minute game and we have F3 F3 right away tells you this is below a thousand and if it's over a th000 the person should never play chess again because I don't know how I don't know how many people you paid to lose to you to get to that rating F3 is just you know F3 is a beginner move you know you get hit with a Scandinavian you think I'm under attack I have to defend my no no no no no no no you never there's like no reason to put a Pawn on F3 it's very very rare in the opening that you have to do that in particular against the Scandinavian defense and this game got completely insane right away D4 Knight B5 E5 like when a game has a level of Randomness uh yeah you just got to go three digits and this game just looks like two toddlers sort of wobbling around like C4 just sort of trying to find their footing D3 threatening a fork by the way there was there was an on pissant there for the Keen you know Observer uh White plays Knight A3 have absolutely no idea if they spotted that or not Bishop E6 F4 like borderline losing after Pawn takes now black plays a tactic here that I don't think they realize Bishop takes giving up a bishop to get this Fork have no idea if that was the plan maybe it was now white of course can just move the king lose the rook and then act white loses the queen what what is happening why did they do that now they get this in Comes The Black Queen activating right now white gives a sneaky little check on D7 which doesn't do much and goes to B5 which also doesn't do much and now there is just a fork uh which black does not see and now there is Bishop takes C6 defending the pawn and if takes it's a fork white doesn't see that white attacks the queen this is a check the bishop is hanging the king is hanging we move the king the bishop can be taken it doesn't get taken the Bishop goes to C4 Knight F6 now now we're pinning oh my goodness we're pinning The Rook Knight G4 check is absolutely brilliant because not only does it hang a knight it hangs a knight and opens up an x-ray so Knight G4 is an absolutely genius move that loses 12 points of material it is not possible in chess to lose double digits of points of material in one move but black finds a way to do it white doesn't see it Knight E3 check really insisting on losing the Knight Queen F5 Queen H3 and then for some reason black went there and resigned resigned black resigned I think black thought it was mate or black had to get off the toilet at the office I don't know but black resigned okay so I looked at this game and I really regretted it and then after I was done regretting it I was like okay the you know I'm thinking 500 right like but but there's a cut off there's a cut off at around 5600 where you're you're playing decent games as a beginner but people are just like kind of tough like ELO Hellen chess is around 600 cuz you just can't find your way out of it um but uh but 400 and 300 is just nonsense like chess is just you know kind of all over the place um so I thought about it and ultimately uh here were the guesses a little higher no one saw little higher okay KY 748 okay we're in the same4 same order of 528 Levy 510 51 I'm I'm I'm so worried about my guest now once again Levy isos it was 420 okay this round I think everybody was a little worried of offending the person in the audience and again chess has nothing to do with your actual intelligence like if you're a chess beginner just like any sport you're going to do dumb things like my basketball ELO is probably about 420 you know I I if I shot 25 three-point shots I would make three or four five would be a miracle I would have a better shooting percent you know what I'm not going to roast anybody in the NBA um so 500 was around the cut off and I thought the game I I I really wanted to guess in the 400s uh I couldn't bring myself to do it I was closer than everybody but Robert this time got very close um yeah the I mean these folks just got to do their tactics do some puzzles stop making one move blunders when 80% of the game looks like you're playing air hockey like you know air hockey bum you know like it just total chaos like like you can't your chest can't look like air hockey it's got to look at least like Battleship or you know or Checkers this was complete chaos and uh indeed uh this player was rated 420 and and that's fine that's completely I mean it was good entertainment so I'm two for two all right I've been the closest to the ELO twice live on stage uh this is game number three and this was a this was a fascinating game I think this is the game that we that that we're looking at so this was D4 and unfortunately I mean I really wish that the you know the person that found these games didn't just Spam londons uh but this time you'll notice the bishop went back to G3 remember the first game we analyzed very first game and I already had information because when the bishop went to D6 white didn't play this so right away I'm thinking okay this is an intermediate this is like a 14500 level player now this is blitz so think you got to compare Blitz and Rapid most people Blitz two 300 points lower than the rapid right so Bishop E2 okay C5 C3 very nice bad move that's a weird move C4 is not good in the London because white can very quickly get out of that situation and does and now here for some reason white doesn't go A4 like it's the most natural followup and black can't go here because of this intermediates know this pattern white did not so I'm thinking okay 12300 that's what I'm thinking right so A6 castles castles Rook C1 and now I really hate what white does I mean I mean white trades and has nothing white has no like why did white put the Rook on C1 if they were going to open the file right very shortsighted decision- making if you wanted to open up the queen side why didn't you put the Rook on like The Rook is a beast on B1 and on C1 I mean this is just Rook hatred you're going to have to play Rook B1 which white does Rook B1 Rook B1 right like you got to now black is attacking the center black is actually you know kind of doing exactly what you're supposed to do in London we have a massive exchange and this also gave me information strong intermediates at 15600 might keep the tension like just cuz you can take doesn't mean you have to just cuz you can take the bishop doesn't mean you have to but okay I'm loving this white is back in the game by the way there's a tactic here there's a pawn Pinn to a Queen Bishop takes Pawn so again I have enough information now where I'm I'm comfortably around that 1300 level I don't think the tactics are good enough to be 16700 I don't think the decision making has been that good but we're now that it's definitely a free Pawn what the fact that white went here again and put a rook again on such a pass like not even Rook D1 you know not even Knight D2 you're so worried about the Knight trade the Knight okay Rook I mean I wanted to barf when I saw this A5 by the way Bishop C4 is still possible because you would take the Knight Bishop C4 Pawn takes you wouldn't take the queen you would take the Knight so white just doesn't see this this right Rook B6 is a nice idea it's a nice idea black plays a great move that's a great move and now now now now black is just totally winning because black got the C3 Pawn uh you know Knight went back to B5 for some reason hanging this now black has the pawn on C very scary Queen C2 Queen B2 uhoh take oh Knight C3 oh and white hangs the bishop white hangs the bishop I mean that's you know of course you had to move the bishop out of the way and protect promotion with 149 I thought that was spotle so I'm I'm I'm in my mind I have a guess I mean it's definitely not above 1500 what like of course it's not above 1500 I mean they just hung a KN for no reason and now they hung their pawn and now now that's it that's oh my God what what is going on oh why are we just you you get in an end game you got to think who has the better minor piece it's probably white I mean White's Knight is so powerful but you know I thought the players were a little trade happy and then black hung M won I mean what do you want me to do like how do you lose a rook and four rook and four end game with a minute and a half guys this is crazy so just that one final moment just this one moment like because again it's all about control it's all about like not making these one movers right I mean King how does how did Black go here and not leave you got to exit through the door that you entered like how did you just go in and anyway so we started guessing and this is what we came up with Robert H guess 1321 oh my God 132525 James KY that's bad for you in Price is Right 1500 game 15 I actually think 125 okay W we'll see okay for the first time we have a different winner James KY is Clos W and wow Josh's rating is actually 1704 explain yourself no I'm kidding you don't have a micl J Money in a first time ever will be calling up Josh I guessed 12:15 that game I was completely wrong I guess 12:15 hes and Daryl were closer at 1300 KY said 1500 and afterwards not only did I uh did I have the shame of having such a poor guest I had to speak to Josh so imagine I do guess the ELO and I make fun of y'all at my desk Josh came up to me after and he said you want to step outside and I said no thank you he didn't actually he he didn't do that he was very nice uh but I told him listen I had a lot of reasons to not think Josh was 1700 and I meant that in the most respectful way moves like H6 and again his opponent is also 1680 so the average of this game is around 1,700 C4 is not a 1700 type of move not playing A4 is not a 17 I thought that Josh made a lot of questionable decisions but I guess in hindsight I should have just been like well he didn't make a lot of blunder so I don't know I I don't know I don't know I I stand by my guess you know what I mean like this was more of a 13400 kind of game and then as it got deeper these blunders like not bringing the night out is oh my goodness I was totally wrong uh I was off by about 500 points so that one was bad uh but you know uh we're going to bounce back we're going to bounce back and so in this game uh I think this is the first time that a person has played with the black pieces if I'm not mistaken yet we've had a bunch of people playing with the white pieces uh now we're you know Sloan fan with the black pieces and this one right away Carl Khan is great Bishop C4 so Bishop C4 is known as the hillbilly a lot of beginners face this but the real hillbilly it's actually called the hillbilly attack by the way I am not trying to be funny um the real hillbilly is to Gambit the pawn this is the real hillbilly where you do this and then Queen H5 and you threaten mate not mate but you know Devastation but a lot of people play Bishop C4 D5 and some of you have like written in about my Carl Concourse and you say Gotham this is not in the Carl Concourse it's not cuz it's garbage I can't cover everything all right like if you're opponent plays this it's not in the Carl Concourse cuz it's a bad move can't cover every iteration you know what I'm saying um this is just bad because it's just an exchange caran pawn takes Pawn takes white just goes here and you're just playing an exchange caran and now it gets even worse this was so FR white went here so white has made five moves and one two three of them are with the bishop and guess where that Bishop is going next it dies you can't play chess like this you can't play one two three four Bishop moves it it white hasn't developed any pieces so right away we're below a thousand right away we're either below a TH or we're just above 1,000 where people just don't care about their opening so now I'm going to find out just how well you know white is doing Bishop D6 Knight F6 I don't even think about it great knight F3 castles I love the way black is playing this black is doing an excellent job activating every piece two wh's credit after that garbage opening white is also playing fine you know B4 is not a bad move A3 is not a bad move and the truth is it's actually kind of hard to break through a position like this because okay there's light squired weaknesses but what do you do with them to be honest I would probably trade put a rook on the a file maybe bring my queen out to trade those Rooks like that and then infiltrate that's what I'm thinking or plop a knight into the center you know and then rely on my breaks here but it's kind of complicated rookie eight I don't blame you now white trades the bishop again this type of Bishop hatred like this type of putting the bishop in trading for the Knight it's got to be a thousand like we we got to be at the 10,00 level Knight bd2 now bringing the queen to the home Square why eight times out of 10 at intermediate and beginner level going backwards is bad don't go backwards at least go laterally Rook A8 Rook A8 Queen d8 oh my goodness take take white is fine after all that nonsense white still has a good position what and now you hang this and now white can take this three different ways and also white can trade Rooks white goes here and hangs a fork oh my oh my goodness great move by the way by black take this Queen takes now if I want to attack here I'm going to go in like this G5 is bananas G5 doesn't make sense on any Planet none of the planets discovered not discovered dwarf planets G5 doesn't even begin to make sense the queen goes in which is bad because the Rook comes here now the queen has to get out now the king comes in for some reason black hangs a pawn bishop goes to F4 black hangs a rook what did Black expect to happen when the queen went on this diagonal why couldn't you just continue I don't know I have no idea Queen takes A8 but Queen takes C3 Queen F3 you don't trade Queens here if you're playing Black very nice now for some reason white just hates the Rooks activate the Rooks you are upper Rook you beginners need to use what you're winning by no G3 Bishop E5 please use it thank barely but we got there for some reason Black's King is coming to the party Knight to B3 we hang our only Advanced Pawn Knight goes back we hang the Knight we don't take the Knight now if I'm playing with white here I'm Trading the Queens I'm not even thinking about it that's another way to do it because it hangs the Knight Queen E4 check we're going to make a draw we're going to repeat moves no draw okay we trading Queens not even that bad of a move rook and Bishop versus rook and Rook is tough to win we don't do that F5 we need two now we go King F6 we're looking at naughty things over here okay okay and we got to protect our King we don't for some we just don't we we don't do it the king comes in oh my God oh my goodness we going to make a draw oh my my goodness oh he yankes the queen now it's a draw because the white king is stuck in the center of the board Kink actually you can't do anything if you block I'm going to go Rook C2 and Rook D2 and you can't move unless you do it this way and hang a queen which they don't take and now we go to an end game and white is completely winning and what ends up happening in this game is no white is no longer completely winning and now white is completely winning and white wins all the pawns but white loses on time so the game ends in a draw utter chaos horrendous play in the opening zero knowledge of the opening then actually a pretty decent game of chess okay decent was a strong word but you know like before we put the bishop on the D3 Square it was good it it was a back and forth game which is why we guess just this okay I'm going to say 8:48 oh I'm so scared yeah 8:43 wow wow oh man I'm so I 11 11 I went 1120 wow no way come on got to800 we've got these guys dialing in I'm going to let the board reveal crazy how close this was go ahead wow4 I win Ben are you here 84 okay wow very close I actually have a numerical dyslexia I wanted to guess 884 can you imagine if I guessed 884 instead of 848 I guessed 848 it was 884 uh so I was five points closer than Robert hes yeah I think Robert and I were both dialed in on that guess we we definitely knew from around here that probably the ceiling was 1,100 and the game was pretty good and you know generally 8 and 900s and even 1000s can play at that level and slightly higher this sequence of moves was kind of at that level but then the 800 kicks in like right like again incessant wanting to trade the Bishops for the knights hanging the bishop in one move and then back to air hockey chess E5 night takes total chaos you hang this and then for some reason like it's just it's pandemonium but it was not at the level of chaos as the 400 game and even 600 like there was still a bunch of logic behind some of these moves but it was coupled with completely absurd blunders like hanging this which is why 7800 is The Logical guess I actually wanted to go even lower but I guess this person was uh was in fact 884 with the black pieces there Ben uh and that takes us to our to our final game of the day so we're back to the white pieces and um this was a D4 and an England Gambit so again England Gambit could be played by an advanced player but probably not uh but maybe right and it's a Blitz game because you don't know three minute game I play the England Gambit sometimes in Blitz and bullet uh so Knight C6 Knight F3 Queen E7 okay white knows what they're doing big moment here does white know what they're doing everybody knows now Knight C3 if you don't know the England Gambit that's okay you're probably a beginner that's life you will learn the England Gambit Rook B1 right Rook B3 okay I was really impressed because Knight D5 is like one of the best moves so clearly white has studied their stuff maybe maybe maybe they studied I mean it's it it spent them nine you know they spent nine seconds now Queen A5 loses the game Knight D5 simultaneously attacks the pawn on C7 and the bishop which is why black needs to go back with the bishop to defend the pawn and get out of the way of the Knight they don't do that and now white is winning Bishop takes B4 Knight takes B4 and you need to take with the Knight and that wasn't the best move by the way you should have taken with the Knight itself to maintain this diagonal control the reason this is not winning is because black can attack the Knight which has to protect the Rook you should not pin yourself like like this it's very dangerous and they do that great move so I'm thinking okay we can't be in the three digits because the fact that black even spotted C6 is very impressive by the way if you're wondering C5 also works technically not there's like some ridiculous engine defense here but it's it it works so C6 C3 cd5 and now we just play chess now we had this you know chaos in the opening knight7 and keep in mind that after E3 Knight E7 um if I'm playing white here I'm just going Bishop E2 like Bishop E2 Bishop D3 and I'm castling white plays Knight D4 which is either genius because it stops Knight C6 or it's a bad move but after this bishop E2 Knight C6 is sort of you know take take and castles and um listen to get here after this kind of opening blunder and you know just one mistake just one mistake and then a bunch of good moves I'm thinking okay it's probably four digits it's probably four digits because of the way it's being played so we have Bishop E2 right we have this position and if I'm playing Black I'm I'm getting out with the queen but I'm castling too so I'm castling Queen D4 this is great black is just up a pawn and black has no weaknesses while white has a weakness doubled pawns and no a pawn like if if I'm playing Black I get my queen to safety and I Advance my a pawn I just make white have to defend so let's see what happens Queen H4 excellent excellent move hangs a pawn but you need to do something you need to create counterplay now in theory this is good but I would have liked to see a pawn attack sometimes the easiest way to start an attack on your opponent is with the pawns look Bishop F5 look at this G4 if the bishop goes anywhere you're going to play F5 F6 also the pawn is hanging so unfortunately the way white does this is white loses the entire house so white lost that that and that now now now white is down three pawns and black can just go and as long as black doesn't get checkm it's game over and I got news for you a nobody's getting mated here Bishop D3 G6 or H6 you can't do this cuz of the bishop if I'm playing with black here I'm just pushing my and that is exactly what black does look at this this is perfect now white is totally lost this great play by black F F4 Queen G7 fine F5 now this is bad because the queen can get walled in and this is really depressing look at this Queen and that the craziest part is if white plays this a little bit longer and gets this this is really terrible for black this is hilarious and apparently the engine still thinks it's winning which is really funny so F5 all right B4 FG to open up the position takes white sacrifices but that's a losing move because Rook takes Rook which black doesn't play but it's still losing probably but now it's Queen d8 now white is at least getting a draw Rook F3 oh my goodness King E6 black is winning Queen B6 queen d8 queen it's M Queen F6 is m one it's m one move Queen F6 is m one they don't see it Rook A6 now the queen comes up Queen F6 is made one again it's made one again oh safe Queen G4 king take the bishop no take the B King C5 Queen that's it run over here you you survive you run to the corner no and the players repeat moves and make a draw now that's a lot of info the early Gambit knowing how to play the Gambit blundering a piece but then counter blundering it back then a pretty normal game white goes for an attack sacrificing literally everything black does very well with counterplay white does very well with counterplay white sacrifices which is not the best way so a lot of information and then at the end cerebral enough to take a draw although not the best decision for black let's see what the guesses all right darl you're up come on get us one what you got 1070 okay all right okay J okay now Robert you want to go next 1177 within 100 points of each other 1250 1170 1170 damn boy same wavelength dang they do look like the rating was 1159 wow I won so it ends with me guessing 11 points away from the person from Ice cubed Great Name by the way I said 1170 and the opponent was 1173 I mean listen I went four for five I had four of the five closest guesses and then you know the Josh game I I guess 1215 he was 1700 we're just going to ignore that conveniently four out of five live games never obviously never seen them before uh different time formats rapid Blitz uh and uh yeah at the end me and Robert had two guesses that were really really close together but um 1170 in this game just made sense I mean it seemed like an intermediate player early intermediate definitely a lot of control in the game a lot of logic but still flaws and you know still room for improvement so my first ever Live guest the ELO I went four out of five and I had some pretty close guesses 30 40 points away 11 points away at the end uh hey you can't mess with the guess to ELO King let me know if you enjoyed this concept and I I do have a little bit of special news I will probably later this year or in you know 2025 I will do live events in the US Europe and maybe other parts of the world as well and a lot of that will be fans fan events but a lot of live guests ELO too so I look forward to it you know the drill get out of here
