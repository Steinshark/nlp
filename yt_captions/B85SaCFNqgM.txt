watch this is on all season tires hello everyone and welcome today is a beautiful day not just because it's sunny outside but because we are sitting inside of the c8 Corvette the brand new 2020 Corvette the day has arrived to test this thing out and right off the bat they're getting that launched in so the big change of course with this Corvette is that the engine is no longer up front now it's in the back and as a result you get this very impressive lunch it actually feels kind of like an all-wheel drive car as far as how the launch is executed because it is so quick off the line and this is on all season tires you can actually get this with stickier summer tires and yet on these specific Michelin all season tires it still launches really well which I'm super surprised by now once you get into second gear I mean first gear has a really aggressive ratio and it really hits you with that torque once you get into second gear you do start to kind of feel it start to taper off the power is very good 95 horsepower with the optional exhaust you're down 5 horsepower there if you don't have that optional performance exhaust and 470 pound-feet of torque so the thing moves and of course as you get to higher speeds it's not going to move quite as quickly but the launch off the line with this thing is insanely good thanks to the placement of that engine we started to see with the previous generation Corvette that as it got more horsepower its 0 to 60 didn't improve and that's because it was traction limited not power limited and now we're back in the scenario where this car right here is back to being power limited and so we're going to start to see quicker and quicker variants of this vehicle as it continues on into production but we are starting with the very first the base Corvette and you know impressive that they're able to bring this in with a starting price at about 60,000 dollars you can option it up as high as you'd like this card that we're sitting in right now is about $75,000 you can get the z51 Performance Package for an extra 5 grand it adds a ton of features certainly worth doing this one we are sitting in is not that z51 tomorrow we're going to be spending some time at the track to get a feel for those upgrades and it's quite the list better tires better breaks better suspension it has a more aggressive final drive ratio it has revised front splitter and rear spoiler they even allow you to adjust the spring height at each of the different corners so you can corner balance it with the z51 package quite cool that that's included on a car right out of the factory so let's dive through the different systems on this car with the logical place to start being at that engine so it's a 6.2 liter engine it's right behind me their overhead valve meaning that this engine has two valves per cylinder it's still using push rods and there was a time actually my channel is old enough now that it was in existence before the c7 launched and when the c7 Corvette lunch I kind of complained and said why would GM still be making an engine with two valves per cylinder and this outdated push rod technology and over the years I've come to appreciate exactly how awesome this engine is I mean it has a large wide flat torque curve it makes great power four hundred ninety five horsepower is plenty its good torque it's compact it's lightweight relative to its size and so there's a lot of benefits of pushrod engines and yes you could have higher breathing this thing revs to 6,400 rpm and then it's done it's not that high of a revving engine but it has the torque band and that's actually what you're using and so as far as accessible power accessible torque you know you've got the whole rev range and it's fun throughout it so I've really been enjoying this engine and it is quite spectacular when you put your foot down we did just pass a cop but I think that means there that way so so they made some revisions to this engine so that it's able to make more power one of the big changes is because it's no longer up front it's no longer going to obstruct visibility and so they're able to put the hood down lower and with the engine back here they can actually increase the size of the intake manifold which is more beneficial for those higher and power the top end of the engine and so because there you've increased that size of the intake manifold it doesn't really obstruct your view because it's not in front of you so the hood height is still good and you get more power so they say by revising that intake manifold equal length runners and a larger Planum first time it's had equal length runners they're able to eke out another 3% horsepower from this engine another change is instead of the exhaust pipes going down the exhaust pipes come up and by improving the exhaust flow they've increased power another 1% so this engine fairly simple in design you just have one camshaft sitting in the center of that Veet it does have variable valve timing though of course that affects both intake and exhaust simultaneously because it's just that one cam chef and then you've got push rods to open and close those intake and exhaust valves now to help with some of the burden that those push rods add and reciprocating mass the intake valves are actually hollow and the exhaust valves are sodium filled to help bring some of the heat away from that combustion chamber so an improvement in power with the new engine and it's stuck behind you now and then that is matched to an 8-speed and for the first time with a corvette dual clutch transmission so these shifts are actually superb and the sad news here is that there is no manual transmission and yes there should be a manual transmission and I'm sad that it's not here however this is a very good tool clutch so you can push this little manual button right here another cool thing they do with the manual version is if you rev it all the way it will just sit there it's not gonna force a shift so it's purely your control it's not gonna say okay we're not gonna let you do anything stupid if you want to just sit there at 6400 rpm it'll let you which you shouldn't do but the option is there to put it in manual mode and it will completely just be at your control which is nice and with that manual shifting mode the shifts are so fast so just like the design strategy with a Shelby gt500 where these paddle shifters are connected directly to the transmission control unit so both of them have Tremec transmissions both of them having the paddle shifters go directly to the transmission control unit and so this eliminates a lot of the delay and when you push the button and when you actually get the shift so the shift comes very quickly after pushing that button and it is nice to have that response dual clutch transmissions are a beautiful thing if you're not going to have three pedals so just wish they would have at least offered it as an option however manuals make up less than 2% of sales in the United States so you can kind of get why they didn't do it even if it makes me very sad why'd you have to make me sad from that transmission we of course split the power through a differential now in the car that I am sitting in right now it has a mechanical style differential and then you can upgrade to the z51 package and get an electronic limited slip differential that can actually vary the pressure on that clutch pack so it can they be basically open up to a hundred percent lockup and so it gives you complete control through you know tuning for various scenarios how much lockup do you want to have in that limited slip clutch versus this just has a set load on it and so you know different styles there personally I tend to prefer this mechanical style clutches because there's no guessing and what the computer is doing you always know how your differential is going and sometimes I've found mechanical limited-slip diff to be a little twitchy because that does something you don't expect that's what I haven't driven this latest version with the electronic limited slip dip so I can't speak to that directly but previously I have enjoyed mechanical style limited slip differentials quite a bit and you get that with the base car so you know you might be wondering can anyone actually get into this for sixty thousand dollars and for the first model year the answer is yes and honestly you don't necessarily need to have that z51 package if you're never gonna push it this is on all season tires and it still has like 0.99 G's of lateral grip it's still 0 to 60 in three seconds the z51 gets to zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds so yes it's a little bit quicker it's $5,000 more is it worth it yes you get a lot of upgrades for that z51 package but if you know you're not the type of person that needs all that stuff you don't and the car still gonna be really fast how fast this thing has a top speed of 194 miles per hour from that differential we go out to the tires and we get to our brakes those brakes Brembo brakes quite big actually larger diameter in the rear then up front though the front has a slightly wider width so because this has a 40 60 weight distribution a lot of the braking is reliant on those rear rotors and so they're quite large relative to what you would see on a front-engine car 20 inch wheels in the back 19 inch up front and 305 s in the rear for plenty of grip so this car has really good stopping distance really good acceleration one of the interesting things though about the grip in this car is that if you look at the peak performance numbers they're actually less according to motor trends testing of braking and lateral G versus the previous generation and so they've upgraded from a pilot super sport to a pilot sport for s however grip has gone slightly down and so I was asking the chief engineer you know what's going on with the grip here why has performance actually gone down and he said in this car for this generation they actually sought out let's not just go for the record book numbers that you can put in that magazine we're trying to have a more balanced car that's more approachable in all livable aspects and so one of the things that's greatly improved in this car versus the previous generation is how well the tires perform when it starts to get colder and how well the tires perform when it is wet outside so it's going for a broader reach of when is even the ideal conditions it has a larger range of when it's going to be quite capable out on the road so kind of cool I was just a little disappointed that some of the peak numbers weren't as good as I was expecting them to be now that it has better weight distribution for braking test scenarios now I will continue to believe that any car could be made that that weighs less but at the price point this is coming in at the fact that it's thirty five hundred thirty-five pounds is actually a pretty respectable curb weight all things considered what you're getting I mean this interior is actually genuinely nice especially for Corvette to me it was a little off-putting at first because there's a lot of things going on in here and it's kind of distracting to the eye but as far as Corvette interiors goes it's a way nicer as far as the materials all the shiny stuff that you see is actually real metal the layout it's all oriented towards the driver I'm not sold so far on this steering wheel in this weird shape that it is I feel like the nine and three are actually forces you to put your hands down a little bit rather than right at the sides something about that I find a little bit strange but overall the interior is definitely a huge improvement over the previous generation something else really impressive is the fact that the ride quality is so good and yes right now we're just on this crazy nice flat road and so we're not going to notice the ride quality but we were driving through Las Vegas earlier today in all kinds of bumpy situations within the city and it actually handles it really well and it's a nice comfortable ride so the suspension tuning is excellent double wishbone suspension up front double wishbone suspension in the rear and you can upgrade to the Magna reel a jackal if I said that anywhere near close to accurate who knows but the magnetic style suspension you can upgrade to and improve ride quality through that because it can adapt to all kinds of different scenarios and do so very quickly so let's get into the driving experience sitting in here and they say jet fighter inspired just like everyone says the interior of their sports cars jet fighter inspired but everything really is turned to you quite a bit and has a passenger I honestly wasn't that stoked about riding in this car because you're kind of completely separate from the driver this is a driver's car everything is for the driver and nothing is for the passenger over there yeah they have their own little controls on this weird Center stock thing but your your really you know left behind over there and it's just all about the driver in this car so you know that could be a little bit challenging if it's like hey would you figure out the navigation it's like no there's like a wall of China in the way sorry I can't get to it but regardless for the driver it's actually pretty cool now as far as visibility I was actually expecting based on what I had read about this car that it was going to be better and part of the thing is yes you know the front of the car is much closer to you but you're also pretty far away from the windshield and so you kind of do have this narrow slit and it's not the visibility off the front is bad it's just kind of narrow and the windshield is really far away from you so it wasn't as amazing as I kind of read about you know how great the visibility in the new car now that you're right up front and then looking out the back is awful so rear visibility out through this hatch I mean it's just terrible and part of that it's a mid-engine right so it's complicated to make that visibility good I think some other mid-engine cars have done a much better job of it and as a result one of the things they do is they give you a digital mirror here if you have you know eyes that can adjust the digital mirrors that quickly looking back and forth you can use a traditional style mirror and look out the back it's just you don't really see anything so you might as well just use the digital one and the digital one is actually pretty nice driving this thing it just feels really approachable because even from a dick even just from 0 miles per hour you stomp on it you're expecting okay I'm gonna get some wheel spin and instead it just takes off because it's got all the weight on the rear axle and so it can actually handle the power that it has and that's what's really cool about it's just a very approachable very fast machine because all the weights sitting there on top of those driven wheels and so when you want to put power down it does it and this rode in on the speed limits ban about miles per hour on it and you never come anywhere close to feeling like oh like we're pushing it like this thing is just on a casual stroll out here and tomorrow I'm gonna get to spend some time on the track and kind of really stretch its legs and see what it feels like but today it's just you know this this thing can handle so much more than we're putting at it right now and it's cool that it has that approachability feel like the interior is a bit intimidating you feel like you're in something super expensive just kind of looking at the exterior of the car looking at the interior of the car the way it's designed it's like this thing's a beast it's ready to go but when you start driving it actually it's it's very simple and it's forgiving and it lets you do what you want to do and it makes you kind of feel Oh actually I know what I'm doing when you know it's actually a lot of clever engineering that went into creating that feeling so it's it's a cool vehicle to drive as far as the throttle pedal feel I mean it's hard to beat naturally aspirated engines and really this thing just has a great torque curve across the RPM range so you never really feel like it's lacking when you put your foot down even if you've gotten into you know a little bit of a lower rpm it still got plenty of rent there and then if you actually shift correctly yeah it's ready to move so and this transmission so fast the shifts are so fast they say under 100 milliseconds for shifting and it is hardly perceptible of course with dual clutch transmissions you get constant torque so it's really neat you're just shifting between two clutch packs so you're always have positive acceleration very cool feeling how's our brake pedal yeah there we got some wheel spin all right little less grip on that cement bridge at sea versus some of the other pavement we've been on actually spun up a little bit that's pretty fun they've also added a ton of customization here so there's about six different drive modes two of them you can actually create the parameters of what you want them to be one of which being this Z mode where there's a button right here on the steering wheel that you can push and it defaults to kind of a mix between sport and track mode so nicely you can customize your own individual modes of you know you just hit that button and you're in exactly all the settings that you want and it will leave that when you turn the car on and off as far as the steering there are different modes so it's going to feel different depending on which mode you're in right now it feels pretty light and we're in a touring mode and overall you know the response is certainly there which is nice and so it's got somewhat of a high ratio fifteen point seven to one but quite responsive and this is on all season tires so usually you know I feel like if I'm on an all season tire gonna probably start to see the response fade away and it's not doing so on this so the steering feels good and again it just kind of feels very approachable it doesn't feel scary in any way and often with like the zo6 of the previous generation and who knows what it would be like with this but it was a bit intimidating to drive and this doesn't have that intimidation it just says go for it but the real story of course with this car is the value you know if you go back 20 years and you look at the Ferraris and the McLaren's of the world yes they were doing things that you know nobody else was doing but that's because nobody else cost as much right and so it's like it's a it's a performance for the valuing and if you look at today companies are doing everything that Ferrari is doing right and now Corvettes coming in and saying look we can be just like that zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds with a naturally aspirated rear-wheel drive vehicle for $60,000 I mean it's just unbelievable the amount of performance that you're getting from this thing for the dollar these there's kind of cars that have created these new waves of performance whether it was you know the Nissan GTR in 2008 or the Tesla Model S showing us how fast we can get longitudinal acceleration just in a straight line zero to 60 in 2.4 seconds especially considering its price and you know now we've got a $60,000 car that's hitting 60 in 3 seconds quite quite impressive thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below and I'm gonna get back on the throttle so we're gonna do you
