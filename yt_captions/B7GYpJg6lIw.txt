ladies and gentlemen in this video we are going to answer a relatively straightforward question that might be on many of your minds and that question is should you spend money on the game of chess now the answer to this question could then extend to other parts of your life and answer a more broad question like should I spend money on any of my hobbies will it make me happy will it make me improve the way this video is structured is I will have an overarching document guideline by which we will go then I will show you three examples of individuals who have spent money on chess and in my opinion have spent money more the correct way then not the correct way they are subscribers they are volunteers very brave and I've never made a video like this so we're going to see how it goes here's the overarching document that we will drive this video by our chess courses a waste of money and our Guiding Light will be no but or yes if all right chess courses are not a waste of money if you ensure the material you are learning is applicable if you choose quality over quantity and if you do not if you understand that spending money does not equal results chess courses are a waste of money if you don't study accurately or you fake study you are not the correct level for the course or you cheat and the last two things to remember are progress is not linear and you need to spend within your limits and now we are going to get into the volunteers but right before we do that let's let's just address something from a a very straightforward philosophical perspective and let's also remember that I am mildly biased in the sense that I literally do have chess courses right that is one major component of Gotham chess if you enjoy the videos you may or may not enjoy some of my courses opening courses beginner courses middle game courses endgame tactics Etc um so why would anybody spend money on anything right like I suppose we should get philosophical like that well it let's say provided you you have the money to spend that's a very good starting point some everybody's in a different spot financially right we're also all over the world different currencies are worth different things so really the first stepping stone is can you I mean beyond that like are you a teenager or are you an adult with a job you might be an adult with a job but you're not in a position where you can afford to spend 6080 $100 on chess or another hobby that you might have and that's okay you might be watching this as a 12-year-old and you're not going to be able to convince your parents to buy you a chess course regardless that's the first step like I have had people reach out to me and say hey I'm waiting for my next paycheck uh and then I'm going to get this course but you know your sale is going to expire so would you mind extending the sale to me I've gotten emails like that and it's like I don't think you should be investing in a hobby that might not have a payoff if you're waiting for your next paycheck you understand what I'm saying like that is a very important component number one number two let's say that's met let's say you do want to spend some money on your hobby I spend money on my hobbies I like tennis I like squash uh you know I uh we we like hiking sometimes like in New York you don't always Rent A Car you don't always own a car we don't so you you know you might Rent A Car you might do something along those lines but I like to spend money on on certain things uh if you like reading you're going to buy books you know if you if you like doing certain thing you're going to buy puzzles you're going to you whatever you're going to spend a little bit of money on things that you enjoy because they make you happy same applies to chess now can you learn chess for Zer probably but the experience of learning chess especially as an adult spending no money is a daunting one it's not that easy for those of you that have done it it's a lot of bootstrap effort like it's the same as going to to the gym and you know you you don't really spend money on supplements or personal training or anything like you just you just go to the gym a lot and it it's possible but some people like to work with a trainer some people like a coach teaching them how to play tennis and improving at tennis like for me so it depends like it depends what your situation is can you afford it and remember quality over quantity don't overspend money now let's jump into certain examples example number one which I'm going to get into right now is a person named Ian right Ian is rated around 1100 all right and Ian uh sent me this game and the way we're going to do this is we're going to go one by one all right I'm going to go in reverse actually Ian's information is unknown and Ian said before I bought the E4 course I only played the ponziani didn't like the positions I really wanted something offbeat and the Vienna was the perfect choice I study once every two or three days for a few hours uh ever since I got the course I only play with in the E4 course I've been a monster always remember the 69% win rate with the Gambit thank you Gotham uh you're welcome Ian let's keep this in mind you must ensure the the stuff you spend money on is applicable it's not too high level it's not too low level and he got one course he did not buy all the courses you don't have to buy all the courses you don't have to buy all the stuff let's see how he does he studies for a little bit a couple hours a day so the funny thing to me is that he sent me this game and this was a game that he beat to 900 right he played the Vienna he played the Vienna Gambit his opponent accepted it he played Pawn 2 E5 his opponent pinned the pawn to the king he blocked went here and his opponent immediately lost the game with this move D6 now I want you all to pay attention because this everything you see here all of this is actually covered for free you can actually get this for free you say what are you talking about yeah so he bought the E4 course but it just so happens that if you go to my courses website click on courses go to the E4 course and click Start the free sample because there's a free sample every course comes with a free sample it just so happens that literally the very first thing was E4 E5 Knight C3 F4 and then you pin the pawn to the king and then you stop the check D6 and this position look at this position Knight to D5 look at his game Knight to D5 it's the same exact position it just so happens that the free sample is really applicable to the 1,000 level in the in the in the game uh Ian's opponent did not play the best move which is this and not losing the queen in the game Ian's opponent went here or rather that he went there first and then Ian took and took all his pieces oh he actually did play the best move but then then he blundered his Queen so he actually did play all of that now Ian has the rest of of the course so Ian's obviously going to learn all of this and and have a very good win rate in the Vienna and the incredible thing is he used to play like a pretty you know solid e45 he actually scored quite decently he wins 73% of his games with the Vienna 73% that is insane that is nuts and he studies it every now and then for a couple of hours a day and clearly he's had success so for Ian who I believe is an adult I don't know if he has kids I don't know if he's I don't know but it seems like for him one course one course is not a waste of money now if Ian had like six courses he spent too much money you know there's no point you can't wear all six pairs of shoes there's no point buying six pairs of shoes with a course you got to go slowly that's what I think especially if you're like a thousand you need a little bit of time so quality over quantity and the quality is high the quality is high clearly it's working and here's a slightly longer game which you know was not exactly this is now chapter 2 and three of the Vienna Okay so Ian has a the the E4 course and he he misplayed it you know his opponent played in a very weird way his 1100 rated Blitz opponent and what you're supposed to do here is you're really not supposed to push so quickly but the opening gives Ian confidence and confidence is what you need when you play when you when you pay for something all right if you're if you're paying for tennis lessons soccer basketball like you go to personal training you go to the gym whatever Ian sacrifices a bishop it's completely the wrong move it's not what he's supposed to do but because he's fueled with the Vienna he just goes for it I mean it's changed his playing style right he plays an opening that fits his playing style he gives up material to create attacks and look at this look at I mean it's he didn't play it accurately but it doesn't matter because he's playing an opening that he really enjoys and pretty soon he picks up his opponent's pieces he doesn't convert the game perfectly he's 1100 what are you going to do but the point is if you're going to invest in something right if you're going to invest in your hobby uh you got to have fun doing it and clearly he's having fun doing it as you can see from his statistics the Vienna he's crushing even if the games aren't perfect the games that he's getting the types of positions he's getting they clearly fit his style so in this particular case this is not a waste of money now I'm assuming Ian did not go in debt over this because if he did then it valid it completely invalidates the whole first thing right but the money that you invest on stuff like this should you know and and the same with like ch.com game review like I if if if it makes your life a lot easier and you learn a lot better than just like analyzing every individual move of a game on your own well well then great you want to do you know puzzles you want to have a huge lesson Library terrific but in this particular case for Ian this is not this is not money poorly spent all right and clearly he's enjoying himself and you know he's enjoyed the video so so so he picks up the Vienna and clearly it's going well for him now Gotham sub number one we're going to bounce from 3 to one here because I wanted to go in ascending order so the next person is uh up to about 1,200 rapid uh 12200 rapid says college student bought the Dutch course September 24th right so about four months ago thoroughly enjoyed learning playing the Dutch it's an offbeat fighting style opening SWAT buckling uh and um I struggled to learn what to do against the stunt and Gambit uh and other Sidelines such as Knight C3 before C4 however I finished the course before my winter break from college I love the opening so much I really dove into the other things and now uh this person actually even bought a book so he bought a book in addition to the course so was that money well spent he bought a Dutch course and even bought a Dutch book to study games okay well again I'm assuming he had the financial means to do so so the next question is is that the best approach as in 1189 from a Pure Chess standpoint there are about the same like studying the openings versus like you don't need to buy a book I'm sure if you if you really wanted like I said if you really wanted you probably could do it for free you just it would require a lot of Googling and making a doc and finding the right games and you know again this person likes the Dutch so like which Dutch was it the Leningrad was right so you you could always argue you could do it for free but this person probably enjoys sitting there looking at games that grand Masters played in The Dutch so for them that investment is worth it then they have the Gotham course right like they have the Dutch course so this person Diego here shows you know shows a game that that they played and this is the Gotham Dutch right you play Knight C3 Bishop B4 you pin and the and the position that they got from the opening is exactly what you're supposed to do in the Dutch now the other thing is if you're a 1189 like Diego Diego's 1189 and let's say you're 1189 you want to learn that the night or of Sicilian so you want to learn E4 C5 okay Knight F3 D6 D4 CD Knight D4 Knight F6 knight3 A6 Bishop G5 E6 F4 bishop7 Queen F3 queen7 here's the problem your opponents are not going to play any of that you are never ever ever ever going to see this position you're never going to see this position let alone this position or this or this and this goes back back back back back back back you might never even see this position as an 1189 because as 1100 people are playing the Smith MOA they're playing the the the Aliant God knows what you know they might be playing whatever whatever but in the Dutch you actually do face this quite a bit like the chance that your opponent plays C4 Knight F6 Knight C3 like this position is very popular and then you play your Dutch so the chance that you replicate what you are learning material is applicable you are spending money on something that will appear in your games okay that is very important now Mr Alex uh Mr Diego uh plays this in a way that you know this is a weird setup by white he plays here right trying to play Bishop to B7 doesn't quite get the position that he would like but you know his opponent is playing some very silly stuff and black is just doing very very okay now at this point this has nothing to do with the opening anymore this is kind of like the position that the opening dropped you in and now now you have to play chess like now you have to play chess you know I I personally me I see a rook and a queen and a king so I want to play D6 I want to play E5 he does this puts his Knight on C4 tries to open up the center you know like it's a very complex battle and he finds a nice tactic and then the game spills out into a rook end game all right like this this is the opening no longer matters so if you go on to win this this game which Diego did you can't really say the opening was the reason but did the opening drop you in a position where life is good and you were doing quite well yeah if after 10 moves with black you're minus. 7 obviously it's applicable now Diego is going to have a game where you know like he said he struggled against stunt and Gambit right so that Gambit but he's going to have a game where he's he's literally just going to play everything that he knows in this opening right and he's going to get this position and this is this is what the course teaches you right like the course teaches you to get this position the Dutch and you're just doing fine you're equal your Knight's going to go there your Pawn's going to go there your Knight's going to go there other Knight's going to go there and your position plays itself and so Diego since learning the Dutch is scoring approximately approximately the same score he used to in the modern but and I found this out by going to opening tree this is opening tree this was this was these were the stats of Ian okay um I think I called Ian I might have called Ian Alex uh because uh Ian's second opponent was named Alex um anyway what I learned looking at Diego's games is that Diego struggles against the London but he never struggled against the London when he played the modern so this is the way you improve your chess courses okay what you do is oh I used to play the modern against the London and I would get some good positions so what should you do if they play the London against you why don't you go back to that why don't you play G6 so I noticed that Diego plays a lot of E6 against London but what about this and you do what you did previously you play like this so you combine what you're successful at right Diego really liked to play the modern and against the London was winning a lot but then he switched to the Dutch and he started losing a lot to the London but that's because he changed his whole approach you can combine the Dutch with the modern right you could play the same exact setup so that's how it works and now again should Diego buy a book and a course maybe it might be slight Overkill but if he can afford it whatever do what makes you happy you know what I mean like it might not necessarily be the best thing if Diego then went and hired a grandmas coach to teach him about the Dutch that would be Overkill especially at 1200 but if he's happy and he's having a good time and he's learning then great do what you want now from 1 1200 from around 900 to to 1200 now we're going to go all the way up to 1700 now this one is is really interesting so this is a father with a full-time manual labor job like picking up chest pieces and putting them down over 30 years old bought a Carl Concourse back in 2021 said I started playing chess after my brother-in-law watched the Queen's Gambit typical story he beat me so I youtubed how to win a chess in 2020 your videos came up I've been hooked ever since bought all the courses and study about an hour or so a day when I can so this is actually a pretty common thing and again I'm very thankful and there are people who definitely do this I've had people reach out and say you know what Gotham I have watched 70 of your videos I I watch the video every day during the pandemic I've watched not 70 700 that's what I meant to say I'll watch the video every single day like I eat food I watch a video so I'm going to buy three of your courses because I just you know video watching doesn't pay you know doesn't pay you anything and and that's fine like some people have literally bought courses and let them sit you don't want to buy courses and treat them like a gym membership you know you sign up for the gym it's like 10 bucks a month and you don't go cuz you're like whatever it's 10 bucks not a big deal and this happens a lot you buy something you get this monthly fee some people like to buy courses but they don't open them that's a waste of money but if the argument is well I can afford it and I want to support this person and you know I watch so much of their content I don't mind and when I get around to it I get around to it that's a personal decision like at the end of the day that that that's that's a personal decision that's completely fine uh and trust me creators who sell Creator products in my case I sell chess courses I don't sell much merchandise or you know other stuff but um everybody does appreciate it uh but you know you you don't really want to buy three courses let's say with the white pieces like you don't want to buy E4 D4 and gambits because you can't possibly study all of them you really should try to specialize a little bit you should try to learn a little bit here and there but if you want to learn everything learn something start a little bit put a little effort into that and then and then move on now the fascinating thing in this case uh oh my God my nose is so itchy I don't know what is going on but I cannot get that itch out and now I just look ridiculous so in this particular case um this is the story of uh of this person right first of all this person is a is a dad like good luck all right good luck having a full-time you know manual labor job being a dad and then studying chess and this person sent a couple of games which I found very interesting so this is Jeff I believe this is Jeff and Jeff is 1700 rapid after learning chess in 2020 I mean you talk about a guy whose courses are Justified being bought I mean shout out to Jeff who has still found a way to play thousands of games now Jeff stats were very interesting Jeff used to play E4 E5 very poorly had like a 60% win rate for white played the French like E6 B6 stuff did okay then got the Caro Concourse and started doing very well now in this position Jeff scores about 60% for black it's the mainline position remember this approach to getting to the Vienna like you know you can get out of here you can go to the courses like I already showed so the free sample is literally if you go to the free sample this first study E4 C6 this is free this is all for free it's all on Chesley C3 Knight C6 Bishop to B5 that's all available for you for free Knight C6 Bishop B5 it's the same exact position same position right all there you go back same position so or maybe it was here anyway doesn't matter same position now in the this you play Queen A5 that's the right move now Jeff didn't do that so Jeff has the course he doesn't play it exactly accurately but remember how Alex I keep calling him Alex remember how Ian didn't play this exactly accurately you remember how he didn't play this exactly accurately and then he like sacrificed the peace and all this stuff as long as you have a course and you're confident and you understand the positions Life Is Good Jeff proceeds to put his Queen here now I really would have loved to see him play Bishop A6 and stop white from castling but he does this and then he spots that the queen can't guard the pawn he understands the ideas of his opening if you understand the ideas of your opening you're golden you don't have to always play the moves that are in the course it's not exactly how it works sometimes yes frequently no frequently you can play things and you're going to be just fine his opponent has to take with the pawn because he has to guard his Pawn here and after 10 moves 15 moves Jeff is just much better he just has a great position he can play Bishop here he can Castle it's exactly what he does right he doesn't get into a crazy fight and now here he can push the advantage by playing this move I would not trade the Knight for the bishop here because you're UND doubling your opponent's pawns I would put the Knight here and just slowly chip away but this is a middle game situation this is we're we're out of the opening now right like now it's a question of is this a good trade for white or for black it's a better trade for white actually normally you want to trade Knight for Bishop but that Bishop is horrible and white has a really bad structure and what actually ends up happening in this game game is you know white starts advancing and white actually attacks you and and gets back into the game because you you help white on Tangle a little bit so and again just like in in the game that we just saw this Dutch game you you you don't win games always out of the opening as you get better like you have to play chess and you're going to see in this game there's a lot of chaos and like Jeff finds a really nice tactic which is Rook takes Knight and he gets to The Rook but then it's like check he's like wide open it's total chaos his King runs and he defends himself and then he goes on to win the end game but from the opening you know again it's like a matter of he understands how to play against the structure you get rid of the Knight you put the Knight on E F5 so obviously the Carl Concourse was a good investment for Jeff cuz he's 1,700 and he's winning 60% of his games from this position but then I discovered something I discovered that in another game that he played and actually uh some of his other games he doesn't do well in the exchange and if you just buy a course and just play then what you're doing is fake studying all right if you buy a course learn a little and then just E4 C6 Caron car so I noticed that actually in his statistics he does not do that great against this and the reason he doesn't do that great against this is he doesn't see it very often but also but also in particular when Jeff gets hit with a panov right A panov variation what do I recommend in the Caro Concourse I recommend putting the pawn on G6 this is my recommendation you spent money to get my recommendation I am recommending this to you you paid money this is the what you were supposed to learn just like it's what you were supposed to learn in this carocon just like what it was you know again it like this is how this works but Jeff in many games just plays nor he just puts two knights and then he puts the bishop here and that's not what I you've been taught so if you buy something but you don't take care of it if you don't put it into use you're going to get into some trouble and yet and yet despite all that this is a game where Jeff is outr by 400 points and still from the opening he was completely fine Jeff was beating somebody 400 points higher rated than him this was like I don't know last year this was you know now Jeff is like 1,700 rapid Jeff beating somebody 400 points higher rated than him he he went on to lose this game all right he went on to lose it was a long end game and they got into a bishop end game and Jeff lost the pawn and then Jeff lost the king race and lost all his pawns and you know lost the game but that's cuz he's 400 points low rated was the opening a success oh yeah look at this position of course this was a success you know he has at least a not worse position against somebody 400 points higher rated than him of course this is a good investment but he's not playing the recommendation so again his his win rate in the panov is super low super low his win rate in the thing that he actually studied which was the previous game this position it's actually quite high and that's what you got to do now if you have a bunch of courses sitting around like Jeff said you know he said I bought you know I bought all the courses to just support you know that's definitely really appreciated but another request I get a lot is hey Gotham I really like your content I want to buy all your courses can you give me a one-time purchase discount and the answer is no because I don't believe that's the right way to study chess I think that is a waste of money courses are a waste of money if you're already struggling financially like there is a balance between supporting your own Hobby and making yourself happy and not paying your phone bill all right then there's a balance of doing everything for free trying to get all your analysis done for free trying to get all your lessons your openings done for free but that comes at the cost of like what if you're 35 and have a kid and a family sometimes especially if you're already employed it's just easier to pay for something that takes you that guides you in a much easier way as long as it's applicable you should not buy courses even if they're made by the best players in the world if they're not applicable for you if you're 1200 and you want to learn some of the most Cutting Edge openings in the world it's completely useless you can spend $250 on a course you can pay a top player to coach you for 5 hours and spend $500 to $1,000 will will it be worth it probably not because you might just go blunder a night in the next game you play or the opening that they teach you is just not applicable so it's all a balancing act quality over quantity okay don't fake study study a little bit at a time also don't read courses like books fiction books should be read from start to finish non-fiction books probably should be read from start to finish maybe you can jump around when you study chess openings you must study what is applicable to you and what I mean by that the simplest example of what I mean by this is let's say you buy an E4 course okay let's say you buy an E4 course what should you learn E5 C5 learn what you face the most don't just go all right chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 4 5 6 7 8 somebody said that like I've got a lot of subscribers were like I studied the entire course then you then you then you learn nothing then you learn nothing all right it's the same thing I don't fear the man that has trained 10,000 kicks once I fear the man what was that that Bruce that Bruce Lee quote right I think I hope that's a Bruce Lee quote the person that practiced the kick 10,000 times that was the quote all right so it's a balancing act if you handle courses the wrong way and you think that spending money equals results courses are a waste of money but if you take one course at a time diligently learn what is applicable to your level instead of reading it like a book from start to finish then it is worth the money if like that's the way that you're going to study you're going to be methodical you're not going to cheat you're not going to look at the courses while your games are going on then it's not a waste of money because we all have to spend a little bit of money on our Hobbies especially like if you can if you can't that's okay but don't try to buy 15 chess courses at a discount that's a waste of money spend it on yourself take yourself to a nice dinner all right I thought this would be an interesting video uh let me know if you want more stuff like this in the future and um till next time I guess get out of here
