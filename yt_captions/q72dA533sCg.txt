[Music] what's up mkbhd here and i today now have a new favorite two-door electric vehicle and when i say that out loud it you probably picture one thing this is very different so i've been talking about these electric vehicle prototypes for a bit you know how i've been saying they're easy to build you can make one because it's true we see car companies all the time just build one single car with a custom chassis on some electric motors and a battery and boom they prayed that around but the hard part is building and shipping them in mass but all that being said this is easily one of the coolest electric car builds i've ever seen so it's made by ford and this is actually a concept car so they don't even have plans to ship it but after seeing all the reactions to this and driving it around for myself for a day i think it would be amazing if they reconsidered it but either way let me show you around this thing so basically what you're looking at right now is a 1978 ford f-100 illuminator but under the hood is the guts of a 2022 ford mustang machi gt that's the performance edition it is a wild juxtaposition of brand new 2022 things alongside the 40 year old solid metal and glass things of this older truck i swear if this was a doug demiro video there'd be endless quirks and features but yeah the final result here is an electric truck that not only looks like really nothing else on the road but it actually drives basically the same as the performance edition machi which is one of the faster ones out there 480 horsepower over 600 pound-feet of torque yes you can break hold launch yes it does zero to 60 in 3.5 seconds and yeah it does feel and look and sound ridiculous while doing it now i don't know about you but i don't get a chance to look at trucks from 1978 very often so sorry if this is like super unsurprising but pretty much everything about the outside of this truck is either an awesome shape or custom rebuilt as new so it's got the style and the lines of the times it's got the silver and copper paint colors the old school wheels are also custom to match and they also happen to hide the bright red performance calipers of the maki's brakes under there pretty well and just poking around this thing it's fun to see how much of the original body is left untouched this six foot bed is basically completely solid metal and the tailgate's super heavy to open and close because there's no mechanical assistance like modern trucks even the doors when you open them i don't know i just find it fascinating that you can just look at the mechanical method right in there for holding the door open at two different amounts probably the only way you would know that this is a resto mod if you saw it on the street would be if maybe you noticed the camera cutouts there is one in the back license plate here for the reverse camera and there's another one up at the front in the grille cutout up here at which point you realize the whole grill is fake it's just a black plastic in there like the rest of the mustang mockies well either that or you happen to see it plugged in and charging because that's a giveaway that flap at the front left bumper is in fact a normal ccs charging port the inside though okay this is where it goes crazy there is a healthy combination of old and new and even some new that's disguised as old to fit better with the general aesthetic i think it's super cool now obviously there's no hiding the dashboard it's got the mockee's huge vertical touchscreen with the knob and everything and there's also a display as the dash behind the steering wheel so not the original dash i think some people would have wanted the original dash but there's so many new systems and things going on here like the fact that it's showing me 200 miles of range for example that i just don't know how they could convert all that stuff so all the software is in here it's working the backup and forward cameras are functional they also brought in the headlight controls from the maki but i did notice they're sideways so maybe they didn't fit in the normal spot and then the more you look around the more you see parts cleverly disguised as old the steering wheel for example it's new but it says f-100 on it and it's got the brown color and the seats are all new but with the tan color to match the rest of the interior which is completely decidedly old school so you get the plaid stitching at the bottom of the door little metal pieces everywhere like for adjusting the side view mirrors the glove compartment is just a metal box like nothing fancy at all and the entire ceiling too is stitched with leather and the sun visors are just like metal wires with leather pieces on them uh there's also old-school speakers behind the seats that are hooked up and seem to be playing great quality audio which leads me to believe they're also new disguised as old and you better believe this car has manual rolling up windows there's no way they could get rid of that it's basically mandatory for a car of this style so yeah a little bit old and a little bit of new and this is the combo you get it's just so funny seeing this old whip rolling around through the windshield but you can still see the top half of a huge touch screen that's only in new cars it seems sacrilegious to have a center console with wireless chargers right next to manual roll-up windows and door locks put that's really what this is all about it's adding the modern creature comforts to a comfortable familiar old truck so i did get to drive this thing around the studio a bit for a day before ford went and took it away to the i think they brought it straight to the new york auto show but i really got three main questions from people that i showed this to one what's under the hood interesting question two how does it drive and three can i get one all good questions so first of all literally under the hood is mustang machi so this is a custom chassis holding things together by a company called roadster shop but yeah basically all the electronics and hvac and wiring things that are normally in the front of a maki and hidden they're all still here plus basically that open bucket for storage where the front trunk is so yeah this thing still has a real front trunk this 1978 restomod ford f-100 has a bigger front trunk than most other electric cars on the road right now so okay how does it drive this is a funny one so it's quite a character as you can imagine very livable and smooth and normal at low speeds like around a neighborhood this would actually be totally fun to drive and maybe forgive me if this is sacrilegious but i think i would prefer to drive this over the 70s version because you got the electric torque it's smooth and silent no gear shifting you've got regenerative braking one pedal driving is great but it's also a massively wide metal truck that can lurch from 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds and if you really pin it and start playing with it like it has very impressive acceleration but it's obviously not going to handle great like you can feel the dipping and swaying of the chassis more than pretty much anything else capable of going this fast i didn't have it long enough to see how well the range holds up but hey if it's quoting me about 200 miles of range that's not amazing but that's also not terrible considering this thing has the aerodynamics of a block of cheese so after playing with it like i said people were like where can i actually get one of these and like i said it is a concept car so this isn't an actual version that you'll ever be able to buy but ford is selling a crate motor that you can actually use to convert other older cars to electric so you don't have to build everything by hand like zach is with his hummer ev so and it's only four thousand dollars it's 3 900 bucks for that which was lower than i expected it to be so i think that's the big takeaway of this this concept truck which is so cool is really just a proof of concept and i think it's awesome i want to shout out ford for making something so fun like this definitely tag or send someone this video who would want a retro modern truck like this that's really what this is the ultimate retro modern truck thanks for watching subscribe for more and i'll see you guys in the next one peace [Music]
