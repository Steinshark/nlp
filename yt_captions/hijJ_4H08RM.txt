in 1996 the Korean cable LG announced the 1.7 billion pound investment in the City of Newport South Wales the United Kingdom the high-tech manufacturing facilities consisting of two parts would have created over 6 000 jobs unfortunately LG never managed to reduce that many jobs despite a grants package announced to be worth nearly a quarter of a billion pounds though not all of that was paid out this is a rough story in this video we're going to talk about LG Electronics ill-fated manufacturing efforts in South Wales Wales is a country within the United Kingdom Newport is whale's sixth largest city by population as implied by the name the city has long been about its ports the first of which Newport Castle opened in the 1300s now you might be wondering the same as I did newport's Newport doesn't sound all that new if it was first built in the 1300s but you know Europe it isn't old unless it's been built back in the days of the trilobites anyway Newport experienced a lot of growth in the 1800s thanks to nearby coal mines in the South Wales valleys those mines were gone by the 1880s but the town economy marched onwards after World War II Wales was designated as a Development Area in these areas it was easier to build factories incentivizing Britain's state-owned companies to relocate their factories there but in the 1970s the United Kingdom as a whole de-industrialized moving factories around was no longer so easy when the whole country's economy suffered from inflation stagnation and the like Cuts were indeed needed the Welsh government spent more on subsidizing these nationalized coal and Steel Industries than they did on health or education but they nevertheless hit whales extremely hard thousands of jobs were lost the unemployment population in Wales Grew From 68 000 people in 1979 to a staggering 166 000 in 1985. new jobs were needed to offset the labor impact of de-industrialization enter the Welsh government's Economic Development agencies in the mid-1970s the Welsh government created several independent Economic Development agencies the most significant of these was the Welsh development agency or wda the wda organized a series of offices and organizations to help arrange new investments into the Wales area the wda and others like it were publicly funded but had the flexibility to do what was needed in order to convince foreign investors to come spend their money in Wales the wda's powers in particular were quite formidable first they had the power of Independence they were able to gather together big Grant proposals for any particular Target with minimal consultation with the rest of the government and second they had the ability to reclaim derelict land there were significant pockets of land throughout Wales left over from the steel and coal Industries the wda would reclaim the land assemble a package of rebuilt property facilities and grants and then Market those to overseas investors and this was quite effective in detracting FDI mostly to the South Wales cities of Cardiff and Newport in the 1980s Cardiff was the UK's 10th largest financial service center city and by 1991 Wales received a fifth of the UK's total FDI projects despite hosting only five percent of the UK's population so much success has granted a few grumbles from the rest of the United Kingdom but it's a race the story of LG proves that The Entity now known as LG group was founded by KU and way as the lucky Chemical Company the company began by making creams and toothpaste by quickly Diversified into Plastics with Combs and brushes the chemicals business Still Remains one of LG group's core businesses their leadership in Lithium-ion batteries is particularly interesting cool later then founded gold star company which helped make radios for Sony this electronics business is now their other core operation producing TVs appliances and until recently mobile phones compared to its terrible appears LG's business strategy is less dependent on political power and diversification despite 38 subsidiaries and 50 plus joint ventures LG's core remains in chemicals and electronics LG has done overseas manufacturing before but only quite conservatively back in 1989 they opened a TV parts factory in the county of tine and where in England and that's about it it would take a bold rival and a new government policy to motivate LG into taking a more outgoing stance the Daewoo Corporation was founded by Kim wuchong back in 1967. it grew quickly on the back of friendly relations with several of South Korea's governments eventually becoming one of Korea's big four chebol next to Hyundai Samsung and LG in 1990 Daewoo announced an aggressive Global plan to build overseas manufacturing outposts all over the globe whenever a client wanted Daewoo products cars TVs VCRs so on Daewoo would build a local Factory to supply it by 1997 the Korean conglomerate had 380 investment projects in 85 countries these moves allowed Daewoo to grab market share gains in their localities spurring its Rivals into doing the same this internationalization strategy received a further boost in 1993 when Kim Young Sam became Korea's first civilian president Kim sought to encourage International engagement as a way to upgrade the economy and ameliorate Troublesome labor unrest at home in November 1994 he unveiled a reform centered on the concept of segewa which literally means globalization quickly became a buzzword that swept the nation people fervently believed in it as the fastest way for Korea to catch up with the rest of the world accordingly outward Investments by Korean companies nearly quadrupled from 1.4 billion in 1993 to 5 billion just three years later in 1996. LG specifically wanted to show a new face in this new era they dropped the somewhat cheesy name Lucky Gold Star for just LG and appointed a new CEO guponmu a third generation member of the founding cool family ambitiously announced that LG would blaze a forward-looking path in order to beat rival Samsung and become Korea's largest chebler thus in September 1995 LG began examining locations in Europe for a new overseas manufacturing base consisting of a consumer electronics Factory and semiconductor Fab and that is how they came across the wda Wales as Secretary of State William Hogg quickly heard about LG's interest and immediately began making trips to South Korea the project saw intense interest from Wales Scotland Northern England and Ireland the latter two quickly dropped out though Northern England reportedly offered 100 million pounds so it ended up being a UK only affair this situation was far from ideal in the UK central government has long wanted to keep it from happening but considering the size of the prize and the way Regional rivalries are I think things can get carried away just look at what happened with the Amazon hq2 Rat Race the city of Birmingham Alabama installed giant Amazon buy now buttons for goodness sakes the competition between Scotland and Wales was fierce at first a wda judge that they had the Consumer Electronics facility but their semiconductor facility would go to Scotland determined not to lose to Scotland the wda offered a staggering 210 million British pound Grant package for the creation of 4 900 jobs LG came back with the ask of only needing to create 4 100 jobs the wda pushed back on this traveling to stole for four days of direct negotiations it was a nail-biting sequence of events several times the deal nearly fell apart once the news prematurely leaked causing LG to reopen the bidding but finally LG and the wda managed to strike a deal LG had vaguely planned for a second phase of the project and the wda leveraged this late Revelation to increase the grant to its final size as announced in July 1996 LG Newport was made up of two projects the first project is a consumer electronics Factory managed by LG Electronics it would be rolled out over two phases in the first phase LG would build a factory to manufacture millions of CRT televisions and computer monitors each year generating about 2 412 jobs the second phase we will talk about a bit later but if completed it would provide another 1998 jobs the second project was a semiconductor manufacturing Factory managed by LG semicon and that would employ about 1 696 people these jobs would be higher paid r d jobs and were particularly valued all together the projects would yield about 6106 direct jobs economists estimated that there would be further knock-on effects related to LG suppliers and what not moving in counting up a total of 20 000 jobs created as I mentioned LG planned to invest a total of 1.7 billion pounds at the time this was the largest ever European investment by an outside country in order to get it LG would get a 247 million pound Grant package the Welsh government offered 69.5 million pounds for fixed assets the wda would pitch in another 146 million pounds for construction and infrastructure as well as 17.6 million pounds for training finally LG received the land called Celtic Lakes at Imperial park for free Celtic Lakes was considered the most prestigious Industrial Development site in South Wales this is because it was a very large single plot about 250 Acres that is close to Big highways it is also Greenfield as in free of contamination it was valued at about 14.2 million pounds soon after the announcement the wda started preparing the site for construction the groundbreaking ceremony happened at the start of 1997. UK prime minister John Major was in attendance there was a minor hiccup a few months later in April 1997 when the package was submitted to the European commission but they ultimately approved it the big concern throughout the negotiations had to do with the second phase the one that helped get the grant to its final size it was not clear when it was going to roll out LG insisted it would have to be 1999 three years away at the earliest but at the same time LG insisted that they get all the money in the grant up front this added risk to part of the investment after the groundbreaking in January 1997 LG completed the CRT Factory without much incident the wda did much Preparatory work to make sure the environmental checks went smoothly the first CRT monitor started rolling off the line in late 1997 even has construction continued on expansion and new warehousing space at this time 1700 people worked at the factory with more jobs on the way the semiconductor Fab on the other hand was never completed even before 1997 the semiconductor industry had been on the downturn prices had fallen by 60 to 70 percent in the 1995-1996 period nevertheless LG and his peers believed it to be normal cyclical behavior and planned ahead with the assumption that things would return to growth shortly nobody wanted to be the one to cut Supply anyway construction on the wafer Fab began but in July 1997 the Asian financial crisis ripped through the Asian economy it struck in the middle of the Korean presidential election cycle and shattered Kim yong-sam's credibility in November 1997 Kim had to ask for and receive a humiliating bailout from the international monetary fund the chairboard were once hailed as essential parts of the Korean economy but now it had been revealed that they had taken a massive amount of short-term loans sending them into a debt crisis this included the once high-flying Daewoo which was revealed to owe over 50 billion USD to 140 banks in 100 plus countries Kim Woo Zhong the Daewoo chairman spent days hanging outside the presidential office before realizing that he had fallen into disfavor semiconductor sales slumped even further even Intel King of the CPU had to furlough 1700 Fab workers for nine days but the Korean manufacturers had it far worse they produced a commodity memory product and they had all invested too aggressively in capacity in September 1998 LG suspended the Newport semiconductor project for at least 12 months and having invested 132 million pounds the wda and other localities had invested another 44.3 million pounds too the Fab shell was completed but no equipment had been brought in LG semicon had also recruited 114 staff in preparation for production start in 1999 awkward at the Korean government's behest Arch Rivals LG and Hyundai were to merge their semiconductor businesses all the way in September 1998. but disputes held up the deal for months until the Korean government finally forced it through in July 1999. the new owner Hyundai semiconductor renamed a high Nix announced that the project would be re-evaluated in November 1999. the wda had the right to try and Claw back the grant money then but opted to wait until the market situation stabilized meanwhile over at the CRT Factory the other half of the LG investment things also deteriorated in 2000 over 2 200 people worked at the plant which was nice but fell short of the predicted 2400 or so jobs that have been projected at the time they struck the deal sadly these 2 200 jobs were the most the factory would ever employ LG's strategic reasoning for the Newport Factory was to tap the growing market for CRT televisions and computer monitors over in Europe CRT had dominated display industry for nearly a hundred years European CRT sales had grown from 29 million in 1990 to 39 million in 1999. LG presumed that this growth would continue but then in 1998 large flat panel plasma televisions started trickling into the market LG endeavored on believing that these new options would not overtake the market anytime soon but after LCD panels entered the market a few years later prices fell and the CRT Market collapsed as a plant manager later said when we set this plant up five years ago the market was very buoyant it was foreseen that the lifetime of CRT technology would be longer than what has taken place Now LG could have converted the CRT Factory to producing plasma or LCD but something else happened in 2004 the EU enlarged adding Poland czechia Estonia Hungary Latvia Lithuania and others as you recall one of the reasons why LG set up shop in the UK was to gain access to the European market now they can get that same opportunity and access but with the use of substantially cheaper labor hourly wages of a Polish person in 2002 were two dollars 54 cents USD has compared to 1681 in the UK foreign investments move eastwards in search of Cheaper labor encouraged long by economic grants of land labor and cash from the Polish government the same economic model as the wda ironically it became clear that phase two of the Consumer Electronics Factory would not happen LG had struck a joint venture with Phillips in 2001 but this failed to improve the company's prospects employment decline from 2200 and 2000 to 1400 in September 2001 and then 900 at the end of 2002. a few months later L.G Phillips told the wda that they wanted to close the plant entirely finally in August 2003 the LG Phillips plant closed and 800 plus people lost their jobs LG Phillips had only kept the plant open so long to avoid the threat of Grant repayments in total 87.1 million pounds of the 129 million total had been actually paid out 34 million pounds of that was eventually recovered the fall of the CRT market led to hard times for whales another 2 000 jobs were lost due to similar closures of TV component factories owned by Sony Panasonic and the like with semiconductor sales continuing to fall heinix decided to sell their plan in 1999 But after those sales plans fell through things remained up in the air the wda eventually came to the belief that heynix was not moving forward with development and started recovery operations they went to Seoul and after a lot of haggling the wda finally received the properties back in 2005 as well as a small cash payment to cover some liabilities the wda's recovered value building an undeveloped land and all from heinix was about 36.65 million pounds with just 44.3 million of the 117 million pounds having actually been paid out an 8 million pound Financial loss on paper seem reasonable considering the circumstances the loss of the CRT Factory hurt more at over 50 million pounds though the actual value of the recovered buildings was not quite clear since it could no longer be used for Semiconductor fabrication a high neck spokesperson said heinex is extremely disappointed that the changes in the global semiconductor Market have meant that it has been unable to progress this major project however the repayment of the Grant and the return of the site to the public sector has enabled heynix to withdraw honorably if you can recall LG spent 132 million pounds on the semiconductor building money lit on fire after the wda recovered the land they searched for a new entity to take it on the Fab shell was eventually torn down and replaced with an industrial park which includes a Microsoft Data Center in 2006 the Welsh government abolished the wda and absorbed its functions in a few ways the wda was quite Successful by the end of the 1980s they managed to produce 50 000 jobs and their efforts always seem quite competent considering the circumstances yet at the same time it also feels somewhat in vain despite a good reputation raw Welsh labor would always cost more than that found in Eastern Europe or Asia the necessary response would have been to shift to more technology-intensive manufacturing or Services an LG semicon Fab might have seemed the right way to start on that but I guess we will never know LG's time in Wales is a reminder that we can do so many of the small things right and still lose in the end all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the Channel Sign up for the newsletter and I'll see you guys next time
