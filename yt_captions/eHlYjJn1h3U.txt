ladies and gentlemen I have got an absolutely ridiculous piece of Chess content for you today this video is going to inspire some of you it's going to severely upset some of you it is going to confuse some of you most of you are going to look introspectively upon yourselves after seeing what I have to show you today obviously I'm traveling I'm on a little travel setup so the microphone's going to be a little bit funny I'm staying in a hotel that's way too fancy for my understanding the bed is like the size of the room and uh I made the bed so you think that I'm a normal person but no normal person makes a hotel bed and there's like a bottle of soda back there you know it it it's fine you might hear a train out the window I managed to get a hotel room with a train outside of the first world problems anyway this video is about tyler1 tyler1 bodybuilder pool boy League of Legends streamer has just hit 1200 ELO on childs.com that who cares right what's so special about that he did it in about two months of playing in two months of playing time tyler1 has played 40 to 50 rapid chess games every single day he has stopped streaming his puzzles rating is 2500. 2500 he has done over 7 500 puzzles he has played over 2300 rapid games and he has now played even hundreds of Blitz Games I don't think there has ever been a dedication to chess quite like this I think this man is more dedicated to chess than Hikaru Nakamura Magnus Carlson and stockfish combined I've never seen something like this and in this video I am going to show you some of his progress This truly is Sensational this man is now higher rated than every pogchamps 5 participant he was one of the lowest rated players when that event began I don't even know what to make of this okay so tyler1 hit 1100. and then he lost all his rating because that happens we've all been there this this game that I'm about to show you he's this is his lowest rating since hitting 1100 he lost nearly 300 rating points in like five days okay and he got down around September 27th September 27th to 8 50. let me show you this game this was on one of his negative streaks now if you know anything about Tyler you know that he plays every single game uh the cow opening uh which you know I have my complaints about but I I'm not going to complain because it's an opening where despite developing in a bit of an obscure way you don't really have any weaknesses and it's very difficult to exploit at like 99 of the rating ladder it's an opening where you kind of develop your pieces sort of awkwardly and passively but even if black follows all of the basic principles like this and then developing their Bishops they're still going to do something stupid like Ponto G6 you know no disrespect but what are we doing uh Tyler Castle B6 now Tyler lashes out with this move a forward to move too deep even Magnus Carlson wouldn't wouldn't even be able to understand it now Tyler locks the center plays Bishop D2 and plays this move F4 and and really this is exactly what you're supposed to do if we actually look at this position and analyze it it's a close position how do you know it's a close position all eight pawns are on the board for both sides that means that the position is quite locked what do you have to do in a close position maneuver your pieces to their best squares and create Pawn breaks this Knight would like to go there to C4 and this Pawn would like to go here so that's kind of exactly what he does he plays F4 but again this is him at 8 50. so what's gonna happen how is he gonna lose all of these you know all these rating points well actually he he does a lot of good things in fact he gets a he gets a better position now what he needs to do is Target his opponent's weaknesses with moves like Queen to D2 which first targets the Knight and then Queen to F4 which targets the knight in the pawn and he does that like the fact that he even plays this little subtle Queen to d2 move is really nice then his opponent goes here that is a very bad move but you have to refute it now in general My Philosophy is you should always consider taking with what's worth the least just try to get that out of the way just take with the pawn because you know they're not going to try to bulldoze through a pawn he takes with the Knight which is still a great move because you're gonna go Knight F6 but you need to be careful about this and in this position his opponent plays Rook takes E4 and now another moment should you take the Knight or this it's five points or three points right if you don't take the Rook The Rook survives and The Rook is going to continue to bully you if you do take the Rook you might go oh but then he's got all of that yeah but the threat of Checkmate doesn't mean he's mating you because you can either defend it or in this case you can actually turn it into a counter attack so just because the threat exists doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good move and in this position Tyler blunders he plays Queen takes B4 which loses the bishop and actually does lose the game but then his opponent counter blunders his opponent plays Rook F4 and basically you know he sacrifices his Rook I'm not gonna yell it because it's a terrible move but I get the idea he plays Rook F4 and then he's like well if you take me I'm gonna Checkmate you and Tyler unfortunately in this position spends seven seconds and hangs mate in one this was the low point of this man's career which is crazy because some of you haven't even been to 800. this man was on a massive slump it was like September 27 he was losing like every game he was playing he was down to 850 rapid up from 11 40. 300 rating points nearly in like three four days I thought well that's that's probably the end right I mean he's going to stay around a thousand because that's where a lot of people naturally Plateau but I should have known that I'm a degenerate and this man is clearly a chess Prodigy and he would be back he would be clutch I started having doubts within two days Tyler got back to a thousand within another 24 to 48 hours he got to 1100 and just yesterday September uh October the 3rd about six days after falling to 8 50 he crossed 1207. 40 rapid games a day on average for about two straight months what do we even do 40 times a day period check our phone literally right like that's it maybe if we go to the gym we do 40 reps of an exercise Tyler definitely does 400 reps of an exercise this is absolutely mind-boggling so let me show you this Ascent from 850 to 1200 in literally like six days this man has had in probably interactions with the chessboard like 20 000 times in 30 days like it's unbelievable just looking at it interacting with it and that's really all it is to get better at anything so he had a game against a Frenchman and I'm always going to cheer uh you know for the Americans in this case uh Tyler of course places uh signature opening his opponent plays E5 which actually just plays directly into Black's hands because now black can immediately attack the pawn Knight F3 but Tyler is a principled man he doesn't do anything about the pawn in the center he just leaves it there now D5 locking the position Knight E7 Knight B6 this obscure close Position Dance that he is just iterating time and time again now he plays Bishop D7 his opponent plays here in Knight G6 now here white plays a horrible move um and it just goes to show you like the fascinating thing about Tyler's climb up the ELO ranks is that there is still so much to unpack and so much to learn uh as you go up and up because as a 1030 the move Bishop takes G6 should literally never cross your mind the moves that should cross your mind here for wider Pawn to C4 and like Knight C3 and Knight T2 maybe rookie one I mean this is crazy you are opening up The Rook for your opponent but more than anything else like if there is no good reason to trade a bishop for a knight you shouldn't do it and his opponent plays directly into that he plays directly into the opening of this Rook which is I I I not a good move at all Knight bd2 but should be seven now I Place Queen C1 which again it just goes to show you you can play obscure openings that are like slightly worse for you but it doesn't mean anything and in this position black can even already begin an attack because the king is completely safe Tyler plays F6 and now his opponent plays C4 which is a very good move now Tyler locks the center which is high level understanding by the way um a lot of you would follow up on this move and take but that would give white a massive Advantage because you just allow a knight directly into your position to attack stuff there is no need to do that you need to play chess as if there is a person on the other side a lot of you play chess like you're the only one playing F5 Tyler Retreats and now his his opponent tries to look at this look at G5 is an incredible move understanding how to attack on that side of the board now G4 same side attacking chess take take now he activates his Bishop on the diagonal he has to bring his Queen what Tyler is trying to do here is play Queen to H4 how is he going to do that by sliding the bishop to F4 this is amazing and now he needs to get Queen G5 and queen H5 and all of this his opponent plays a good defensive move now Tyler's next move is flawed but I understand the objective right now Tyler has to take a second and he's gotta like realize he can't actually Force his Queen here he doesn't have the time he's going to lose the bishop and then he's going to lose the pawn but instead he does this that's a very bad move it's a very bad move because if you wanted to sacrifice the bishop you should have done it in a way that didn't open your opponent's position what I mean by that is for example take the move Queen to G5 after G takes F4 you haven't opened up the position and now after something like Queen H4 black is just winning because anything that takes on G4 there is a mate the only way not to get mated here by white is to play Rook to E1 that's the only way and then the king makes a run for it black probably takes one F4 and goes on to win the game um but this is too forcing of a sacrifice and now your queen doesn't actually get to the h-file he plays Queen G5 but it's losing because white can just like Queen takes G4 and also you've opened up the rook and The Rook is going to defend the Knight so you helped him a little bit too much okay now Queen takes G4 is played Tyler goes here the opponent plays King G2 and now Queen back to H6 of course Tyler is losing but his opponent has to find a way to win the game now Tyler brings the Knight his opponent attacks the queen queen to H5 wouldn't have played that if you're down material I would try to keep the queen on the board the Queen trade I do not like now the opponent here plays a deranged move you cannot do this this is crazy you are you are under attack and up material what is going to help you win the game if you're up material and if you're under attack trading the Queens you have to trade the Queens here with white I mean it's an it's non-negotiable you have to trade the Queens this is crazy and now tyler1 is immediately back into the game and now the most clutch move of all black has a very powerful attack but he's only got two pieces in the game Rook to G8 is good all of these moves are good tyler1 plays the absolutely gangster long castles in this position now stockfish of course is a scumbag so it immediately jumps up but this is going to win Tyler the game bringing the second Rook into the party as the other rook and the queen already barreled down to White's position the top engine move here is probably something like Rook to G8 yeah at The Rook to G8 or maybe Knight F5 but I I don't care this is this is gangster stuff giving up this his opponent takes the bait and now Tyler instead of having tunnel vision here should have realized the queen no longer defends the pawn so definitely Queen takes G3 is winning because it forces the king out the move that Tyler plays is a little slow it allows white to defend himself but Tyler sacrifices The Rook on G3 now he does it this way the king is hunted Queen D3 check and it's probably a draw but the opponent walks into a checkmate Queen G3 Queen G2 Tyler wins The Rook Tyler brings his Rook down Tyler takes the other Rook while his King is actually defended and he's going to just have to escape these checks he does he mercilessly hunts the king into the corner and he wins the game with 19 seconds on the clock the buzzer beater Victory down multiple pieces a roaring counter-attack against the Thousand Thirty dude these games are like heavyweight fights they are so back and forth you never know what's gonna happen you never know if he has the energy to land a knockout punch these games are super exciting it's just like filling in the little gaps of knowledge like for instance uh back here you know like just the element of time you you don't want to bring your Rook the idea of castling was to bring your Rook which is why he went here but he could have adapted to the new situation and played Queen takes G3 because every position on the chessboard is is a chance for for something you know even better this was September 28th the next game that I'm showing you is September 30th 2014 48 hours later this man gained yet another 100 points you you cannot script this stuff now what opening did he play you know what opening he played he played the cow and this was a full cow he put both nights on the outskirts of the board his opponent played a king's Indian defense like imagine being one of these people that's like I like to I like to watch Gotham chess and he taught me the king's Indian defense and the Karo Khan and and the Vienna and I'm gonna go try it out I'm not saying that this person sounds like that but I'm saying this is how it is to learn chess and on the other side you got a guy that probably bench presses 450 pounds all right he could probably uh pick you up out of your out of your seat and turn you into one of those like balloons uh balloon animals and you know he just plays the cow every single opening and uh you know you don't know what to do with black because you you weren't taught this it's like I'll give you an example I I'm I'm training boxing nowadays you know I'm getting better but I trained with with a with a 60 year old ex-world Champion you know shout out to Greg and uh he'll randomly just come up to me and go like this like he won't even engage with me he'll just stand there like this just hands on his body what do I do like where do I even punch the second I jab at his head he's you know he's and then if I make a mistake right to the stomach and it's like you know what am I supposed to do if I had more experience you know maybe I would be able to do something but if your opponent is not engaging with you whatsoever what are you supposed to do so Bishop D2 Bishop C3 Bishop F3 just just like look at this position right he's just playing simple simple chess now again we're going to get to a position where probably the game is going to lock up right no explosion in the center of the board he gets his Bishop taken he takes there take take so now it's six pawns each Rook B A Tyler again plays A4 the thing is Tyler makes quote unquote bad moves like every 1200 makes bad moves but who are they bad moves according to they are bad moves according to title players maybe or to stockfish but at this level he's at best you know at worst he's making inaccuracies he doesn't make like too many massive blunders except made in one when he's on a downturn so now for another game in a row we have a locked structure now they're navigating this chaos is very difficult so Tyler is just castles you know he doesn't get tunnel vision he doesn't take the pawn which he probably could have taken but it you know it'll still be there I don't mind the move castling take take bit night night here and now he he targets the Knight on uh on the F5 Square his opponent plays H5 Tyler takes probably thinking that he was going to get this Pawn but then this happened F3 and the position is just like kind of balanced black is better but that's just because he has two Bishops and the actual approach to winning this game is not easy at all for black he's gonna have to put pressure here and then maybe get can take something I don't know so Rook d8 C4 um Bishop goes back Pawn to A5 and his opponent just hangs a queen just just straight up just hangs the queen in one move because 1100s you know can play for a while and and then they hang Queens just like the rest of us that's just that that's I that's what happened and Tyler took and how did he convert this game he played Knight G3 put his Knight back in the center centralized this queen to take the pawn with the Knight and then adapt it to the new situation and took the queen with the pawn the pawn with the Queen Bishop takes C4 very nice move simplifying down the material Rook B8 Queen E6 check he takes on G6 and in this position his opponent resigned because Tyler just went directly for this now a lot of you after taking on G6 in this position would play Queen takes H5 check the way I know Tyler has a future in chess uh is in this position he played Knight G5 it's actually something extremely subtle Queen takes G6 Bishop takes D5 probably seven and a half out of ten like 75 percent of people in this position after just playing Queen takes would play Queen takes H5 check it's just like human nature you just took one Pawn with the queen it's obviously not bad to take the second pawn and give a check think about it how many of you watching this right now you can time stamp in the comments you can say 17 whatever there's a 10. yeah I would have definitely played Queen takes H5 because you just took the pawn and now your queen can take another Pawn so how bad can it be and then and only then would you go oh Knight G5 and I have Checkmate but then your opponent would go like Rook F6 and then you're not going to get checkmates so you would adapt to the situation and hopefully still find a way to win or lose because some of you would still lose this with white Tyler goes here he just gets the mate he doesn't take the pond with check he realizes his Queen needs some help immediately and goes to H7 use this as a teachable moment because it's very instructive it is severely underappreciated how good of a move Knight to G5 is for the 11 1200 level he's just he knows the objective of the game he doesn't need to go and and take another thing like he just needs to get I'll give you an example you know what queen takes H5 is it's like being at the end of Super Mario and you need to jump on the big flagpole and instead you're going to get some coins and the coins are not even going to get you a one-up okay like it you don't need Queen takes H5 and now my friends we fast forward to October the 3rd 2023 which is a day that will live in history for many many reasons um tyler1 crossed 1200. and uh the way the way that he has done this run is nothing short of Sensational in this game he was playing and I love by the way his like Global opponents like this is uh Colombia France Romania Indonesia right like amazing the chess is such an international game he's played so many people he's played so many people he plays a cow as always last time the position really opened up in this game his opponent played very well this is a very good opening by black Tyler plays C4 don't love this I wouldn't instigate in the center unless you Castle but I like how he delays castling then he plays A3 his opponent goes back he chases back the bishop and I mean the position for white it's very difficult to exploit Bishop T2 okay slide in accuracy his opponent plays A6 after spending two seconds I mean right like it's tough it's tough you just don't H6 now Tyler plays C5 and he plays F4 so he does his flank attack he attacks with the c and the F pawns take take now his opponent plays a great move here plays Pawn to B6 trying to get rid of that pawn on C5 not a bad move at all now the best move here probably for whitest to start battling on the C file with something like Rook C1 yes according to the engine the move Rook C1 is is the top and you know I know that because I kind of understand the Dynamics of the position like you you know B6 is played um taking is my first option but I don't want to free things up for black and also if black takes my Pawn they split their Pawn so their pawns become split and this way their pawns kind of stay together and I need to activate yet another piece and that move B6 week in the night which is why the move Rook C1 is so nice putting a knight on C5 or a rook on C5 in the future will be nice for me but okay Tyler takes and he pushes the bishop back and now he plays Knight H5 he loves to do this his opponent after going here realizes I'm not going to be able to get my Bishop out this way so let me route it out this way and 11 and 1200s are better at chess uh in the sense of keeping the tension so his opponent didn't take on H5 Tyler takes plays Bishop H5 the reason that he does that is to bring in his Queen it's all pattern recognition Now by bringing in the queen he pins the pawn to the king so Bishop takes H6 as a possibility and he has opportunity to go here and here now of course this bishop is a little bit bad but you know it's all right King h8 now Rook ae1 look at this just bringing all the pieces to the party his opponent is fighting back but Tyler immediately takes advantage of this inaccuracy by the 1200 and pins the Knight to the queen the amazing thing when you played these one movers is they feel good they're like I'm putting my knight in the center it's probably a good move but as you get better at chess you you you stop yourself from making these moves because after Queen G3 suddenly you're in some trouble like you can't really move and White's next move is either D4 or Bishop F4 which is just crushing and black realizes that so they go oh I have to guard my queen but they should have done it with the other Rook because in this position tyler1 uses the checklist checks captures attacks to decide whether there is a good move in the position this is the only check he has a couple of captures he can take this and this and this none of them are good but attacks starting with the most valuable he can attack the queen and it just so happens that behind the queen is a rook that is called an x-ray Bishop B4 and suddenly the position is going to go from bad to worse now according to the computer Bishop F4 was even better because the computer wants to win this Knight in a way where you end up with a checkmating attack what I mean by that is it doesn't want to take like this it actually wants to take like this and hit the queen and checkmate with the queen over here but he does this which I don't mind at all he takes the rook and now he plays Knight D4 and a truly cultured man he is up material so what does he do offers a trade of pieces and his opponent blunders his opponent here under a lot of pressure already not wanting to trade plays Queen D6 not realizing that the piece is overwhelmed and he just takes he takes hides his King and now slides The Rook forward a lot of you in this position would get excited and play rookie seven and blunder the The Rook in one move Rook E6 and now watch this conversion the second the queen took its eyes off of E7 look at this how many of you after Queen C2 would be tempted to give a check or maybe to take the pawn tyler1 realizes The Rook now has access to E7 this Clairvoyant train of thought a lot of you also in this position would see Queen C2 threatening this threatening this you would realize that the queen is defending the pawn and then you would go B4 there was nothing really wrong with the move before but that is a crazy move to make you don't need to save every one of your pawns you need to understand the objective of the game Rook to E7 ignores the threat on the pawn because the bishop is hanging and that is Checkmate and his opponent here plays Rook G8 he gives a check he could take on B7 he could that's the best move but he goes here trying to trade off his opponent sneaks in to attack his rook and obviously a lot of you in this position would probably guard your Rook but that Rook that just went that way can also go back Tyler immediately realizes grabs the queen his opponent resigns or ran out of time yes ran out of time and uh maybe resign on it that was weird and Tyler one just crossed 1200. he hasn't played a game since he's rated 1207 I'm gonna read you a couple of stats here that like I said might inspire you might make you very sad um tyler1 started playing much more actively about you know 30 days ago he's actually done more puzzles today as I am recording this video tyler1 has crossed 2500 in puzzles this is actually insane he is solving 2200 level puzzles I'm looking at his chess.com profile right now I can't show it to you because my laptop doesn't have the overlay but go check it out for yourself big underscore Tonka underscore t uh this dude is just straight up 2500 in Puzzles he has played 760 Blitz Games 2298 rapid games he's played 3 000 games total he has done 7 600 puzzles his interactions with the chessboard like that are just ten thousand but the amount of analysis that he does game review that he does this is otherworldly pogchamps 5 was just about like two months ago and he was rated 200. he is 1200 rapping now he is higher rated than every participant in podcast I wouldn't be surprised if he could beat the participants of box Champs so Tyler if you react to this video uh keep it up and uh answer my messages please because we got we got to set something up Tyler Tyler once challenged me to a ten thousand dollar chess match um I don't think we want to do that but I would be willing to put him in a one-on-one match against Frank for example the UK sensation and maybe we put a bounty of ten thousand dollars maybe I'll put it up myself Frank Tyler won ten thousand dollar chess match 75 to the winner 25 percent of the loser or maybe Winner Takes all whatever they want to do let's set it up I'm I'm gonna go now I gotta check out of this hotel before they kick me out get out of here
