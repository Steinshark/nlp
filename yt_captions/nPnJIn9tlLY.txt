hello my friends and welcome back to mystery Tech we have a very special guest construction noise oh oh what's up I caught it I'm so fast like sanic alright first item is alright don't like this oh is this the stupid MH KPD thing or whatever it's called so recently on Twitter I found that there is a company called MH k BD or m KH BD it looks like mkbhd and every time I read the name I feel like I'm Dyslexic but they make these wonderful little wood creations like this which is a phone stand right yes alright so let's give this a try Wow how lovely that is truly a magnificent sight hustle for Marquez and his secret woodworking company but look how nice this is I can it rotate it around I'm not entirely sure why this moves because I don't see any reason for it to move oh ok I see so you can rotate the Moose so you get different angles on your phone how so smart he what did what a clever gentleman that Marquez if only we had recently done it this is episode with Marquez all about whether or not he can guess takun phones correctly linked in the description [Music] I hope you have some headphones Ken I'm feeling the mute mood for some music hey wait did you actually have headphones really ready okay cool these are the Razer Opus Wireless noise cancelling headphones so eventually heard a lot about this so if she got a really brief look at this at CES earlier this year but essentially the idea is that these are very similar to something like the Sony 1000 X Mark threes however there are only $200 and by most accounts they are almost as good in certainly most categories and obviously a lot cheaper so can I know you've spent a lot more time with you 1000 X mark 3 so generally speaking they're regarded as some of the best sort of over year noise cancelling headphones however it's 3 or 50 bucks they're very expensive so if these can even get close to the same level of comfort noise as well noise rejection I suppose as well as audio quality I'll be really impressed Wow I mean these look almost identical to the Sony's but that's not a bad thing I feel the Sony's have a very classic design it's just very unusual that of all companies Razer are the ones who've dropped these out I mean yes there's certainly not gaming focused headphones but of course you have to consider the Razer makes a lot of other products including their own phone so the only natural for them to get into the sort of higher-end audio space that's not necessarily just for like a gaming headset they do own thx oh okay initial impressions the passive isolation is nuts on these things like legitimately I could believe that these were on just by putting it on like that's actually a massive difference usually I'm not a big fan of downloading apps for well most of things I miss protected however I will download the Razer Opus app because not only I'm sure to use this for things like updating your firmware and whatnot but supposedly you can actually tune it fairly accurately I guess with the EQ and everything so I'm connected auto shut off Oh auto pause resume when the headsets remove from your ears that's a nice feature obviously with a lot of sort of like in ear buds you know you take out your ear pods whatever I'll polish your music it's a little bit of a left common feature for a proper full-size pair of headphones it's a really pleasant sound it's nice soundstage but it's not it's very easy to listen to it's not like sort of cranked up on like the highs and especially the bass like a lot of headphones there especially like bluetooth headphones alright verdicts so I do agree there's definitely not as much of a punchy bass e sound to it the one thing I really like is that this actually has physical buttons instead of the Sony that where the Sony has such controls that I feel like get in the way of everything I like these almost purely for the fact that they automatically play on pause like I really gotten used to that with bluetooth headphones let the galaxy buzz and like ear pods and stuff that's a really nice feature that is really seamless it's super quick do what they don't like is when you turn on and off and see the music pauses for a second which sounds kind of like jittery you sound really good for $200 all right okay well I see more Razer stuff is this just the Razer sponsor episode Ken are you just sneaking your sponsors now already so we have the Razer Keisha another item that we did take a look at at CES we also have the TCL 10 Pro wait hold on walk me through this for a second have you bought anything in this episode yet have you just been fully like taking advantage of that sweet sponsor money the entire time well thanks after the last one was like $400,000 I'm pleasantly surprised okay you know so let's start with the key sheet okay that's a pretty straightforward lookin controller I would not do that with no I do you subject your Galaxy behold flip Heisey flip you know what no the C flip is durable one bad moment in your phone no look it's even sturdy look it's like the full tongue up flip in half look it's fine oh right I forgot I will mean to say one thing I like the gray finish on the back that actually does look kind of unique this is every bit as good as a one plus or a galaxy it's nice sort of metal machining on the sides you've got a tapered edge which honestly looks like it's straight off of something like a one plus seven oh we've got a headphone jack how wonderful although I will say the notch is looking a little a little on the old side I was about to say what a nice freebie in the box but um display greatness is burned onto your case so uh I don't like that at all all right well I mean I'm not impressed with this fingerprint sensor right now it is taking on a solid two seconds for it to register right now maybe you'll be a little bit faster later choose dominant hand left hand or right hand this is a Snapdragon 675 which is actually resolved 675 probably will see in like pixel for AAA or whatever oh my god it burned in a watermark a TCO watermark display greatness display greatness display great selfie portrait I mean wow did you see how far like delay that was I mean that does not look good that is not my best selfie what the okay so we have three cameras running right now that's cool original ultra wide in low-light video that what what but that's that's gonna haunt me forever for Austin's hey guys this is aa phone [Music] okay so you know what the camera seems to be about as good as a four hundred and fifty dollar phone should be unless your name is Google pixel why don't we try a game here one slight problem with this it covers up the the proximity and the light sensor so the phone immediately went completely dark I have to manually adjust that up so now that we have fortnight downloaded there are a couple of issues so first of all the key she does seem to work at least to the menus and all the buttons are being registered the problem is is that the phone is defaulting to low low resolution in 20 fps so I cranked up the limit but I don't have high hopes for the performance of this guy wouldn't even let me turn up the graphics to medium I didn't think that the 675 was that sort of low end but like it looks terrible like it definitely looks like it's running it like 360p or something well its name in 30fps right now I'm at 21 22 yeah this thing is not impressive my iPhone se would absolutely do a better job well you see how the world was like spawning in as I walk down the corner there look the thing is the controller I'm on Portland this feels good it's not a perfect fit for all phones but something like this I think it works well enough the problem just is with the TCL it's a nice bit of hardware but the performance is bad like there's no other way around it like this just looks terrible whoa what the I had no idea how to play fortnight but they've added a lot of stuff since last time played Sonny Tech okay what is this what is that I see it capacitors and is this like the Tesla coil this is part two yes okay never mind I'm excited again excuse me you say words plasma loudspeaker this looks so nefarious I could don't even know where to begin so we have what looks like a power supply here and then we have a like a motor or something and then it goes to this which is I guess just a couple of copper contacts are you sure there are no instructions of any kind there was nothing in there I said go for it Howard [Music] what the [ __ ] was that okay what is that what how do you do anything with this okay boys jumping over what the what is happening yeah this is like going all over the place so the thing is this is a really interesting device the problem though is this is not all that loud it's very cool there were literally using electricity and a plasma arc to listen to music but it's incredibly quiet you would never want to listen to this as like a real speaker right you almost hear sort of more of the hissing than anything else but that being said is a science toy it is actually really interesting it also scares me but I mean what else is new lots of things Kenny oh wow what lovely background noise if only I had my active noise cancellation headphones oh well instead I have a ps4 controller Wow oh gee whatever can I do with this and [Music] this is the main flash magic in test wireless controller adapter for switch in PC we're trying to tell me that this turns a ps4 controller into a switch controller alright my friends I come bearing a solution this may look like a normal TV to you but in fact it is not because it is the ultimate Nintendo switch Pro that we very carefully customized on the building the ultimate Nintendo switch I'm using this because I want to show off my craftsmanship not because I can't find another Nintendo switch dock which is not glued to the back of TV I looked really bad on camera okay so this is pairing that's probably a good size oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh it worked it worked it worked weight wise not what weight well yes period it's big what it's buried it's bear DC's paired can you see its period right now look how blue that is this should be working why isn't this working okay you know what this thing doesn't work we're moving on with the u.s. fine cuz the ultimate switch doesn't need a PlayStation controller it's good enough as is what is that why do you give me more things I don't need everyone on the table this is another rowboat after Ken did you give me another guy mobile raptured thump we've had Robo Raptor we've had Robo raptorex that megaraptor we've had that weird pink Raptor we've had like five or six others that I can't recall off the top of my head but now we've completely given up and now we have Robosapien a Gundam I mean it's from the same company are you trying to tell me the Robosapien is more popular than Robo Raptor really who wouldn't want a robot dinosaur a little brother that was the most likes moment of my life woo [Music] you know I wonder why people don't take me seriously sometimes and then moments like this I haven't reminded of why no one takes me seriously sometimes we names us the cringe episode of mystery tech was that just every episode he's not happy about his newfound brother yes yes there there okay so we have Robosapien he doesn't look as high-quality as rebel Raptor he's just black and just generic looking and that's cool that's kind of cool actually here's two feet full of batteries I don't know I screwed over to find out notice some form for another to seize kg oh yeah two DS double D's my friend double D's just break your night he's not so hard you broke it we do have DS are you trying to tell me that this mystery tech is officially over now that we don't have batteries for Robo limo we do know the bolt late yeah it's good thanks watching see you guys next time [Music]
