about a year and a half ago i almost died while making a documentary three of the seven people i was with got shot and my camera and tripod took at least three bullets we were setting up to film an interview and just about to hit record so needless to say a lot of my equipment got damaged when the shooting started but out of everything one piece of equipment took two direct hits and still works perfectly and that's my sackler flowtech tripod i'm luke forsyth documentary cinematographer filmmaker and former photojournalist and this is the bulletproof tripod before we get going here i just want to say that i am not a gear reviewer and this is not going to be an in-depth analysis of every little feature that this tripod offers instead these are my long-term impressions of a working tool that i've used for over three years as a professional documentary cinematographer that still works as well as it did the day i bought it despite being shot twice if you look around on youtube there's a lot of people who like this tripod it's not just me but in all honesty most of those guys look like their tripod came out of the box about 10 minutes before they started filming and i'm really not trying to take away from the opinions of the other reviewers because i watched a lot of those videos and they helped me make my decision when i was thinking about whether or not to buy it or not they did a great job but all their tripods look like they've never left the air-conditioned studio and no offense to them but that's just not me if you take one look at my tripod you'll see what i mean it's covered in dings and scratches and it's really obvious that this isn't something that i've babied and kept locked away in the closet i have used this thing and put it through as much abuse and hurt as i can throw at it and it just won't stop working after the shooting happened i even wrote an email to sachtler complimenting them on making such a tough tripod and they offered to send me a new one but since there was nothing actually wrong with this one other than the physical damage or the superficial damage i should say i said no i've used this tripod on dozens of shoot in jungles deserts mountains any environment you can think of i have never once tried to be careful with it and it just keeps on going it's one of those rare instances where innovation meets really good design and it actually changes the game for filmmakers so after three and a half years i can confidently say that in my opinion this is the best tripod available for documentary filmmakers [Music] video is a gear intensive process and companies are always coming out with newer and newer products dji seems to make a new drone every year and sony releases cameras at a crazy pace that i can't keep up with yeah all the brand new things eventually lose their shine and pretty soon we're just looking forward to the newest and best thing but for a long time tripods have been a static piece of technology there hasn't been a lot of change to the way their design or the way they work i mean how many different ways are there to balance a tripod on three legs invest in a good one and it'll last you a really long time because after all they all work pretty much the same way but every once in a while someone will do something that changes the game just a little bit that's exactly what sackler did when they designed this tripod so what makes a good tripod anyone who's used a bad one will tell you that they can be the bane of your existence as a filmmaker when i moved from photography into filmmaking i wanted to spend all my money on cameras and lenses and all the sort of sexy accessories that go along with it and i wanted to spend as little money as possible on a tripod so i bought a pretty cheap one needless to say it was a terrible idea the first time i took it out on a professional shoot i'll never forget the moment when i tried to set it up for the first time and was sort of bent over fiddling with nine separate knobs while the director stood over my shoulder and stared at me like i was a total amateur it was a really high profile shoot at a time in my career when i really needed a break and it was incredibly embarrassing by the time i got the thing set up properly and leveled the moment had passed and the director was already walking away onto the next thing he didn't say anything it's not like he yelled at me or got mad but i could tell he didn't really think much of me as a professional and those first impressions are hard to shake considering how much i wanted to impress that guy it sucked compare that to the flow tech which goes from its lowest height to its highest height even with a really heavy rig on top of it in like seconds and you'll see that it's a world of difference basically that means that when something is happening or there's a shot you need to get quickly you can get it set up to the right height and start filming with as little delay as possible for me making documentaries the next important thing is how easy is it to get the tripod to the actual location you're shooting there's definitely lighter tripods out there but you usually compromise in usability and how much weight they can carry and so for me the flow tech really hits on that sweet spot a few years ago i was working with another dp friend of mine for national geographic shooting a show on mountain bears in colombia so we were running up and down these crazy hills looking for andean bears and we had to get the tripod set up as quickly as possible when we saw one we were shooting on really long telephoto lenses so we needed that balance of a tripod that we could actually carry for hours a day while we were hiking but that was still strong enough to hold the camera when we put a 600 millimeter lens on it i honestly think that was the trip where i really fell in love with the flow tech we only ended up filming one bear the entire time we were there but since i was the one carrying the tripod i will never forget how much better it was to carry that than some of the other heavier cinema tripods i was used to the other thing that's really important to me making documentaries is durability now i already mentioned that this thing took two bullets and survived but i understand that that's not normal for most filmmakers but what is normal is the fast pace that documentaries move at you tend to kind of move from shoot location to shoot location really quickly and there isn't a lot of time for slow setups and takedowns and i usually don't have time to put the tripod back in the carrying case in fact once the shoot starts i usually just leave the bag in the hotel and it just gets thrown in the trunk with all the rest of the stuff a lot of tripods would get broken if they were underneath a pile of pelican cases or i'd constantly have to worry about checking on them to make sure that they were you know in a safe position but i never feel that with the flow tech maybe i should be a little bit more careful with it who knows maybe i'm headed for disaster but so far i have never once had to think about whether or not the flow tech was going to survive transport it just keeps on working just take a look at all the nicks and scratches and you can see that i have not been careful with this thing granted it might be a little hard to sell this thing because of how beat up it looks but i have no plans to sell this i'm gonna use it to the end of its life and from what i can tell that's still years away i think a lot of other tripods out there would have broken by now and one of the best things for me about the float deck is that i don't have to baby it i can just focus on the story in front of me and getting the shots i need i can go on for a really long time about how great i think the detachable feet are or how cool the light up leveling button is or how easy it is to get to a really low angle but a lot of other reviewers have already covered this in a huge amount of detail there are a lot of other great design features that make this the perfect documentary tripod but i don't really want to make that kind of video i've never wanted to dedicate this channel to gear and so i only want to talk about things that i've used in a professional setting and that i really believe in this is definitely not a technical review this is just my long-term opinion on a tool that has proven itself time and time again to be the best one for the job even after years of abuse and two gunshot impacts it's still going strong it's definitely expensive but if you're an up and coming or professional run and gun or documentary filmmaker and need something that will perform in every environment and help you get the shot every time you need it this is definitely my favorite tripod out there see ya [Music]
