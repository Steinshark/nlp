welcome to the complete camera comparison between the brand-new one plus 70 the iPhone 11 of the non pro model and the Samsung Galaxy S 10 I'm also gonna be using a scoring system that's hopefully a little easier to follow that before on the top left you'll see whatever category were currently talking about so in this case video quality during the day time and for each category I'll be giving a score out of 10 it will be somewhat subjective but it hopefully just give you an idea of where I stand with these phones mostly which one wins at the end now if you pay attention to the colors one thing will become quite clear one pluses footage is far more vibrant now you might like this it's almost like the company has done the editing for you but personally I think it's a bit much I think that compared to the other two phones the Reds especially are pushed quite hard but one plus is video dynamic range is fantastic details and the bright areas of the sky they're captured best by it something that's starting to become a bigger deal in smartphones is the ultra white camera and even though none of these phones are their company's top offerings they've all got one you'll notice how the iPhone and Samsung's all troy'd cameras really are ultra white whereas the oneplus a little less so I don't think it's a huge deal but it's noticeable especially when you're trying to fit large buildings or landmarks all into one frame another important factor is zoom whilst the oneplus in Samsung the earth got optical zoom cameras iPhone 11 doesn't so in this footage zoomed in three times iPhone 11 is looking east softest and Samsung the sharpest that said even without the zoom on balance I think the iPhone has a most consistent reliable video footage closely followed by the Galaxy S 10 also just so you guys have a point of reference I'm going to drop the current approximate prices of each device on screen stabilization is getting good on smartphones and if you need an example of that this is me walking as carelessly as I could all recorded in 4k resolution but stabilization becomes a lot more impressive when we scale the resolution down to 1080p in fact this exact scenario stabilization at 1080p is something that each of these three companies have specifically addressed with their smartphones this year and you can probably tell all three are fantastic at this point I was slightly leaning towards Samsung's on the far right but I had to be sure so that led me to this Here I am jogging and you can probably tell oneplus is super stable too but does have a weird warping effect as it tries to correct for my movements and finally pretty much a full-on sprint some songs is astonishing really oneplus pretty good too but it kind of looks like with Apple when you get beyond a certain amount of motion it prefers to just keep the shake as opposed to having that artificial look that can occur when trying to correct it see ya something is king here with the oneplus producing a bit of warping and the iPhone just not being as steady mind you the software may improve over time moving on to daytime photo is probably the most important category but here's the thing every single modern flagship can already take great photos when basked in light so I focused on the most challenging scenarios like taking photos when the Sun is directly behind the subject there's a trend the oneplus 70 shots are dark and grungy almost like you've taken a normal photo but then dragged the contrast slider right to the end in a similar vein to how its video looks and there's two ways of looking at this in some cases it makes it an easy camera to use need after to mess around with editing software and it can mean a nicer looking photo even if not as accurate as the iPhone but I do think a lot of its shots could benefit from being more evenly exposed you lose a bit of information because there's so much dark sometimes that a lot of the shadowy areas just disappear into straight black it is still capturing that information like you could take a oneplus photo and just brighten it up yourself and it looked fine but out of the box bit dark samsung's photos are punchy but not in an annoying way or a way that looks super unnatural they uses its scene recognition to pick up things in the image like sky for example and it just slightly adjusts the hues to make what a lot of people would say is a nicer looking photo to look at the actual detail captured we can take these shots and crop in at 20 times there's not a huge amount in it iPhone 11 shots are sharpened compared to the other two and the oneplus is just a little bit behind in terms of information captured it is a cheaper firm though we need to keep that in mind another thing is portrait mode and you're probably used to hearing all about how great I friends are at portrait mode but I wasn't actually blown away here on the 11th when taking photos of people it's good the software recognizes a person's face and creates a warm realistic image but compared to its pro counterparts the 11 lacks the telephoto camera that's usually used for this and as results you can take portrait mode shots from a distance and even when you go right up to a subject it's often not as good as soon as you use it with irregular objects that don't obey patterns in the same way human faces do one plus and samsung just do a better job the iPhone isn't always bad to reiterate but it just has the capacity to fall apart quite badly the other caveat with not having a telephoto camera is of course with the iPhone 11 zooming in is just not great one plus and samsung they remain fairly crisp even at five times magnification the iPhone does have an ultra white though and it takes two important pillars a it's extra width compared to the one plus is especially apparent with photos and B whilst both other companies they ramped up the contrast with erol troy'd cameras iPhone doesn't the 70 is good in the sense that it has less distortion than the other two phones with ultra white plus it's an exceptional macro camera the oneplus 70 can get very close to your subject although for what it's worth I did have to take this photo a lot of times because when you're this close even tiny movements are enough to cause blurring so in this category whilst oneplus does have a lot of perks versus the iPhone like it's zoom like it's macro apples actual photo quality is almost always slightly higher and that roughly bounces out in my opinion this again that leaves Samsung has slightly better here with a combination of versatility and quality all three phones have their own unique advantages when it comes to slow motion so to start with live or what the basics covered they can offer you slow-mo at 240 frames per second and oneplus actually does a really good job at preserving its dynamic range oneplus can also shoot continuous 480 frame per second footage that's twice as slow as a 240 that the other phones can do continuously but quality does take a small hit but then that Samsung can record bursts of 960 frame per second footage that is twice as slow as 480 although it can't shoot like this continuously the main win for iPhone comes from the fact that I can shoot slow fees in slow motion footage on the front camera although whilst I'm sure people will come up with creative ways to use this I can't see it being as big a deal as rear slo-mo the last two years in smartphones have seen a serious shift to nighttime photography and so now we're going to start pretty dark and get darker and darker each photo on paper oneplus should be smashing this it has the largest camera sensor and a wider F 1.6 aperture compared to last generation that said it is up against two of the very best here because remember the standard iPhone 11 has the same main camera and the same night note software as the $1,000 iPhone 11 Pro if we crop in 20 times the detail is level between the iPhone and the Samsung but as the light dips further and further the iPhones lead increases you'll start to notice when we get to ultra low light that one pluses shot start to look pretty green as its struggling to find light at all and when I straight-up pointed out the pitch black sky whilst it was able to pick up stars which is impressive the color makes it look a bit like you're seeing the scene through night-vision goggles it's a little more stable than Samsung's attempt though now one of the new features of the oneplus 70 is its ability to use this night mode with its ultra light camera - and to be clear this won't be as good as the main camera but considering that the iPhones quality completely tanks on its ultra wide this is +1 to 1 plus Samsung's ultra wide is better than both though and whilst none of these phones encourage you to zoom in with mic mode that phone also just about edges it if you do in terms of flash the iPhone is actually left a little bit behind and it's a light doesn't give quite as much fill to larger areas but it's not bad overall then for night photography whilst the iPhones night mode is impressive its limitations in ultra wide zoom and flash would make me put these Samsung's ahead also if you didn't already know I'm hosting a big iPhone 11 give away with everything Apple pro all rules are in the description video at night is the one area where smart phones struggle the most because there's little light so it's harder for cameras to capture information and unlike with a photo where you can stand still for 3 seconds to get more light in with a video your phone's got a capture 30 frames per second relatively though the iPhone is usually a little better at controlling bright spots which can end up being blown out on the other - but it's close I was super impressed with the seventy's low-light footage and it could do with being a bit less saturated but it exposes shadow is much better than the s10 and if we try zooming in 2 times the iPhone falls into last place because it doesn't have a zoom camera and it becomes pretty grainy if we pause this video at any moment to be able to see that oneplus is during clear sharp individual frames whereas on the other two phones they're struggling the motion is quite blurry as for the ultra wide cameras I just straight-up wouldn't recommend using them at night they need well-lit environments overall then the night video I'm giving this one to one plus two more things front cameras and microphones quilty then actually in low-light oneplus takes the crispest selfies followed by the s10 but in brighter conditions Apple catches up big time its camera has the ability to go wider than the other two and it's dynamic range is far greater not to mention the iPhones front portrait mode rifles many phones rear cameras when it comes to video the 70 misses out on the 4k that both the other devices can record I think Samsung's video is the best in terms of resolution stability and just color balance oneplus looks good is just it's not wide enough on balance then when it comes to front cameras I'd say the 70 is close to the other two but not quite as good now just poorly run things off here let's take a listen to the audio quality on all three phones this is if you were talking standing pretty near each of the respective devices this one being the 1 + 7 T moving over to the iPhone 11 this is what you could expect this phone's microphones to sound like and finally the audio from the Samsung Galaxy S 10 I'm gonna give my opinion straight after this see ya if they sounded similar there but because they are the main notable difference being that oneplus is audio is slightly tinea a little bit harsher than the other two and whoa that leads us onto these summarized results and again I've gone through a lot of footage from these phones many times more than what I've actually shown but even then the results will be somewhat personal opinion the main takeaways are this the iPhone 11 and Galaxy S 10 are incredibly reliable camera systems they have excellent dynamic range across the board and generally capture an accurate representation of what's in front of you that said whilst the oneplus 17 doesn't win many categories it's never far off and that in itself is impressive considering how much cheaper it is you can safely by the oneplus and not feel like you're missing out in the camera department and that's a plus in my books by the way if you did find the scoring system useful I'd really appreciate it if you'd let me know in the comments because I've got some feedback last time that the scoring system was a little hard to follow so I've changed it dramatically because I just think there's some extra benefit to be had from getting numerical values from this as opposed to just looking at a load of pictures and me telling you what I think regardless thank you so much for watching my name is Erin this is mr. he's the boss and I will catch you in the next one [Music]
