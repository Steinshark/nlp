we're not perfect oh I just dropped One ow ow you're roasting me just we've made mistakes wait what oh my God holy and even our most Ardent Defenders have to admit that out of our more than 6 000 videos we've made a few that are below average a couple that are pretty bad and if we're being totally honest with ourselves we have made some absolute stinkers well it's time to stop hiding and face our shame to celebrate our 10-year anniversary as an independent company I'm bringing on some of our ogs to help me react to the worst videos we've made in the last decade I'm talking our most disliked cringe-worthy unprofitable videos that will leave you either full of second-hand embarrassment or so bored that you just want to turn off the screen and contemplate a lifestyle completely free from technology so you never have to experience something so awful ever again but you won't do that because if you did you wouldn't get to experience our reaction to our Folly and you wouldn't get to experience this Segway to our sponsor build Redux build red makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help along the way they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a PC yourself head to build redocx.com Linus and start your new build today in no particular order here is the bad LTT playlist this one's a bit before your time uh not much so today I'm going to be having a quick look at a new product from Asus it's kind of like a random product I don't know where this came out a total left field here but it's called This is a USB cable to give you some idea how this video came to be I was still working at NCIX the computer store and there's a certain number of videos I had to make a month to get my full bonus if we got to the 25th 26th 27th of the month and I wasn't very close I started just walking around in the warehouse grabbing almost literally any bullet I hadn't made a video about yet and filming an unboxing this is a two minute 20 second video of a cable that yes I promise you I do not even plug again so that's kind of neat so kind of you can do this with it very nice wow you can pull back the foreskin on it so I guess all we're going to be able to do here is have a quick look at the crosslinked product and then I'll have to post my thoughts on the uh annotations in the videos I don't know whether I ever did that those are gone this was 12 years ago but if I did they're gone yeah oh it's Luke revive your old laptop what was so bad about this what am I possibly doing one handing a laptop is it raining why are you in sweatpants they leave nothing to the imagination but before we do that let's explore what it's like to use this thing with the hard drive in it this takes so oh my God we were so bad at making videos how did anyone watch any of this I think I would have either left the video by now or disliked and left the video by now to be fair so they see the saw they see the face shield and then he just swaps the hard drive for an SSD and you've taken three minutes to get to that point are you gonna do anything else check out this video where I detail how to make a test bench for basically free and I'll see you next time no wonder he got canned from the writing team hey man it's good tip let me tell you when someone wants to sponsor a video featuring their wireless headphones their projector their charger vacuums their Robot vacuum a writing Team Works overtime trying to find something can gently related that is actually interesting and then to shoehorn the product into it that is what you are about to witness Sony reached out to sponsor a video about their new wh-1000xm4 headphones we've got this cool pair of wireless headphones that no one wants to hear about and we basically turn a U-Store unit into a theater that has the headphones as the audio device so no one knows you're in there I guess what does building a theater in a storage locker have to do with wireless headphones especially when the only part of the video that I've seen where you listen to audio you were listening it through the TV speakers when you work with a company like Sony who happens to make a sound bar and a TV and a game console there's a lot of politicking that seems to take place over at that company so it came out of the headphone groups budget but I mean heaven forbid we show anything non-sony that Sony happens to make as well probably the stupidest thing about this video is that it was shot before the PS5 came out but released after the PS5 came out due to delays on their side so we were showcasing a shift compact home theater with a PlayStation 4. and it was so much work finding a place that would let us film in their like you store this is a huge security concern yeah [Music] yeah this is classic how is this one of the worst things we've done people didn't even dislike dislike they didn't watch it I disagree oh the actress we hired to be like a background dancer in our rap video thought that she was like getting a ride to the Sky Train after and I was like how on Earth am I gonna drive you anywhere I can barely even get into my car Taryn who didn't have any experience driving stick had to drive me home because I was like buried in this armor in my car which was standard this shoot was an absolute disaster how can I turn this around be an imperial instead of being in a cloud oh we didn't believe it we just muted it yeah so that's one of the things that people hated about it is that there was some kind of miscommunication in the edit yeah great I wanted it censored I think censoring is comedic yeah and I intentionally wrote like really cringy lyrics for it yeah because I wanted it to just be like full of bleeps essentially but you don't just like remove the entire audio track no I arrived at the scene but 10 minutes after dispatch got the call it was easy enough to determine the cause of death but the real mystery is why it happened I think this may be the worst I don't even know what accent this is supposed to be Chicago Brooklyn you want to jump in for this one nothing before sometimes things get rough they hit the ground never get up again open and shut case my mom made fun of me before during and after this shoot for having no idea how to handle a cigarette it was also a conscious decision that Brad Pitt style Luke would be eating in every single shot fast and Powerful a look at two this was a gaming notebook with all the latest pies handling is my app though and yeah that is actually the actor actors in this video yeah yeah set how to speak in both the Boston and a New York accent we were just trying to pick which one was he less bad [Music] so it wasn't Fallen nah this notebook was still running when it hit the ground but that didn't last for long you may have never heard of final mask the company responsible for the creatively named final Mouse but despite its obscurity I tried so hard to turn it into a host yeah I think he just didn't want it that hard he was very qualified to make this video and even the packaging is bare with just the small slip of paper with instructions and a final mask sticker very passionate about mice and mouse pads and actually lots of things and when you talk to him about this stuff he's fine but you point a camera at the poor guy especially back then this is the first one I felt actually improved my game it's just so light and responsive I remember how many times we did this take two not to like it was not in the fall it was just it was a hard thing to do so this is something new it's called Tech Showdown and if you don't like it TS get it maybe the tech Showdown videos didn't work they were so hard too oh my God absolutely grueling I think the funny thing to remember about this is we had so little resources at this time even though we had the office everything I'm using a piece of diffusion to divide this video set a lot of people have asked for subscriber was to come back and this was actually an attempt to continue this kind of spirit of scrap yard Wars but in a way that wouldn't destroy our entire production schedule for an extended period of time it didn't work out that way it doesn't help that Luke and I are [ __ ] at arts and crafts yeah yeah uses boring I stand by it yours is stand by that too it's on Enthusiast Hardware where we first see the innovations that trickle down to the mainstream stuff a couple of years later why is this so hated welcome to a bit of a new style video for me I'm calling it a micro review people don't like micro reviews I guess just least viewed video well that's why we don't cover Motorola phones anymore Yep this video actually starts with an incredibly frustrating moment for me now this motherboard arrived and I was like Yay Christmas time yeah why did we private this it has 804 000 views you know what I think I remember people were so mad about the bathroom about me like hanging it off the edge of a cardboard thing to screw it in from the bottom and I was just like I don't feel like dealing with this anymore I'm just gonna set it private for a bit and then you never and then I guess I never fixed it I have privated so few videos in the history of the channel That Never Thought to go back yeah even some of the videos that are supposed to be private aren't private and I haven't gone back to fix them because when the channel was hacked a few years before we actually went Indy part of restoring the channel was That Google restored the channel every video public private deleted deleted was back up I was like oh okay I mean I knew they don't delete anything but wow they really don't delete anything since when is this full-size Tower more attractive than this little HDMI stick they're both computers and the impossible standards set by the media all computers are beautiful and you're gonna hurt the little compute sticks feelings yeah yeah so you can keep your scummy hands off of it this is terrible I'm so uncomfortable this is really bad I don't remember this literally at all I've like blocked this out like a trauma the definition of the Intel compute stick is actually rather simple it's an Intel based computer on a stick um that was great writing the first six unique items are Windows 8.1 with Bing this is pretty funny that was all right okay ready yeah are you sure you're ready for this actually hold on a second let me just let me just fix it well no you don't it's already I set it up before we didn't this was this was your idea I know this bit was your idea I 100 I argue it against it and I 100 apologize it was a terrible idea he had to make it seem like oh well Lance is gonna do the camera now because I'm in front of the camera for this video and we've wasted already 30 seconds kids used to be so bad hey guys what's up bro oh I'm talking so loud why am I screaming oh yeah I remember this I had the cell phone flashlight going over the shot like that I know that trick all of Brandon's personal SD cards that work yep yeah yep we already had a no personal stuff at work policy did we I think uh we still needed a lot of people's personal stuff seven years ago maybe not yeah cards are slightly overclocked here and here I'm gonna take a baseline idle temperature reading so I'm at 67.65. your voice sounds so different 35 in the background and the cat is moving the projector don't do that this is even a Channel people watched you know this is our least viewed video ever let's see if we can fix that guys get in there watch the great videos yeah welcome to another RC Arctic hobby unboxing this is the aqua Rider 703 Tugboat people love the fire truck did they not like the aqua Rider fire truck was a fluke Loop imagine watching a video where someone unboxes an RC boat and doesn't even bother to put it in water so we're doing a bit of an in-progress shot here we've got to love that editing like hold on a sec dip to Black our extra tires are deposited gracefully on the deck it came with a lot of extra tires I'm not sure why I think that's something to bear in mind guys this one does not come with a remote so you have to get a transmitter so I will be unboxing that one and then trying this guy out hopefully uh on a lake or Pond or bathtub near you yeah hopefully said I'm unboxing the MacBook Air clearly that was a lie this is the Asus Zenbook 13.3 inch Ultra eye no I'm just kidding I actually am unboxing the MacBook Air but before you hit the dislike button it's for a very good reason it's so that I can compare it against the Asus Zen book so the MacBook Air yes I tried to do people in position and then undoop themselves click bait and left that's actually really funny they didn't wash long enough to see that it was a joke hello and welcome to part two of my Blackberry I switched I'm slick and this part two will be a continuation of last time where it's just more of a general use case of the phone every time people tell me like man you're such a good host whatever I'm like you haven't seen the Blackberry video it would be nice if like the camera app if I held one of my notifications it would open the app that corresponds with that notification I hadn't slept at all the night before I asked Linus if I could shower before I filmed it and he was like no we don't have time my hair is like going in a bunch of weird directions oh the idea list that I had done an I switch to Windows Phone series for 30 days and I was kind of like vlogging updates as we went it was kind of cheap easy content and it performed pretty well so I was sitting here going oh yeah you know it'd be crazy Luke you should do like a switch to Blackberry you weren't very good yet [Laughter] my hair looks like a spaceship like it has a pointed front and it has wings on the back you actually look like someone who doesn't know how to do their legroom themself oh remember all those videos we did of coverage at CES well Western Digital remembers them too oh this was one of the worst brand deals that I ever signed we needed it we had to go but they asked for the world got to give them credit for negotiation they wanted seven videos covering a storage company at a show one time it's really hard we were desperate to get any views on any of this and this is what desperation looks like [Music] and the more views those videos get the more crazy insane stuff we get to give away once we get back from the show the orange handle isn't that an ax yes it is why now when I say crazy I'm not talking like your average running I can't watch it anymore then we get to give away two Western Digital one terabyte Velociraptors two four terabytes shoot this but I haven't even revealed the grand prize yet if the video's average why is she married to me and not continue to exist welcome to the Prototype build of the pizza heater computer the idea is you put a slice of pizza on here and your computer keeps your pizza warm yeah the computer should keep the pizza warm you tried to take cold Pizza still got a million views no I think that was the argument back in the day too that like this video went up it still performed okay for the time even though it wasn't not at all the concept that you approved I said all you gotta do is make sure that all the hot air is funneled up to the metal plate the miscommunication was that the pizza was supposed to already be hot I don't know what his problem was these are two 980 TI's they should have a pretty good amount of thermal output then there was the anti-rgb PC this ended up getting three million views whoa that's a lot of dislikes a lot of views but people were so mad at us for for spray painting the hardware and turning it black one um it was actually the motherboard that people were really mad about this was probably not the best way to do this James was pretty new yeah this right here is the design that made James Dyson like like that James Dyson go to his team and say you know what guys all these other upright corded vacuums blow em up this was not entirely my fault the Scandal or the controversy was that all the major Tech creators were sponsored by Dyson on exactly the same day yeah people's subscription boxes got absolutely flooded with these videos making them pretty angry thankfully we came away pretty unscathed relative to some other guys who just were like I'm vacuuming and I love this thing so much this is definitely my real thoughts about it I really didn't say much about it at all I just did a studio tour and then happened to be vacuuming a lot this is our most disliked video this year really you need to get a media server I have a Google Drive where I keep my photos I didn't realize how kind of hated Plex had become over the years the timing of the release for this was that it came out right after the security breach that's never gonna go well not great it took me a while to find out yeah that that was that was BS that was BS right there that was this is one of those ones where we had to make a video about a product that we didn't really have anything to say about so we made a video about something else entirely we got this one wrong I thought people might be kind of interested in basic game development tools and what you could do as a relative layperson in a relatively short amount of time he looks very excited to be in this video [Music] we used to upload behind the scenes of our ad productions for companies to LTT to help promote the ads did not work and I guess this was our least viewed video that year [Music] this is just classical music and like [ __ ] so far everyone looks so young I remember Brandon's transitions what [Music] was that I don't oh yeah that's bad hey these are some pretty good stunts though okay this is the all-new one series from BMW a line of sporty economical hatchbacks that might surprise you this was one of the most difficult brand projects we ever did everyone that was on the trip when they came back like I didn't even get to see the video and I was like this is gonna be rough we flew all the way to Germany I shoot the intro in front of BMW of we've got this shot where like the rep flips the keys to me and I get in the car we get driving and halfway through the day whoever the coordinator was for this project apparently has no idea how video production Works kind of goes no we don't want to use any of that we don't want any BMW representatives in the video we don't want any BMW buildings in the video they didn't like the disclosure that I had that it was sponsored because it makes it feel too commercial I'm like it has to be it is they had us throughout literally everything that we had shot and back then you'd only have one day I only had one day yeah and then towards the end of the day they were like well you can just stay another day I'm like no I actually cannot stay another day this video is the reason that we have a clause in our sponsor contract that they are only allowed I think it's two at its maximum every time it went back to them it would go one layer up the management chain and they would want to have their say on it and we just had this video sitting for months unable to release it when we needed stuff for the schedule whoa it's real unlike project Valerie which we saw last year at CES from Razer this one actually makes an ounce of sense this product ended up being a complete grift oh no it looked credible enough for a pre-production product but this never got any farther than science fair project and they just are still taking people's money that's right it's back in the studio and in this video we're gonna see the solid gold Xbox controller we should never have made the gold controller I thought this was gonna go like kind of viral I can't believe they made a gold controller timing we could yes it's stupid I get it oh my goodness oh my goodness I can't believe we're gonna
