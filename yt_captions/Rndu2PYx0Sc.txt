I I would say nuclear has suffered from the worst PR and that might it might be partly because governments have always been involved and you know things like Fukushima or three M get brought up but I have to point out that nobody died in those in those situations and if you look at deaths per gwatt hour nuclear beats out wind and it beats out solar surpris right it's the safest already and that's not even considering that smrs and microact still safer from new big civil power [Music] PLS hey everybody so I had a great discussion today with uh someone I've wanted to talk to the type of person I've wanted to talk to for a long time and and turned out to be exactly the right person James Walker he's a nuclear physicist CEO of a very interesting company called Nano nuclear and Nano is making micro reactors that are nuclear reactors that are portable that can be moved around on the back of trucks and this is something I'm very interested in being interested in the Nexus in the relationship between energy environment and the amelioration of poverty and it seems to me that investigating the provision of lowcost resilient widely distributable nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuel is morally required partly because we know we know this isn't some wild hypothesis that if you can make people who are absolutely poverty stricken relatively Rich they start to care about the environmental future and so what that means is the fastest way to environmental sustain sustainability is by the amelioration of poverty and the best way to do that is to provide lowcost energy and potentially the best way to do that is with nuclear energy and so I think these guys are on The Cutting Edge so I talked to James Walker as an extremely interesting Technical and managerial background military background as well about just exactly what they're up to that's all part and parcel of this so you know welcome aboard all right Mr Walker James um you're CEO of Nano nuclear and you've got a cool title I think head of reactor development that's a cool tile and I was looking at your bio and you know it's it's quite a lot of fun so what have we got here extensive experience in engineering and project maintenance including mining construction manufacturing design infrastructure and Safety Management so that's a lot of practical work and and so you know I'm very interested in talking to you today and so thank you very much for agreeing to participate in this I've been following Nano nuclear on Twitter for quite a while and I'll just give you some background so you know why I wanted to talk to you I mean I've thought for years that it's utterly insane that we're not pursuing nuclear energy like at at a rate that's as fast as we can possibly move and I have a lot of questions about Simplicity of design and I I they're probably stupid questions to be frank but now I have the opportunity to ask them and hopefully I won't be quite so stupid after I'm done this conversation so do you want to start by telling everybody what it is that you're up to with Nano nuclear and and why you think what you're doing is plausible and plausible helpful and possibly revolutionary I mean you you're up in Canada um take mining sites or a lot of the the um uh First Nation communities they're in remote areas all of these things are run on diesel power and you can't substitute this out for anything else until micro actors come on the scene and then suddenly you've got a market there thousands of mining sites hundreds of remote communities Island communities um charging stations fre Vehicles you can essentially put these remote Power Systems in the middle of nowhere and they would power your communities or businesses 15 20 years and that's a wonderful business opportunity that's never really been present before and that's why we pursued the micro act okay so so let me get some terminology straight so I understand exactly what we're talking about here so we have large scale nuclear reactors in Ontario which and they're planning to refurbish the Pickering site which is a new decision I think that came up out actually last week and and and a good decision thank God we're not as Dopey as California or Germany let's say now you talked about small modular reactors and I've looked into the mol and salt technology reactors and so forth but you're differentiating that down further to micro reactors so do you want to distinguish for us draw a distinction between a micro reactor and a small modular reactor and can you tell us the scale of power production you know in in house equivalents let's say a standard reactor or p it will power something like a small City if I understand if I've got my numbers uh aligned properly a small modular reactor I'm not sure about their power generating capacity and you're and what exactly constitutes a micro reactor so differentiate that for us absolutely so let's start with the conventional civil power plant because um that's what everyone's familiar with because we've been using those for decades so those things are powering cities and Beyond so usually a significant portion of your National grd um and that's that that's in gigawatts you know but when you when you shrink down to an smmr you're talking about something really between say 20 megawatts and about 300 megawatts and when you're getting up to about 300 megawatts you're getting up to quite a large Rea and so that's really the definitional um the definition we can place on an SMR a micro reactor really is anything between well anything less than 20 megab um that point you're dealing with very small reactors um okay yeah and so that's where we are and we're at the low end of that because we want to transport micro reactor okay so so let me okay let's zero in on the micro reactors now for a moment and then we'll talk about the technology okay so when I've been thinking about this because I've been thinking about the relationship between energy and the environment for a long time so when I've been thinking about this a number of things struck me the first is the absolute power density of nuclear fuel which is unsurpassed by any standard except with for fusion and we're not at Fusion levels yet although I talked to someone about that recently and that'll be released quite soon and so then I thought well we've obviously had something approximating micro reactors that are reliable for a very long time because we've been using nuclear subs for what how long now 70 years is at least 70 years yes right I mean so that's a long time and they fit in a submarine so they're not very big and submarines move around so they're obviously portable and the people on them don't dive from radiation poison and they can stay underwater forever so and they're obviously extraordinarily reliable so then I keep thinking well why the hell aren't they everywhere and so let's talk about everywhere for a minute I mean there's some real advantages to distributed systems I would say you pointed to the fact that they could be used in isolated communities but I'm also wondering it's like well why not a network grid of micro reactors as a substitute for these multi-billion ion dollar massive reactors that can but don't very often fail cataclysmically and so I mean is there as well as a market for these isolated places that you describe is there a the broader capacity of making a resilient networked power grid that that gives countries sovereignty over their own power supply but is also has the advantages of like multiplicity of provision which you know I mean we have a distributed system for fossil fuel and there's some real utility in that because if part of it goes down the rest of it doesn't and so so tell me tell me your thoughts on those those sorts of matters well it's interesting you bring that up because um we were recently at a conference in fact just last week and the PO a representative of the Polish government approach us about exactly this and they have um a grid system where certain shutdowns mean that they the whole grid gets lost and so they really come up with no real solution to this apart from micro reactors which they believe they could space these accordingly so that in the event of blackout in a certain area the grid can be substituted with other power sources along the way and this has a this is a far more preferential solution than say big grid system or even a diesel generator system which is actually less consistent and requires the the daily importation of diesel just to maintain right right right well how what these systems are they resilient to solar flares just out of curiosity like because this is also a concern right because a solar flare is about a once in a century occurrence and the fact that a solar flare could take out our whole power grid seems to me a lot more pervasive and present a threat than this like climate alarmism that we're shorting short circuiting ourselves about so I know that the in the the distribution infrastructure still might be susceptible to say solar flare induced shocks but what about the reactors themselves well the good part about a reactor is that it's almost entirely mechanical obviously you can the argument mechanics the mechanics can be very controlled by the electric but the truth of it is that like the reason why mic micro actors are very safe is that say there was a big solar flare and knocked out the electrics and the mechanical systems all simultanously failed with the micro reactor you you can't get the sort of the the disaster or um the the core melt which is the big problem with a big civil plant that you can and reason for that is that it can't generate enough heat especially in our designs to to actually melt the reactors so it passively co and right right so it just shuts down shuts itself down and and even then the say the rea the uranium just keeps getting hotter it's fine it just radiate heat out and it's not going to melt and it doesn't matter like the worst thing that can happen with a reactor is if I don't know it's a coolant leak which leads to a core overheat which leads to core melt which can H happen in big reactors it's not going to kill anyone but it's messy to clean up right right right in a microor just it just passively cool so say you did get that solar flare there's not a huge amount of electronics that it it would it would be a fairly quick fix to go around and put these things back in order but they would essentially just sit there until you came around to do that fix so it's a big Advantage okay so that's another advantage on the resilient side okay so now I want to draw delve if you would into other issues so let's say cost availability but I'd also like to ask some really stupid questions about the technology itself so I've mean and correct me any place I'm wrong and that might there might be many places like that I mean so you refine nuclear Fuel and it heats up of its own accord as a consequence of radioactive fusion and so and then in a big reactor you use rods to dampen down the rate at which the fision um reaction occurs so that it stays within acceptable bounds so let me ask you really a basic simple technical question so I was thinking well what would be the simplest possible source of electricity that you could hypothetically design if you were using nuclear power so I thought well why not embed pellets of enriched uranium or some other substance inside molten lead balls and calibrate the distribution of the uranium pellet so that the balls were basically red hot but no hotter drop them in a bucket of water capture the Steam and run a generator okay so like why is that stupid because it seems the lead seems to me to be something that's dense and would Shield I guess it would get radioactive over time but so that that's a very simple design so tell me why that's a stupid design oh no I mean effectively what you've done is design a basic reactor because like uranium gets hot heats up water like the only thing that's missing from your design is the circulation of water so what you would want to do is obviously move the hot water to of yeah so right but that's a simp we we have pumps we could do that we have pumps okay so so why aren't why aren't extraordinarily simple systems like I mean I know it's not simple to mine and refine the uranium you know but why aren't extraordinarily simple systems like that available even is heat sources for that matter well I I'll give you a good example actually you know that do you remember the voyage uh spacecraft that NASA launched that were they I think on the of the solar system at the moment and um essentially all that's all all that's powering those is plutonium that's um basically radiating heat and that's it it's like it's like the Jordan Peterson reactor but um it's radiating heat and there's like a thermoelectric turbine on the just converts some of that heat into electricity that's it that and that's that's the totality of it so that's probably the most simple nuclear device nuclear power device you could get um but say with say with a a lead lined uranium pet like you described well say you have a place for your fuel and you're putting all of the lead pellets in there um that's going to obviously the lead is now occupying space the fuel could be so you might need to have a bit of a larger reactor and if you have a bit of a larger reactor you need to put a bit more fuel in and then you can get that runaway effect unfortunately the laws of physics keep pushing Us in certain design um decisions um so that's I think been the challenge why micro reactors and um smrs have never been done before is that Material Science is now catching up so for for instance you've actually described um something very close to a solution that a lot of the big reactor companies coming up with called tofu which is um uran like uranium encased in certain layers of um uh like lead and to So eventually you can't get the fuel melt and they're essentially pellets that go into fuel space okay so that gives me some sense I'd like to kind of understand the most basic possible model before Things become elaborated so can we walk a bit through your technology one of the things that I that struck me about your technology was its portability on the back of a truck I mean I can imagine 50,000 reasons why that might be extremely useful but there's something that's kind of cool about it too that you can just trundle one of these things wherever it's needed for emergencies for backup power um and for remote communities which is all obvious land mining sites and so forth as you pointed out which is which is a big deal in in place like Canada and would also as far as I can tell would open up the possibility especially in places like the Northwest Territories for mining where that's practically not feasible because you can't build the bloody hydroelectric lines you know across 2,000 miles of tundra to fire up a mine but with this provision of power then I was also thinking it'd be pretty damn useful hypothetically on the desination front too because everybody's jumping up and down about not having enough water which strikes me as like abysmally foolish given that 70% of the planet or something like that is covered by you know water some miles deep so I don't think we're going to run out so so walk me through the if you would to the design of your reactors and help me also understand why they're not already everywhere okay um so with our reactors um as you mentioned we wanted them to be portable that there was actually a business decision that speared that on because we we thought well if they can fit within an ISO container as an example then you could transport them by truck or by train um or by just put it on the back of a maritime vessel and you could ship these things anyway you could even effectively helicopter in now when you do that you can straighten your design a little bit so you've got to work within the confines of an ISO container so you kind of end up with almost a bath TP bath shaped um design but so we have two technical teams one drawn principally out of scientists and Engineers out of University of berky California and the other out of University of Cambridge but we gave them the same Mo so it needs to be transportable it needs to fit with an is container it needs to be modular and it needs to be able to passively cool like we talked about earlier and they had different solutions so the the US team um they realized that if they take the coolant out and you just have uranium conventional fuel rod and it radiates through a solid core then you don't need pumps for a coolant at all and then the whole mechanical system shrink shrinks right down um so it's it's basically the it's it's one of the most basic designs you could probably make um conductor a solid core and then and then circulated air basically removes heat from the periphery of that core to a turbine and that's pretty much oh really really so you're not using you're not using liquid at all you're just using unless you air as the liquid but that's effectively their solution and I think it's quite brilliant I'm bound to say that but I do genuinely think that um and the University of cambridge's solution um was to um take a basic fuel form uranium dioxide fuel Rod um and um surround it with a solar salt but introduce some um heat into that system to create a natural circulation and then as that circulates the uranium keeps that momentum going and so then you can take the pumps out you can take the mechanical systems out and the system shrinks right down okay and you said that was salt that was salt based that was salt based yes so it's like right right right but the salt isn't molten in that system so how is it or or is it m molten or how how is the heat transferred so it is it is essentially liquid so it'll start off but as you introduce heat um you create that natural circulation and then the heat of the uranium maintains that natural circulation of salt and that will remove heat from the fuel rods that then you can remove heat to turbine and so forth and so right and so how is the turbine how is the turbine spun with that system um with that system it's it's a thermoelectric so um we're not in the we're not going to design these turbines but I mean if you think like a um like a helicopter turbine or something like that where your your burning high quality jet fuel to generate heat and that heat is essentially moving that turbine it's they're very con the good thing about turbines is that right quite similarly to each other right right well they've been around for a long time so that's a wellestablished technology now you also worked for Rolls-Royce for a while if I if I've got my fact straight I did so I was Ministry of Defense that's actually you mentioned submarines earlier that's how I got my start in nuclear I was involved in the construction of uh manufacturing facilities uh to produce reactor cores but they they seconded me to Rolls-Royce where I worked as a physicist in the design of the next generation of nuclear reactors for the Next Generation nuclear submarines I see I see okay so that's a logical segue into the into the commercial Market that you're that you're attempting to conquer now how long have you guys been in operation so actually not very long it was it was only really about 2020 when we wanted to really get the company doing and um I was number two in the organization um and um we came at it obviously from that that background when we were talking about why we why nuclear why micro reactors um but what was quite interesting is actually once we got into the industry we realized that the US infrastructure the nuclear infrastructure had kind of atrophied a little bit and it it had done that because the us could Source enriched material from Russia um weapons grade material and then it could just down blend that material for whatever domestic need it wanted whether that was military or um civil power plants um and that that allowed it essentially to be to not have to renew a lot of its system so when we entered the um the nuclear industry it was It was kind of alarming that we thought we would have major impediments to actually launching a commercial company because of these infrastructure problems so we we thought actually this could be an opportunity so we're looking to try and build our own fuel fabrication facility or our own deconversion facility or our own fuel transportation system and hopefully like we could be part of you know this Renaissance of nuclear right right where are you located so the head the headquarters are in New York um so I'm here I'm actually here at the moment um but uh I'm actually I like I live in Canada most of the time so I'm in where do you live in Canada Vancouver and have you have you had any contact say with the government people in Saskatchewan because I mean as you no doubt know Saskatchewan has like uranium reserves that are I think unparalleled in the world and that don't really seem to be being utilized all that efficiently and so I mean it's such Insanity as far as I can tell we have this in almost infinite power supply at our hands and yet we've turned to solar and wind we're trying to Cobble together battery storage which as far as I can tell isn't working that well at the moment and um so so well so that was the other question I had is like another question I had why aren't these already everywhere you you pointed to transformation in material technology and alluded to the fact that maybe we're just at the point where this has become economically VI viable and scalable I are there are there like regulatory problems are there problems of a public perception as well that constitute impediments I I would say nuclear has suffered from the worst PR and that might it might be partly because governments have always been involved in um the funding of these big installations and the government don't care about but like if I was to say to somebody you know if you nuclear is the safest of all energy forms like if even safer than if you look at deaths per gwatt hour nuclear beats out wind and it beats out solar right is the safest already and that's not even considering that smrs and microact are still safer than new big civil power plants right right and you know things like Fukushima or three M and get brought up but I have to point out that nobody died in those in those situations and really it's just a cleanup operation I don't want to trivialize but um it's I think it human psychology is interesting I think radiation might be more intimidating because it's a danger you can't see and so you can't understand the magnitude of that danger consequently it's not like a tiger in the room you can see and you can assess and and that that maybe has been an impediment okay well okay so that that's well well we can understand that I mean a huge part of the problem that any company has to solve is the marketing problem that's often 85% of the problem even if it's a complex technical problem and so then what about what about government impediment or other like sociological impediment specifically to your progress where where are you where are you getting resistance and where are you seeing like a well- paved Way Forward well the the good part is that when we we did see a lot of resistance but resistance in the form of infrastructure not being in place and just to take an example of another company and they probably won't mind me saying this is that um new scale were the first company to license an SMR in fact they're the only ones in the world to do that um but they became Under Fire because the costs of their megawatt generation was more than they thought it but to be fair to them everything they had to do was first of its kind and so it's like the first pharmaceutical drug cost millions and the second one costs nothing um and so they got penalized for that but they if there was an infrastructure in place within the country to support everything they did and manufacture the fuel and parts they needed it would have been an order of magnitude cheaper for a start and logically nucleus should be the cheapest form of energy um but you have all your Capital costs up front which can really distort that picture right right in big projects like 70% of your overall costs might be financing costs related to that big front Capital cost well you know one of the things it seems to me that you from a PR perspective a marketing perspective that there's a there's a wide openen field of opportunity on one side of this equation that I don't think has been well capitalized upon I mean first of all I think you can make us you already made a case for for green um what would you say for for that that nuclear power can be is a very green form of energy at least at least in principle especially when it's safely delivered in the form that you're delivering it and uh you made a case for reliability and portability and all that but there's another case that's just begging to be made even additionally on the environmental front and so the data is quite clear that if you get people around the world up to the point where they're producing about $5,000 in US dollars a year in GDP they start to take a long-term view of the future they become environmentally aware and that's because they're not scrabbling around in the dirt burning dung trying to figure out where the next meal is coming from and and willing to burn up and eat everything around them so they don't starve so it's it's clear that if you get people we know that rich companies get rich countries get cleaner that's what happens and so obvious and we also think at least that absolute privation and poverty is bad because do we really want starving people and stunted children children and and all the misery that goes along with that and so there's this opening it seems to me for people who are in a position to provide at scale inexpense of energy to say look we could feed the world's poor because there's a direct relationship between energy and wealth like more direct than anything else energy equals wealth and now we can make all the poor people in the world rich in a nonzero some Manner and as soon as we did that they'd start to care about the environment so like where's where what's the problem with that and and and well and what do you think of that as a marketing campaign let's say well you you you've outlined our marketing campaign because um when we were building up the company and we were making some very big connections one of them we were talking to some African diplomats and they were mentioning to us you know one significant issue that Africa faces as the continent is that there's large sections of population that are completely removed from grid systems and so that means diesel generators but the problem there again is that you need a constant supply of diesel to be brought into those generators for R so their supplies it missed um if you have a micro reactor system um we touched on it earlier like desalination plants medical facilities a micro reactor could be put there and you've got 15 years of power for a community and then it's and it's consistent too um and then you can have that $5,000 per capita wealth to create more long-term strategic thinking and um you know been to Africa enough and seen these these poor areas to know that like when you're scrambling around in the dirt your considerations are very short term because they have to otherwise you're going to die and so it's it's it's a situation that begets you know um you know very damaging decisions for for the the larger Community can your savings weather another economic storm think about what you've put away for the future inflation can render cash worthless and even real estate can crash as it did in 20 8 during times of economic uncertainty or Market volatility investors tend to flock to gold as a safe haven asset its value tends to increase during turbulent times providing a buffer against Market

9898 98 that's Jordan to 9898 98 today right right well that's the that's the environmental cost of poverty like we we scream in the west all the time about the environmental cost of wealth but the environmental cost of poverty is way higher way higher and so and this is something I can't figure out I cannot figure out why the greens don't get this because in principle they're on the left and the leftists in principle are on the side of the poor but when it comes but like the thing is like I take Germany as example like the green lobby got into essentially a position of power within that country and they're effectively left with um yeah and they they were very they heavily campaigned against nuclear to push for other renewable Solutions so they pushed heavily into wind and solar but the result of that was that the country no longer could power itself it had to buy Power from from Poland which was manufactured by coal and it had to and liite liite coal right not not just coal but the worst kind of coal yeah I know brilliant brilliant which is which is incredibly polluting and and and they also had to buy um ironically um energy from France which was generated by nuclear power so right right the costs the costs of the German went up for their power and they became their carbon footprint right right so we we want to we want to dwell on that for a minute so the consequence of the green movement in Germany was that power let's let's lay it out power is five times more expensive than it should have been the Germans became reliant on fossil fuels to a degree that they weren't before including reliant on Putin which turned out to be a very bad idea let's point out plus and and Germany is now in the throws of de-industrialization so the poor are going to get a hell of a lot poor and you might say well that's all worthwhile because we're so much Greener but the truth of the matter is is that Germany now has among the world's dirtiest energy per unit because of their idiotic policy so they didn't just fail on the economic IC front entirely and make the poor poorer they failed by their own standards because the bloody goal was to decrease pollution and what they did instead was increase it per unit of energy and not just a little bit a lot and so this just bedevils me because I cannot I cannot put my finger on why it it is that the leftists are simultaneously pro- environment Pro poor people and anti-nuclear it's like sorry guys you don't get to have all three of them you can have two yeah I imagine there's a lot of posturing here and and it's yeah yeah it's not just say that all right well yes but like as an example like I was working in Utah once and there was this I was working in this small little town and there was a massive Co power plant there and I was like oh so this this power is Utah and they're like oh no we we send all of this power straight to California I was like why and they're like well they shut down a lot of their power plants um so so they can claim that they've greened essentially um but really they're still they're still powering their Teslas off coal um that's being generated in Utah and so it's it's the same kind of Optics well you know Californians in Utah and and the inhabitants what are uto utonium I have no idea what you call people from Utah what's I have no idea anyways you know that California and people from Utah they don't breathe the same atmosphere it's like China in the United States completely different a Supply as everyone knows so yeah well one of the reasons I like to talk to Engineers is because they don't get to posture like the thing that's cool about engineers is their stupid stuff either works or it doesn't and it's very unforgiving and so you know and and uh yeah it's okay the Dei people and this and the the uh the politically correct types they're going to take all you Engineers out too so you better get prepared well as a as a my days might be numbered so yeah well plus you're an engineer man you've got a lot of things you know a lot of strikes again you so okay okay so so we we've we've made a case for for um for these small these micro reactors now I'd like to know and you you alluded to something quite interesting you know you said that when you first started to contemplate doing this in the American environment you realized that there was a lot of um a lot of industrial and infrastructure pieces that needed to be in place that had been allowed to Decay because the Americans had had a reliable supply of file material from the Soviet Union as a consequence of its collapse and so a lot of things were left to disintegrate let's say but now you've realized that that's also another Economic Opportunity so it sounds to me like you guys are planning to build a what would you say from the ground up Enterprise that will allow for these micro reactors to exist so then I I want to know where you are how how you came to that CL conclusion where you are in that process and then again because I have a particular interest in western Canada I'm curious about you know H how these ideas have been received in places like Saskatchewan so I would say um there's there's like three questions there y yep yep so um how how these things have been received like let's start with that one so yeah um I think certain territories like Alberta become very friendly to the idea of powering a lot of their remote Industries even the oil sands operations with nuclear power right right right right and that's an incredibly energy intensive industry um and so there has been support voiced for the and there's like an invest Alberta program which is looking actually to bring in smrs but that's not ubiquitous across the whole country like you don't you wouldn't see the same receptiveness from say British Columbia where I am currently it's it's again certain more industry friendly provinces would would drift in that sort of area and I I think obviously Toronto well the Ontario the greater Ontario area came to the conclusion that nuclear had already provided a substantial portion of the energy um for the province and um they didn't want to substitute that for um more more fossil fuels so they they've gone back and invested in is Canada actually has a pretty decent I quite like the reactors they put together the can do reactors and they also they almost generated their entire independent industry because they opted for designs that weren't being widely used across the world so Canada is actually in a very strong position to build out their own SMR industry if they invest properly now um in doing that otherwise they're they're going to suffer in the same way that the United States is suffering from getting going now and another thing you mentioned is why we why we saw these problems we saw big companies like take Terra power it's it's a big SMR company and it's backed by Bill Gates so there's there's no shortage of money for this thing to get going but they effectively did could not find enough fuel to put into their reactors to complete the test work and we thought that's very interesting so what happened there well they effectively had to shut down for two years and that's the worst thing that possibly happen because you just burn cash and so they probably probably going to burn through hundreds of millions of dollars and so the advantage you know W A wise man can learn from the mistakes of others so hopefully we just saw that and we thought well if we can't we're not backed by Bill Gates so we can't afford to make a hundred million dollar mistake like that or a billion dollar mistake like that and so really before we saw the US government realized that there was a significant problem which which very closely mirrored the Ukraine war when relationships began to become very strange and they began pushing a lot of funding opportunities out there to build back their infrastructure and they're doing that now but it's it's still come a bit late and so the advantage we had is we started doing that before these funding opportunities from the US government came out to build uh conversion facilities deconversion facilities fuel fabrication enrichment facilities because otherwise if if Russia cut off the states now and they're still they are still through back channels dealing in the supply of Rich teranium because the US can't afford to go without it um they don't but they don't want to have those channels open anymore and they they they want to cut ties but they can't do it and you mentioned earlier that Germany lost sovereignty over it over itself partially because it it couldn't P itself it was reliant on Russian gas right that's a situation no country really wants to you want to be have Sovereign energy um you know absolutely otherwise your diplomatic strength is completely gone and um yeah well you'd think that no country would want that but when you watch the policies that they're pursuing uh a sensible person would conclude that that's exactly what they want and I I I do believe that posturing has a very a very large amount to do with that because almost all of the green idiocy is is narcissistic posturing it's the pretense of doing good without doing any of the actual work okay so walk me through where you okay so explain to everybody who's watching and listening how you're involved right from the place where the uranium is still in the ore in the ground like what has to happen at each step along the way so that the fuel actually gets to one of your reactors and how how is your company situated to make that happen and where are you in that process so starting at the very basic uranium mining you mentioned this scatch deposit so you you you mine the uranium but the ore is effectively not very useful for anything but you you you subject that or to a leeching process and you create a yellow cake which is essentially more concentrated uranium um that then would be shipped off for a conversion where we sit in that is that we've actually reached out to Central Asia where almost the majority of the world's uranium is currently being mined it doesn't to come from but say there are big deposits in like Wyoming and skatan that are not producing uranium readily now in enough quantities to meet the demand and so it is coming from abroad I believe those domestic deposits will we built up now that the uranium price is rising because like cop 28 announces trip the necessity to Triple nuclear energy by 2040 or whatever it is so that that is having an effect on the uranium price which is encouraging Mine Development but the problem with mining is that it can take five years from a green field deposit to get to a to a mine and so you always have that lag and if the lag if during that lag the uranium price drops and that could even hit that might even coming to commercial production so it's it's there's a lot of risk associated with you know not having your own domestic facilities in place so we have reached out to them we do have an ability at the President office within certain countries in Central Asia to Source uranium directly if we should need it and we've even talked with the largest uranium materials broker in the world to make sure that we have a supply of that because no business wants to make wants to like have the risk that you have all you build all these facilities and reactors and Manufacturing facilities but the the raw material that fuels all this isn't there so that there's that component to it too well do you worry do you worry that you're dealing with these like say Central Asian again it it it I bring it brings me back to the same thing well if you have could have a resource in Wyoming or let's say in Saskatchewan that seems to me to be a lot more geopolitically stable in any real sense than trying to Source something Halfway Around the World in countries that are definitely not politically stable and so so why were you compelled to go seek out suppliers elsewhere well the the it's the immediacy of Supply like they are able to supply material now and that is over we have a mine and it's at even feasibility level you still need to put the mine works in place the processing plant in place processing plant from uranium operation could be quarter of a billion dollars and take three years to build and so we want to make sure that does it have to take three years to build I mean you know because things do move a lot they could move a lot faster now than they once did and I'm you know I also wonder are there improvements in technology that are in the pipelines that would make it possible to do it in like a year instead of three years if people actually decided they you know I mean Germany built new natural gas importing terminals in months when they needed to so like we can actually move pretty quick if we decided it was a good idea so okay so you said immediacy of Supply that's what drove you to Central Asia but it would be better perhaps if there were domestic supplies that were at least in the pipelines let's say domestic Supply from saskat or Wyoming would be would be a lot better of of course they would there's there there's no geopolitical well there's less geopolitical uncertainty um and like for instance even in Central Asia like they do Supply China and Russia still with the Uranian that they need for their own programs too so you're competing against other countries which are potentially hostile to the the states or Canada or places like that and if they're looking to wage an economic War we'll look for more exclusive contracts and so you then are in a competing position for material you can't control right seems like a bad yeah like from a geopolitical perspective that seems unwise let's put it that way so I can understand why you guys are doing it commercially because as you said you can't afford the delay and fair enough okay so now do you have a stable Supply fundamentally can you get can you get moving with what you're doing you can so um the the good part about what we're doing now is we've we've ensured that we have broken enough good relations with certain countries that we can Source the material if we wanted we we're not in the business of enrichment but we could do things like conversion and get it into a uranium hexafluoride gas which can go to a licensed enrichment company like um orano or centrus and they could enrich the material for us and once gas so what's the relationship between the gas and the yellow cake so what you want to do with yellow cake is what once it's been concentrated by that leeching process is that you it's easier to enrich a gas um uh than it is say say yellow cake which which you could use a centrifugal system but um but gas is certainly lot easier to maneuver and so um if you would take the yellow cake and you would expose it to several chemical processes to turn it into uranium hexafluoride and it's actually the enrichment companies will enrich uranium Flora to produce um well whatever you want so um enriched enriched whatever level the customer needs it but at that point it actually needs to be deconverted back to a solid oh yeah so our company actually wants to build out that infrastructure for the country too so take that uranium hexafluoride convert it to dioxide hydde sorry uranium dioxide uranium hydde Anum metal whatever the the market will need um so that's one element and then fabrication facility to tailor it for the specific reactor so essentially fashion it into Dimensions composition um mold it with zonum whatever they want and then and then sell that and the final part of what we want to do is build out a transportation company um so we can actually transport that around North America too how would you transport it so we've actually been spending about a year doing this but um we've got a patented technology now um for a c system that can transport the most amount of um uh enriched material uh so Halo material so it's enriched up to almost 20% around North America and we're just in the process of getting that license now with the with the regulator okay so okay so that's okay so you you've been working on solving the transportation problem and so what are the problems associated with transport that you've had had to solve and how did you solve those so the fundamental problem with transport is that you cannot have uranium critically configured what I mean by that right if you if you uranium is only actually really radioactive if you push it all together which is the basis of a bomb really if you push it together then it be it triggers itself more and it sets off a chain reaction and it's the reactivity creates the heat um so effectively for Road regulations you have to you have to store the material in a structured way to make sure it's not critical but it doesn't end there there's a lot of other regulations surrounding that so is it going to be hit by a plane or a misfile or is it going to fall underwater or is it going to fall or what are the heat conditions going to be cold can it be warm and you got to all these safety scenarios so designing a transportation CK that fits within a truck that can move a lot of material by road is a bit of an engineering challenge but I don't think it's that that difficult but um it's it's certainly something that has not been in place previously because for smrs and micro reactors the uranium is enriched slightly more and because it's enriched slightly more you need a completely new CK system and so that's where we thought oh we'll jump on that and build that out and that way um when the industry does take off the SMR mic we'll have the transportation able to move fuel for all the okay so does that mean I see so that means that your transportation system in principle is not only designed to service your micro reactors but to be expanded to service these slightly larger reactors the smrs yeah the good part that's the plan yeah that's the plan so we don't I mean we we're not in the business where we want the other competitors to fail if they win we'll win right yes yes right absolutely yeah the right number of competitors isn't zero no exactly yeah and also we want them to succeed because um they'll build out the infrastructure they'll generate more money within the country for this industry and we'll be we'll be beneficiaries of that too and they want to move fuel we'll help them move fuel they want to fabricate fuel will fabricate it for them even if they outs sell our reactors it's fine like right so you can also be in on you can also be in on their success in that situation too as okay so that's cool okay so you said you've got a supply at least at the moment in Central Asia that gets uh reduced to by leeching to yellow cake the yellow cake is transformed into uh uranium hydro hydro what's the name of the gas yeah hexafluoride hexafluoride uranium hexif floride that can be uh concentrated and then converted back into about 20% you said uhuh and so why 20% and then and what and you can transport it at 20% and you can do that safely and you can do that by rail by Ship by car or or by uh By by Train and and so now you have the 20% enriched material what do you do with that when you get it to where it's supposed to go so um it depends where it's going so if it's going to um if it's the 20% enriched uranium hex floride that'll need to be converted into uranium dioxide hydride whatever fuel form you want effectively oh so are you transporting the gas we go well we don't want to I don't want to speak preemptively okay that well that's fine yeah but actually no it's fine we do want to Branch take our CK and ify it so it can move gas um I see okay okay the anticipation is that currently um we are building out a deconversion plan to be able to convert that gas into other forms and then when they're in other forms um it's easier to fabricate into the final uranium um form that the customers might want okay okay okay and how how far how far along are you when you're thinking pessimistically in solving these this because you've got a you've got a bunch of problems as you laid out you've got the supply problem which you seem to have solved now you've got the transportation problem which is also a huge opportunity so that's cool because that gives you multi-dimensional access to the market you got the transportation problem and it sounds like that's twofold there's a technical element there's a regulatory element I suppose there's going to be a public relations element to that too but whatever okay so now you can move the stuff around now you've got these deconversion plants that are going to help you formulate the fuel you need to run your reactors and then you have the problem of building the reactors and getting them to where they're supposed to go so four streams of problems that have to move together somewhat simultaneously how how far along are you on each of those streams so if I was if it was a pessimistic timeline I would say I mean we've been working at this for a fair amount of time I would say that the first line of business that we anticipate being commercially ready to deploy would probably be the Transportation actually because oh yeah we have the patented technology we we've already approached the licensing company to a regulator to do the licensing for us and we've actually brought in the former Executives of I don't want to say the name but the largest um transportation company in the world which might give it away but we've brought in some of the former Executives from their organization to build out the company around the technology and so I believe that might be the first commercially Deployable business the timeline on that probably looks like finish the licensing hopefully sometime next year um and then the buildout of the manufacturing facility to produce the cks as well as the the infrastructure around the cks to fit into trucks and things like that we'll do that simultaneously probably finish that sometime about 2026 hopefully in 2026 2027 we would have um a commercial vehicle ready to start moving material around North America that would be okay so that's pretty it's pretty fast okay well and if you were if you if you were optimistic what would you say oh I would say hopefully the licensing will runs all smoothly while that's going on we build out the manufacturing facilities we have them finished next year um and then we're in a position to begin initially deploying vehicles that can move um enrich material up to 20% around country so maybe I shave two years off that if I'm super optimistic um okay so that gives us a range okay so now if you had the opportunity to work with a state or provincial legislature that was like helpful in every way they possibly could be what would that look like what would you need from them is there is there anything you need from from like a particular local jurisdiction that would speed what you're doing along I I would say the big thing on that topic is that the the regulatory process just for any reactor micro reactor SMR or big civil power plant is probably at minimum four years oh yeah that's just no good that's terrible problem the problem I think and they're probably GNA see this podcast and be angry with me but I think they they're trying to apply a civil power plant regulatory framework to a micro reactor a different product and it almost its own regulatory framework to be designed so You' need a You' Need A legislature that was willing to consider the fact that this isn't the same old industry yes yeah it's it's a new product it's a new industry and it's essentially all new technologies and if they were to design some sort of regulatory framework that just looked at say safety criteria for where these things could deploy like uh met certain sizmic conditions or temperature constraints or ranges um then the reactor would would be approved for deploying anywhere as long as it met this criteria I think if they right right right it could really allow for one the deployment of these things absolutely everywhere and and it would really be a much faster process because they're also much more basic I mean it's it's come about because of advances in technology but the the technology itself once it's built is it's more basic than the right right right right right well so do do you have a jurisdiction with whom you're having productive discussions that is simultaneously capable of understanding that this is a new technological front that would be hypothetically will I mean because the economic opportunities here are extreme if it's done right and so you'd think if you were optimistic that there might be a legislature somewhere in the 50 states in the United States and the 12 places that this could happen in Canada that might be open to such an opportunity I mean are you having productive discussions with people who could conceivably clear away the Reg regulatory hurdles so we we have obviously made contact with the Department of energy in in the states and um we've obviously broed this topic that this is something that should be considered it's not that they're unaware that this might be a good idea too it's just they also need funding to implement new legislation or get approvals from Congress um or how it works in the states and there's good bipartisan support in the states for new clear but it still needs to go through the approval process um where you get the the Senate signing off on things and so and they do need funding to put this new regulatory framework in so when they give it to a regulator like the nuclear regulat commission the NRC it can design that new framework um and it needs to obviously employ people to do that what well what kind of funding is necessary to do that like I I'm trying to get a real handle on the impediments you know because the the advantages are so Stark and obvious and we've done some pretty extraordinary things on the idiot wind and solar front and in relatively short order so you wouldn't think that this is that this is impossible so so like what sort of funding is necessary if you're starting a a new regulatory Enterprise essentially from scratch designed around this new technology I don't understand the necessity for this great expense and and and spending of time no I I think really it could be done if I'm honest it could be done very very quickly I think the problem is that um say like a department of energy they run into needing more funding to create a smaller Department to design a framework and then they could be waiting on that funding for a long time as as Government debated but actually if if Government were very in favor of it I'm sure on both sides of the aisle there would be General support for just a small amount money okay so let me ask another practical question if I said um do you have a 20page document that would outline an intelligible regulatory framework that you could hand to a legislator who was you know positively predis opposed to you like do you guys have that because you know one of the easiest ways to get people to say yes to anything is to make it extremely easy for them right and to provide them with us exactly exactly because if you're saying well you have to whip up a regulatory structure from scratch and you have to take all the political risk they're going to say yeah five years from now and we'll let other people do it and it'll take forever but if you can hand them a tailor made solution essentially I know that runs you into the problem of you know government industry collusion but that's a secondary problem as far as I'm concerned because this isn't collusion it's joint it's joint effort to move forward something that would be of great benefit to people you know then so and if it happens to be of benefit to your company it's also going to be of benefit to many of the other companies that you described too so do you have a set of proposals at hand that you could Supply to an interested legislative party yes I mean to be honest that would take us a few weeks just to put together like a proper okay well that's not long few weeks is long you know because I can imagine some people who might be interested in taking a look at something like that oh well look if they were very interested I'd be very interested in that conversation and we our scientists would be very happy to prepare a formal document that outlines a proposal for how these things could be like it would have to be a very high level thing but I down but essentially the the criteria for approving the safety of these things for deployment on mass to different locations and it is very different because um like a big civil power plant you have you have a a site regulation process where they it has to be site specific and you tailor your um your safety case for that specific site yeah for reactor you wouldn't do that it would be a different process where there is a safety criteria that you need to meet but as long as the site meets that safety criteria the reactor can deploy that so it's it's fundamentally different if you're always

of detail that legislators would appreciate so that that differentiation is not only made conceptually but made in a manner that would be credible to like investigative news reporters and so forth and people who are skeptical about this but I mean I do know that technical problems are one thing and obviously you guys are capable of solving them but it's very very easy for a whole industry to fall into a mess of red tape and never get out and certainly that's happened on the nuclear side of things and so that's just not good and it's it's once I see I realized I I I worked I'm ashamed to admit this to some degree but I worked on a panel years ago 10 years ago something like that which was one of the early un documents on sustainability and I worked on that for about two years and I learned a lot about how such things were made how such sausage was made let's put it that way but I also learned a lot about the Nexus between energy and environment and one of the things that really and and economics one of the things that really struck me and I never forgot it was the fact that soon as you make people Rich they start to care about the environment and I thought oh my God that's such a wonderful thing to learn because it means that we could deal with the problem of absolute part and we could deal with environmental sustainability in the same way okay what's key it's clear what's key it's easy it's cheap energy period And so okay so then the next question is well where are the available energy sources and obviously one answer to that is with continued use of fossil fuel but we see the geopolitical trouble that's laid in front of us because of that and there are problems of pollution although especially with coal although they're not as grotesque as they've been made out to be but nuclear you think nuclear I mean I read tell me if this is true I read that part of the reason that nuclear is safer than solar is because people fall off the roof all the time installing solar panels and that you know and PE falling is actually like the fifth leading cause of death it's no joke right so falling is really hard it but it's true like and also if you look at wind power too there's there's a significant number of Falls that are generated by the installation of these and they need constant maintenance which means there is a constant stream of people going up and down these things death which is why when I men there a stupid solution low energy density like they're know they're not a good solution and solar I mean one of the things I've really watched in the last five years say as these big solar and wind projects come on especially in Alberta because I've been watching the Alberta power situation it's like the the price of electricity goes to infinite on windless and sunless days okay infinite is a bad price that's a very bad price and you can't have unreliable you can't have an unreliable reliable grid that doesn't work so and I don't see a solution to that I mean tell me if I've got this wrong so my understanding is that fundamental the fundamental problem with a renewable grid is the phasic nature of the power and because it's phasic you have to have backup it's like Well it can't be nuclear because it takes too long for them to get online at least in their current form so you have to have natural gas and fossil fuel backup or coal and if you have to have the backup then why not just use the systems because you're not going to build two parallel systems like who in the right Germans would do that you know and that's that's insane you know one of the things I thought was funny when I first moved to Canada is that I was I was actually living up in Yellow knife in Northwest Territories for a few months and it's an interesting place to live for a little while um but I was I someone mentioned that the whole city was powered on diesel I said that's crazy this is a city of like can't remember 40,000 people or something like that it it was fairly significant and I was like why and they're like oh the dam is broken I was like can't they fix the dam it's like well they can't really like it's it's blocked up and it's winter it's difficult to get people up there and so we're just been running off diesel generators as far as I know it's still running off those diesel generators and I I was there six or seven years ago um so that's think how much diesel there's yeah well there's nothing more permanent than a temporary fix especially if the government happs to be yeah absolutely absolutely and so right right well and and Yellow Knife is isolated and so the fact that all that diesel has to be brought in all that means is that it's really really expensive to live in Yellow Knife that's the outcome yeah there was another uh there was another Province who I think it was in Yellow Knife too they were talking to us about there was this there was a community of about 800 people um one of the first nation settlements up there and they they the outline of the diesel alone if you ignore the logistics and Manpower and the cost of generators was $10 million Al loone for just the diesel by itself for 800 people for a year and I thought well that's crazy like that's that's an enormous expense for just 800 people um right right right no that's right it's well there's many crazy things going on and and and there all that posturing that you described combined with a tremendous technological ignorance of of of the of the most Stellar sort means that we are putting it in place solutions that cause way more problems than they solve this just isn't acceptable it's not acceptable and look I I never want to denigrate fossil fuels too much because I believe they definely have a place and they've been of enormous asset to humanity and I and people talk about zero as in going to zero yeah that's insan that's insane that's completely insane also just not practical I even if you were to stop all power by what about textile industry or the down stream products of of the fossil fuel indry Plastics you're never going to eliminate them completely and so it's it's foolish without eliminating a lot of people yes yes yes yes and that seems to be the plan well you could imagine a world where we used fossil fuels as chemical as a basis for chemical production like fertilizer for example because we're not going to substitute nuclear for for fertilizer right so but yeah there's no one solution for every aspect of humanity is very complex existence but everything could have a very very well fitted place and to be honest micro reactors are in a much better position to power remote communities like yellan than diesel whereas obviously nuclear is never going to replace you know fossil fuels for producing fertilizers right right right right well and and we shouldn't be burning arguably we shouldn't be burning up our fossil fuels when we need it for chemical for chemical stock I mean that's that seems to me so why not okay so let's let be optimistic here for a minute so so let's imagine that you cleared the regulatory hurdles and now you you you've managed to transport your file material safely and you can build start building these reactors okay now and people clue in and we can start to build a resilient power grid as a consequence now you can start manufacturing at scale right in principle so how much how uniform a product are you making at the microa Factor level like is this something this assembly line manufacturer and can you drive down the cost in with volume yeah so this is actually it is that the economy of scale here is the real benefit so if you're producing two or three of these a year it's very expensive but if you're produce of these it actually gets very cheap and the good thing about micro actors which has not been possible before is that it allows for very easy manufacturing because they're they're simple enough to do so there's no reason why you can't have a production just 3D prints these things and then that the costs come down very quickly and then and then you are cheaper than a diesel generator and once you are cheaper than diesel generator and that will take a few years um to be fair but once you do get to that point there will be no real logical reason to use anything but microaces in these remote locations mining sites out okay well let's go be okay let's go let's expand beyond that so now let's assume that you can use this printing technology that you described and you said the scale the economies of scale start to kick in at how many reactors a year I I would say actually really about 15 and then that sort of points more economic it's actually very low in fact I think Idaho National Laboratory concluded that it was something like nine I don't want to Mis okay okay so it's a very low okay so let's Okay so let's expand our our vision momentan and say that you could produce a thousand of these things a year and that and that they were distributed widely enough to start putting some back resilient backbone into the power supply and start to substitute for for natural gas and for and for coal well we could start with coal okay so what if if everything went as well as could possibly be expected on this front how how far down do you think you could drive the price of energy like compared to what it is now well I mean that's very interesting because if the ear infrastructure was in place and you had domestic production of uranium um and we upgraded our enrichment facilities but domestically which they we currently don't have um and you Mass manufacturing these things I mean I'd hate to put a price on it but like yeah there's no reason why you can't keep optimizing that system to keep making it incrementally cheaper so even right okay so you're driving down the price you're driving down it and to be smrs it's it's not our business but those guys their costs will also fall commensurately with hows are falling too because there's no reason why they can't Mass manufacture those things to be major components of a major grid system so it's a more robust system that's getting cheaper all the time um there's no reason why that couldn't have the beneficial effect well that's well that's ridiculously exciting all of that and so yeah well seriously seriously I mean that's such an optimistic possibility okay well let's let's okay let's be smart about this let's talk about downsides now we talked about the fact that people are afraid of nuclear technology now in principle that could be handled with a marketing strategy that wasn't based on lies that provided accurate information about the fact that this was essentially a new technological approach and that could go in lock step with the provision of the Mater the legislative material right you can imagine a parallel campaign so that seems to me to be a solvable problem now okay some terrorist hijacks one of your trucks how about that so the the the Assumption there is they're going to turn into some sort of weapon um or spill it or spill it so let's let's think let's think about how they would have to do that so if they were to seize your microact or your SMR um the problem they have is that the uranium is not enriched to a weapons grade level so they can't make it blow up and it's also alloyed so they'd have to build a multi-billion dollar facility chemical plant to to recover the uranium and separate it from the alloy and then okay so that that okay so so that's just not a danger what about what about what about stealing one of your trucks and threatening people publicly with like radiation I know look I already understand I I want to put this in context because it seems to me that anybody who hijacked a propane truck would be in a pretty good position to cause a lot of Mayhem so and you know or derail a derail a p a train that that is carrying fossil fuel so we have plenty of risk like that already in the system so do you where do you see where if anywhere do you see the kind of risk to the public that can be could be leveraged by someone crooked who wanted to cause trouble well just just to touch on that quickly if they if they seized it the problem they have people use examples of things like dirty bombs which is where you attach bomb but the problem with the reactor uranium is that it's it's not going to explode if you reactors can't blow up for a start like they're not enriched to a suitable level enough if you were to take the uranium out of it and strap it to a bomb the most dangerous thing is the bomb that you've made not the uranium around the B actually right if you blow up uranium it becomes less dangerous because You' separated the material so it's going to react less with itself and become right so you could imagine that you could imagine that as a public relations disaster fundamentally yeah because you can imagine how that would be played up but but again I don't think that puts you in a category that's any different than you know people who are moving fossil fuel from place to place cuz that's that's more risky that's at least as no it's more risky because it's much more explosive it's much more explosive and it's dirtier actually like obviously if you had a dirty bomb you'd have to pick up the pieces of UR radium no one's going to get hurt but like it's still You' need to maybe cordon off for a microct maybe up 100 100 meters either way but it's still not very say the BP oil spill I think some of the effects that are still being felt so it's it's it's a lot it's a lot cleaner cleanup operation um right right right I think it's It's Tricky I I don't want to sound like it's all perfect but you know what's a terrorist going to do with a microactive from Heat's house you know it's that's there is a good advertising campaign right yeah mic reactor heat your house right right right all right well okay so now let's see we've covered we've covered timeline we've we've covered the your process essentially okay maybe we could talk a little bit more about the micro reactor technology per se so um what is it about the technology that makes it amenable to mass manufacturer and why does that drive the price down and where are you in the manufacturing process okay so the the good part is that like if you think about those big civil power plants they're huge they take up I don't know 30 30 city blocks they're absolutely enormous but there's an enormous Quant of mechanical components um pumps all sorts of systems that go into that as it should be that's fine but as you shrink down to SMR and you Shri down to micro reactor a lot of that goes away and we actually in as say one of our reactors have hardly any mechanical components at all and so then then you can get to the point where you can 3D print these which you couldn't do for more complicated mechanical systems where it's a bit more finicky um and that does allow for m production of these things whereas mass production for larger Machinery that's more intricate becomes harder you can obviously still 3D print components and piece them together but there's still a lot more engineering work and um uh human involvement that would be necessary to to compete those whereas a lot of that can be automated I think as you get simpler and simpler well so you've pointed to something very interesting there which we've kind of brought over is that you know you basically said something approximating almost no moving Parts okay and that that's not something that should be brushed over because that's quite remarkable because the fewer moving Parts the fewer things that can go wrong so that's a big deal but that's also simpler more understandable it's more marketable too because people can understand it and but also it's as you pointed out it's much more manufacturable so to what degree have you reduced the moving part complexity like when you say there's virtually no moving Parts how many parts are there fundamentally so I would say take our Zeus reactor just as an example that's a bit further along like there are moving Parts say control rods that are inserted into the core and control rods are to moderate the reactivity so they go in they eat up neutrons if Comes This reactive and that's how you control Power essentially as well so that is a moving part and that does require mechan um but the it does need fewer safety mechanisms involved than a much larger reactor because a much larger reactor or an SMR will have the ability to overheat and have a core melt or coolant loss and a core melt which is then leads to the reactor being essentially destroyed and needing to be cleaned up like you got in Fukushima when that reactor essentially melted and then you just had to spray it with water that really can't happen with a microact because it can't overheat to a point where it will melt and so you don't need as many Dundon systems in place um in case wasn't wasn't it a safety system that went wrong that caused the Three Mile Island trouble I read that it was like a safety camera that broke off and got lodged in a exhaust pipe something which is you know horribly dismally comical dis dismally comical exactly and this is the this is the problem is like you still need sensors and things like that within a reactor so you know how to operate so you know you can see you can tell what's happening uh and then obviously modify the controls accordingly so there are systems inside a reactor that could fall off in Three Mile Island obviously you something was dislodged and affected the flow and then created effectively a runaway effect where core melt and then you did have a right right right right but again like Three Mile Island no one died in that kind of operation but it it's bad it's bad PR certainly yes yes yes well and that's a problem I mean that that's pollution in the public in the space of public opinion and that's not trivial okay so let's let's um recap here just for a summary for everybody watching and listening and then maybe as a closing see if you have anything to add to it um so there's there's plenty of uranium it's very very dense fuel source it needs to be mined and transformed into yellow cake and that has to be further refined into uranium oh now I forgot the damn heide heide hexif floride hexafluoride and then that can be that can be refined further into the raw material for the for the raw for the for the power source for your micro reactors now we talked about what a micro reactor are is it's it's very easily transportable um doesn't require which also something we didn't talk about which is extremely important that also means that you don't have to produce the kinds of transmission lines to move the power from place to place which are also hyper expensive and require a lot of maintenance that's a huge Advantage okay so you have these micro reactors they're under 20 how many watts 20 megawatts under 20 megawatts right and you've built them reliably enough so that they can be just transported on site as long as the site meets a variety of minimal preconditions and so this is going to be superb for isolated communities or mining Enterprises Etc but in principle these could be networked together to provide a very resilient reliable and increasingly lowcost Universal power grid which would enable us to free up fossil fuels for use as chemicals chemical uh precursors let's say that's a wonderful summary like absolutely and there's no reason why it come you know some countries are examining doing exactly that like like I mentioned Poland was already examining doing that just to make it grid more resilient more robust and eventually cheaper right so that would be the start you could imagine these things littered around in some ways as backup for the current grid right so that to increase its resilience but as they become cheaper and more reliable and more tested even in the public market then they just start replacing pieces of the grit yes exactly and like there's no reason why a developed country can't like slowly transition in that direction it doesn't have to be immediate it doesn't need to be trillion infrastructure spending shouldn't be immediate shouldn't be immediate because there's going to be problems that are rise that you don't understand till you try to do it so should start locally and then well absolutely I mean that's the problem with like Net Zero by 203 it's like no how about we don't Stampede off a cliff like linked arm and- arm you know maybe that's a bad idea like it like it certainly is okay well that's extremely cool all of that and so um now is there anything you want to tell people that we didn't get to on this side of the of the interview I mean the good thing I mean you covered a lot and like obviously um you're you pick your understanding is very quick on the nuclear industry as a whole um I would say I mean holistically speaking I just think it's best to communicate that this is a this could be extremely beneficial for mankind generally and I I could obviously talk about the company and everything like that but I think yeah ultimately the probably even more important message is that this could enfranchise billions of people around the world provide that energy and I think you put it best when you said that you know if you give people access to energy you lift them out of poverty and then they become more concern with the environment if you really care about the environment you should try and lift people out of poverty right exactly ex that's a great closing note that's right if you really care about the environment as well as people let's say because maybe we could include them in the environment then you do everything you can to lift them out of poverty and then with no holds part right that's the number one moral imperative right I mean even the climate look even the climate apocalypse mongers use the safety and well-being of future Generations as the rationale for the moralizing so there's no way out of that conundrum it's like no how about we help the people who are live right now how about we do thatly and look I I have children of my own and I worry about them all the time and I wonder what kind of world they're going to inherit and I I would like that world to be one where they had access to energy and and they were and poverty was far more scarce and not and not an impending risk um so I have a duty I have a duty to the Future to try and make it a little better right resilient wealth resilient wealth that would be great that's a wonderful phrase like if we could some sort of resilient wealth and look wealth is very energy dependent and so yeah yeah they're the same thing man for all intents and purposes because energy is work and work is wealth so like end of argument fundamentally end of argument like I think the fundamental things to progress mankind as long as it's conf feed itself and it can power itself then we should have a a relatively decent future that can incrementally keep improving hopefully yes that's the goal that would exactly be the goal that's right incre incrementally improving in an intelligent manner that feeds on itself yes exactly it's a good definition of Heaven as far as I'm concerned all right so that [Music]
