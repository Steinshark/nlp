CES is pretty much the biggest tech event every year and the 2019 one starting on January the 8th in particular is big for the smartphone market welcome to the top six reasons why brand new flagships this newfound rush to release the first mainstream of 5g phone means that Sony might well be bringing forward the launch of the x f4 to CES and while i haven't been excited for a sony phone in a while taking a look at the leaks of the display it's looking like a massive modern makeover not to mention here to be powered by the brand-new snapdragon 855 which may make it the or one of the most powerful commercial phones in the world HTC has pretty much slipped off the radar and there passed you 11 and you twelve phones didn't exactly set the world on fire but they are rumored to be showing off a completely new variant of smartphones something completely different to those past devices at CES or failing that a couple months later the company has said they're taking a new direction with phones and fair play to them it's about time they may well be focusing their upcoming devices on AI the 5g and blockchain technology and of course there's almost definitely going to be many more phones we're gonna see including some potentially big news from Samsung but latest rumors are saying that they're gonna push back their event to February more powerful accessories I'm quite excited for a ton of new audio gadgets better VR headsets and more applications for them and some slightly more wacky smartphone accessories that you'll hopefully end up seeing on my smart phone gadget series one of the standouts of last year's was razors project Linder which is a full-sized laptop that can be completely powered by the razor phone and I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a more powerful and more finished version of this product maybe one that is universally compatible because you know the razor phone 2 isn't exactly flying off the shelves Apple has a track record of making announcements around the CES time as well to try and just dominate the news cycle they've been talking about air power for so long that it feels like a joke by now a wireless charging pad for the new iPhones and wireless airports but leaks over recent weeks suggest that they're at least on the verge of launching Apple brand charging cases rolled in new iPhones experimental cameras so you might have heard of Nokia's up-and-coming Penta camera smartphone and credit where do the companies done a pretty good job we had the two cameras on the mid-range Nokia 8.1 so it'll be interesting to see how they utilize five on their flagship for a camera experience we've hopefully never had before xiaomi has also announced that they're going to be launching a phone in january but the only speck we know about it is that it'll have a 48 megapixel camera and to be clear that's even a step above the 40 on the May 20 pro which will mean not only hyper detailed 48 megapixel images but also the option to use pixel binning to combine for small pixels into one big noise free one for a really clear 12 megapixel image 5g okay fair warning there are gonna be a whole load of smartphones about to fly in with 5g connectivity and while the vast majority of people are gonna have to wait months if not even a couple of years to be able to take advantage of it this tech is a generational leap and so buying a phone with at least the option to be able to use 5g is a smart future-proofing move then we've got wearables we always see new wearables at CES and 2019 is looking like the year where we're going to see watches that can detect heart irregularities smart bands with seamless live translation and terrifyingly advanced NFC chips that people can plant inside their bodies so then note we've got foldable smartphones and even though Samsung is the one that's been in the limelight for the introduction of foldable devices it's actually LG that owns more patents for them and it's looking likely that a folding phone from LG might just come earlier I highly doubt that a first-generation foldable phone is something I'd be using as my main device but I'm curious I want to see how they're gonna sell it to people and how they're gonna take advantage of the literal flexibility that this is gonna give you alright so let me know what kind of things that you guys are excited for at CES and if there's anything in particular that you want me to film while I'm out there because right now I'm just trying to sort my flights get my hotel but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be going anyway thanks a lot watching guys my name is Aaron this is mr. he's the boss I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
