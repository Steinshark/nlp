oh and there's that cop and i'm getting pulled over [Music] the beautiful thing looking at this police officer behind me is that i'm driving the speed limit [Music] yes hello everyone and welcome i am finally driving my supercharged miata everything works life is good so let's talk about this car let's talk about dino uh charts what happened before and after as far as horsepower and torque what acceleration is like now that it's supercharged uh all the good all the bad that kind of thing just walk through this project now that it's finally pretty much done um and the car is working great let's get right to the point with horsepower so i did four different dyno runs actually a bunch of different dyno runs but four different tunes so the stock car naturally aspirated uh that made 144 horsepower at the wheels 139 for torque then i used a naturally aspirated tune that i put on the car at fab 9 tuning and that gave it another you know 10 horsepower so it was at about 155 horsepower very similar torque about 140 pound-feet of torque so it raised the red line and it increased the torque on the top end so actually that naturally aspirated tune makes this nd1 miata act a lot like the next generation nd me out of the nd2 which has 181 horsepower in a raised red line all right so how about the supercharger so if you haven't yet seen the install with charles and some of the problems i ran into with it i'd recommend checking out those videos edelbrock has sent me a new tune and so i'm not running into any boost issues anymore regardless of which tune i'm running and so with the edelbrock tune the one that comes with the kit uh it is making horsepower at the wheels 184 for torque and then finally for the fab 9 tune which is this is now running 210 horsepower a lot of that because of an increased redline the edelbrock kit has that same 6800 rpm redline one of the advantages of that edelbrock tune is simply the fact that you get the edelbrock warranty for your powertrain and its emissions compliant so now with the fab9 210 horsepower at the wheels 188 pound-feet of torque and that is a very significant bump i was excited to see these numbers i mean it's about 37 more horsepower 30 percent more torque i think it's like 66 horsepower and about 50 added horsepower i think 49. now keep in mind looking at these dino plots um dinos are extremely finicky machines so don't look at all of this as like the exact word of what is a hundred percent accurate about this system but it's nice to see a before and after also we're using roller speed so don't exactly pay too much attention to the rpm the rpm is slightly off just because we're using roller speed for calculating at what rpm these powers are happening but the beautiful thing looking at this police officer behind me is that i'm driving the speed limit the beautiful thing looking about the torque curve is that it's just all bumped up so you can look at that torque curve it's nice and flat before and it's nice and flat after and it just bumps up and above 3000 rpm which is where we're really starting to measure this uh you can see across that whole rev range you're lifting up the torque curve so that's fantastic it means you always have usable torque versus the style supercharger that i used on my s2000 the centrifugal style it only adds on the top end so this is adding everywhere uh because it's a root style supercharger very cool love the way that it feels and how it just lifts up the entire torque curve now what does this all translate to as far as real-world acceleration so i did acceleration runs in first second and third and then calculated g forces in each of those so looking at the actual force pressing you into your seat what is that force that's you know my i think the best way of talking about acceleration rather than zero to 60 which is a time it includes shifting there's other variables in there so the force actually pressing me into my seat i looked at and so i'll display all of those before and after putting on the supercharger in first second and third gear and pretty impressive to see i mean in first gear this thing's accelerating at 0.65 g so what does that mean well if you lay down on the ground you feel one g pulling you down this is 65 of that and that's actually pretty good as a comparison i started trying to find a car out there with similar acceleration numbers to kind of give an idea of what this is like and it lines up almost perfectly with the honda civic type r based on motor trends test data so in first gear acceleration and second gear acceleration it falls in line with a honda civic type r as far as what the acceleration feels like ensure the civic type r is front wheel drive so in that first gear it may not be capable of putting down all the power because it doesn't have you know that weight resting on the powered wheels which is what's going on with the miata you floor it you get extra weight on those rear tires but the civic type r also is front heavy it's about a 6238 distribution so it does have good first gear acceleration and this with the supercharger is matching that first matching it in second and that torque is just flat and that's what's so cool about it the force putting you into your seat is greater in every single gear by about 20 to 30 percent uh looking at g-forces so it's it's definitely noticeable um and and i think it feels fantastic now i won't pretend that it is all a 100 glamorous there's one thing that has kind of been a reoccurring theme with this supercharger kit uh that keeps popping up and it has given me all new respect for oes and their throttle tuning because mazda's throttle tuning which is far far more complicated than it sounds as far as just it's not just simply an accelerator pedal matches your throttle position uh it's not nearly that simple and it's given me an all-new respect and how challenging throttle pedal feel is with electronic throttles and i know a lot of people are quick to jump on electronic throttles and say they're garbage i don't believe that i think there are many real genuine advantages to electronic throttles and i think if you drive a stock miata you will know that it can be done well because they do a very good job with it the challenge is switching over to the supercharger some of the aspects of how the throttle pedal feels have changed and that is kind of an advantage of mechanical throttles like when i supercharge my honda s2000 it's a mechanical throttle you don't notice a difference in how the pedal feels you know before and after supercharging so two issues that i've noticed that are kind of a bit annoying with it first of all shifting from first to second at low throttle applications it blips the throttle when you shift and so it's kind of like a bad rev match not a bad rep match bad rev hang where it blips the throttle as you shift from first to second even when you're basically not on the throttle you let off throttle position actually increases slightly and then it closes and so it kind of makes low uh low speed low rpm gear shifts from first to second a bit annoying it doesn't seem to be nearly as bad in any of the other gear shifts and again this is only with low throttle positions if you're a wide open throttle or 60 throttle you don't notice it it's only when you're driving around the city and you're just kind of puttering around it has that bad rev hang from first to second the other part is the throttle closure seems really abrupt for how different you change your accelerator pedal position so what do i mean by that well when you're on the throttle pedal and you're just barely just barely on the throttle pedal and then you let off you get a noticeable closure of that throttle pedal and to me my feeling is if i'm just barely on the throttle it should be very close to zero and if i let off it really shouldn't feel significant and sure there's going to be a fuel cut that you'll feel uh but really i didn't feel anything before and now you know with this tune on it with the supercharger there's a very noticeable throttle closure when you let off the gas even if you're at maybe one percent and you go to zero it has this notable kind of lurch forward uh and it's not like it's bad it's not like basically i'm just trying to say it's noticeable the only real drivability issue that i'm not stoked on so far is that low speed shift first to second and again i think this stuff can be worked out with some tuning that's just a matter of getting it all sorted out so overall as far as the throttle pedal is concerned uh you know that zero to 25 throttle isn't quite there yet anything above that is fantastic you actually get very different torque you know from 50 throttle to 75 to 100 throttle and i like that you have that control and it's actually noticeable not just an on off switch which you commonly will get that feel with turbocharged engines where it's just on or off and i really like the way the throttle feels from about 25 to 100 you have a lot of control as far as how much torque you're putting down now i think a very reasonable question you might ask is hey jason if i want to maintain the warranty if i want to maintain emissions compliant and i go with the edelbrock kit and the edelbrock tune why would i spend all that money in trouble going for you know 192 horsepower rather than just getting the new nd2 miata which has 181 horsepower all that trouble for 10 extra horsepower well two very good points to counter that question first of all this is power at the wheels not power at the crank so it's 181 at the crank versus this is 192 at the wheels with the edelbrock tune you know probably closer over 200 horsepower at the crank if you were to measure it so it is a bigger difference than it sounds it's not just 10 horsepower second the new miata's engine really doesn't have much more torque than the previous uh this engine so both the nd1 and the nd2 miata whether it's a 2016 engine or a 2019 engine have very similar torque and they have the same gear ratios the reason why the newer miata has more power is because it revs higher so what that means is the actual feeling of you getting pushed back into your seat does not change between this engine and the newer engine what changes is how long you can stay in gear and with the supercharger kit the wheel torque is absolutely not the same it's significantly greater with the supercharger so the feeling that you actually get being pressed back into your seat even with the previous engine 192 horsepower versus 181 is going to be you know 20 to 30 percent greater than in that new miata one thing i forgot to mention and i'm a bit ashamed of is that my acceleration results for the stock car are actually with the versa tuner and one tune so it's actually the tuned naturally aspirated car not the stock stock car and so as a result the the wheel torque really shouldn't be much different they have extremely similar wheel torque but it might have a slight advantage meaning my percentage increase might be slightly more over stock uh the supercharger numbers that i'm showing you know i'm saying 20 30 it may be you know 21 to 31 22 to 32 somewhere in that region it might be slightly better all right now let's chat about reliability because a lot of people have asked me jason aren't you afraid that your transmission is going to blow up and apparently there have been issues with nd miata transmissions and so here's what i want to say about this i think any conversation about parts failures you should look at data rather than anecdotes because if you have one person saying their transmission failed doesn't really mean anything if you have 100 people saying their transmission failed but there's 200 000 cars out there doesn't really mean anything so context is extremely important now in this case i think mazda has acknowledged that they have had issues with some of the earlier model year transmissions and this is a 2016 so it's the first version transmission out there and a lot of people have been like jason it's probably gonna fail and like here's the thing maybe it will like that is a part of project cars and it's like you cannot go into modifying a car not changing the transmission not changing the differential not changing the engine and internals and just assuming everything will be wonderful forever like that's part of modifying a car you will decrease reliability almost always so it's it's not that i'm going into this thinking oh everything's going to be glamorous and 100 fine all the time if things break they break like that is a project car that is part of it you definitely shouldn't go into you know just throwing a supercharger on a car if you want that original warranty and original reliability like that's just not how it works so i am certainly aware that the transmission could fail and if it does well we replace it that's that's what happens so another really big challenging thing from a design standpoint is when you design an automatic transmission you can control almost everything right you can control how it shifts when it shifts that sort of thing with manual transmissions that control is taken out of the engineer's hand so they have to design something that they think will work well and they think that people won't ruin but they can't control how people drive and i'm not trying to blame this on drivers i'm just saying with a manual transmission reliability part of that reliability equation is put on the driver like there is a portion of it because you can trash a manual transmission very quickly if you want to like if you genuinely want to destroy it it's not hard to do with an automatic it's quite a bit more challenging because there's so many controls in place to prevent that from happening all right enough ranting about the transmission oh and there's that cop i'm getting pulled over i even saw you on the way over i don't have a mask i apologize what was that all about i know i even saw you on the way over and here i am being an idiot literally right in front of you i mean you're on the speed limit and then you accelerated i am dumb that's what that was about let me just see all your information sure no problem here's my license okay so this is uh it's a super i i just put a supercharger on this miata um so i run a youtube channel it's called engineering explained and i teach about how cars work so i've been having a lot of problems with this car the throttle tuning has has been all off where it wouldn't ever get into boost and the reason was the accelerator pedal says it's at 100 the the communication from the car to the throttle pedal says open up all the way and the throttle pedal would just sit at 25 and so it wouldn't work and finally i've been working with this shop to figure it out and get the tune on and somehow now it works is it all uh electronic it is so so yeah i mean that's kind of a challenge with new cars is the throttle pedal isn't mechanical anymore it's electronic so the communication is somehow broken um and and now it's fixed but yeah i accelerated yeah i know and uh i've got my insurance somewhere in here if you don't mind me yes yeah don't worry about i just want to play okay yep you're all set please watch speed right i will do thank you sir appreciate it well there's a master class on being an idiot i saw the cop on the drive down and yet when i got back to him on the same section of road that he had been sitting that entire time that's when i decided to speed good going jason brilliant execution so what have we learned overall well supercharged miata i absolutely love it apparently it's gonna start getting me into trouble uh but yeah the power is great acceleration is fantastic still feels like a miata you don't really feel any of that weight difference and as far as straight line acceleration it can put it all down but when you go in a corner you can get the rear end to kick out a bit more easily just because it has a bit more power overall i love this thing it's a fantastic machine and for my drive home i'm going to go the speed limit and obey traffic laws thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
