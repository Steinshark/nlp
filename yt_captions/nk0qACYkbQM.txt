this is the brand new nothing phone too and this is Carl pay the guy who made it this is a rare opportunity to learn about not just what this phone is and the thought behind each decision but also to really understand the secretive way that the world of smartphone building works so I'm going to make sure we get all of that insights and then a couple of curveball questions at the end so just to catch you up nothing released their first phone this time last year it was a 399 pound mid-range with really unique design I've actually got one right here it sold pretty well by the sounds of it almost 800 000 units across the world across the world how is that versus your expectation that was our expectation bang on yeah okay he's running company before and now they're nothing fun too so this is the package you get it's very thin it's very streamlined it's very different you have to peel off this tab on the side to get in which I don't love it kind of destroys the packaging but then inside what's cool is you can tell nothing has spent the time to craft the experience you get some manuals that almost look like apples a Sim ejector tool which is completely clear and the same goes for the USBC cable I like this it's really cool to see a bit of personality across the accessories too and then the phone to itself comes in white which is in this box and gray instead of the black which the last phone one came in which I think is a good decision lighter colors tend to be better at hiding fingerprints first question on my mind this is a big big departure in terms of Price Right first firm released at 399 pounds in the UK this is five seven nine I mean in my mind when I see a series of phones it feels like most companies have kind of decided what they are and they stick to it whereas you've gone up 45 in price what's that about the first year when we built our um previous device it was a very different time for us as a company our team was very small reaching for a flagship wouldn't really be realistic in terms of our capabilities but we always knew that the second one would be a more premium experience you were just warming up with fan one we're always warming up there's a long road map ahead of us this is actually a good segue to talk about the design itself so this is arguably what's put the nothing Fern on the map right and you've taken it up a step further with this phone in what ways would you say it's better the glyph interface was quite Limited in the film one but that wasn't because we didn't have a vision of where where to take it was more that we didn't really have the resources yeah to build those features so I would say say for the phone too the glyph interface gets much closer to that original Vision we wanted to enable people to be more focused on where they are in their daily lives people they're interacting with instead of always being on the screen that's actually really important to me personally I've set up all sorts of mechanisms on my phone recently to stop myself getting lost in apps because they are getting better and better at hooking it but there is still a question on my mind because while it was pretty cool that the nothing for one could use its glyph interface to be a flashlight and show you your battery percentage while charging it never to me felt like more than just a party trick so what makes this not a gimmick the hardware part is not what makes it better necessarily but it's the fusion of the hardware and the software and for phone one users out there who are watching you will also get a lot of these features I would say some of the top features for the glyph interface is one this Cliff we made it into like a segmented glyph so it doesn't just have an on and off initial progress we build support for some third-party apps especially food delivery and ride hailing so that when you're ordering these Services you can see how close it is to you without checking your screen I've already become the kind of person who sticks my iPhone like this but actually doing that while knowing that okay my ubereats order is here it's pretty cool we created something called essential lift notifications for the apps that are truly important to you but you can make this like as an example to stay on persistently I really really like that I think this is a super interesting tool to help you organize your life I'm just imagining setting up my own nothing phone too I'm picking just a few contacts and types of notifications that I would deem important enough to make this Flash and therefore demand that I check my phone as opposed to giving every notification that power of me also side note on the design the fact that the back glass now curves all around is an A plus move it stops IT feeling like an iPhone clone like you could say the last one did and legitimately makes it about eight times more comfortable to hold you've kind of integrated this same design philosophy into the way the phone works as well with phone 2 right we're thinking about how apps have kind of hijacked the entire smartphone experience 2008 the App Store was launched it felt like a lot of people just went to focus on how to build apps that were really sticky how do you maximize the amount of time you spent on each right yeah so you can sell more ads or sell more data and a lot of the smart people in the world were working on that meanwhile the mobile OS itself kind of let it happen because you know the big Tech platforms also make money together with app developers we want to start making apps a bit weaker we built this monochrome design language it's actually really funny that this is a feature because on my own iPhone I've actually set a triple tap to do that exactly yeah and that's basically your home screen so when you set the phone to up you actually get a choice between setting the home screen as default Android which is bright and colorful or nothing's own skin that focuses on being a bit Bland and not distracting I'm a big fan of the nothing phone concept of giving you back power over your apps and removing the app labels but until I've properly used it myself it's really hard to say if that's gonna make your phone less engrossing or just make it harder to find your apps so subscribe if you want to see my full review where we all go into all that stuff you can take all your Android quick toggles and make them into widgets so if you can do more on your OS on your home screen you don't have to use the apps as much as before it sounds very reveal just having these widgets but there's a next step and a next step in the evolution to keep making things more and more efficient I will say initial Impressions upon using this software are strong it feels really fluid which is to say it's smooth but every phone nowadays is smooth but it's smooth combined with all these tiny little animation choices that feel thoughtful like how double tapping the screen will lock the phone with an almost Looney tunes-like animation that centers in on wherever you have double pressed so in terms of the screens you've gone from a 6.55 inch 700 nit Peak brightness display to a 6.7 inch with a 1600 nippy lens is that right that's right which is an enormous jump in brightness the main reason for this uh jumping screen is that it's a much more Flagship level display for me the most interesting thing is ltpo so meaning we can dynamically change refresh rate from one to 120 hertz with just one Hertz increments from the front every phone has kind of felt like it looks the same for the last five years do you feel like phones are getting boring I mean that's one of the reasons why we started this company on the hardware side we're nearing a very mature state of the smartphone form factor if we're really going to innovate it has to happen in uh software services and maybe in alternative form factors how would you say this screen ranks to other phones on the market I think it's a big Improvement to the phone one screen it's 1080p still in terms of resolution yeah I think that's fine I I still use every phone where I get the option still on 1080P and I'm above average in terms of how much I would care about those things but I still just cannot tell the difference I really like the fact that you stuck with these symmetrical bezels it feels like a really tiny thing to have like a slightly thicker bezel at the bottom and I can see why most companies are like oh it's fine no one's going to notice but it really bothers me when that's not the case we had many Fierce debates internally there were two camps actually if we didn't go for symmetrical bezels we could have made the side bezels even Slimmer so you could have technically increased the screen to body ratio further yeah but you wanted symmetry yeah all right choices okay let's talk about cameras so the phone one had two 50 megapixel cameras this also has 250 megapixel cameras am I right in thinking the main camera has been upgraded that's correct so on the hardware side we opted for a slightly better sensor for the main camera so this one had the Sony IMX 766 and this is the 890 that's correct but I think most of the Improvement is actually on the software side and the tuning side what Carl says is that because the phone 2 comes with a more powerful chip than the phone wanted more on that in a minute when you take a photo here it can fuse together multiple full quality raw images to get the final output as opposed to what most phones do which is fuse together a bunch of compressed jpeg images to get the final output so why is it that you guys opted to not go down the let's get a massive sensor in this phone route it's got a lot of design consequences I mean one of the reasons why a lot of phones are starting to look similar again having these round camera modules is because they want to hide the really big one-inch sensors but I don't think it's worth it now this I disagree with for me personally I didn't think big cameras look bad or come at the cost of design if anything they make your phone look more capable and therefore cool and I mean the way I'm looking at it even if there was a situation where the camera quality did come at the cost of design I still think the priority should always be function over form but then again that's just the way that nothing is positioning themselves they're kind of a design-led brand so you think camera Hardware is mattering less and less you're saying the improvements are like 90 software and that's why I think it's a bit interesting to partner up with Legacy camera brands because they're all Hardware companies or lens or sensor companies like Zeiss yeah but they don't really have any know-how to help you improve a tiny smartphone camera okay so yeah you're quite far away from sticking like Hasselblad next to it unless they built a really strong AI team yeah okay so this Fan's using the Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1. it's a flagship chip but it's from last year how did you come to that decision I think when we make product decisions it's always about the user benefit the cost versus the performance or not just performance but also things like Heating and battery life so we found that this is like the optimal processor for us to use a phone at this price point also we don't really want to be the first to use new platforms we prefer to use something more stable and reliable so the battery life has gone up so it was 4500 on nothing than one now it's 4 700 milliamp hours on the two what was the reason for that change we just wanted to deliver a better user experience um the phone one would last a day sometimes if your day was a bit longer you would have battery anxiety towards the end with the phone too we just wanted to eliminate that like for me I've had days where I haven't charged my phone for two days and I'm still kind of okay kind of okay so alive after two days still alive I'm not a heavy user do you use the front or the back both well this thing charges in about 55 minutes is the quoting charge is that zero to a hundred yeah the four ones maximum uh charging was 30 watts and this one might sell 45 right yeah how important is charging speed in a phone it's important but you don't have to go crazy your battery degrades faster if you use that kind of high ampere charger but you feel like it's negligible up until you get past about 80 Watts yeah probably 60. 60 is probably the ideal so then I guess the big question is nothing fun too who is this phone for what kind of user is going to be buying this I think first and foremost uh forget about all the design forget about all the differentiation we have to build a really solid phone because a phone is not a toy like there might be really serious situations in which you need to contact somebody like the police for instance so it just has to work I know the Divide between IOS and Android is getting bigger and bigger for consumers so I think people who are familiar with Android or or curious about trying Android now this is a really solid phone do you see it as a bridge for people who like Android to use but like iPhone as a status design symbol we see about 10 of our users in that cohort like they like good design haven't been able to find an Android brand with a design ethos they can accept how do you see this verse as an iPhone and a lot of your sort of launch events stuff you reference Apple a lot maybe even more so than other Android companies right I think the iPhone is a really solid phone there's like a almost like a no-brainer recommendation if your friend is not that techy is it because it's the majority like because it's the best selling phone it's the majority everybody knows how to use it there's no education it's kind of like uh how Windows was back in the day is it accurate to say that like nothing would want to be something like that for Android I think we should take inspiration from the early Apple like the apple of our childhood yeah almost kind of like magical with a lot of unique ideas trying to push the user experience forward trying to make products that are better and better what would you say is the biggest challenge when building this phone today if you want to build a smartphone you probably need 200 to 300 million dollars in working capital because if you think about the last 10 years there's been a couple of teams that that's tried to create smartphones and they've all failed I mean you don't need to do much digging to find examples of this like red the camera company who tried to make their own smartphone which failed catastrophically and when they failed they also made their suppliers lose a lot of money the suppliers were all really friendly before they were like okay we'll build your product and then you know just pay us 30 days after we deliver the goods to you today is like you say you can sell phones right pay us two months in advance um delivering products so you need a lot of money because you need to pay them before you even get the product to sell presumably a lot of your job is actually convincing consumers yes this is a great phone but also convincing suppliers this they're gonna really like this trust us yeah it's going to do volumes and it was really tough for the for the fun one we had to pay people about two months before getting the product wow um normally you pay two months after getting the product so in a sense our Gap was four months right like a cash Gap compared to the bigger guys and then we got really high pricing like about 15 higher than everybody else and then we had a very small team in terms of engineering software to deliver like a really Stellar product you can see why there's very few successful entrants so yeah exactly sometimes people email me like hey I want to make a phone can you help me it's like please don't yeah don't do it okay so I wanted to finish with a quick lightning round you ready yep okay what is your most used app email that's so cute dark mode or light mode dark what was your first smartphone first smartphone was the Motorola a780 for Android phone was a G1 G1 T-Mobile G1 that's the first Android phone incredible oh yeah yeah it is I imported it into Europe and I loved it what would you say is your average screen time in a day uh probably two and a half hours if you had to use a Samsung or a xiaomi which would you pick Samsung great Hardware Great software and not investing in logos see YouTubers have started doing this thing where when they start to have beef with someone they get in a boxing ring and they have a boxing match if this situation were to ever arise for Tech CEOs would you do it I've seen that uh Mark Zuckerberg has gotten really fit so probably not him um and they sub to the channel would be hmm wait you could just say nothing a sub to the channel would mean everything beautiful to me I love it
