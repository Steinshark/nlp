so the end of the year and the holidays are creeping up on us and as filmmakers we all share the problem of being impossible to find presents for everything we want is outrageously expensive and in the end I pretty much just asked for socks every year [Music] but this time of year doesn't have to be only about buying stuff and Black Friday stampede so instead of putting together a list of stuff I want to get I'm going to look back on the pieces of gear that genuinely made my life easier as a filmmaker over this last year filmmaking is super complicated at the best of times and when you're shooting it can feel like there are so many technical things to think about or storytelling moments to remember or people to direct that anything that makes this process noticeably less painful is worth its weight in gold in my opinion so in this video I'm gonna go over seven things that really honestly help make my life easier this year the things that were the most helpful during all the stresses of the job I'm gonna put them in a rough order of how much I appreciated each one but to be honest they all save me at different times though I can pretty safely say that without the last thing on this list my future film shoot this summer would not have been possible so that one is going to keep the top spot for this year alright so let's get into it [Music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is Luke Forsyth and on this channel I teach the skills I've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to be grateful to that subscribe button because I've got new videos like it coming out every week okay so the first thing that made my life easier this year is probably something you've heard me talk about on this channel before because you know I have a serious bag fetish and I'm a total Fanboy of this company and that's f-stop if you're a run and Gun filmmaker shooting documentaries like I do it's all well and good to get the newest and best gear but first you actually have to get it to your location sometimes that's easy and you can just roll a bunch of Pelican cases from the car into an elevator but for what I do there are a lot of times when it's not so simple like last year I was the series DP for the spin-off of the Survival show alone called Frozen and for almost 12 weeks I was living and shooting out of a surveyor's tent in a remote Bay in Eastern Canada there were no roads and the only way to get in and out of the camp was by jet boat and then once the river froze over by helicopter I had to respond to all sorts of situations from verite shooting to b-roll missions to technical callouts from the cast who needed replacement Labs or batteries and so it was really important for me to have bags that could hold a ton of gear but also handle a lot of different environments and be comfortable the carry over tough ground while shooting alone for example it was normal to have to respond to a call out first by getting into a helicopter then transferring into a boat then jumping into the Atlantic Ocean and then hiking up a rocky Mountainside before we rolled a single frame I'd never really know what I was going to find when I got there so I'd have to pack like two to three lenses extra batteries audio gear a drone extra warm layers every time and you need a serious pack to handle that sort of load while still being well balanced I know there are a lot of Brands out there that make rugged packs and I'm sure they're all great but I don't think I'm ever going to have a chance to use them because honestly once I got my first f-stop pack I pretty much just stopped looking for anything else I normally use this one which is the 50 liter to lopa for all my normal shoots but I also have a massive 80 liter Shin bag when I need to haul a ton of gear into a remote spot and also a much smaller Guru bag when I just need to carry like a YouTube setup they feel indestructible their incredibly weather resistant and they feel like a hiking bag on your back even the mountain guide dudes helping with safety on a loan complemented them and honestly those guys normally spend their time making fun of the camera operator stumbling around in the woods the talopa is probably the perfect all-round camera back out there and the new Dura diamond fabric which is the newer version of this one in green looks so good in my opinion I'm going to link to all of them in the description but if you pick one of these up I promise you're going to get years of use and abuse out of it all right moving on the next tool that made the year easier actually pulled off what I thought was impossible and that's that they made me hate using GoPros just a little bit less yes coming from a photography and cinematography background I've always had a love-hate relationship with GoPros that Trends pretty hard towards the hate side sure they're really useful for getting cameras into tight spots and there's more than a few times in my career where getting the shot would have been impossible without them they're great at what they do but they have one main problem for me and that's that the footage looks terrible at least it looks terrible most of the time when I think of GoPro footage I think of wide angle High frame rate unnaturally smooth footage that you can always tell game from a GoPro you can mitigate some of this by using the linear lens and shooting on the flat profile at a fixed white balance but it's really the fact that you have to use the auto shutter to get the right exposure that's the worst Defender for me I don't want to get into a full technical breakdown of how shutter speeds work but footage shot at the wrong shutter speed like when you're shooting 24 frames a second and the shutter speed is set to something higher than double the frame rate just doesn't look cinematic to me and if you lower the shutter speed on a GoPro to let's say a 50th of a second most likely your shot's going to be Overexposed with most cameras the ants answer to this problem is just to use ND filters to bring the exposure down but for some reason I never really thought that was an option with GoPros so I just avoided using them then this summer I realized there were some shots that I needed that wouldn't work without a GoPro so I started looking around for Solutions and I found these guys from a company called freewell now maybe for some of you this isn't revolutionary news but for me I guess I just never thought to look for a product like this and accepted that GoPros had to look bad but now that I have these I can just drop the shutter speed to match the frame rate and suddenly my GoPro footage doesn't look all that bad I mean I'm still a cinematography snob and I'll do anything I can to use a real camera whenever possible but for those times when nothing but a GoPro will work it looks way better when you shoot at the right shutter speed instead of just on auto which is only possible when you use these and that definitely makes my life easier all right moving on like I said the last couple years I've been working on the show alone and that means keeping a ton of different Gear Running in remote locations we also needed a lot of drone shots and even though I have four extra batteries for my drone with the strong winds and the quantity of footage I was shooting every day I was always running low there were even a couple of times when I had to choose not to get certain shots because I was worried I'd run out of battery for later in the day and that's really just not a situation I want to be in while shooting enter this guy my new best friend on travel shoots this is the Omni charge ultimate plus and it's pretty much helped me avoid situations like this ever since I got it portable batteries aren't anything new but the problem with most of them is that they're usually designed to charge something small like a phone a few times and they don't have that much capacity or else they don't have enough output to power professional accessories like the batteries for my camera or my drone I've carried around huge batteries before like this one from Goal Zero and it's great if you have a car nearby but if you need to carry them for any length of time your arm's probably going to fall off before too long this Omni charge is the perfect middle ground it's high enough capacity to charge a laptop twice or up to like four drone batteries and I'm pretty sure I've done eight of my fx3 batteries on a single charge before it's got the usual USB A and C ports but it's also got an AC plug which means I can pretty much power any piece of gear I have unlike those smaller banks that only have USB now it's not tiny but it's also small enough that I can put in the backpack and it makes it way more useful than the Goal Zero it's built like a tank and has this rubber shell on it so I don't feel like I have to baby in the field they make a few different sizes of these things and I'll link to them in the description if you want to look at the different options but I like this one the ultimate Plus for most shoots just because of the super high capacity it's not a crazy technological breakthrough or anything but it's just a well-designed product that seems like it was made with filmmakers in mind and it definitely made my life easier this year alright so breaking away from field gear for a second the fourth thing on this list is more of a post-production tool but it has absolutely made my life easier when it comes to one of the hardest parts of editing my projects and that's finding the right music there's a ton of services out there that you've all probably heard of that sell royalty-free music subscriptions and I've used most of the major ones but this year audio and that's audio spell with two eyes reached out and became a sponsor of this Channel and it's made my life so much simpler and easier by Shifting the focus away from quantity and towards quality instead I remember logging on to some of those other music platforms and just feeling lost when I'd see these massive lists of songs to look through but audio does it a little differently by spending a ton of effort on curating the library I mean they still have tons of stuff on there I think it's like 6 000 tracks or something but because of how tight they keep the collection there's no throwaway junk on there it's all hand-picked good stuff for me that is way more important than just numbers because the last thing I want is to spend hours scrolling through lists of songs I'll never use but all I really want to do is find something that works and start editing there's also a massive sound effects Library there which I love for sound design and those are also really high quality as well now audio is a sponsor of this channel so do with that information what you will but I'm under no obligation to actually use it if I thought there was something better out there the thing is that since I started working with audio I've actually never needed to use anything else and I honestly haven't used any of the other services even though I'm paying for some of them and saving maybe the best for last is the price audio is hands down the best deal out there especially if you're just starting out in your filmmaking career right now viewers of this channel can save 70 on the Pro Plan which brings the yearly price down to 59 which is insane if you've ever shopped around for music services like this before just follow the link in the description use the promo code Luke 70 to claim the discount but I'd say you probably want to jump on that quickly as you can because let's be honest there's just no way that they can stay in business and keep prices that low for long so at some point I'm guessing they're gonna have to jack it back up to somewhere closer to Market rates it's a really great service for an amazing price run by a nice group of people and it seriously made that part of my life as a filmmaker much easier so check it out before it's too late okay so next up is something that I've been raving about on this channel since day one but the difference that this thing has made in my filmmaking process is crazy and that's my tripod the Sackler flow Tech I'm actually using it right now to film this video so I can't actually hold it up but it's working hard for me as always coming from a photojournalism background when I first got into filmmaking I didn't really think about tripods as that important all my work was handheld and I like to travel as light as possible so I got the smallest cheapest tripod I could and threw it in my bag almost like an afterthought but very quickly once I started taking filmmaking seriously I realized how important tripods were and how much of a difference there was between a good one and a bad one bad tripod is awkward to set up it's hard to level it doesn't have the right head to make smooth pan and tilt moves and it's really hard to adjust which pretty accurately describes that photo tripod I tried to put to work in video took me eight years to upgrade that thing to the flow Tech but the difference is insane and even compared to high-end video tripods that cost two to three times more I'd still pick the flow Tech pretty much every single time unlike most tripods where you have to adjust all the different stages individually which is really annoying when there's a loaded camera on the head the flow Tech is controlled entirely from one set of latches right at the top so going from super low to super high takes about 2 seconds instead of 30. it's easy to level the strength to weight ratio is nuts I mean it weighs less than 10 pounds with the head but it can easily hold my fully rigged out fx9 and it's so strong that it took multiple direct hits from an assault rifle and still worked like new when I was shooting on a loan most of the other camera people were using much bigger heavier tripods and had a really hard time getting them into remote spots with the flowtech I could just strap it to the side of my backpack and hike in and that made a huge difference in the kinds of shots I was able to get the major downside to this thing is the price because once you add on a decent head it's going to be expensive I think for the legs on their own they cost around three thousand dollars these days but since we're talking about things that made my life easier and not cheap things the flow Tech goes right near the top of this list I tend to shoot most of my scenes handheld or off the shoulder but it's still amazing how often I switch the sticks from interviews to establishers to long lens stuff even my handheld shoots are probably at least 20 percent shot on a tripod so having one that's pretty much indestructible that's light enough to strap to my backpack and that's barely enough to hold my heaviest camera setup is one of the biggest quality of life improvers out there tripods also don't go obsolete really so get a good one early on and you'll have it forever I'm on year five with mine now and if I lost it tomorrow I'd replace it with the same thing as much as the price tag kills me alright from the biggest thing on this list to one of the smallest the last piece of gear that made my life easier this year is all about audio and that's this guy the tentacle track e-lab recorder I say it all the time but audio is the backbone of your documentary story not video and having characters mic'd up is mandatory for documentary filmmaking in my opinion now the top mic is decent for getting Ambient sound but documentaries are about people and the second the people you're filming turn their back to you or get in a car or walk into the Next Room your audio is ruined and trust me as soon as you get into the edit you'll realize what a disaster that is for most shoots the answer is a wireless lav system something like the Sennheiser eng3s you put them on your characters it sends audio back to a receiver which then sends the audio into the camera I've used a system like that myself since day one of my career and it's great until it isn't most cameras only have two audio ports and since one is taken up by the shotgun you're only going to be able to use one lav at a time without some sort of external recorder but external recorders for me are just more things to Monitor and go wrong and I've never liked them personally so what are you supposed to do when you don't have a sound person with you and you need to more than one character miked at a time or what happens if you're filming people from a distance and the wireless system doesn't reach which happened in me while filming rock climbers for Red Bull in northern Mexico last year or maybe you're in a location with a lot of radio interference which ruined my audio for weeks during my feature film shoot this summer and is the whole reason I started using the trackies in the first place these things are pretty much the same as the Sennheiser system and you just plug in a mic on the top and then put them on your characters like you would with a normal lav but with one important difference these record everything internally to an SD card so instead of transmitting them back to your camera it's all being done inside that means it will roll audio from any distance in any condition and you can put them on as many people as you want I used four of them this Summer and without a sound recordist there is no way I could have miked up that many characters on my own they also have a 32-bit flow track which means basically they won't clip even when you're not monitoring them which is also huge for small teams now this technology isn't new and there's been things like this on the mark for years the company's axcom made the first ones that were really popular and since then other companies have made their own versions some are way more expensive and some are way cheaper than the tentacles but the main reason I chose these ones are because they work so well with tentacle's own time code boxes so that it's easy to sync all these audio sources together if you're lost here I'll link to a detailed video explaining time code in the description but basically it's just a tiny box that controls the clock in your camera and then matches that time to all the other cameras and mic packs you're using so that in post they can be perfectly synced up for editing technical's time Code system is really easy to use for small teams and because they also make the trackies the whole thing works together extremely well through one app and for me the whole system fits into the kind of price point that gets you professional quality stuff without buying crazy expensive gear that a pro sound guy would have one of these is I think 3.99 which is about the quarter of the cost of the high-end stuff from electrosonics so even though it's not cheap it's honestly a really good deal for what it is now they're not made of solid steel like I said electrosonics but they're still really well built and I feel good using them anywhere okay this video is already getting too long so I'm going to wrap it up here but let me just finish with trackies by saying this story is King and audio is the spine of your story if you're anything like me and you think you might find yourself and you get clean audio on multiple characters without the help of a sound recordist the trackies are the best solution that I found that doesn't cost the same as a small car now that I found this system I'm amazed I was able to make it work for so long without them they've been such a game changer for me this year and that's why they're getting the top spot on this list so that's it Top Gear that made my life easier this year gear is part of filmmaking and investing in the right stuff can make a big difference in how smoothly your shoot goes and how sane you are at the end of it I love hearing about this stuff though so if there's anything you found this year that's made your life easier that I didn't mention let me know what it was in the comments hope that video was helpful and if it was please do me a favor and do the whole like And subscribe thing so I can keep putting videos out like this one and if you did like this one and you're a gear Nerd Like Me Maybe check out this other video I made about different lines of grip gear I use on travel sheets see ya [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
