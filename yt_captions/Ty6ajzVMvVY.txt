speeds are okay we've got team iron in this corner over here and we got team ryan over there the goal of challenge one is to hit the most pods within a 30 second time limit brian's hitting the red pods i'm hitting the blue pots the winner takes the first point on the road to victory three two one go come oh this is exhausting it's so tiring you won let's go let's go he's quick he's quick gg oh gg indeed number six is a smart skipping route it's gonna count how many skips we do simple enough but simply does not mean easy how many do you think you can do in 30 seconds all of them all of the skips yes this is one of the ones i penciled in to lose and there's no way of cheating because it's a smart rope that will monitor your score which is good for you three two one oh my god jump jump
