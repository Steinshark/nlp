hey bullied by local hosting providers the Shady practices someone said go daddy very excited let's see what happens here chapter 1 the unforeseen beginning in the fall of 2019 my journey began inconspicuously it's weird that it would start conspicuously honestly to tell you the truth the real estate agency owner distressed by his online sit's stagnation reached out to me his WordPress one could say that it was you were quite conspicuous with your skills anyways his WordPress site once a bustling hub for daily announcements had hit an inexplicable wall despite his limited technology sense something a miss when new posts ceased to appear leaving his customers in business in limbo as I delved into the sit's back end I discovered A peculiar constraint the hosting provider known for their unlimited offerings had imposed an obscure file count limit a detail buried in the fine print this limitation had quietly throttled the site's growth leaving its digital presence crippled let me repeat it was not a storage limit it was promised to be unlimited but no it was a file count limit chapter 2 armed with the clients go ahead I embarked on a digital excavation sifting through years of accumulated data I Unearthed and cleared redundant files freeing up a much needed space this initial Triumph opened the door to a broader opportunity a complete website makeover we chose a vibrant modern design that mirrored the agency's warmth and appeal the redesign process was meticulous involving a careful selection of fonts colors layouts that resonated with the Brand's heartwarming ethos commonly referred to as going onto WordPress M Marketplace and paying $15.99 for a thing meticulous I combed through hundreds if not thousands of themes to find one just for you upon relaunch the site shimmered AO with its user-friendly interface and captivating visual reigniting the client's online presence his Joy was palpable his words of gratitude were a Melody to my ears it was a fleeting but sweet victory as his checks hit the bank baby Chapter 3 The Unexpected Journey Lord of the Rings reference still going on in my head however just 5 days post launch a shocking email landed in in my inbox the site was down accused of exceeding some nebulous quota I poured over the server logs combing through data and analytics but the evidence eluded me the site was a simple Affair far from a resource hog the conundrum was a cryptic Enigma leaving both my client and me in a haze of disbelief and frustration chapter 4 the battle with customer support approaching the hosting provider's customer support felt like entering a lion's den marketed as offering unlimited dis space their PL reality now seemed a cruel Gest the Sation quickly soured evolving into a barrage of unprofessional remarks unhelpful suggestions and even yelling and insults please tell me this is God Daddy come on god daddy let's go God Daddy I was still a green developer back then just starting so I was overwhelmed wasn't the support meant to help me why was I getting yelled at and insulted oh my friend my friend my friend that is very funny to imagine customer support of a hosting provider to be on your side you could tell he was green totally the wrong approach as I was thinking about all those questions they gave me their final advice to seek an international hosting provider and asked me to stop using them which was delivered with an almost disdainful air leaving me stunned and infuriated okay just change just change hosting chapter 5 the plot thickens after days of meticulous debugging a revelation dawned the rank math SEO plug-in a familiar tool in my Arsenal emerged as unexpected antagonist this discovery was baffling I had employed this plugin numerous times without incident even in cheaper hosting plans the variable it seemed was the hosting environment activating the plugin here was like tripping a wire triggering an instantaneous shutdown the so-called unlimited hosting was a facade a marketing Mirage the customer support might have been Rick this this sounds a little bit Ricky chapter 6 the Strategic Retreat a tactical shift was imperative just change hosting companies I presented the case for hostinger to my client a blend of desperation and optimism in my pitch he agreed I'll be at with reservations the migration was cautious But ultimately triumphed hostinger wasn't just a new hosting solution it was our digital Lifeline the site's performance sworded the supportive environment was a refreshing change not sponsored though a part of me wished it was considering the stark contrast in service quality get the bag baby this is a great story hostinger if you want to sponsor this video uh totally would work out here chapter 7 years have passed the unexpected call had smooth the ripples of our past struggles it's been more than four years the green developer is now a senior developer and has gone through even more experiences and stories but out of the blue a frantic call from the client shattered the calm in the chaos of managing his expanding business my old client and friend now had overlooked a crucial step confirming the receipt of his domain name purchases absolute rookie mistake even though they received the payment and could see it was from him they didn't enable the domain for him and ultimately released them this oversight led to a devastating loss one of the domains was snapped up within hours of becoming available the buyer who could get access to one of the most Wanted domains locally it was a mix of City Plus the field of work it was wanted domain around here and people even offered to buy it h who but who do you think purchased this one the other domain was still free and ready to be purchased my client had difficulty so I offered to get it for him and transferred to him later but in a surreal twist both my client and I in our resp Ive bids to reclaim the Lost domain ended up purchasing it the baffling scenario unfolded as we both received confirmation emails each proclaiming us as the rightful owner how could this be that's why I had to read it twice cuz I was like I must have misread that that doesn't make any sense the situation spiraled into a bizarre stalemate a digital puzzle that defied logic and precedence chapter 9 Reflections and Revelation reflecting on this digital Odyssey I recognize it is more than a sequence of technical challenges it was a journey marked by resilience the necessity to adapt and the Relentless quest for Solutions the domain Saga is still going on we haven't told them anything yet we want to see what their last Shady move will be you're ending here you can't do that first off it sounds like crimes were committed with this whole unlimited hosting but then actually not being unlimited second off it seems like you you have extortion or some sort of blackmail and minimum you have fraud two people winning a bid that's fraud one of the lowest layers in that in Dante's Inferno what's going on here you can't just you can't Edge me like that I'm EDG I'm fully edged I'm ready I'm ready to go for hours like Bill Gates asked I guess I found my best edging experience for 2024 I should probably share that one with Microsoft Edge I am thoroughly disappointed that we didn't even get any form of resolution okay no I don't want to see Dune chapter 2 of the local hosting provider Saga I just wanted the feel sweet release okay that's all I wanted in my life cuz you know what I think there's a natural disdain in all of us for hosting Prov for whatever reason all my previous past experiences with hosting is just the worst now the new the the new school of Hosting you know we're talking like fly and shuttle it seems different like I have this like I I I just have this hate inside of me like there is no company I feel like I have an unreasonable dislike more than GoDaddy like right now if GoDaddy offered me $10,000 to say something nice about them I would take $10,000 and I'd say something nice about him but I would feel really bad about where my morals were I would just let you know that right now I would feel very bad about myself and I would look down upon myself quite a bit I I would still certainly take the $10,000 I'm going to take that bag okay but I'm going to feel really bad about it okay let's take them out reverse GameStop style let's go I mean 10K is 10K baby okay I'm just saying you know you got you got to be honest with yourself like I've already been very honest I told kick kick.com gambling I hate
