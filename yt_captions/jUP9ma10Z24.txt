welcome to the Huawei 8p 30 Pro I'm super excited about this phone and it's probably the one I'm going to be switching to when you open the packaging the first thing on top is the smartphone itself and you'll immediately notice this breathing crystal color that I've got going on here but we'll come back to this underneath it you've got this insert which has a sim ejector tool as well as a silicon case to protect it with and you're also getting the same 40 watt supercharger that we saw with the mate 20 pro bundled in with a box we've got their charging cable you've got a pair of earphones but let's get to the main event here the p30 Pro is the company's primary flagship smartphone for 2019 so as you can imagine quite a big deal and couple of things to point out before we dive straight into this ludicrous camera setup the p30 pro is built primarily from glass and there's a real emphasis on the flow of the body from the soft gradient color options to the way the back blends into the sides which blend into the front the design fuels fluid you've got a power button that is well positioned your thumb just kind of rests there naturally and it's a little bit ridged so you can feel for it but what is really interesting is that there's no earpiece on this phone it uses a weight for it electromagnetic levitation speaker beneath the screen which should mean that when you're on a call there'll be zero sound leakage so only you can hear what the other person is saying you've got an IP 68 water and dust resistance rating and there's also an optical in display fingerprint scanner supposedly the best one Holly has ever used and no headphone jack oh yeah and on the front is a six point four seven inch full HD plus OLED display and what is good is that when I put it side-by-side with the s10 plus the brightness seemed very comparable alright this phone might just have the most complex and at the same time the most complete camera setup on a phone period on the front in this dewdrop not at the top there's a thirty two megapixel selfie camera and flipping it round on the back this crazy quad camera solution it's based loosely on the May 20 pro setup but with quite a few key improvements you've got the main 40 mega pixel wide-angle camera which now has a more capable sensor and of wider aperture than before to let more light in they call it the super spectrum camera you've got that ultra wide lens so you can capture more in one go and the telephoto lens to get closer to subjects now you might remember how for pretty much the entire 2018 while we was leading the pack in terms of zoom capabilities their phones had three times optical zoom compared to everyone else their hat too well with the p30 Pro you've got five times enough to clearly see things that are so far in the distance your own eyes would struggle we're not done yet there's a fourth camera the time of flight the phone fires out dots of light and this camera can then see how long it takes for that light to return and use it to calculate depth it should translate to more accurate to portrait mode and better augmented reality experiences because your phone understands the position of objects one of the things I really liked about the p20 Pro last year was the introduction of night mode in the camera well the p30 pro does this better for a few reasons the phone's more capable sensor and wider aperture let more light in and the main camera now combines AI stabilization with optical image stabilization so you can all the phone steady for longer letting you capture even more information this improved sensor has four times the sensitivity to light as the last generation and on the subject of stabilization from the time I spent with it video looks incredibly steady I was standing there physically trying to shake the phone and the footage look like it was coming straight off a tripod also just the general quality is much better in low light as we expected the p30 pro gets all the battery perks we saw on the mate 20 pro so that's a 4200 milliamp hour battery 40 watt super fast charging wireless charging and the ability to reverse charge other smartphones it's also powered by the same keren 980 chip but now starts with eight gigs of ram instead of six it feels every bit as responsive and this phone is releasing with the latest mui 9.1 geared at better taking advantage of the dual neural processing AI cores we have here you'll see AI features more prominently than ever before for things like real-time translation being able to identify objects in a photo and just for general responsiveness according to the company in mui 9.1 49% of built-in apps respond faster you're also getting GPU turbo to stabilize gaming frame rates as well as just a heap of camera modes to play around with which is one of my favorite things about the last few Huawei flagships now because of the way they've built the earpiece it's not loud enough to complement the main speaker when listening to music so the phone has a single speaker but it did sound pretty punchy in the time I spent with it and quite loud too there are two models at 899 pounds the 128 gig version and for another 200 that goes up to 512 gigs and they both support Huawei's tiny nm cards for storage the p30 pro is going on sale in the UK on the 6th of April and I'll drop a
