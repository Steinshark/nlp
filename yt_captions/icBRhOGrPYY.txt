ladies and gentlemen I've got some very bad news AI will in fact take over the world you see about a year ago I made a video and that video was about the Martin bot on chess.com the dumbest AI known to humankind I gave Martin 30 queens and I managed to win and to this day that is my most viewed video on this channel Martin was a laughing stock he was an endearing character with a family and he was about 200 at chess not anymore it's currently April 2024 yesterday was April fools I thought this was all an elaborate April Fool's prank it's not there is now a generation Martin bot on chess.com whose rating I believe is 1 million and I am going to play it today the bots of this month are all generations so I'm going to play all the generations and um then I'm going to play Martin and I think I'm going to lose but we're going to do our best this is absolutely terrible I honestly thought that AI would not come to this point but it has say hello to generation Martin Martin's rating is literally uh oh it's not even a number anymore it's so high that it turned into letters and also you get cool special themes for the this month I'm going to turn them off cuz they they look bad on my streaming software but if you like you can you can play with them I'm but I'm I'm I'm going to turn them off because I don't have the board set up the right way let's play Martin bot all right let's let let's let's start the video off with a nice little game against stupid little 200 level Martin bot let's get a win because I don't even know if I'm going to win a game today all right um little rematch against Martin hit him with a little Scandinavian defense that I've been playing as of late I really like the Scandinavian he plays E5 and says what should I do and my kids say hi Martin the medication is not working you don't have any children um no Martin is a very nice man and you know I made fun of him a lot in my previous video um and I I had people reach out to me and they were like I can't even beat the Martin bot like it feels good to capture maybe yeah maybe okay will you take me back Martin this is not a good move oh look at Martin putting in the work all right look I got to win this game and then I'm going to play the rest of the generations um let's develop our Bishop and then let's develop our Knight let's get all of our pieces out yep there's no threat to this move if Martin puts a knight there I'll probably just take it uh let's play Knight out this way to maybe put some pressure we'll trade you know I'm up so it's it's good to trade and then I'm going to put my queen right here attack the pawn and what is Martin going to do he's going to go there uh I can trade the queens and beat Martin in an end game sure tremendous I mean I beat him down 30 Queens I I imagine he said there goes my best piece indeed Mr Martin indeed all right let's push this Pawn we're going to we're going to start off nice and easy just beating the Martin bot just like old times that's a terrible move cuz he can go here wow is he going to see that he could take the pawn no one logical move was more than enough for Mr Martin I'm just I think I'm just going to like pre-move the game like why don't I just oh promoted to a rook very good smart promotion thank you Martin thank you thank you all right now let's take all the pieces it feels really bad playing against Martin like I have to tell you now I'm just going to make a little ladder Checkmate I'm going to oh okay maybe not is he going to let me Checkmate him oh Martin's fighting on oh my goodness he's escaping and he forked me which is like insanely disrespectful ladder mate okay this is mate that was a good game I feel like do I want to coach your kids no I'm I'm I'm good brother okay that was Martin but now for this month we have generation we have Boomer oh my God they made Lee look really mad it says Lee has been playing chess for close to 50 years how how will you Fair against this wisen wizard of the board he's 500 y'all can't even see that he's literally a 500 bot I'm going to like minimize this a little bit so you can look he's 500 and they have this description up of this guy like he's come on guys um then it's generation question mark what what does that even mean Generation Y decent at chess and $140,000 in college debt that's what it says about Anthony hilarious I'll just minimize this so you can see all the descriptions I feel like they're all funny they're all they're all they're all pretty humorous now um let's go and then we will end with this clown he doesn't seem to lose anymore though this is going to be such a depressing video all right Lee I'll start with the white pieces Le Le's going to start with my grandson told me about you I'm ready to play yes yes that is generally how it works yes that is uh that is actually usually how it goes uh it's uh okay let's start with D4 let's let's play a London against Mr Lee okay he plays G6 Lee doesn't know what pre moves are did you know that I met George Washington when I was a boy Lee I don't think you're that old bro what isn't George wasn't George Washington alive in like the 17 and 1800s like what are huh okay I don't I don't know they're making these Bots seem like ridiculously old that's not a good move the reason is that Mr Lee weakened his dark squares just kidding I'm not that old get ready there was a followup oh my goodness Lee pranked me I thought I was playing like a geriatric old man all right get ready to lose what are you up to oh Retreat uh you went forward Lee there we go that's a retreat Luis Prima has a great song or to I think you'd really like I don't I don't know what that is old man I don't I don't know what that is I'm you can tune a piano you can't tune a fish I but those are dad jokes you know not not not Granddad jokes anyway now that the crop looks a little bit better I think it's time to destroy you I need to get to the Martin bot okay I'm going to play E5 here's a ER for you like King Edward the I don't I don't know what Lee wants Lee won't stop talking to me yes I'm going to put the queen on H6 I cast hold on the opposite side and now I'm going to play H4 H5 and activate my Rook Hey who taught you how to play Gotham chess Lee you should check him out he's uh quite good good uh good YouTuber and uh now we have the two pieces over here the queen is in I'll take that little guy okay uh I guess I'm going to go here and when Lee takes me I'm going to take his Queen nope didn't work check is he going to what's he going to do that's the best move all right I I should stop messing around no I didn't see your plan Lee ooh good move I don't know what that does I'm going to sacrifice my Pawn to open up the f file over here Lee did not take so now I'm just going to March him down and put him in a nursing home that hangs a rook this probably hangs the game what is he what is law like I don't oh no my Rook oh he didn't get checkmated well done look at the old man I'm going to sacrifice my bishop and then I'm going to bring my rook and then I'm going to bring my knight and Mr Lee unfortunately that's a free Queen and then I'm going to yeah I'm just going to promote that's to a rook Checkmate well I underestimate yeah you're 500 Lee all right I I I mean you were always going to lose really I I I don't know really okay in the future everyone will play chess through VR goggles right now though it's just Troy that's what it says about Troy uh you can't see the cutout anymore because I put the voice lines there yeah I you know what I'm just going to say wearable AI stuff I don't get it switches tabs excuse me for a moment oh he's just one of these like scumbag Silicon Valley nerds is that what this is like this dude is just walking on the street with a with a Vision Pro anyway I'm I'm look that stuff is like okay but I'm not I'm not I I I oh I missed his big what was that big Manifesto that he just wrote can I can I go back add these items to

the moves I consumed 465 grams of protein you're that's you're going to you're going to poop yourself dude wait so Troy is like a huge AI douche and and he's also like a Jim bro I mean this is so confusing who is this based on is this based on like one of the chess.com like people I who oh my God and Troy is terrible at chess I mean he's just giving me pieces I don't I don't get what's Happening Here what happens when I take Troy's Queen what if I what happens when I take the I built 24 he's not even he's not even talking about the game he built 24 startups in 12 months I don't even like what is this this is like the most superficial what huh okay I have a Checkmate trap I'm going to like take this pawn and maybe Checkmate him over there let's see is he going to play Bishop here I'm going to be very annoyed oh come on Troy just let me win dude going to take this insane I can't believe Troy actually I are you a oh my goodness six I'm not reading his lines anymore oh my God he is everything wrong with the world no there's worse things but okay I'm going to take this bishop and then take that Bishop okay maybe I'll take that Bishop all right I just got to I just got to I just I just got to end Troy I can't do this anymore why is he pre-moving now why is he pre-moving why it's mate it's just mate you can't stop mate Troy what did he say what's he going to say I'm adding a community note that wasn't a win and this is fake news Troy is officially the worst bot in the history of CH like literally just oh my God I never want to see that again Anthony Generation Y do we have a millennial is he a Millennial Generation Y typical Generation Y CH player decent to chess $140,000 in college debt and a liberal arts degree to boot that's not what it says but that's go easy on him all right Anthony I'm feeling generous I'll give you I'll give you a game with with the black pieces I'm so excited for our game but first coffeee sure I'm technically a millennial but I'm on the cups I'm actually honorary G okay okay okay oh my God I hate him too already let's play a Caro Khan against Anthony he's a thousand I hope they give me a Gotham chess shout out somewhere Anthony is definitely even though oh he's 33 he's like a prototype Gotham viewer like got into chess during the pandemic a thousand de chess watches the videos uh at work doesn't pay attention you know let's put a pin in it and all that other corporate lingo and be nice to me okay we have a weird exchange Caron what is the Wilco album what are these Bots talking about I want to play the old Bots avocado toast okay so we traded the bishop for the Knight we're pinning me we're threatening the pawn I'm going to go here so the Knight can't come forward oh my God the millennial bought won my Rook I completely missed that move oh this is really bad uhoh I'm losing to a 1,000 rated bot and he just keeps talking to me about things I don't care about is he going to trade Queens with me I'm just straight up losing okay this is this is this is not good can you write and curse shut up oh my God so annoying okay thankfully he lost the center Pawn so now I have a big Center and I'm going to develop all of my pieces okay he lost that PA too cuz he's awful and he's a Gotham subscriber um I'm going to defend that he's probably going to lose his Knight too he said I'm worse than Voldemort what the she shut up this is officially the worst set of bots ever I mean all of them are horrible prototypes of society I mean really really bad I can't wait to get to Martin and end this video um I think I'm going to do this so I can bring my what am I even thinking about this dude is a thousand he's not even a dude he's a bot he doesn't exist he doesn't exist I'm just going to push my pawns go toward his King then I'm going to open his King and then I'm going to win the game that's what's going to happen I'm going to play Knight D7 attacking his bishop and then I'm going to trade his Bishop we're gonna keep going look look at my blob of Pawns very powerful here here okay how about we trade and we get a giga Clump yes I'm going for the Giga Pawn Clump uh get the pawn all the way down to the E2 Square so he can't move there we go then I'm going to play Knight C5 Knight E4 he just has absolutely nothing he can do to me I did lose a rook though that was really impressive on my part um but I am a very talented player and also very humble so when he goes here ooh does Anthony know about Aus I'm not even going to take because I have so many pass pawns oops oops oops oops and poor Anthony is going to get uh checkmated with a pawn actually extremely brutal in fact I'll even let him promote brutal yeah it's tough yeah I'm also tired Bud yeah yeah yeah no I listen I I understand being a millennial is very tough you're in debt you can't afford a house that your parents could buy life is rough I keep seeing all this content on the internet about how hard it is to be a millennial I'm 1995 so all right we have Generation Z Isla Isa Isla back and ready to do spring cleaning on the board can you handle this quirky gen Z streamer then we have Generation X that's like before Millennial right XYZ yeah teenager in the 9s right then it's Esra who's generation a so he's like 5 years old or like nine and then it's Martin so we're going to keep it moving we're going to play a 1350 uh was I white that game I was black that game I want to play White this game I'm streaming this game say hi to my chat you know what I just I just I just got to say this right now streaming is so odd like I stream but I'm not going to lie like sometimes I'm at chess clubs and people are streaming their games it is just really wild to watch people look at a screen and just be like thank you for the gifted Subs like we live in a weird Society man The Vibes are so on right now okay Pawn to D4 let's play a French defense play exchange French I have a perfectly curated for you page chess memes astrology memes and M memes about other memes yeah no no no no guys for you pages are not that that is not what they are and the guys who are watching this right now you know exactly what I'm talking about our for you Pages do not look like that Zan Slayer 2017 for subscribing to my channel that's what I just said I just said it's dystopia and we just stare at these screens okay um I'm going to develop my knight to go Knight B5 mid oh no no no no no short Castle long Castle it doesn't matter we still stand wow they they really created ju just about the worst human beings imaginable like I I I oh my my coach memeel Lord 18 okay I like that that's good meme Lord 18 shout out to meme Lord 18 I wanton a pawn I don't think she's going to lose her Queen though she didn't I'm going to take the bishop um this doesn't quite work so let's go here this is a free Pawn actually ah not really I had a tactic I nobody nobody talks like this don't take my Bishop that peace is a major influencer no nobody talks like that like no literally who what was the focus group for these Bots I mean I I how did they possibly decide on their voice lines goated move okay that's a little better where's Riz if Ezra does not use the word Riz I he I'm I'm done F's in the chat right right right right Fs in the chat how can I just say something why has no bot shouted out Gotham chess can I just say that like by the way check and now the queen is going to hang why I mean all of these people watch Gotham so where is my shout out chess.com I'm mad Ezra Ezra better give me a shout out Ezra's my Ezra's my dude Queens are so Leos just like me nobody speaks like that nobody speaks like that nobody says those pieces are Leos no nobody that's Checkmate by the way is she going to find this move oh my God that's annoying I was really hoping that would not happen okay I guess I have to give this check and then here I mean now this move defends everything oh my goodness ranking my top three botes sisters Anna cramling what it's cuz I'm a dude like it I mean dare I say chess.com this is I mean this is offensive I I I mean that's that is you're uh you're you're really I'm going to promote to a to a knight or not that's Checkmate I am I'm I'm offended Honestly by this touch grass okay that's pretty funny I like that I like that that's pretty good oh my goodness I got what I got to I got to play two more and then I got uh and then I got my boy all right Sloan listen I'm sorry it's been fun but yeah chess is cool all right I'm going to have to play a Dutch defense against Sloan we're going to have to get a quick dub if I win you played bad if I lose it's whatever okay it's really hard to make Generation X cool cuz they're not cool Sorry Sloan yuppies yeah you're sorry look no disrespect but oh that's a pretty good move actually SLO heard me talking trash all right I got to kick the Knight out got to protect my Pawn I'm going to kick the Knight out like I said I would what's your favorite band None of Your Business play the game okay now SL is insulting chess and saying 3,000 BC call why would they make a bot that insults the game I I don't understand all right taking some space this is a queen Trap by the way oh disgusting and that's still a queen Trap by the way oh my my goodness yeah I'm sorry Sloan I had to uh I had to keep it moving I needed to uh you know to keep my viewer retention oh no my Rook fine take it take it take my Rook okay Queen here uh that's a good move actually the bot is uh after losing a little bit of material the bot is playing very well wow actually like very very well okay let's trade some pieces let's attack the bishop let's get my guy some help I like that I I I speak more like a okay I don't say stuff like that I don't say you're a pillowcase what what did they Google like most common things that like Generations say oh there's Rook e 3 okay luckily the bot is not particularly good at chess uh rook and now I will go for a ladder Checkmate that is exactly why I went there by the way and it's about to go back to worse oh you can't take this is Checkmate that's Checkmate okay we had to you know we we we had to beat the previous generation and now we got to play Mr Ezra okay now Ezra I Ezra better say I'm going to RIS you up uh Ezra says is this Roblox chess very Sigma where we TR dropping is in fortnite you see you wouldn't understand um okay I'm going to play E4 E5 say Riz say RZ if he says Riz the video ends when he says Riz mom said I can only play on the iPad for 20 hours honestly honestly gentle parenting 20 hours a day on the iPad none of that we're not doing that we not no no way I'm playing a schleman variation by the way whoa this is really aggressive give me your Netflix password what that's like a thing 40-year-olds say I don't even okay skib there we go he said skibby he said he said skib okay very good he said skibby but did he say give me your stop asking for passwords what is wrong with you okay Bishop there yes bringing out your Bishop for the rizzler oh I'll take it I'll take it oh my god oh he said bringing out your Bishop for the rizzler oh this is good my video is made anybody watching this over the age of like five is going to be really confused but okay um C5 maybe yeah now I actually have to not lose like the bot is not playing that that stupidly um 2100 level bot is pretty good I would be quite embarrassed uh to lose this game um maybe bishop B7 I'm just going to try to get more pieces in the game who says oof.exe stop capture P capture p is that what he's singing is that is that I dude I dude this kid is awesome Ezra is really funny I like the Ezra bot unboxing Blind Bags YouTube kids Coco M I kind of feel like Society is Doom though I I just I really I just kind of get that sense do you ever get that sense um okay swiping oh I feel like I'm winning can I sacrifice my Rook let's see will he yell at like oh he doesn't even yell it oh boring how about Queen Here pawn takes Queen here King F1 Rook f8 that looks pretty vicious yeah my my two pieces here are really good also it's insane he hasn't given me a shout out like I'm sorry but this is like my target audience not actually you you would be surprised a lot of a lot of the times people are like oh Gotham makes videos for kids no a lot of my audience is actually like 20 and 30 and 40 um the average age of a commenter is pretty young because they're the ones that are always in the comment section doing goofy stuff but um yeah you'd be surprised actually um this is a good move this is also a good move I'm just going after Ezra's uh King here uh Queen G3 King G2 is pretty pretty smart it's not like super smart but it's it's good enough uh Bishop G3 there's like Rook H1 stuff so maybe I take here and uh a lot of stuff is probably winning here but Queen G3 looks good followed by Rook F3 looks good and Ezra's position is kind of falling a w um that's kind of spooky so if I play Queen H3 he takes and I get mated huh got to be very careful here I don't think this works yeah taking my Bishop is probably just bad for him so let me play H5 if he takes my Bishop I have some sort of checkmates yes and what was the big idea here Mr Ezra but this is losing I think I just go here this is called a clearance sacrifice I play this move and I'm threatening this mate and this maid and Mr Ezra unfortunately will have to lose the game a he sacrificed is the queen that is actually quite clever um Queen H3 so wait what about Queen here takes Queen here King goes back to H1 Rook H3 Queen H2 Bishop E4 Knight takes Queen takes King goes to G1 wow wow I guess Ezra is going to survive yeah yeah he is getting cyber oh that's not a good move now I have check check check check check can I take his Rook I also can go here and here I'm telling my mom yeah do that nerd no Riz literally zero Riz okay I have waited a very long time now it's time to play Martin Come on Martin generation Martin no monthly bot theme is complete without me Martin indeed let's let's let's see okay Sicilian Defense I love you you don't know me stop saying you love me that's parasocial stop it um I'm a futuristic unbeatable chess robot now really that's really really scary I don't like that do I have any hobbies other than chess okay didn't realize I'm under attack you don't have all your uh okay okay why is Martin kissing me I mean this is weird I what did Martin just smoke a bunch like what is going on the Knight has hopped over 10,000 I honestly I feel like Martin's having a trip like I really I I I I don't know how I feel about this E5 is not the best move I know that for a fact because it it it gives me a Target so at least I know that Martin is not uh perfect he's not playing perfectly he keep oh boy okay well if that move is possible then maybe he is playing very well um I don't understand the idea but okay I guess we can take on D5 why did he play that move what what is he trying to accomplish oh he just wants to trade Queens what if I Castle what if I just trade the Queens what if it's kind of insane that I've played I'm playing Martin and he's not losing all his pieces it's very disturbing I really don't like it if I castle and he trades Queens with me he's going to put his Bishop on F5 so maybe we just trade the queens and then castle and then I have a bad feeling he might try to double my Pawns yes but is he going to go here no he did not maybe I play Bishop B5 to Target this and Target this I expect F6 yes um he's threatening to take and take my Pawn on A2 which is a little bit crazy but maybe I can just play F4 and then if he takes I take he takes I take he takes that doesn't look particularly good for him so let's go here maybe I won't lose to Martin but it is kind of terrifying that Martin is playing all these very very decent moves what did he say did he take what did he say taking a piece is one of the best feelings in life better than the birth of some of my kids what it feels better to take a piece than it does to have a child not like to physically have it I know that doesn't feel particularly good Rook D6 I can take here but then the king is just going to move at the end and I'm going to take the rook and that's kind of all that's going to happen can I like trap the bishop by the way wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute no I think it's just not it's it it's it's just not working because my idea here was Bishop takes Pawn takes then I have to defend my Pawn then I would play Rook D4 but then there's F5 and after King B2 there's C5 I think but like maybe it still works maybe I can play Bishop takes Pawn takes Rook D4 no maybe there's Bishop takes Pawn takes Rook here and then I take the pawn like this I mean I'm not losing in that position I don't know why there was a lag there that was a bit weird okay I guess it's a draw because he's going to trade the Rooks with me yeah I shouldn't lose this end game could also I guess play Rook D4 I can also double up yeah is he going to go here okay I might make a draw against Martin which is pretty nice the last 120 presidents of America at chess I don't think there's that okay I see Martin is just from the future I understand I understand now yeah that makes a lot of sense um well maybe we just end this video with a nice little comfortable draw against Martin now this actually oh I lost the pawn that was really stupid oh my gosh I completely missed that move that was really dumb uh but this should be a draw this should be a draw it's opposite colored Bishops which is a very drawable endgame but I have just made this infinitely more challenging for myself we're getting to the end of the game what an enjoyable game prepared to be obliterated oh oh yeah okay okay um maybe I will be obliterated I don't know uh maybe I shouldn't have allowed that maybe I shouldn't have allowed that wait a minute uh I actually don't think it really matters if I lose this Pawn but is he going to oh this is really bad I can't even I'm playing this so poorly I have to monitor this pawn and not let him get too close to my other pawns oh my God what am I doing what am I doing he's just he's just absolutely going to since when is Martin good at chess oh no I love you and how much you like CH no no no Martin stop we don't know each other oh I can't get back I have to I have to walk over with my king he's going to go there he's going to not let my king leave the square in the future everyone will be Martin no they won't dude no stop saying we're best friends dude please stop why is Martin such a creep in this version this is over my friends he's just going to bring his King I can't stop him this is I what what is happening what why is how does Martin know how to play chess now he's just beating me he's just I have to monitor this pawn and I can't I can't stop both pawns it's just over oh my God what oh I guess he's gonna what why did he do that oh why is Martin inviting me to vacation with him isn't he married guys this is the end I don't think anybody's going to be able to beat Martin again no no good game you should come over for dinner and meet my wife and all 35,000 of my kids I don't know what type of Black Mirror episode this is but I'm done we're done here I goodbye
