have plenty of money. All right. We're gonna
take a little time out. Everyone, rate Chris's cart so far. - It's a lot of meat - Especially the bread. Don't forget to rate the bread. - That bread is very important. - 'Cause you would use
your money to grocery shop. - I'm such a Dad. What's the nice toilet paper?
I don't know, I don't know. - I don't know. Well,
that one says premium. - "Great value" premium.
- Aw, nah dude, how much is that?
- Five dollars. Five dollars, for six rolls. - That's premium stuff, dude. - That's premium. 359, all your groceries. - Yep.
- And your dog food. Dude, you got your dog's food and a fence? - Yeah.
- You're such a Doggo Boy. - Everything went to my dog. - We're at Best Buy. I'm gonna get me an Apple
Watch. An Apple Watch band. See, my other mouse for
my computer ran away. So I need to grab this one. - Building a computer. Okay. - I'm going to get a mini projector because these seem really cool. And a Roomba, because I absolutely
hate sweeping the floor. Can I get a iPhone X and an Apple Watch? Need to buy some Beats. And then do you guys have earbuds? I'm gonna buy me a mini fridge. I got a record machine now, I can play the MrBeast
outro on my record machine. - Okay. I'm no, I'm gonna walk away now. How much was the total? - 4,000 something, something, something. - What? You're expensive. Two terabyte Western
Digital Blue hard drive. I'm gonna be getting this for my Dad. I got a MacBook for my Mom. A 50 foot cable for
internets. I got everything. Got the MacBook, got a
Dell laptop for my Dad. Got a monitor for
myself, some other stuff. Yeah. I have a thousand dollars left. So what should I get? I just got a PS4 Pro, I
wanna play some God Of War. Oh, there's God Of War. Of course we have to have
PlayStation Live, for 60 bucks. An extra controller, because why not? All right, we're ready to check out. Total was $674.03. Who got closer to 5,000, me or you? - Oh, a hundred percent me. - Nah, I don't think so. - Look at the difference
between our carts. Then there's me. - So we're comparing who got the closest to spending $5,000 on the dot. Katie went over by $7.
- $7. - You owe MrBeast $7 now. You're automatically
disqualified for that. - Oh.
- $4,654. - I adopted two rescue dogs
and I live near a highway, so it's kind of frustrating
taking them out. 'Cause sometimes they like
to run near the highway and it scares my little heart. See right now they have
to spend inside, all day. - So this is why you're being a Fence Boy? - Yep.
- Because you're a Dog Boy? - Come here! Ah. Are you guys excited
you're getting a fence and you get to hang out outside all day? You're gonna get to hang outside all day and you're gonna get
playing around outside. Come here, Boom-Boom. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! Oh God. He ran right into the camera. Oh, oh, that is some good
scratches right there. Oh, that is good scratches
right there. Oh, jealous. Hey viewers, do you want a kiss? Come here, Chief, give it a kiss. Ah, yeah. Good boy. So I've been needing a fence,
and we got a quote for a fence and it was just way too much money. - And all week Chris is
like, "I want a fence, but it's like, a lot of money." I would show it, but I don't
wanna give away your address. Basically, the total's about
$3,000 and he just bought it, but blah, blah, blah. Two, one. All right, it's been an
hour. It's been an hour. All right. Told everyone. Did you play a little too much Fortnite? - Yeah.
- Yep. They got me. - You got it, you got it,
there you go. There you go. - So is this $40,000 kinda, sorta, minus Chris' fence and a plane ticket? So minus two couches,
a plane ticket, a fence and also our person who wasn't here today, we have $40,000 worth of stuff. But Chandler, aren't we so
lucky to have QwikMatch? Hey! Can you stop playing
QwikMatch and listen to me? I know it's the best app ever- - Guys, we gotta finish the video, then you can play QwikMatch. - We don't wanna do any more videos, we're just gonna play QwikMatch now. - QwikMatch. - Thank you so much for the fence, it's gonna help me so much. - What do you wanna say? - Thank you for the
new streaming computer. - What do you wanna say? - Hey, thanks for the couch,
man, I'm gonna enjoy it. - Can I sit on your couch? - Yeah, dude.
- What do you wanna say? - Thank you for my new computer monitor. - Yeah? - And what do you want to say? - Thank you so much for my recliner, I will sit on it forever. - Did you get a recliner? - I did not.
- What'd you get? - Thank you for the new phone, now I can play more QwikMatch. - Oh, ooh. - And this is, ooh, that
was a pretty good plug. And this is Ethan, but
Ethan's editing, so. - "Thank you for the computer." - That's what Ethan said. ♪ MrBeast oh, ♪ ♪ MrBeast oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast oh ♪
