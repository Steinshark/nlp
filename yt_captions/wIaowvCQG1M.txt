[Music] what's up guys mkbhd here and welcome to ask mkbhd number 31 for august 2018. first things first the merch is back so you're probably aware by now the merch sort of comes and goes and waves but every time we get a new wave of things it's announced and you guys all know when it goes on sale and we'll link it below and everything and every time we do this we also tend to add a couple things i think this might be my favorite group of things we've added yet so the glitch shirt which you've seen in a previous video there's also the matte black hoodie which i've also worn previously actually some people got mad at me when i called it a hoodie because it's it's technically a windbreaker or a jacket i think all these words are fine it has a hood so i called it a hoodie but it's got a couple interesting things about it mine's really wrinkly right now but it has this little logo and it's made of 3m material where it's kind of really subtle but when you shine a light at it or like take a flash photo it's really reflective so that's pretty sweet and it's also appropriate because technically summer just ended i think two days ago was the first day of autumn so having a little windbreaker is not such a bad thing and then uh one of my all-time favorites i've shared these these matte black air pods with you guys in the past especially on like twitter and instagram colorware who we worked with who generously made these was comfortable enough with doing a batch of them a super limited edition batch that is now also in the merch tour which is pretty sick they are definitely not cheap it's expensive to do these like hand crafted painted air pods and get them as precise as color where it does but they've done it and if you're crazy enough to actually want these well you can get them now and last but not least is these couple wristbands which i think are pretty sweet i've shown these before and there's been people asking where they can get the bands that have worn in videos so that's a thing now the links below like i've said okay let's get into the questions so obviously uh august was a pretty incredible month for a lot of reasons most of the questions i think were about the elon interview or about elon or tesla of some kind i can kind of address some of the faqs or things you might not know but right off the top i can say i mean honestly what an amazing experience it was a lot of fun it was a big learning experience going into an environment like that and trying to shoot a video again i highly recommend watching john's behind the scenes video where you get an idea of not just the the gear we used and the sort of a process that went into making that and the rehearsal we had before but just the the chaos of actually going into a factory and trying to make a video there uh i've gotten a lot of like interview requests from news companies who want to interview me about the interview but what i've noticed i've declined them all but something i've noticed is a lot of their questions have a pretty similar theme to them so aside from the like typical howie's elon um obviously he was super nice with us and very generous with his time that he gave us but uh it was mostly a lot of questions like why didn't you talk about x or why didn't you do this do x y and z so first off this all came from or was born from a twitter conversation which is kind of amazing and it all when it was all locked down and scheduled we had scheduled 30 minutes that was our absolute guarantee you'll get at least 30 minutes may or may not be more depending on how it goes but plan to do everything in half an hour now knowing that most of the interviews he's done or he's had to do like in the last year are these like super stiff sit down interviews uh we wanted to make this one a little more fun so it was split into two halves which you saw it was a sit down just conversational half and then the sort of a factory tour part but i have to sort of self-time in my head getting all this down in 30 minutes because once the 30 minutes is up it's sort of the guarantee is over and it may end at any time so that little notebook you saw next to me in the interview the one on the chair that i never once reached for during the entire video that one that's this notebook here that one had that i wrote down all of my questions in it that's one they saw me rehearsing with in john's video i had written down all of my pages of questions they were all on this once we got in the interview we sat down shook hands and started talking and the conversation just sort of went and i never once never once looked at that notebook during the talk now it was useful that i kind of had most of the things i wanted to talk about memorized and the conversation actually sort of nicely flowed between those things it's not the same order that i wrote down but it was cool that we just talked about tesla and tech for a while uh but i definitely there were a couple things in here that i wanted to ask that i didn't for sure so yeah for everyone wondering why didn't ask elon what phone he carries that's because i didn't get to it uh although i'm pretty sure you can tell it's an iphone like it it's definitely an iphone so anyway yes i definitely again recommend you watch the bts video and now on to the twitter questions so will you will you use the pixel 3 as a main driver if it has that notch so i don't know if you've been living under a rock or just not paying attention to any tech news but the pixel 3 xl specifically over the last like three weeks has been leaked into oblivion i think there's actually a full review of the phone out already and it's still two months away from being officially announced like legit for real this time google could probably just have someone walk on stage at the event and just go yep that was it and walk off stage and just a price shows up that would just be it but of course naturally what a lot of people are focusing on is that gigantic notch up at the top first of all yes i'm going to test and use the pixel 3 and the 3xl uh i am not a fan of the just massive notch it seems to have but i'm still interested in that phone because of the camera it's going to have a better right a better camera and possibly an interesting better front facing camera or camera pair than the current pixel 2 so i'll be interested in that uh it looks like it's keeping the front facing speakers as well but it is a just ridiculously ugly horrible looking notch if the leaks are true which they probably are did you see this pocophone f1 what are your impressions about the super aggressive pricing i've read mostly information about this xiaomi poco f1 see what they did there poco f1 and then f phone same thing essential did you guys have seen that already but i've seen most of the stuff about this phone on my timeline it's apparently an extremely inexpensive phone snapdragon 845 six gigs of ram top-notch specs uh under 300 bucks not coming to the us i think it's india only for now but bottom line yes i am interested in it i hope to actually probably get my hands on it soon depending on how fast that availability happens uh but it's kind of getting appeal the same way one plus originally got my attention which was a lot of bang for the buck bringing the highest end specs you can get into the lowest imaginable price that's like why most people are paying attention to the poco phone which by the way not a good name you should have just called it the the xiaomi f1 separate video on the flamethrower i don't know i i don't know if it's work it's kind of a is it worth a separate video it's just a small little it's a prop essentially it ends up looking pretty cool on camera relative to most other flame throwers and i don't know i i guess i could see it being worth maybe a short twitter video or something like that i don't know it's kind of needs a propane tank and it's it's a prop right now right now someone asked if this poco f1 is a oneplus killer again if it's only one market right now which is just india then i can't say it's a oneplus killer because oneplus is in a bunch of places and may even be coming to carriers with the next version which is a big deal in the us that's how you get in people's pockets um but yeah it's again a lot of parallels with oneplus i agree with that have you ever cleaned your red sensor no but that does kind of remind me of a funny story so i travel a lot with camera gear as you probably already know and it's always in like the same couple of think tank bags it's the the one that's the exact size of the domestic overhead bin it fits perfectly every time we have this layout that we go through i'm used to traveling with camera stuff so what i'm also used to is going through tsa and when i have that bag which has all the batteries in it and the camera body and the carbon fiber they always see that and pull it to the side and open it up and swab it it's like 90 of the time but i'm flying through these big airports like newark and san francisco and la and usually they just pull to the side swab it doesn't come up with anything close it give it back to you you're good that's fine but a couple weeks ago or months ago we were on a shoot where we went to we flew into a smaller i think it's san jose or somewhere in there a smaller airport and so we were one of the first flights out of there like seven in the morning there is no one else in the tsa line no one else in the security line just the crew and the camera bags and they're gonna check them they got nothing else to do at 6 30 in the morning at the airport if these things go through the x-ray and they look a little bit weird they're going to swab them and they're going to check them but these guys not only did they swab you know the inside of the bag they took out all of my lenses all the lenses in the bag took the top of the lens off took the body cap of the lens off and swabbed the glass on both ends and looked through it to make sure it was glass so that's like five or six lenses right there then they get to the camera and i'm okay with all this up to this point like i get it you're doing your job this is what you're supposed to do but they get to the camera the red monstro and they're like yeah we're gonna have to swab the inside of this and i'm like okay wait a second uh no they wanted to open up the body cap and make sure it's a sensor and swab the inside of it and i drew the line there but uh they did do their job and and check the rest of our gear and eventually we made it through that airport but yeah that's funny that they wanted i don't know if they i don't know if they knew what they were doing whatever they kept us safe the flight was safe everything was safe what question did you forget or regret not asking elon aside from the the forgetting like that last part about what phone do you carry uh the one regret i have is a question which was how did you find these videos how does someone as busy as elon who probably has better things to do than watch youtube videos uh end up watching tech videos at all land on the channel decide that he's cool enough with it to be on it how does that happen do you have the youtube algorithm to thank for that or the trending page or just maybe he just looked for some some phone reviews one day who knows uh would you buy wood joey would joy buy would you buy a rimac uh i would drive a rimac but that's also like a million dollar car so i don't i'm not gonna buy one how are you liking your new kicks those okay so for those who were wondering or think that was my kicks of the day choice it wasn't to go into that factory you need steel-toed boots and so tesla provided still toy boots for the whole team we weren't all rocking the nursing home 2.0 or anything crazy like that that was a safety feature safety first uh how much footage do you generally shoot for one video the answer would vary a lot between different video types like a review way more typically a couple hundred gigs closer to a terabyte but this video it's just a lot of talking to the camera one shot so i'll leave i'll try to put the amount of footage this video took up right here there you go if you could shoot either ahri 2997 or red 2398 for a year which do you choose how dare you john um it's actually you know what it's not actually that bad i think i would just shoot ahri 2997 that's just me i know you guys know i love red but i also love 30 frames a second and i could shoot ari i could learn to shoot array for a year it's only a year if you told me like a lifetime i might have other thoughts about resolution and things like that but for a year i'll shoot eric that's fine what is the biggest misconception for you as a successful content creator that's easy uh it's the amount of work that people think it takes to make what we make even at a totally different topic level or anything else like people watch a five minute youtube video and they assume it took 5 10 15 minutes to make people watch even if people watch i'd be curious what you would think if you watch a seven minute really well done review of something how long you think the process from inception to completion took and i think 99 people would guess way not enough time videos that we make in tech have a writing process a research process like this sort of a summary process to turn it into a video form oftentimes there's storyboarding and shot listing and shot planning and then you go into the actual shooting and production phase then there's all the editing and the post production and everything that goes with publishing it and distributing it there's a lot it's not like a seven minute video it takes an hour and i've said it before a creative's greatest trick is making it look easy but that still stands today the biggest misconception people have about youtubers period is how much work they think goes into it but hey that's where i'm gonna end it thank you guys for uh for all your questions on twitter and for watching this video for ask mkbhd in general to live on hopefully uh the next one's even more exciting but definitely stay tuned in the next couple weeks for some of the most exciting videos of the year on this channel given what we just had that should mean a little something thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace
