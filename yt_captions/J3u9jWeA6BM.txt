before I met Jonathan In the Flesh I might have a photograph of Jonathan there in my living room Jonathan comes in and he moves into the house I don't need the photograph you know it's redundant I've got Jonathan himself and so there's that it's interesting because you know I'm so bound up in the question of symbolism but you in the Orthodox especially in the Orthodox iconographic tradition there's a there's some aspect of it which is you could call anti-symbolic in the sense that they they move moving towards saying Christ is the finality of these images and so when you have Christ it's the you don't you're not necessarily wanting to represent him in these Shadows but you have the thing itself it doesn't mean that symbolism doesn't continue to exist in this typological way there's a sense in which Christ is the is the end of the of the symbolic pyramid [Music] this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] I'm an associate professor in the department of practical theology here at Princeton Theological Seminary I'm also the founder and executive director of Scala Foundation which is a non-profit whose mission is to renew culture through liberal arts education Beauty and worship I'm joining you here today from the studios at Princeton Theological Seminary where I have the pleasure of Hosting Aiden Hart an iconographer born in England raised in New Zealand now residing in England that's right and Jonathan pejo from Quebec Canada who was also an iconographer and icon Sculptor both Aiden and Jonathan are here this weekend for the conference on Art the common good and the sacred being hosted by Scala and Princeton Theological Seminary and before we do that public event I wanted to sit down with them and talk to the two of them as artists about how they think about the relationship between scripture image and symbol specifically we're going to talk a bit about one particular icon that of the Transfiguration but before we jump into that particular icon I wanted to say that I for the class I'm teaching on Aesthetics and Christian education I read very carefully Aiden Hart's book Beauty spirit and matter icons in the modern world and what struck me about this book was this idea that images remind us that life with Christ is above all a relationship between persons and in that book Aiden just explains that in the tradition of icons it's both Christ's Divinity and his Humanity are supposed to be represented so just as the words of scripture are supposed to reveal to us who God Is So images are supposed to help us understand Christ's Divinity and his Humanity Aiden also explains in this book some Timeless principles of liturgical art and those principles let me see if I get these right Aiden I don't have them memorized but I haven't written down one time as principle of liturgical art is that well what I just said that God became man the Incarnation right so Christ showed himself as man second that in the Transfiguration which is what we're going to talk about today we got a glimpse of divinized man and I want to unpack what that means and what that looks like in the icons of the Transfiguration and here I think you're taking on a big stance here theologically when you say that matter can be Grace bearing um so I want to talk about that and then you also say a fourth principle is that human beings are fulfilled in relationship that's why it's important to see the faces of others and fifth that and the fifth principle of liturgical art is that we have what's called The Noose a noetic faculty the eye of the heart that we don't just know about God With The Noose we can know God did I get those five principles right yeah yeah more or less yes the Noose uh enlightened by the Holy Spirit where no man can see God so it's almost a so yeah I said God sees himself through the news so it's always a Synergy a union of the two but yes those five points are really important well let's stay on the news that let's stay on the news for a second because this was a I I admit this was a New Concept to me like the news how do you describe the news Jonathan I think I mean the way to understand the the news let's say practically is to understand that there's a there's a capacity that humans have to uh grasp things directly it's maybe the best way to understand it that is pre-discursive it's not it's not a discursive it's not a description it's not a it's a it's a contact that is direct and and full uh and so we actually we actually the news is necessary for you to exist but there's something about our thoughts and about our desires and about our passions that clouds us from being able to to live in that space and much of the spiritual practice you know in in the Orthodox Church for example is there in some ways to purify the Noose that is to kind of still the thoughts still the images still the word the buzzing and the worrying so that we can enter into the heart you know he talked about the eye of the heart enter into the heart and then it's in that position that all of a sudden the news can be open to to to Revelation to the Holy Spirit and then you can grasp things directly like you can see them pierced with God but then ultimately the the contention is that you can also you know see the Divine Light you can enter into God himself wow see okay these are Big claims um I do actually remember distinctly my senior year of college at Yale after I had taken classes in psychology and sociology and I remember walking into church and thinking this is a collection of rituals that human beings say mean certain things and other people in other points of time have come up with rituals that they say mean certain things and how do I know that any of these symbols or any of these rituals are actually anything more than a human creation so when I read your book now I'm still a practicing Catholic I always have been but as I'm teaching my students about these images the students might be captivated maybe their noose is being activated they're they're having an encounter but they're posing this question how do I know that this image that I'm looking at is actually Revelation or how do I know that it's not something from my imagination but another thing I loved reading in your books Aiden is that working as an iconographer you have a way of approaching this question about what do we depict in art and why so that's what I wanted to talk to you about today can we just pick the two of you pick I thought let's go with the Transfiguration because that figure is so centrally in your book Beauty spirit and matter and I wonder if we can unpack the event of the Transfiguration The Encounter of the symbols the meanings and from there just have a conversation about how do we know when symbols come together to reveal who God is and or what's a human invention that's a big question I know but let's start with the Transfiguration um you know what what happens to the Transfiguration well the Lord just going straight from the gospels through the gospels related ironically the one or the three disciples John who was there didn't write about it in his gospel but the other three gospels describe it Christ takes Peter James and John up to a high mountain it doesn't describe what the mountain is in the scripture is bit by tradition it's table and this is that he's transfigured um and then Moses and Elijah appear with him and they're conversing about his coming Glory which means his crucifixion and then dear Peter who always likes to blurt things out says lord it's good to be here let's make three tents um and then the voice of the father speaks and then Moses and eyes are going they come back down again so that's the basic story but there's so much packed into that I think that's one reason because it's so pregnant that traditionally I don't know how often it happens when an iconographer is fully trained that's the first icon they paint yeah why would that be says everything the Incarnation communion but also because much of the Theology of the of the icon you know and the Theology of Orthodox mythicism is related to the question of light and to this notion of Divine Light um and so the image of the Transfiguration right is that is that's what's going on in that in that image it's about light and icons are about light I mean especially painted icons that's what they're dealing with and this lies at least an orthodox theology is God himself God doesn't create a gift of light and give it to us like the sun we kind of goes into the orb of the Sun but the Sun comes to us so the light and the warmth coming from the Sun is sun isn't it so um so this is the glory of God himself the Shekinah Glory to use the Hebrew term coming to us so it's symbolic but it's much more than symbolic it's actually encounter with the Living God a lot of the Old Testament is Experiencing God via something Moses and Elijah who appear with um Christ uh they get an inkling of God so Moses hears God's historic it sees God in the Mount Sinai is sort of thunder and lightning and he hears God but doesn't actually see the Lord and Elijah likewise he comes to the mouth of the cave and this case God is a still Small Voice a partial liberation back there it Transfiguration they see the Lord face to face incarnate Lord face to face so it's the opposite of symbolism yeah the symbolism leads them to the face of God you mean it's the opposition it's the opposite of symbolism in the sense that that which they're seeing is the combination of symbolism maybe it's the best way to understand it is our footsteps yeah and so to the face Aiden's got it exactly right that is you know it happens on a mountain just like Elijah just like Moses there's a sense in which you know it's going up towards that space where Heaven and Earth meet but now what is seen there is the source of Revelation itself it's the culmination of Revelation at the same time and that's one of the reasons why for example Moses and Elijah are brought to see right the very source of creation it's almost you could almost say that it's a little moment of Eternity right it's like it's their encounter with God that is happening the promise what they ask God right when Moses asked he said God show me show yourself to me and God has said well I'll show you my back and now he's getting the fullness of what he asked for and this isn't just Jonathan I Dreaming things up if we look at the um because people say well all this stuff how do you know it it's in the liturgical text the the the the the the face the icon is bought out and put in a what's called an analoy on the Feast of the Transfiguration and then we hear all these incredible hymns that are just full of theology I have a book called the festival name which has the translations into English of all the fixed feasts and it's just got London lining and notes it's just profound theology so it's from these texts that we we we're talking about really these uh patristic texts that have been tried and tested and always related to the scriptures the the translation into English uh has a notations underneath referring to every biblical verse referred to directly or tangentially in the text and there's only about five references there so they are that much graphical text has got about five biblical references so it's rooted in the scriptures so Moses died God buried him it says Elijah went to heaven so it talks about Moses and Elijah represent all the living and the dead but together with Christ and in the icon the top half you have Christ with Moses and Elijah who are in heaven down below you have Peter James and John who on Earth but they're all within the rectangle of the icon so in fact this is the church yeah the church living in dead prophets all together there all right let's let's slow down for a minute here because I and we we have five scripture references but all this hymnology so you're saying that the icon evolved both from the scriptural references but as it was there's also imagery or poetry let's say in these liturgical texts that talk about the feast Express profound truths through poetry yeah and it's I mean they're expressing typology and so it's not it's not that the poet just thought up nice images is that the poet is versed in the Psalms this verse in the Old Testament and that these insights through noetic experience the insides of seeing all of a sudden the Transfiguration hinted at right glimmers of it in Moses glimmers of it in different parts of the Old Testament and then seeing that this is all being connected in the story of the Gospel you know it's interesting to what extent hymnography is actual a kind of bib the Bible interpreting itself right referring to these old images bringing them back and showing you how they connect and how all this is brought together in the person of Christ so one him talks about when you're a transfigured in Christ you revealed the original beauty of the human nature and this refers back to a lot of the fathers say that if I'm Syrian for example that when it says Adam and Eve were naked they'd been clothed before they've been clothed in light the glory of God so when they sinned as it whether lost that light like if I pull out a plug or turn off a switch these lights go out so it's a land but yet it's not a lamp because it's not a radiant with um through electricity with light so this sign in Christ um is actually the new Adam who's put back on the Garment of light in other words he's not just human he he he's shining with divinity and it's not it's really there it's really there in the story because this is also happening during the Feast of Tabernacles so the question that Peter asked it's almost a joke in this in the story you know Peter says can we give you a garment can we cover this like can we make a house for it and and Christ this is this this moment is beyond that right this is not this is not a this is more than a moment that can only be held within the tent of even the tent of the Tabernacle because that's what it's being alluded to you are here's the glory of God appearing to us can we build the tent around it to contain it and not this one right it's so what you're saying is that that resp that dialogue between Peter and Jesus just that simple thing can we put a tent around it is actually a reference yeah we are yeah he didn't realize it probably but no no it doesn't matter right it's like he was just in the moment in saying it but then when you see it in retrospect just like the disciples themselves at Pentecost all of a sudden you know saw all these things that Christ had done and how they connected they participated in that too let's build a few Tabernacles that refers to the Feast of Tabernacles and that was to remember when they lived in the jeset and God was with them in the desert because of course during the daytime uh the Lord LED them forth with a pillar of um fire a cloud at night and a bit of a fly so the Feast of Tabernacles was to remind that God was with them and the desert so here at he's prophesying in a way peace we're saying this is the Fulfillment yeah that's right yeah the pillar of fire is here before I said God himself and then Jesus responds that no we cannot put a tent around it is to say this is not the symbol of the glory this is it exactly this is the real thing like that's this this is the real thing yeah before I met Jonathan In the Flesh I might have a photograph of Jonathan there in my living room Jonathan comes in and he moves into the house I don't need the photograph you know it's redundant I've got Jonathan himself and so there's that it's interesting because you know I'm so bound up in the question of symbolism but you in the Orthodox especially in the Orthodox iconographic tradition there's a there's some aspect of it which is you could call anti-symbolic in the sense that they they move moving towards saying Christ is the finality of these images and so when you have Christ it's the you don't you're not necessarily wanting to represent him in these Shadows but you have the thing itself it doesn't mean that symbolism doesn't continue to exist in this typological way there's a sense in which Christ is the is the end of the of the symbolic pyramid to go back to the anecdote I shared with you before about myself as a senior in college it's a little bit frightening when you begin to realize that there's other rituals and there's other symbols and there's other meanings and there's other ways of thinking about worship because I think for me as a young person I wanted to believe that these rituals and these symbols truly were what I had been told they meant and that I could have this encounter with God because the alternative is to say well none of this means anything and all of this is just made up and whatever I choose to believe the symbols mean is what they mean and then that's what it means to me and it's all the same right and that wasn't very satisfying to me either because if I just make up the meaning then I'm not really getting the meaning of my life because I can just claim it to be one thing you know but what I hear you saying is Well there's a rich history of symbols and symbolic thinking but Christianity is actually claiming this isn't just about symbols we're actually claiming you can meet God In His glory is that right well that would be the point of symbols also I mean the point of you could say that the point of creation is so that it can meet God and so even the even the symbols or the symbolic hierarchy or these these These inklings are there as a they're there to act as a ladder that's the only thing they're there for they're not just for our just enjoyment and thinking about Concepts but they're they they have to if they don't provide levels of insight that can bring you closer to a Divine encounter than their they're kind of pointless you know you can be just turning around going around in circles in fact the word symbol is a combination of two Greek words Sim and Volus which means literally to throw together um so the aim of a symbol is to draw us together with the architect because Christ so once you're together then there's someone is fulfilled its function you don't discard it you're sort of thankful for that tree or whatever that brought you closer to God I came to believe in God's existence through trees now I used to hide in trees as a child playing hide and go seek and I a sort of quiet way I can I came to be there must be a God who made this incredible things called trees so when I was a Hermit living in 20 acres Savannah planted 5 000 trees and Thanksgiving to God and Thanksgiving to the trees if you like for being like Saint John the Baptist leading me to God so it's not as so now Matthew standards job I can spit it out it could have makes a symbol richer it remains there but beside Christ instead of in eastern and western Christianity you have these three stages of movement toward Christ in the west it's called um purification illumination and Union and in the East it tends to be called practical theology from Praxis something you do you've got to act and make an effort to repent and then Fisher key theology or natural theology perceiving God in the nature and the created world and then Mr key for your mystical theology so the first is repentance been purified as Jonathan was saying you can't see unless you'd get the cataracts off but the second which is related to symbolism is perceiving the words of God within each created thing so this plant behind us it didn't just come out of nothing God spoke plant whatever it is rubber plant and the rubber plant comes into existence but that word that the Lord spoke actually keeps that in existence so when I see the rubber plant I don't see a plant it's a gift of love to me you know my wedding ring is just hang of gold but when I look at that I see my wife's love for me and then follow these footsteps is logo and plural these words embedded in creation eventually come to feet and look up and there's the face of the Lord the logos himself we can't proceed we can't look at the sun straight away but gradually or I suggest until eventually we can look at the face of the sun himself well it's a kind of gradual Ascent maybe to the face of God I would say that the Transfiguration is a feast in the church or a part of the scriptures that I always struggled to relate to it's not that long not that many words going on there and I wasn't until you know a little bit later in life that there was something about the Transfiguration that captured my imagination and I wanted to try to understand it more because I wanted to believe that in the midst of these struggles that I was having and these issues and these problems that God still loved me and he loved the people around me and that things were going to be okay and I think that this is a very visceral human desire right that in the midst of struggle and suffering you begin to ask okay are is this faith that I've been given is it really real like can I really see God even in the midst of all of this difficulty but I will say that Transfiguration is not something I remember being taught about much in catechism or having much of a way to think about it so when I picked up your book as I mentioned Beauty spirit and matter I said oh finally here's someone's kind of unpacking the meaning of this to me so let's let's talk a little bit about you mentioned that what an iconographer begins to train this is the first one I wanted to finish the training once they finish the training the first one they were paid so what are the pieces of the icon we mentioned Moses and Elijah who what is what is it describe the icon of the Transfiguration like what's that what are the elements in it I know Moses and Elijah there's some rays there's Simon Peter no Simon is Peter right Simon James and John Peter James and John okay Peter James and John there's some mountains okay so just describe the image for me that you've describe it well yeah so it's there's variation in the image but usually there's a a mountain sometimes there's three Peaks and Christ is in the center and then there's a glory around him his vestments are white um and then you have Elijah and Moses on either side of of Christ below then you have in the mountain you will have the three disciples that are reacting to the to their Vision usually uh James and John are kind of tumbled over falling back you know looking away and then uh Peter is sometimes kind of looking towards Christ it depends on the icon but there's a sense of what he's gesturing towards Christ and that's when he is asking the the question about about the Tabernacle there are some little details that are interesting that that appear in the transfer aggression for example often you'll have one or two of the disciples losing their sandal during the during the the they're they're kind of being bowled over by this this Vision um and so those are the basic elements of the of the Transfiguration and from the uh the glory it can be a circle it can be very shaped you have Rays coming up sometimes underneath most of the knowledge you've got caves with with golden some later on have the disciples going up yeah and on one side and coming down the other and that's quite important um important but it has importance that's important in the idea also of how Revelation works right it's like this Moses going up and bringing something down with him and so having that image is definitely yeah don't stop being a state of ecstasy if you're going to go down high school be crucified they've got to carry the grace of God into into the world yeah all right so in that one image I'm hearing movement up and down I'm hearing Old Testament I'm hearing dialogue I mean there's a lot happening in one image now sorry we're gonna have to go back to basics here what are Moses and Elijah doing there well they they there's several things that they're doing one is that they are fulfilling their their question they ask most of them asked you know Moses asked to see God and both of them had a partial Revelation you know Elijah heard that soft that quiet voice and Moses saw the back of God as he walked by and so they're there to see the fullness of the glory of God that's what they're there for they're there to kind of finalize their their movement towards Revelation so it's like it's what it's saying is this is the final this is it like this is the the the the fullness of Revelation is being shown here you know if there's an image without saying it that is saying this is God it's the Transfiguration because why are Moses and Elijah there looking at you know standing next to Christ in the center who is who is revealing this Glory completely uh and so so that's why it's one of the reasons the law came to remember and Elijah it's a prophet so Christ is the Fulfillment of the law and the prophets the the uh not only victims Commandments but the tent of meeting and the Temple of all types which types of really physical prophecies all of Christ so this is a fulfillment of them okay so they're beholding the glory of God in Christ that's the Fulfillment of their everything prophesied about all the law everything is there okay okay and then Jesus has invited Peter James and John to be there and you said that sometimes Peter has shown looking at him yeah he's he's kind of gesturing towards either he's looking or sometimes he's gesturing it depends on the the image but most of the time he's looking towards Christ and gesturing towards him and each of the three postures relate to the age so the oldest one is Peter he's looking at Christ John is the youngest he's probably about 19. he's the one normally looking away James is middle age he's sort of between the two but what's interesting is that John is the Mystic I mean they don't like the word but his symbol is the ego so the eagle flies really high but interestingly he's often curled up and there's a lot of teaching about the Jesus prayer when you do the Jesus payoff and you make a circle out of your body but you don't want your thought to shoot out there you want to um meet God the holy spirit in your heart so you create a circle um so he's seeing the Lord but but mystically through his heart as it were said the plenty of stories about lay and monastic people um experiencing the Lord through that in a in a prayer so it's three different ways of encountering God and they're not um contradictory they're just different ways so it's not that one posture is superior to the other it's that there are different ways of of letting the mist of seeing this each of us are three distinct people and each of us will experience God in distinct ways wow and why would the sandal be falling off I think I have noticed that before why is the sandal falling off yeah I that at least for me that now this becomes the land of speculation but I I do think that it has to do with Saint Gregory of nissa's vision of the the What's called the removing of the garments of skin so there's a there's an image in the ascent of Moses as he goes towards the burning bush where God says remove your sandals for you're in a holy place um and say Gregory sees that as this kind of aesthetic practice where you remove the the passions you remove the externals in order to enter into the heart once again and so my I've always when I see that sandal falling off I feel like this is a gesture towards that saying like this is this is the the this removing of the of the outer garments and moving into the holy place and it's not that face is bad is it it's not saying oh the the fish is bad and anyway you can see God has to get rid of that bad material stuff called the flesh it's uh Jonathan used the term passions we tend to think of passions pejoratively but the passions are a god-given energies but you've got to direct them toward toward God I'd say there'd be two other elements as well is that you've already alluded to Jonathan that the Lord tells Moses to take his sandals off he's encountered God and says Holy Ground so this shows us that Christ is the burning bush a Bush's physical stuff but then it's got this fire which doesn't consume it so obviously the fire is is not a created fire it must have been a Divine fire because otherwise it would have consumed the bush and and thirdly if you're afraid and you're shaking your sound might fall off um so that's also to show that this light is actually not just bright physical light but this is Divine Light it's a completely different order it's an encounter with something that's completely beyond anything we can imagine in the created order so this sort of fear and the shock and this falling over and and the disorder of the disciples is to emphasize that this light is Divine Light um and you see this in icons of the mother of god with Christ sometimes the sandal falls off Christ's feed and that's because as God he knows is going to rise die and Rise but also it's a human he's afraid of death so the child is shaking out of fear um so it's a normal thing to be afraid of death so this sort of sandal falling off on the Vladimir icon it's called is an indication of a film in Christ Humanity in that case in this case it's a fairly Christ Divinity wow and the the supernatural nature of this lies okay so now let's go to Christ in this image you know as I mean mentioned to start you say that you know one of the purpose of icons is the real is to reveal Christ and his humanity and in his divinity so it would seem to me that the icon of the Transfiguration we're clearly seeing Christ in his divinity but are we also seeing Christ in his Humanity what does Christ look like in the Transfiguration when you paint the Transfiguration I mean he looks like it's an image of Christ it's a recognizable image of Christ Christ has certain characteristics that makes us recognize that it's him so it's definitely representing him in his Humanity you can't represent the Divinity of Christ you can't represent it you can gesture towards it you can here's a place where you can kind of symbolize or gesture towards Christ's Divinity and that's what the glory that's the role that the glory plays in this image right the Rays of Divine Light That emanate from him but the important thing theologically it's the person of Christ we're depicting yeah icons only and the the fathers who defended icons against the iconoclast were always affirming we're not depicting the Divinity of Christ we're depicting the person of Christ um but the person of Christ is divine he's not a human created being whom God popped into because he was a good lad um the person or the hypothesis to use the Greek term of Christ is that that of the second person of the trinity so you're seeing this this man Jesus Christ whose personhood is divine but as I mentioned earlier what is interesting is that the texts say that he has shown us what it is to be truly human which is to be not merely human but to be deified to be god-bearers so I think the miracle is not so much the crisis transfigured but the fact that he wasn't trans people out it would have so in fact the Miracles that he clothed himself as it were to hide his divinity and one of the aspects of the of the mandurla or the the glory that is around Christ is usually that it's represented as a darkness that moves towards light and so usually in the middle it's dark and on the outside it's white and moving different tones of blue towards the towards the the light and that has to do with this this idea that God is beyond is beyond the description yeah and so there's a there's a Divine darkness is what house and Gregory Divine Darkness yeah what is that tell me more about that I thought I thought you said it was about light well that's it so there's it so it's represented in aporia it's always represented paradoxically so there'll be different ways of saying it's something like a a light so bright that it blinds you something like that or or the idea of or that which is beyond light even that is the source of light so how do you how do you figure that you know that which is beyond description which is beyond name which is beyond all capacity to to frame and that is the highest aspect of of of God in in the mystical experience and in the descriptions even in in theological descriptions this idea that that uh I talked about saying Gregory of Nissa and the Ascension of Moses and when Moses goes up he moves into the Divine darkness and it says that there's Darkness covered the mountain and there's lightning yeah you know Darkness and Light and in the story of the Transfiguration you get that because it says it says a very contradictory thing in the story it says it says they were they were covered by a they were covered by a cloud of light it's like what what is that it's like two contradictory things a cloud is something that is shaped right it sucks right and then but it's a cloud and it's it's light at the same time so even in the actual text there seems to be a kind of a Poirier that's presented that that is implying both light and dark at the same time but really what we're just saying is that is the unknowable no unnerability of God um in Orthodox theology we discern distinguish between the essence of God which even in the age to come is unknowable and the energies of God it's rather unfortunate translation but basically it's it's the living person or God in his nobleness you know like if I said I've I've known you for two years I know you're entirely you'll be a bit offended by that even if I knew for two thousand years Margarita will always be unknowable to some extent you know your each of us is created in God's image so each have asked is Eternal in the sense that we never entirely know I mean both of us are married we're married but we know we're never going to know our spouse in their entirety so this is a noble Essence in a way and if this is true of humanity surely it's true of God from our point of view it's not darkness and God himself but we can know we're getting closer to knowing you can know your oh yeah of course yeah and gregorithia whom Jonathan's referred to a lot he he uses the term from glory to glory a lot of course at Saint Paul's town that even in the ages can we if we're growing closer to God okay yeah it's an eternal message uh Journey right right so now in the Transfiguration Christ is filled with light and I believe you've told me Aiden that also it's important to depict the garments are also filled with light it's not just his face it's not just the Rays emanating out from his noose maybe but his His Garment is transfigured that's what the scriptures say it's saying that the face shines with that but although all three gospels talk about the garments they do oh my God this is I don't know if you want to speak to this is one of my favorite subjects yeah yeah I mean it's just the clothes we wear in they're just inanimate aren't they they're not personable they're just woven linen but this inanimate matter participates in this uncreated Glory so that this is and in Greek one of the terms used for what we now call nature rather sadly that this call of the created World um is cosmos uh the the God God created the cosmos and Cosmos in Greek means adornment Cosmetics comes from that so Christ's Cosmos Christ garment is really the whole of the created World which is wrapped around himself and is filled with light again so Maximus to Confessor talks a lot about this that each stage of Christ he's Gathering something which had been discarded by the Fall Adam and Eve discarded creation by not um giving thanks it just sort of became dead then when you if I take this garment off it just becomes dead it just flops when it's on me it takes on my form it actually participates in my personhood so really what's happening in the Transfiguration is that the person of God who's taken on our Humanity the off before so it's the second Adam is transfigured but through the second Adam who's like a a priest between the Creator and the rest of creation the whole of the cosmos participates in his Transfiguration and Saint Paul talks about this in Romans 8 the horde of creation sort of groaning waiting for the Redemption of the children of God because it too then will be filled with Glory all of creation but I mean are my clothes part of creation yeah of course they are but I thought but it's very it's there's a very there's a very deep understanding of even in terms of the story of the Fall you know garments are very important because Adam and Eve are clothed in glory right that's the way that at least San Ephraim presented in some of many of the church fathers and then in the fall is when they kind of see themselves as naked as lacking and then they they feel like they have to add something to themselves and so these dead garments of skin get added to them but that doesn't stop there it becomes also civilization right so Cain goes further down into the fall and he builds this city and he builds these walls and technology and these weapons and the the idea is that that is somehow a reaction or it's a movement of the Fall that's going deeper and deeper down into into basically going all the way to the flood in the biblical narrative and the surprise of Christ is that he fills all of that with light so the final image let's say of the Transfiguration is the Heavenly Jerusalem which is now it's like now it's really just the entire world that is filled with Glory but the hint of that or the the promise of that is exactly like Aiden said is that this garment that Christ wore is now no longer let's say a dead Garment of skin but is now feel like it's full of the of the very Glory by participation in the person of Christ because the Garment takes on the form of the person wearing it and it's only friends figure because it's part part of them it's not him but it sort of takes on his image I said well so what you're saying I think Aiden has really profound theological implications that the person of Christ has his garments are part of the person of Christ is that what I hear you say um distinct but yes like I had to put it or they helped to reveal the person yeah yeah I mean the whole of creation is in God's image I mean we we are persons with freedom so we're more in the image of God but everything in in creation even to a rock it's a symbol reflects some aspect of God's life so in fact the whole of creation was created as a temple for us to worship God let him talk much about this you're talking about how do we know the rituals have significance if it's true worship it should reflect Heavenly worship this is why God had revealed to Moses exactly how to build the tins of meeting and exactly how to uh moral the year liturgically because it wasn't this man's invention dreaming it up he had to reflect had to be an icon of heavenly worship um so the whole creation was created by God as a temple for us to worship him in and it affected uh the truth of who God is okay so in some ways I mean because we believe that human beings are created in the image of God and my clothes aren't created in the image of God but yet they somehow reflect God's glory which is different their take on your shape and your image of God say that they're that obviously a lower image of God than you are because they're just inanimate um but you could understand I mean if you want a simple example that's not that doesn't because I see it's kind of confusing you but you can you can imagine that let's say in in when you go to you go to church and then you have a chalice right it's like you hear that this is kind of a child it's like we have Cubs we have things but then all of a sudden there's this possibility of taking something which we use in common day life and then bringing it into service and bringing it into worship then it participates in this movement towards God and so you know so in some ways you could say that for let's say this it's a Liturgical Movement but think about it in terms of what the promise is that this will fill the whole world right that is what the promises that the the reason for creation is that it can be theophanic that it can be a place where God reveals himself I mean in some ways that's the reason for creation without that why did God create the world like God created the world out of this it's in the way of him trying to get in the way of it okay so all of creation from you know plants and trees and clothing can participate in the glory of God is that well God created it but it says in Hebrews that Bobby word of his power all things sustained so God just didn't create and then he walks away and that thing has its own God remains in that and gives it life so Bishop callistos whereas is that Christians aren't pantheists but they are panintheists you know goddess and everything sustaining it this is the meaning of the logoy the words I mean it's the second stage of the spiritual life is to discern see hear the words of God within each created thing it was a highlight you're obviously an animal is is high enough they're hierarchy than a stone but nonetheless everything in its own way is an image of reflection uh it takes on some element of God's form inverted Karma so that means that the word monocot means one who is alone and all of us call to be monarchy monastics in the sense that wherever I look if I look at Jonathan look at you look at look at look at a tree I'm seeing God in that you're not God but I see God coming through you so everything becomes iconographic so um and this is I think the essence of the Fall that I think it's Ephraim who suggests that the tree of knowledge God and Evil it's the whole created world and it will become knowledge of good for Adam and Eve I.E art if we give thanks for it so when you give thanks you see the person The Giver in that gift if I just grab that gift and turn my back then it becomes knowledge of evil becomes dead for you so this is why the Eucharist I think it's wonderful but the Central Christian Act is the Eucharist to give thanks that everything then is a means to be holding the Lord so then we're all living like monarchy monastics and that we're living alone with God in fact the whole universe is gathered in so with our look is the Lord well I like the word I've been teaching this class on the Virgin Mary and I like the verb kind of gathering and it sounds like from what you were saying a moment ago Jonathan that the Transfiguration of the clothing the matter were Were Meant to gather all of the creation of God and sort of Bring It Back give thanks kind of you know bring it back to God so all of these things God created at this point in time but they're meant to be gathered and brought back in a and then therefore thereby participate in this in this Glory see that did help me right because as a as a young person well what's the alternative to that well you use things and you do things but it's completely unrelated to your March towards God right you just go towards God in your head but all these things that you're interacting with nature objects Etc that's sort of Superfluous to the spiritual journey and what I hear you saying is no no no all of those things are part of our spiritual journey they don't have a soul they don't have a noose but we're meant to gather we're meant to to Steward and to appreciate the presence the creation of God and all of matter and and Steward that gather it bring it back to him and that to me was very moving to think that that's a that's a beautiful way to think about life rather than um using and throwing away or consuming just for pleasure that all of these things can can come together so I guess in the time that we have left I wondered if you know if you could share with me what this Feast means to you or what the Transfiguration means to you I mean was there a moment in time when you asked yourself like what really is the meaning of the Transfiguration what does this look like in my life why do I need to to meditate on this or to ponder this particular feast I mean I I think that there Christ in the the gospels there are moments in his story and each moment reveals an aspect of the mystery that Christ is uh you know and so to me the the the trans I see in some way the Transfiguration the crucifixion is almost kind of standing in contrast with each other there's here's this moment of where Christ is revealed in his divinity through a kind of Glory through a you know really using all the symbolism of the Old Testament all the symbolism of the of the glory of God the Shekinah all these all this this imagery is brought there um and then you have this other contrasting images where the glory of God the glory of Christ is actually being shown on the cross as well but in a very strange inverted and and hidden way um and so to me you know I I love that I like there's something about have it holding those two stories in tension which I think is important for us you know in terms of even in terms of the liturgical artists for example and so we we understand that the beauty of the church right the beauty of all the things that we make you know the the frescoes the mosaics all of this is in some ways a participation in the in the in the Transfiguration uh and so and that we're called to kind of hold these two things in tension you know one which is the self-sacrifice one which is the the helping the poor to care for those in need to to kind of give ourselves to empty ourselves for others but then there's also the possibility and the importance of celebrating that glorious aspect we're all creation comes together and celebrates God uh you know and so so so to me the image of the Transfiguration as a as an artist is is in some ways a Guiding Light to say like no there is this possibility of of participating in that and and like you said Gathering the elements Gathering bits of wood bits of gold bits of stone and and being able to to to hopefully offer something up so that it participates in that process oh that's beautiful John and let me see if I heard what you're saying that for you and your vocation is to be a liturgical artist you make sculptures you do design you iconographic that the image of the Transfiguration the meaning of the Feast of the Transfiguration in some ways is like it gives meaning to your vocation or gives inspiration that what you're doing as an icon Carver an iconographer you're taking created material and you're working with it and putting it together in ways that participate even further in the glory of God and it gives meaning is that you hope someone's the anchor it's it's it's part of the anchor of what makes a liturgical artist do what they do at least for me is this idea of kind of stewarding and Gathering the materials and then creating an image that's kind of bringing creation back to God in an act of Thanksgiving I liked very much what you said that part of our calling as people of faith is to serve the poor and to care for the needy but we're also called to to gather and to co-create with God and to make beautiful things that give Glory that that celebrate celebrate yeah that lead us into this place of rejoicing and celebrating that God's presence has come into the world and therefore matter has been can be Sanctified and can be gathered and brought back I think that goes beyond liturgical artists right for any kind of vocation for anyone working in the world doing anything like this is so inspiring because otherwise you know then your faith and your work are just completely separate from each other so that's that's a very inspiring message thank you what about for you Aiden uh as you're talking I was thinking perhaps there are three things face community and matter I think I sort of nominally raised an Anglican but never really had a conscious Faith but when I was 15 um I had a conversion experience as this man was speaking about the faith I saw a face full of light but also they were there was a crowd behind there were people behind and this is what converted me so it was the face of Christ but also it wasn't just him isolated and that sort of entered my heart and I've sort of measured everything against that in a way so when I encountered the Transfiguration icon there you have it the face of Christ but not alone um but being an artist I started off as a Baptist which I really loved I got to know the scripture as well but I felt matters hasn't really got a place here the material world it sort of does not mentioned really so my journey kept going uh and and when I discovered the icon tradition and the Orthodox affirmation of the material world when I saw the Transfiguration icon and started reading about the theology I realized ah no I've got the face of Christ got the community of the church here's Mata transfigured you were describing this process of of taking god-given matter up and making it even more articulate in the worship of God that artistic process here it's all in the Transfiguration icon so that's why the idea of Christ Garmin being Cosmos means a lot so much to me the garments aren't just raw Flags someone has taken the flanks span it woven it so here this idea of man as prophet priest and King and I understand kingship is like an artist like Jonathan's got to be master of his stereotype and he's carving it but he's not master to crush it and grind it he's master of it to raise that hunk of inanimate Stone to become the face of Christ so kingship to me is the kingship of an artist to to make creation more articulate and the praise of God so that's what the transformation says for me that's very inspiring and I know we'll hear more from you on priest prophet and King in your lecture tomorrow at the pts and Scholar Foundation conference and you know Jonathan I wanted I wondered if you could just give us a few minutes uh just a few words really what are you speaking about tomorrow at the scholarship friends like pts well actually it has a little bit to do with what we're saying you know there's something about uh especially modern especially Contemporary Art there's a sense in which the artist is there to question right the artist is there to to to poke at the system and to to uh to try to break you know the structures that are are there and what I want to explore tomorrow is how traditional art and how especially liturgical art is in some ways there to celebrate and to bring together and to kind of build identities and so we're going to look at that the dangers of that also there are dangers in that and so we're going to try to look at in scripture and how it all it all kind of comes together in the person of Christ like most stories so that's great great and you know as I mentioned at the start uh The Scholar foundation's mission is to restore culture through liberal arts education Beauty and worship and this event that we that I've put together this weekend is going to bring together artists with Educators with Scholars to experience the beauty of the campus here at Princeton Theological Seminary the University Chapel Sacred Music and I wondered if you could comment on what was it that attracted you to be a part of Scholar's Mission what do you find about Scholar's mission that made you interested in being a part of this I mean you know I think the world is hungry for exactly the things you mentioned you know people are are heavy because the world is quite ugly especially in America in Europe you have more luck than we do we have more chance than we do you know the the suburbs this plastic World in which we live and also this world of consuming I think it it in some ways it's sad but it also is a kind of a hunger and people are looking for meaning and looking for beauty and so if we can help people move in that direction it's wonderful great well I would encourage everybody watching this to look at Aiden Hart's website Aiden heart icons they're beautiful images wonderful essays please do check out his books beauty matter in the sacred also his Book Festival icons which was really easy
