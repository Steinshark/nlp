ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Qatar Masters 2023 this is a ridiculously strong chess tournament and this is the final recap after today I will tell you who is the winner and we will conclude all of the crazy story lines of this event one of which is the fact that Magnus Carlson has not played up to the level that we have seen over the last decade plus before we jump into today's

to the video we begin in round number eight my friends with Magnus Carlson and Gregory kaidanov this is magnus's bounceback game after suffering a setback against the Indian Grandmaster uh murali kikan young 20-year-old and I mean it's really been Magnus against a bunch of very strong Indian players but in round eight he plays Gregory kaidanov who actually just took down uh Jordan van forest and we're seeing if Magnus can make a comeback to go to a comeback though he plays a London a very interesting opening Choice C5 E3 the players go to a Mainline position after E6 Knight F3 and now kaidanov takes on D4 and plays Knight H5 this line got very popular several years ago it was played by Wesley so I think for the first time uh and basically Black's idea is to hit this bishop and then put the Knight on F4 right so and white really should not put the bishop on D3 because that plays directly into the hands of uh black and normally white plays Knight E5 hitting the Knight black plays G6 very complicated position ensues Magnus though just says play your idea just play it go ahead Knight F4 take take castles castles congrats you got my Bishop I'm so I'm so happy for you you got the bishop on F4 isn't that everything you wanted well your Bishop is bad right your Bishop is stuck behind your E Pawn I'm going to secure control over E5 so you can't play E5 then then I'm going to take space on the queen side so Magnus plays Rook E1 and Knight B3 trying to put the Knight on C5 Gregory says no and now Magnus does exactly what I said takes Pace on the queen side kaidanov plays F6 a very KY move everything is well protected white can't play Knight E5 and maybe black is preparing E5 himself Queen C7 Rook E8 everything in Black's position is poised to set up this move E5 in the future G3 kicking out the bishop and Magnus continuing to fire away at at kidon of's position so that he cannot play E5 right again this is everything that black wants but after cd5 and queen C4 black would just be losing so he can't do that so it takes Queen C4 konov plays Queen D6 very tense position it's just Magnus and a bunch of pieces on the sixth rank Magnus trying to move forward as best as he possibly can here Rook to A6 and now Magnus plays a brilliancy it looks like he's been completely thwarted he can't hit here here he can't go here taking here would simply be bad because you would be giving up a bishop and then you would trade everything and you would have no Advantage Magnus finds a very nice idea here Knight to C5 a move that looks completely impossible and this move is like stepping on the gas because now Magnus is hitting everything if you take this Knight I take your queen is hanging right so let's say you just slide it back Bishop C6 and at the end E6 is falling so if Queen E7 it's even worse you just lose the Knight for nothing so kaidon here strikes in the center Knight takes D4 now the knights see each other the queen sees this the queen sees this the Knight sees the bishop the bishop sees the bishop the bishop sees that bishop and the pawn sees the Knight and so does the queen take take Magnus slides in Rook A7 hitting that bishop and that pawn on E6 looking mighty loose now B4 forcing the queen to make a decision a lot of pressure being applied here by Magnus Knight on C6 but kaidanov is doing a very nice job defending himself this man is 64 by the way like that is ridiculously impressive because at 64 the cognition mentally for chess is just really not there I mean he is definitely the strongest 60-year-old Grandmaster in the world this man is keeping close all right but look at Magnus I mean just a juggernaut of 53 minutes on the clock that man was ready to get out of there and go do whatever you do on in Qatar at 6 PM I I I don't know restaurant uh what do you do in Qatar at 6 p.m Rook D1 Rook A4 and Magnus just smooth sailing that pawn is a passer and it takes him a little while to configure his pieces but a very nice tactic if Rook takes there's back rank Checkmate on A8 Rook E7 take take and Magnus converts this very nicely up the bishop ready to take the rest of the pawns and get out of here with this guy now this was magnus's comeback this is the intro to the video while that was going on uh and uh I think we just got a Windows uh notification noise I do apologize for that sometimes that happens in these Recaps sometimes I see it come across the screen and I don't hear it and I'm like wait a minute now I'm going to go check my my OB yeah I I I do apologize your computers are all fine um hearu meanwhile is also playing uh and hikaro is not making any comeback hikaro is just trying to win the entire event he's playing against V pranav uh better known in the Chess World as buddy I don't know uh that nickname I think came from uh back when he would play many many games of Chess against the chess Bross Eric Hansen Amon Hamilton so they called him buddy because they're Canadian and they're nice um and this was a very sharp line from Hikaru uh this is actually the the line seen in the game uh sua versus Carlson some of you might remember I think sulov played Knight F3 in that game Magnus played Knight C6 and then sulov developed his pieces and launched the devastating attack in this game we have Knight B3 F3 and now this position where hikaro has two Bishops and a very pleasant space Advantage now how is hiara going to try to win this game slowly but surely B4 crawling forward into the position opening things up against the Buddy V pranav take take Rook is active Hikaru is upon down with significant pressure on the queen side the Knight now has to gallop into the black into the white position Hikaru pushes pav back the Knight goes 2 E8 the bishop undeveloped and now Black's Knight is trapped so now pav is going to have to go crazy D4 trying to save his pieces Rook C6 trying to defend his Bishop F6 hikaro provoking massive weaknesses but now the Knight can get out Rook A1 if you take on C4 hikaro is going to get in on A7 at some point there it is Rook A7 but still a very tense position Rook D7 he call finds Rook A8 and F4 trying to go forward for his Bishop position looks on the verge of utter collapse but Bishop takes Bishop Queen takes now we're looking for this peraf plays Rook to D5 cutting that off Hikaru finds Bishop F2 but the better move here was Bishop G5 a ridiculous move which would have sealed the rook's vision of H5 FG would have led to Queen H5 and Knight takes G5 and F takes G5 whatever to start some sort of attack so now Bion back to to and now here pava is actually back into the game but only has 30 seconds plays Knight C4 and now Bishop takes D4 same idea different execution you cannot take this because my queen would get to H5 and then I would play uh any variety of moves here wins the game but something like Queen H6 and then if King G8 I have Knight F6 if King F7 I have Queen H7 so a very nice tactical shot from Hikaru massive scramble extremely tense game hikaro picks up the queen Prav resigns and hiar is in contention to win the Qatar Masters he's got to win with black in the last round and Magnus Meanwhile my friends I don't really know how to uh preface this what you are about to see is going to terrify you we are in one of two eras we are either in really truly the era of saying goodbye to Magnus Carlson in class chess because he's still winning most speed events that he's playing um or we are just in the era of Indian chess period like the next 20 years are going to be dominated by Indian Grand Masters um it's just exceptional stuff so Magnus ends his tournament with a ninth round game against abanu Panik another 20-some year old Grandmaster from India which you've may not heard of panic I have uh I I've known about Panic for many years and mag plays this line A6 B5 Knight A5 this a very provocative line in the uh Ru Lopez and essentially black says I'm going to get your bishop and give away my Pawn in the center sabotaging my own development okay Magnus played This I Believe In the first game of the World Chess Championship Match um against uh yanomi if I'm not mistaken I might be mistaken now PUK plays D4 which is the best move Pawn takes Queen takes setting a trap C5 looks like it's going to trap the bishop but Bishop takes F7 and queen takes Queen to D5 check is just winning for white so we have here and look at look at how much development puran gets look at this this is really provocative stuff by Magnus I mean really provocative stuff Knight to D5 by Panik I mean he is already knocking on the door ready to collect Magnus thinks for a little plays the ridiculous this move is so ugly Rooks a G8 that is one of the ugliest but I mean that that move is so ugly you can't even Castle now and and but it's kind of forced say why is it Force why can't black just like play you know F6 cuz then he's going to take and you can't go here cuz that's Checkmate and like what else do you do if you play Pawn to C6 Knight takes F6 Knight to F6 check and then Bishop takes F7 and queen F6 and if you don't take if you go here then just Bishop takes F6 or queen takes F6 and The Rook is trapped Magnus has to play Rook to G8 and puranic doesn't even slow down he just plays C4 Magnus kicks out the bishop look at this is one of the most absurd positions Magnus has ever had take take take he doesn't take back he goes long castles magnus's King is in the center pawns just standing all over the place he now has to manually walk his King to safety Queen C4 but the worst does seem over and Magnus is now consolidating and now we are going to get a glimpse at that signature style that Magnus plays in which is like outmaneuvering opponents in these kind of obscure positions all right Bishop to C3 H5 played here by black trying to mess around if Pawn takes H5 you get something to the H file you activate the queen as well very nice move but puran just on it I mean Rook to G1 it would have actually even been better to play G5 or H3 but he plays Rook to G1 because now he senses that his Rook is going to get in the game so Magnus plays G5 this is one of the weirdest positions I have ever seen Magnus never gets into positions that look like this it's the risk that he's willing to take to try to win some of these games Queen to F5 and there it is Magnus is now officially taking over massive Advantage pawn to G4 the bishop is going to go to H6 it's going to snipe on on that diagonal The Rook has the entire file this is under pressure the queen is hitting everybody everything is happening uh in magnus's favor Bishop to H6 9 minutes remaining for white this is vintage Magnus Carlson taking over the game here now he's going to continue to apply the pressure all he has to do he's going to take this Pawn then he's going to reroute his Bishop to F5 and it is easy look at these just absolute laser beams the bishop the bishop the queen but Magnus takes the Knight and then he plays Rook E5 which definitely secures the pawn it's definitely going to secure the pawn fine he wants to do it this way Panik tries to sneak in right he tries to sneak in with his Queen Magnus undevelop his bishop and now he's ready to take on D5 Rook gg3 now Magnus can take on F2 he can maybe take on D5 or he tries to take the entire file but now Queen A4 and this and in that way he gets the pawn on A6 Magnus takes on D5 the time is now equal and panic has won all the important Pawns in Black's position oh my goodness Magnus blunders with Bishop to C4 and now we're in a rook and Bishop end game but it's white who is two pawns up I'm not sure if you were tracking this but when we were here panak has been up a pawn most of the game Magnus needed to take one back he had to take one back this was his moment Queen H5 he would have been up no pawns but instead of hitting the pause button and just taking a pawn Magnus just kept trying to instigate and now he's in an end game two pawns down he's going to lose this game he plays Rook to d8 King to C1 Rook to D4 and he's just doing his best but after Rook D2 Rook C4 all mag can hope to achieve here is a draw that's it he is just completely at the end of his wits this is just going to become a queen the only chance that black has is to activate his pieces and to bully the white king along the back rank if black can land a rook here it would be Checkmate that's not going to happen King to C6 abanu plays A3 his King is never getting mated now unbelievable turn EV EV Rook to G8 Rook to G3 Rook to E8 and now he's got to run his King but Rook B8 and and and the the Deep supercomputers here were were saying that this position is drawable for black very very complicated draw very unclear game um you see this stockfish doesn't even understand what it what is supposed to happen in this position it just thinks you know this is equal but now it's thinking that it's winning see it can't it can't make up its mind Rook to E8 apparently this is still drawable if you play King to B6 if you just sit and wait that apparently is the draw Rook C2 I don't exactly know why maybe because of Rook F5 maybe because of Rook F1 check Rook F5 you would think the pawn can just go to H6 so I don't it's like ridiculously deep analysis here where the computer somehow is showing uh you know maybe some surviving chances for black Magnus goes here which apparently is a losing move apparently that's a losing move and here the evaluation showed plus 10 now nobody knows it's plus 10 super computer knows it's plus 10 human doesn't so aamanu just needs to not get mated he's offering a rook trade because if you trade Rooks it's over the pawn just goes you block it I bring my king Rook F3 and now H6 look at this this is unbelievable pan is two moves away from beating Magnus Carlson King to A4 and now White had to go here here you had to walk into a check go here so that Black's King cannot enter black would have gone like Rook D3 now if you play H7 it's a draw Rook E1 and Rook B3 so you can't play H7 just yet apparently there are some other winning ideas here like Rook D2 Rook C3 King D1 and using the Rook as a shield for your king to try to play H7 it's unbelievable and then you can play like Rook F2 and you're trying to stop this if Rook D3 now now here and you win so puranik had to use his Rook as a shield for his King instead he goes here and magnus's king gets in and now because the king is so close the game is going to end in a draw because Magnus has so many threats Panic has all these pawns flying down the board but Magnus is going to going to win them he's going to win the pawns and the B Pawn is far but it's not far enough King C4 Rook B8 and the players agree to with draw as Magnus is going to save the day oh my goodness and so concludes Magnus Carlson's worst classical chess tournament in I don't know how many years I like that is not an exaggeration that is not clickbait I think his total performance rating was 2,650 which is not anything to laugh at for the average player but this is Magnus Carlson we're talking about so crazy stuff absolutely crazy he's down to 2,820 something I mean like what a wild time I mean just two things right Magnus suffering In classical chess the Indian players he played seven out of nine Indians and they fought this man it's like a chess anime Magnus defeats vishwanathan Anan for the World Chess Championship in 2013 then he beats him again in 2014 and vishy the first ever Indian chess Grand Master trains the entire future generation puranik kakan gesh prananda Nial sarin arji ruk sadani you name it they are all coming crazy it's really like a chess anime now who's going to win the tournament how about that if Magnus is not going to win the tournament who's going to win the tournament nck yakobo versus morali kikian morali just beat Magnus we have a Kings Indian defense the winner of this game will win the tournament or tie for first it's a king's Indian defense symmetrical structure and nck gives away his dark squared Bishop he does that to have a pass D pawn and to isolate Black's Bishop behind his own Pawn now ner Beck is going to transfer his pieces that way and look at that look at this is so instructive he straight up plays Bishop takes Knight this is a very very very highlevel positional move that looks really really dumb the point is if you didn't do that black was going to plant his Knight on D6 and from there the Knight would exert a lot of pressure on White's position so Knight D6 and F5 would happen as well in the future in the future so this is a really high level move and nerb has kept the position completely closed look at him go look at him go and expand into the black territory look at this Rook A7 you can't take the Knight Queen B3 slowly but surely defending himself attacking now black tries to fire back kakon gets kicked out of the position Queen to D1 now look at this move Bishop to G4 all the Queens are hanging sacrifices his Bishop take take take the position is actually still in Black's favor because if you do the math white lost the Knight on C4 Pawn takes Knight Queen D1 and when everything is said and done it is white who is still down upon Pawn but his look at black structure it looks like dominoes all right and I'm not talking about the pizza now look at this Knight Galloping to eat one of these pawns it's going to take one at least here comes kagon but Rook A2 and caragan has to sacrifice his Rook because it's literally trapped look at this it gets trapped in a cage so if he doesn't white is going to go here here here or here here F3 and my friends nir Beck yakobo is the first finalist in the Qatar Masters 2023 this man wins a brilliant positional game right at the end of the event with the white pieces 2616 Yoko yakobov is already a Olympic champion with usbekistan and he takes down karthikan who just took down Magnus so by the laws of syllogism no that's not how that works and now he awaits the the winner of this game and my friends when I tell you that this game had one of the most heartbreaking finishes you will ever see in chess I am not exaggerating nobe Abdu sator of arji it is an English opening it immediately becomes a Queen's Gambit decline triangle defense E4 the Marshall Gambit take take Bishop B4 check Bishop D2 giving up a pawn in the center and giving up a knight with check but a very sharp position arises black has taken two pawns two pawns Bishop F3 Queen G5 and it is white who early on is still in his prep aragi plays E5 Queen B3 played instantly by Abdu satov castles played by aragi after 18 minutes of thought noer Beck in one minute responds age four we have went 12 13 moves into an extremely sharp and aggressive line but Nock emerges H4 the queen has to retreat to defend the Knight the Knight comes in instantly the queen has to slide over ner backck long castles 16 minutes 16 moves rather have been played nearly instantly now he plays Rook G1 lining up a rook directly onto Black's King Knight F5 played by aragi who is now down 26 minutes on the clock Bishop to H5 a huge amount of pressure mounting the Knight tries to cut off the circulation the queen slides over no your back F4 bringing everybody oh my goodness aragi is definitely on the ropes C5 he's losing a pawn in the center of the board but he's bringing in his other Knight the queen slides all the way back now the queen is going to be traded it's a very very tough spot for nerc who sacrifices his Rook takes the Knight comes in with check oh my goodness the Queens are having a staring contest noirre grabs the second Knight but Rook takes E5 so suddenly the white pieces are in the situation where you can't really go forward anymore and a queen trade will end your attack but there's not much else you can do Bishop goes back to D1 he's trying to attack with the H Pawn the bishop tries to hit the Rook Eric iy says go ahead what he's giving up the Rook because then he's going to go here and despite this cannon pointed at his King there is nothing useful oh my goodness Knight to G4 ERI down 40 minutes trying to find all of this he gets the Queens off the board Rook F1 Bishop F1 and now Against All Odds arigi has survived the worst and if arigi draws this game he is the clear leader of the tournament heartbreaking stuff for Nock who was up nearly like 40 50 minutes on the clock with such a massive attack and the attack has been extinguished arjin arayi escapes like Houdini now he's just got to bring his King to the middle you are never getting checkmated with this little material and that's it I mean two Bishops can beat a rook but not when there's the same exact pawns it's just not possible Right like these pawns are never going to get through those pawns and on top of that this is an outside pass Pawn sorry this is an outside Pawn if you trade that pawn uh for example if you sacrifice The Rook for that Bishop in certain positions the game just ends because the promotion square is not the right color as this dark squore Bishop so that might have been very complicated that's why this happens now all every gu he has to do is sack The Rook for that Bishop I'll give you an example Bishop E5 Rook E3 this is a ah wrong Bishop wrong Bishop wrong wrong wrong Bishop R that's the wrong Bishop been a long day this would this would be a draw it has to not be the color corner and then you run to the corner my friend this game ends in three moves with King F4 Rook H2 and in this position with 18 minutes on the clock arjin regi blunders a rook not only does he blunder The Rook he loses the tournament because nck ties for first place so Nock wins the Qatar Masters 2023 is the biggest plot twist because two ncks are tied for first nck yakobo and nck Abdul sator of just tied for first instant replay one of the most shocking blunders I've ever seen Rook to H4 he just straight up forgot about that just he played 10 days of Chess eight amazing rounds he had six and a half points out of eight he just spent four hours playing this game one move changes everything I mean chess is so it's so gut-wrenching it's so awful it's so horrible um now we have a playoff for first place yakobo versus Abdu satov Abdu satov yakobov it's an Italian it's a closed maneuvering game it's a blitz playoff to determine who is going to be the guar Masters 2023 Champion the Olympic teammates nor your back nice and steady position we go directly to an end game Knight bishop and a rook I can't even say nerb because they're both nerb that's extremely confusing A4 Abdu satov poking winning a pawn in the center and plays Knight to C3 the position's balanced but yaku yakubov has some more pawns on the king side and they both have less than 10 seconds so they just spent you know 10 days in Qatar trying to win this tournament it's Knights and Bishops and they have they're going to determine who's going to win this event with 5 Seconds on the clock in a ridiculous scramble in this position I think uh I think Abdus sator blundered that this was a check otherwise I'm not really sure what happened there he blundered that it was a check and uh a couple of moves later he loses the other pawn and he's just up a pawn in a he's up two Pawns in a bishop end game yakob boev so King D6 and uh just King King D7 or King C6 and and and abdulov just resigns because you're not going to be able to defend against two pass pawns he just lost with white so now he has to win this game but Nock is on Pace to win this tournament I love being able to say that because they're both named nck like that almost never happens uh Abdu satov does his best he tries and he tries and he tries but yakobov just too solid look at this the knight's Galloping look at this FL Rook takes he six sacrificing the rook and getting the pawn on C7 the bishop slides back the Queens are traded but white has too many pawns he has a knight and two pawns he goes in with his Knight Abdu sator doing his best and he's got a lot of time he's got a minute and 25 yakobo have 13 seconds on the clock but he has no weaknesses the Knight is going to D4 and now look at this effortless rook and Bishop he's up two pawns again Rook D4 Rook D7 and in this position Bishop takes D3 the final move of the guitar Masters 2023 your Champion nir Beck yakobo 2616 F that's it I'm not even sure he's in the top 100 of the world I got to go look this up what rank is nck yakobo in the world I I I don't actually know top 100 he he's probably top 100 yaku is he not he's not not he's not even in the top 100 he's like number 200 in the world yakob boev no is like top 20 top 15 and he's the winner and this is the incredible thing about this event so many people gained like 20 25 points Magnus nearly lost three games to people rated 25 and 2600 so what is happening are we seeing a decline in interest and ability from the best player of the last years and maybe ever are we seeing a rise in the Young Generation and the fact that those players don't get to play a whole lot of tournaments against these top players is top chess a bubble which Theory are you subscribed to the qar Masters 2023 is in the books hikaro finishing in a tie for second place he wasn't shown because he drew his last round game against SL Nan he will recap his own game uh very tough for him because he he had to win with black it's not so simple to win with black at this level um what a crazy tournament and um yeah we have two more months of 2023 there will be some very very fun chess events coming up including the launch of my book in four days that's a major chess event so if you haven't signed up for the in-person fan events in New York City you should consider doing that uh but that's all I have for you today my friends you know the drill get out of here
