[Music] this is not productive enough [Music] what [Music] by seuss's beard three monitors in one portable package my dreams have come true or so i thought it's true that i've wanted something like this for a long time and after seven years a stolen razor prototype and a sleazy kickstarter that has allegedly ripped off backers for nearly 650 000 and counting someone finally did it they finally stepped up to actually deliver what appears to be on the surface the ultimate road warrior productivity tool but is clumsy just their name or is the product kind of clumsy too i know it's not as clumsy as this segue to our sponsor build redux they make it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help you along the way and they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a pc yourself so why not head to buildredux.com linus and start your new build today [Music] i'd forgive you for thinking that the clumsy p2 pro triple monitor is a scam because it wouldn't be the first it's story time ladies and gentlemen five years ago at ces the team from slide and joy gave me a demonstration of their much-hyped le slide and young naive linus believed that they were a legitimate company and he was excited to see the slide come to market since then slide enjoy has missed every production deadline they've set for themselves they've undergone a rebrand to portable probably in an effort to cover up their troubled history and they've provided precious little evidence that they've ever actually shipped anything to an end user oh and it gets worse their kickstarter page features years of complaints about delays and on their website we've got this review page with pictures of happy customers except that almost all of them are taken with the founders in the same house slash office this one's a duplicate as for the independent media coverage oops none of those logos actually link anywhere probably because any old coverage of these guys has been updated with warnings like this one and they are still taking people's money and funneling it into viral marketing stunts on social media how do we know because they stupidly reached out to one of our sister channels techlinked offering us 20 euros per conversion that's a pretty bad offer considering how much they're obviously keeping the cherry on top is they even admitted they have no stock of it not even a demo unit so that we could see in person what we were promoting and it's because of butt heads like these guys that we're no longer able to cover crowdfunding campaigns that takes important promotion away from honest people who are actually trying to solve problems for their users problems like not having enough pockets in your hoodie when hoodies now in stock on all sizes lttstore.com scammers aside razer's project valerie was another cool attempt at this idea but it was allegedly stolen from their booth at ces 2017 and razer made it clear at the time that it was more of a proof of concept rather than a real product that was then though this is now clumsy's p2 pro has its own sketchiness to overcome like the fact that an apparently identical product from offiah also exists but at least they managed to ship us one so let's take a look at it and here it is we shot this out of order so this is my first actual hands-on with this thing qualm zp2 pro they got a bit of a kerning issue here um it's more like the k1z try screen notebook expansion screen presentation mode portrait mode triple screen mode it does exactly what those rip-off artists promised that their product would do i couldn't help noticing it's really heavy oh okay it's 1080p 60hz 1000-1 contrast ratio 16x9 13.3 inches oh okay comes in some kind of plastic leather carrying case oh okay this isn't packaging this is just to cart the thing around with with you we've got a usb type a wall board this puppy is good for 5 volts 3 amps so it's a total of 15 watts that'll probably be enough to drive both of these panels a type c to type c a dual type a to type c this is a lot of cables we actually have two of these type c to type c's what they did is to cover their bases it's like if you don't have usb-c power delivery you might need two usb-c ports if you don't have two usb-c ports then you can use two usb a ports and a usb-c port oh no just two-way or and a usb-c port oh i see for a random product from a manufacturer i've never heard of before this is actually a surprisingly decent quick start guide oh there's a micro sd reader in here well that's cool is why is there a card in here is this just a placeholder no that has data on it this has data on it this is how they give you the display drivers you need drivers for it kinda should i try and hook this up and see what happens yeah let's do that oh boy uh okay got a little kickstand on there you can adjust the angle like that i know you mentioned this to me already adam it is 13.3 inch compatible specifically 13.3 inches no more no less well some more some more you can make it you can make it a lot bigger it supports up to oh you can make it bigger supports up to some 17 inch oh i see oh i lied again look at that all right we got our one cable solution hopefully so here's if we have power delivery i'm hoping for power delivery here okay oh p2 pro oh it's really dim do they advertise a brightness spec on the box it says 220 nits that seems optimistic and this is the part where i'm supposed to figure out how to actually get it to operate i guess then because i do not see the um sd card i'll figure it out and this has got to be just a one time thing okay but no maybe the pd port is just for power in okay i'm gonna i'm gonna assume that type c then okay i'm trying the type c port how about now but okay it's a little heavy a little clumsy you might say all right my usb drive is here driver download address text document just in the interest of uh time i installed the drivers on one computer they didn't do anything oh really oh so how do i get it working sometimes it's just a matter of is that is that for sure power delivery port i mean this says smi usb display like and that's what the drivers would be it's just smi you also don't need to use the sd card they do have drivers available on their website but they do take you to a google drive okay you say i don't need the drivers but it's not working without the driver so i do need the drivers are you in a power delivery usb port well i don't know does i have a little lightning bolt buy it no maybe you should try both try both or it might just not work because they're a chinese company and a small one their documentation is very lacking and also it's a niche product so you don't hear many people going on forums trying to solve it right i definitely need that driver like it's it's showing up and i'm prompted for a windows 11 oh it's on all three screens i didn't even notice i was so busy being like no i don't want windows 11 right now well that's awesome they're really dim and they don't dim and brighten which i didn't expect them to to be very clear you can adjust the brightness with the on-screen display oh so there's controls at the top is that what the plus i don't even understand what i'm doing here the controls are pretty unintuitive yeah wow brightness does not seem to be actually changing panel backlight intensity it seems that's the image adjusting the gamma yeah that's the gamma if you scroll down to the bottom of this menu oh it doesn't change is that the joke oh oh wait eventually it does hold on eventually it does when you get into like the last 20 it does actually change meaningfully how do i exit this menu you just wait for it to time out they advertise 207 degrees of rotation but that that's that's coming from the back right which is super frustrating because this is really wide and just bringing it in like 5-10 degrees makes it take up so much less space the viewing angles are also not amazing these are not a matching 13-inch size are they oh actually you know what i think it is i think it's this is a inch but it's a 16 by 10 so there's just a little bit of confusion there that also explains why you're having a bit of a better experience my laptop because it's 16x9 this bezel ends up digging into the ground and like making it so like i can't easily manipulate it which is really frustrating 16 by 10 life man yeah it's a good one you should have chosen better everything is solved in my currency yeah yeah neither can we there is a solution actually to the dimness really but it's not clearly labeled in their manual right why would it be it is on their website though now when i was testing i only got 93 nits for peak brightness uh-huh and i was like clearly not right yeah they promised 220. i thought maybe it's 90 190 plus 90 is a high it's 180 it's closer get in there what you actually need to do is plug in both cables no so it'll work with just one as long as you're in the dark yeah there we go two cable solution not ideal but not bad i mean it's certainly usable okay cool so i got my excel over here i'm you know managing my home assistant thing here like that is a freaking lot of screen real estate for a laptop is it a little clumsy yeah and we haven't even tried to pack it up yet he already made that joke i know but it's a good it's a funny joke when it comes time to pack it up you know what i say about this i say don't hate because no one else is doing it better this actually does not take that long to pack up they've got a nice little some kind of i don't know like a suede alcantara to be clear i'm not saying it's either of those materials it's probably something much cheaper but it's they've got a thing on there okay unlikely to damage the screen got this boy here nowhere to really stow all the cables you're gonna need that's a bit of an oversight but hey realistically you've got a bag you're carrying this thing around in with your laptop anyway yeah late 90s form factor but very 2020s real estate one thing to note is that this will not be easy on your battery we tested it on our 17 17 msi creator z16p yeah and it cut the battery from 30 like by 33 like you lost of like a couple hours of battery life with a laptop like that if you weren't plugged in anyway you were going to have a pretty clummy experience linus isn't here yet so i'm going to use this time to air my grievances these aren't damning but something that manufacturers should consider if they make a v2 and please make a v2 i want this to be great one have the screens flip vertically so that i can close them into the case without having them exposed during transport two increase the rotation of the hinge mechanism so i can bring the monitors in a little bit tighter three a reworker of the kickstand to be spring-loaded and having locking points would be great and finally brushed aluminum is a fingerprint magnet i don't like it and hopefully we can get better color calibration from the factory that would be the cherry on top hey linus we're ready for you great the elephant in the room is of course the fact that there are two brands clumsy and ophia advertising the same lineup of products there are actually a few potential explanations for this they could both be rebranding a product from a third-party oem they could be sister brands that share products kind of like if oppo and oneplus had two very similar or near identical phones or one of them could be acting as an odm so that's an original design manufacturer kind of like how foxconn builds iphones but those are designed by apple and then it could be that that manufacturer is then secretly selling that other company's design out the back door we don't know which of these situations is right it's all speculation but what we can say for sure is that clumsy has a pretty cool product on their hands it is actually real but the standard small company disclaimers do apply here the documentation as we saw is kind of lacking and we haven't tested their customer service but that's the risk that you take when you go with a brand that doesn't have an established presence in your particular region but hey at least they've made a better first impression than slide and joy right yeah yeah and i'm going to make a first impression for you with our sponsor epidemic sound
