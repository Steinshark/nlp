all right so I've never actually watched one of these videos these I quit Fang company after two months let's see why this guy quit after only 2 months cuz I'm not going to lie to you when I hear this I feel I it feels weak one time I got fired from a job because I refused to put away food that was set on a table back in so that we could serve it to other tables okay I'm just saying you got to have honor but let's see what happens here is this honor and we always talked about it in the sense that you have to be intense and in fact if you ever had to give up friendly in order to have intense we would do that so if we needed to be intense and combative we'd do that before we'd be not intense but it's an interesting phrase like just in general here's a PLL I I think this is actually a really good thought-provoking question to ask yourselves do you think that it's better to work with a bunch of nice people when we all know everybody's the same person on the inside right we're all not great we all think [ __ ] of each other and all that do you want to work with a bunch of plastic fake nice people or would you rather have people encouraged to speak what they think to your face I don't think I'm an [ __ ] like I'm not going to be mean to people but there's definitely like a you got to be careful when you think something's happening right you got to be like well you know I really see how you're feeling about the situation but have you considered alternative perspectives with whom do not circle around your unchangeable opinions it's just like you know there's there's these things that we all have to do that are very difficult I think I know it's just it's just it's just a very interesting thing I I I would love to try it just be in an office where I knew exactly where I stood with every last person there's always a douche but the thing is is that that douche still exists whether or not someone's speaking kind or not kind to you does that make sense like that douche is still talking [ __ ] about you I don't know I've been congratulated by my Candor and telling how it is so I guess that I'm uh I'm in a blacklist yeah maybe I mean I don't know I there's it's just a very interesting thing I would like to think about I think it'd be fun to try it out but I'm curious if it could last I think it would definitely select for a certain set of people I think whoever wants to live in that would thrive in that and whoever hates that would quit and so you would you I mean all companies self- select for some archetype of person and this would just be one of those archetype selectors I don't know interesting anyways let's keep I don't really talk about my personal life on here but if you followed the channel you know that I was unemployed then I made this YouTube channel then I got into Google and now I quit but I never really talked about why I was unemployed in the first place well the short answer is that after I graduated I actually accepted an offer from Amazon and I worked there for 2 months and then I quit I'll give a bit of backstory I grew up with my Mom this is what every guy looks like when he's alone I want you to know that okay this is every man's room when he lives by himself I mean the fact that he has a sheet on his bed that matches his pillowcase I'm actually pretty impressed right now I'm genuinely pretty impressed no blanket the man has no time for blanket or it's nicely placed on his lap right now my guess is it's on his lap also I would like to just do one more kind of call out here his bed is off the ground I'm just saying until I had a wife my bed never made it off the ground my bed never made it off the ground until until then okay I'm just throwing it on there it to it took a wife to lift a bed okay I know you might think it's strength that lifts the bed it's not strength okay that's not that's not the reason why beds are getting off the ground I like that $1,000 stand up books on the desk yeah you got this these beautiful books right here all right let's keep on going that's like a O'Reilly an O really book going on right here anyways let's keep on going by the way many respect already for this kid I I love I love this current situation okay he's focused okay he knows exactly what he wants he has that the the the oldfashioned dick mic in front of him he has that bed without a blanket on it MacBook strewn about I mean this is like I mean he has a he does he does have a a table or a table at the end so that's I mean that's impressive and two brothers my dad had uh drug problems and pretty much abandoned us and I mainly just wanted to like help my family we were poor and we definitely knew it I remember as a kid I was like playing outside and then I fell I looked down at my knee and it was bleeding and the first thought I had was damn my mom just bought me these pair of jeans and I already ripped them and I if that's not your first thought process you're not living that poor life I remember falling and ripping my stuff and thinking oh [ __ ] not the blood but like damn my my mom's going to be upset that I ruined the pants yeah I want to hire this dude I think I know this is good I love this mentality it's really good I wish my kids had this not in my stomach which the worst feeling now this isn't a Saab story I think some people spend their whole lives like looking for a purpose but I already had mine so when I was lucky enough to be the first in my family to go to college my goal was simple get a degree as quickly as possible so I can get a high-paying job and then help my family and I actually did that I got my CS degree I failed some interviews but I managed to get an offer from Amazon where I was supposed to make like 140k a year let's go and this is actually the backpack they gave me anybody who works at Amazon can probably confirm I think everybody gets this I put yo dude that was like the most sloppy hold up to the camera it was like bottom third of the screen I know you could do better okay okay I know you I know you could do better just get that crap on the screen like a sticker on it uh but other than that it's the same Amazon backpack when I got the offer I felt like a huge weight lifted for my shoulders this is what I worked my whole life for and it's finally going to pay off going in dude I remember when I got my first real job $50,000 a year damn it was so sweet I was so pumped hey that was my first real job a year yeah 50k a year dude it felt so good 10 sick days 15 vacation days damn it was so cool it was so I dude I I have never felt more amazing in my lifetime because I mean grew up as poor then I got I got a raised to 75 and after that it didn't feel nearly as impactful anytime I got any further raise raises beyond that it wasn't hugely impactful it was great I liked I mean I very appreciative every time but going from zero to 50 arguably was my biggest jump that was my biggest jump was from no money to money I was like oh my goodness I could I can eat yes no peanut butter sandwiches right yeah College to 50 was huge dude it felt so good 10 sick it I was definitely intimidated because it's like wow this is Amazon it's going to be a well-oiled engineering machine I joined I by the way I love this mentality okay can I get ones in the chat for those who have not started a full-time job anywhere yet ones in the chat for those who have not not started a full-time job anywhere yet lot of ones wow hey I encourage you guys like that the point of this stream is that I want you guys to feel like you can do it please pick something go deep with it okay become excellent become hirable I beg you that is what this stream has always been about okay now that we got that out of the way this next part's very important of those people that pressed one how many of you think that if you were to join Netflix you would join a well oiled incredible amazingly Talent ented Place press one can I give you a little secret about Google about Amazon about Facebook about Microsoft about any of those places it's all horseshit okay you know what it sucks everywhere good news is is everywhere you go it sucks so don't worry like just just remember that it's all [ __ ] shows it's all [ __ ] shows everywhere software is extremely hard it's more of a shock that any software Works ever anywhere than anything else oh thank you beautiful wife she even said sorry handing me this she didn't have to say that the Alexa org there were four experienced Engineers on the team and like five or six new grads had just joined including me and one of the first things my manager said to me was the team is a little burnt out so try not to ask questions now oh [ __ ] who says that just can we just take a pause here for a second this has to be the manager of the year I want you just to replay what he just said in your head for a second there were four senior people there was five or six new hires hey new hires don't ask the people any questions they're kind of burnt out why the hell would you put six new people on a team like what is your goal he got Amazon so hard so Chad for those that uh don't know Amazon is Infamous for being absolute stress trash fire yeah it's one of the reasons why it just won't work at Amazon like I I personally will not work at Amazon twitch I hear is different but I will not do that I just won't usually I don't mind a challenge but for some reason this was different I had like so much anxiety just trying to read my screen like I could not concentrate I felt like something in my brain broke like the glue that was holding everything together was just coming apart even tasks that were like trivial for me in the past just felt like impossible my entire life I never had an experience like this one I swear I felt like I was on fire and I would do anything to make it stop and I recently had an extremely challenging life situation come up just recently very very challenging in which I would consider some level of Injustice happened and Injustice is very difficult I feel like because it you want to be right and I will tell you this much that when you're presented with a situation in which you feel very upset and angry and all those things you really do you should push through that and be and and get through it you know when I hear this I don't hear oh those are good reasons to quit as of right now right now what I hear is this is a good place to learn how to become extremely resilient now I'm not saying stay there for a long time break through that difficulty then go get a new job to me when I hear these things I get encouraged to try to push through and just like just a few months ago extremely difficult situation I never really brought up much and I haven't talked about any of it on and I really really really hated it I'm not an optimist I'm a realist the more challenging a situation you can go through the better you're going to be at life life's an RPG there's a bunch of stats we all have and if you choose you just choose to train whatever stats you want some people just lean way too hard into the Comfort stat okay I don't want to I don't want to lean into the Comfort stat sucky stuff accelerates growth it's a fact and it's horrible and it's awful and I wish it upon nobody I wish there's a way I didn't have to go through horrible stuff to gain emotional resilience who's going to carry the boats really if you want physical resiliency what do you have to do you have to do physically awful things if you want to be more emotionally resilient you have to be able to go through really emotionally difficult things without cracking that's that like I feel bad for those that crack like I I do I I truly do and it's it's awful situation I've been the person that's cracked right I've been the person that got really frustrated and left I've been the person that didn't gain emotional resiliency but instead gained emotional fragility that that I became really like tender afterwards I I totally get it and I feel like it's it's it's definitely easier when you're young well does it have to be emotional at all of of course it does all things are I mean at the end of the day all things you make more decisions based on how you feel about something than you do about cold hard logic right almost always you make decisions based on that like whether you like it or not I would rather use spelt simply because I think rich is a cool guy spelt is better objectively but I would also want to use it because of that for rust I want to use leptos because I just like Greg I have an un usual liking of Greg just that's that and so I'm just going to use felt cuz I'm like Greg is super awesome so I quit my thought process was I'm sure they're going to fire me anyway but i'm reasonably smart and reasonably hardworking I don't know how long it's going to take but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to get another high-paying job one day and even if it pays half as much as Amazon did for me that's still a lot of money yeah uh but honestly maybe I was just trying to convince myself and the funny thing is when I actually first sent my resignation email my manager called me and basically said come on you don't have to quit but I was like no I'm serious this sucks ass and then the next day my I do feel bad I do feel like there was a great life lesson that could have been learned here no matter how awful it is I guarantee you Amazon's awful I'm positive of it I I'm not denying it I'm not denying that he felt awful but there's also a huge W there right he was I mean did you hear his language his language was I was really worried about being fired I was really worried about these kind of things so I'm just going to quit and when he does what does his manager say what do you do you don't have to do that right like your expectation and how you view a situation sometimes doesn't always align with reality you know another thing that I've always I I've seen a lot I wouldn't say always but I've seen a lot people who've been able to be very successful just relying on their own Laurels up to a certain spot when put in a situation that is above their pay grade if you will that they completely fold I feel like at some point in your life you have to fight it out to earn the fight and once you fight it out you earn it's just like every time you meet a person that has fought it out they they can continue to do that fighting out whereas like if you've always just success right you go to school you get A's you don't have to be like you don't have to try super hard in school you just are always successful at the things you do everything you put your hand to you're generally successful for those that haven't seen that I've seen it a lot of times and then when those people get put into a hard situation one in which they don't have the gifts they can just simply rely on I've seen a lot of times they they actually it's a lot of caving happens it's very very hard put me in a hard situation trash jokes on you you're always hard senior manager called me and basically said the same thing somehow they actually convinced me and I was like okay maybe I can make things work here okay and a couple days went by and for the third and final time I sent my resignation email after quitting I thought things would get better they did not whenever I sat at my computer and opened vs code I would just get like this intense feeling in my stomach I get the same thing to this day I can't even open up vs code without getting super pissed off so maybe you know maybe the situation was you're not using neovim have you thought about that maybe it wasn't even all what are the chances it was just viia Co by the way every time I do that I swear I have so many stupid shorts and YouTube videos of like out of context clips of me dunking on vs code and people are like you know man you know you in your high pedestal sitting up there thinking you're just better than everybody else because you use deal this dude it's just so funny it's just so funny you clip something out of context and damn PE people ready people ready to die on this one they're like grenade and after a while I just gave up I think I recorded a few leak code videos but I even stopped that because I was just so depressed I was turning to drugs and alcohol I hit the bong so much that I literally didn't even feel it anymore I I was just in shock how did this happen to me this was not supposed to happen it was supposed to be different if I was Stronger this would have never happened to me if I could just have one more chance I know I could make things right maybe in another life I'll make them proud I literally thought that to myself it sounds cringey to say it out loud but that's literally how I felt I was that rock bottom and feels on that one I'm sure so many people look back on so many of these little moments in which you know you could have done better and often it's like only when you're far out of the situation and you come back do you realize man I could have done this differently it it sucks it sucks having to look back and do that I I I I can think of many situations in which that is real taking things a little serious isn't he there's there's this thing that happens to people it's kind of like a well-known phenomena a good example of this and someone that has talked about this on the internets who I absolutely think is a complete dick of a dude uh Dan bazarian right he has a problem where he talked about staying in a five-star hotel felt yucky to him I recently stayed in my first five-star hotel like a year and a half ago ever in my entire lifetime it was absolutely incredible to me so the ability to stay in a place I got to stay there for one day it was incredible okay I got I got a one day stay in there and it was super super sweet nonetheless there's this thing that happens to people where difficulty or pain is experienced differently depending on your life I know it sounds crazy everybody's a little bit different but when you're only used to experiencing a certain level when it goes down a level it can feel like real pain your your brain processes like real pain if you're always used to being a success and now for the first time you're a failure you can like that could you're experiencing for some people that's not Rock Bottom that's like day that's like an average day in the life for some people that is Rock Bottom you know and you just got to understand just it's going to it's going to you know so I I I understand his words his words are what he felt this lasted for weeks and it was not getting better until one day I made a huge mistake I went to my fridge I opened the freezer I grabbed a piece of tin foil I opened it and ate everything inside it was like five or six tabs of LSD now it was a I've done something similar I too took too much LSD and Hall I to this day every now and then I'll still get like a streaks but that was like 15 years ago so you know I'm lucky horrible decision but I just wanted to feel like I was flying now I did not fly I spent that day laying down and watching the ceiling just spinning all of the negative feelings I had were like 10 times more intense and the thoughts just kept replaying in my mind but that wasn't even the worst part of it after it was over the world around me had very no noticeably changed a school construction project next to where I lived was not really about the school it was actually meant to spy on me why that's the question I kept asking myself why is it that every time I go for a walk there are people following me why is damn man yeah I mean you can hurt your brain real talk you can Hur a drug induced skitso is a real is a real thing I have I have multiple members of my family who used too much drugs and have some level of schizophrenia because of it it can get it can get real dark don't do a lot of drugs dog for those that haven't made this mistake yet don't do that use neovim find Jesus vs code and LSD just ain't it okay that every time I drive police are following me I know that sounds crazy but here's one that's like a tiny bit believable at least for like a paranoid person in college I had my only internship at Capital 1 during that time there was a data breach on their services that were hosted on AWS and it was actually intentionally caused by like a former Amazon engineer and while I was at Amazon I would sometimes take like handwritten notes like about my tasks so then I started thinking oh [ __ ] there's going to be another breach and Amazon is going to try to blame it on me why I don't know but I took those notes and I burned the [ __ ] out of them now I'm not that's that's some intense psychosis man hurt hurt the brain a little bit with too much LSD lsds can be very dangerous by the way not a big crier I'm honestly not but in this situation it was so hard to get better because I just could not stop crying even worse I couldn't remember anything I would get up and walk to the kitchen and be like wait what am I doing again wait how old am I again what's my name again wait didn't I have a doctor's appointment today I was so scared that I was just completely losing my mind but I did not stay down almost every day I would drive to an empty parking lot and after I was done crying I would read to myself and I'll actually show you maybe working this particular job caused a little too much anxiety right now but as I continue I know pretty soon it will be easier and more manageable you can even see the date last edited August 20 2020 I would read these words every single day until one day I could believe them even then months went by of me doing nothing I couldn't eat I couldn't sleep or even remember things I didn't really know what else to do anymore so I think on December 1st 2020 I decided okay I'm just going to solve a leak code problem every single day regardless of what else happens around me and great step right here it's a great step and the consistency and predictability ility of this actually helped me calm down a lot and literally a week after that I started feeling like a tiny bit normal again so then I started making leak code videos again literally like a week after that it was such a strange feeling like as quickly as my brain had like come apart was as quickly as it just came together and I kept at it for a year until I got my first job interview and then job offer since quck and it happened to be at Google and maybe huge respect for this please have a routine a routine alone can make a huge difference in your life I mean that like the fact that he just did something consistently made a huge impact into his life have a routine this is why I just say go to bed at the same time if you go to bed at the same time you drink up or you wake up at the same time I I I literally wake up and go straight to work and I just do that I don't have some red light therapy 3-hour morning routine with a bunch of working out and cold sauna hot sauna jump in the cold water I don't do all that crap I just go straight to work for an hour and a half just wake up and go and then I come back and do the things I need to do to get ready for the day it just makes life I I usually don't eat breakfast I usually skip breakfast Monday through Friday I don't eat usually till like 2:00 or 3: in the afternoon I just wake up brush teeth work just helps it just helps because I have this thing that I just do it every single time if you don't do that exact thing and you just have a VAR a varied schedule every single day where every single day is just kind of chaos it gets hard this is the drugs talking but ever since then life just feels like a dream like it doesn't feel real to me anymore I feel like every time I have to do something hard or something I couldn't do in the past I literally feel like somebody else is doing it for me now I'm not saying that leak code will cure your mental illness and I'm not a doctor but if I had to guess this whole experience of going crazy was probably like drug induced psychosis at least from what I I know now I can't tell you exactly how to get into Google I can't tell you exactly how to make a lot of money or whatever it is that you want to do I wish I could but I can tell you this when you're consistent never stay down enjoy what you do maybe even obsess over it and lastly are honest with yourself and a little self-critical you tell me would you want to bet against someone like that I wouldn't and for that reason I'm never going to bet against myself I'm na'vi and that's my story in my own words respect on that that was some good respect right there I really appreciated that video chat this is gigachad this not some freaking Arch rust weeb waiu enjoyer [ __ ] that personally feels attack if you criti his indent preferences and starts crying into his programming socks calling for BT goth mommy I'm not sure what BT goth mommy is I'm not good enough I I'm not hip enough to know what that means but I agree like And subscribe but but real talk this was a really good video and he says I can't tell you how to be successful how to make a lot of money that's absolutely true people like to say there's no one siiz fits-all approach to life but there are most certainly really good identifiers a good easy thing that just almost universally works specifically in programming is becoming really good at something it's just always a good idea you know like anytime I meet somebody doesn't really matter what it is but somebody that's really going that just has really gone deep into a specific topic networking you you meet someone that's really good at like devops like Al 4 any of these people that just really understand all of the various you know Concepts and really pushes in hard and when you talk to them you can just feel this wealth and knowledge on a specific thing even if it is react right my arch nemesis if you will I still find it really really impressive and I I I want to work with that person that's a tip be consistent go deep on something right I mean you will do so well in programming sales Forge honestly if you were the best Salesforce plug-in person I guarantee you you could make deep into the sixf Fig salary right now dude just get good at WordPress and you will still make a ton of money that's Lambo money it you don't have you don't have to like work in the coolest technology in the world just find the thing that you are excited about you know what I mean like if you just do what you are excited about it's shocking how far you will go you should be excited about gaining some money I I mean I was there I was there and I I I had an absolutely awful time I went from $0 to $50,000 a year and it was it was one of the most incredible moments of my entire lifetime you know you should be excited about that that stuff is good but at the end of the day making money is not a long-term motivator at some point when you're going up by 5% a year making money becomes a a a grind find something else in there to help fill in those gaps you know what I mean like real talk I wouldn't just I wouldn't only program for the love of it if there was no money in it at some point I'd have to do something else and that's totally that's totally fine what's my motivation you know when I was 19 doing too much LSD had hallucination problems for a large part of my life all that kind of crap the methamphetamines just the extreme addiction to pornography I mean honestly I didn't even know if I was gay or straight I had no idea like my life was just a p of confusion and I felt confused on every single point of my life and I just remember sitting there just like I had no Direction nobody told me how to live my life I had nobody told me anything and I just felt so desperate to feel something and that's when I accidentally became a late Life Christian that was weird but then after that my motivation is really that I just want to help people like I want people to feel like there's something in life I want someone just to say hey I may not had the best life but at least I had somebody saying something nice in my life like I got nothing I had nothing dad died when I was young [ __ ] sucked it just sucked right that's all that's my life that was my life it just sucked nobody told me nothing now look at me life's completely different it it didn't feel good though there was years upon years of really sag times you know what I mean I had a lot of a lot of struggles for many many years I think that's why I find all of the programming struggles hard for me to relate to is because quitting porn was such a day in and day out extremely difficult life change cuz my first time I saw porn was when I was 4 years old my brother found magazines inevitably I got to them and so it's like my dad [ __ ] up his fuckups became my fuckups I didn't choose it it kind of got foisted upon me kind of ruined my life for many many years right totally sucks and so there wasn't a day that didn't go by that I didn't think about that for decades that's sucks thinking about something for decades and so like that was those were hard things yeah dude dad dad's hoist hoist your dad's Bard I literally unfortunately he did not give a good petard man it was tough it was tough it took many many many years it's why I have a hard time relating when people are just like oh man it was really stressful I'm like yeah don't quit hard is not a reason to stop right it's just not if you want life to change you have to be willing to fail every day over and over again nonstop hour after hour and when you get get done failing you have to get up and be willing to fail again and then do it again and do it again and do it again and do it again and do it again and do it for years and then things start to change and then at some point it's easy like right now it's hard for me to think about porn that only changed about 2 years ago take a moment and think about that it took 30 years and 15 active years of fighting against pornography for me to finally feel like it's no longer a daily thing now I feel like I'm the one in control took a long time anyways deep video odd probably wasn't expecting this whole situation to go on but we just went on so hey the name it's the primagen
