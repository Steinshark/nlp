what have they done hello everyone and welcome we are sitting inside of the all-new BMW M2 and we're going to keep this simple and entertaining at least the first part so we're going to look at six different elements of this car and just say whether or not they are exciting yes or no so we will start off with the engine and yes as you might imagine this is an exciting engine this is the same engine out of the BMW M3 and BMW M4 the s58 it is a three liter inline six cylinder making 453 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque this engine is Twin turbocharged so you have one turbo for the first three cylinders cylinders one through three and then cylinders four through six go to another turbo these are mono scroll turbos not twin scroll turbos like you might see in some of the V8s that BMW uses why might that be well first of all you have an odd number of cylinders going to each turbo that's part of it the other part being with three cylinders going to each turbo you don't have exhaust valve overlap so you don't need to worry about that Scavenging effect which is what twin scroll turbos take advantage of so mono scroll turbos work out just fine this is a potent engine there is plenty of power here and just to kind of get an idea we're going to go down to third gear slow down we are on a bit of a downhill slope so that's going to help us but put my foot down and you really start to feel the torque at about 3000 RPM and this does in fact hit Peak torque before 3000 RPM and it holds on to that torque for a good long time so as long as you're above 3000 the torque full torque is available that said there definitely is Turbo lag so if I put it down in fourth right now we're at 4000 RPM punch it it's a good second that you're waiting where you don't really feel much and then you feel those turbos spool up and then you start to get good acceleration same is true for lower gears I mean the thing is if you're actually you know constantly on the power you're not going to know it as you shift through the gears you have that turbo leg it's very you know imperceptible but if you're just going from nothing to flat honestly it may be even longer than a second there's a decent amount of Turbo lag with the engine but it's got a large torque band it's got plenty of power it's an inline six so it's super smooth I do like the engine in this car moving on to number two is the transmission and this is also exciting so first of all BMW keeps the manual transmission alive thank you BMW because not many companies are doing it these days so the six-speed manual is still an option it is the exact same six speed from the previous M2 same gearing I will always argue that the gearing on pretty much every manual transmission except maybe like the Miata and BRZ is Too Tall so you know the thing is you get well over 100 miles per hour in the manual in third gear so from an acceleration standpoint on the road you never really need anything beyond third gear that's kind of disappointing because if you've got a manual you probably want to shift a little bit I think the realistic solution to that is offering two different gear sets for a manual you know one being hey am I mostly going to use this car on the road and then if that's the case then you get the manual with more aggressive gearing are you mostly going to be using the M2 on the track then you get the taller gearing where it makes sense and you reach those higher speeds of course we don't have that luxury because the manuals are just kind of dying off and so I don't think we're going to get options but right I have it my way I would have more aggressive gearing with the manual now we are sitting inside of the automatic this is an eight-speed Zepp automatic instead of what was used previously a 7-speed dual clutch you may think that's a downgrade I do not two reasons first of all the eight speed is great it shifts quick um you know you're not going to notice any huge differences maybe the DCT was slightly quicker but honestly this thing shifts fast it's smooth it's a great transmission the other benefit is since you have one more Gear with that additional gear it allows to make the other gears more aggressive so first gear is about the same as the previous gen automatic but second gear third gear fourth year fifth year these are all more aggressive than the Dual clutch transmission of the previous M2 which means real world you have better acceleration in all of these gears you have better wheel torque meaning the force that you know pushes you into the seat is greater so I like this transmission I would take it over the seven speed dual clutch I think it's fantastic it is aggressive you know second gear you're not even hitting 60 miles per hour it's like peaking in the 50s it's real fun aggressive gearing you get that little wheelchair between you know the different gears and you can get a little wheel spin and second if it's raining number three let's talk about the looks I know this is a very polarizing car I'm going to say it's exciting and I'll give you a reason why but I looked up the definition of excitement and it says causes great enthusiasm and I think you know unequivocally this when people look at this there is an enthusiasm there now enthusiasm generally has a positive connotation not negative but there is great enthusiasm surrounding how this looks people like to talk about it and so because of that I will say exciting personally I think it looks alright we are living in a sea of boring cars out there today uh and BMW made something polarizing that people say oh I love it oh I hate it I can't stand it it's hideous do I think the older M2 is much better looking yes yes I do but I like that this is something different and it gets people thinking about it and it's not just this same boring soap bar driving through town so it's at least exciting in that it's very different and the color is awesome I love this xanvort blue and so I have a little bit of a conspiracy theory here uh none of this came from BMW this is all from my own brain which is unhealthy and so what I think happened so Al Biermann used to be head of engineering at BMW M he is responsible for some of the greatest M cars I'll be Airman was poached by Hyundai or maybe he went on his own accord whatever happened he switched to Hyundai and helped develop their end line and worked on the Veloster n so the Veloster n came in performance blue which to me looks identical to this zanfort Loop and then he retired from Hyundai you know around 2021 so in my head this color is a nod to Al Biermann and his retirement and you know just live a nice life doing whatever it is you please you made some fantastic cars along the way so that's what I'm choosing to believe this color is and I think it's fantastic color number four is the price and I think the price is exciting despite you know all cars today are insanely expensive this is starting at about 63 thousand dollars but when you start to look at that number you know it actually does make a good bit of sense the 2016 BMW M2 when it came out was fifty three thousand dollars adjusted for inflation this is cheap cheaper than that BMW M2 in 2016 even though it's starting at 63 000 so cheaper overall adjusted for inflation and back in 2016 the BMW M2 was a heck of a car for its price point it was wildly competitive with this segment that it fell in so I think the pricing on this is actually really good and in addition to that it can't get optioned to insane numbers the car I'm sitting in right now has a healthy list of options and it's under 70k with destination if you max out a 2024 BMW M2 you're still under 80k with every box checked and so that's including a 10 000 carbon fiber package that you really don't need and doesn't provide that much of a benefit so realistically pricing on this is quite good and one final comparison if you look at this versus the base Porsche Cayman Porsche 718 the bottom of the barrel Cayman starts at 70k this is starting seven thousand dollars less than that significantly more powerful a little bit quicker and that Porsche Cayman you can option past 100k with you know you start checking boxes on Porsche you're over 100k and that's crazy right you're still in a base Cayman so the pricing for this including options is actually pretty decent and when you start looking at what it competes again I think it makes a lot of sense now what's the difference between this and the base came in well the base came in weighs 800 pounds less I am not lying to you I don't know how 800 pounds less than this car right here that is absurd which leads us to point number five the weight and it is most definitely not exciting this score is over 3 800 pounds it weighs the same as the BMW M4 I don't really understand why that happens right the BMW M2 used to be this smaller lighter more Nimble you know brother of that BMW M4 and now they weigh the same so that is crazy to me if you look at the 2016 BMW M2 this weighs 500 pounds more and it only has 90 more horsepower now that leads you to the question is 90 horsepower worth 500 pounds my answer to that question is no from an acceleration standpoint the answer is yes that is a worthwhile trade if your goal is to accelerate faster 90 horsepower at 500 pounds will make this car quicker but it makes all the other aspects worse right so handling braking enjoyment to drive these are all pulled back because you've added so much weight and I think that is a real question worth asking when you start thinking about this car is 90 horsepower worth 500 pounds to you another interesting comparison here if you look at the previous generation m240i xDrive so it's a 2 Series it's got the inline six cylinder and it has all-wheel drive it was 150 pounds lighter than this car here it's like what how is an all-wheel drive six-cylinder lighter by 150 pounds I really don't know where the weight comes from in this car I don't understand why it is so heavy now that leads us to number six the driving experience and by no stretch of the imagination does this offer a bad driving experience this is a great car it's a great car in the exact same way that the BMW M4 is a great car it's mature it does everything well and it just does it you know it handles well it accelerates well it does all the things you ask of it and it does it properly and in a mature fashion if the BMW M4 is your cool dad well what used to be the case is that the BMW M2 was your cool dad's wild brother you know it was your exciting uncle but now the BMW M2 is your cool dad's twin brother this is a BMW M4 both figure iteratively and literally it has the exact same engine it has the exact same transmission it has the same track width it has the same wheel and tire sizes it is a BMW M4 that is what it is they even weigh the same and so it used to be the case where the M2 you know it had this real differentiation from the M4 and that it was lighter and it was a bit more playful and a bit more wild but what's the difference now I mean the BMW M4 has a 4.4 inch longer wheelbase that's about it slightly more room in the back seats a slightly larger trunk a slightly larger fuel tank and I do mean slightly for all of those realistically they are the same car so that to me is what's sad because the BMW M2 is gone we don't have it anymore we have something that looks different from an M4 but it is an M4 so if they're both essentially the same I mean yeah the M4 has 20 additional horsepower but they have very similar acceleration you know which one do you choose and I think the only real way to answer this question well if you go back to the pricing discussion we were having where I was saying this is a good deal it really looks like a good deal when you compare to the M4 because it's basically the same and yet it starts fifteen thousand dollars less so that makes a lot of sense if you want an M4 with all-wheel drive well the only way to do it is with the M4 they don't offer all drive with the M2 also if you want the competition package to get slightly more power then yeah the M4 competition is your choice but realistically this and the base M4 are the same car this is fifteen thousand dollars cheaper that's my answer like why spend 15 grand unless you just like the difference in how they look and you want the one that looks you know different so all of that sounds like a little disappointing and it's crazy because it's like this is a great car this is a really good car uh it's mature it's stable it does everything well it's not really an M2 anymore and so that to me was the disappointing part that said you know it's like how do you balance that because I like it I just wish it was actually an M2 thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
