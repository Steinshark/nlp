imagine the kind of PC this kid would build pretty awful now imagine he never stopped that's right that kid was me is that supposed to be a chalking twist today we're going to be roasting the cringiest most embarrassing builds from my past and who better to join me than two of my kindest most gracious paid friends three if you count our sponsor Lenovo who's featuring their brand new Creator focused yoga Pro 9 eye known in North America as the Lenovo slim Pro 9i with Intel 13th gen processors and Nvidia 40 series laptop graphics oh man where do we start our tour at the beginning I'm gonna have great context for all this stuff that was done when I was two years old I can't wait till this is how big this picture is it's a recovery from when I lost all of my pictures and was only able to recover thumbnail sized images how old are you here well that's not me yeah thanks Jake I don't know but this is my setup my hand-me-down setup from my uncle who was ditching his Pentium 166. holy z985 sticker is legit is that a receiver no no that's a tape deck this is the 2002 baby I love the corded phone too that was to talk to my girlfriend that you can't use at the same time as a computer yeah when did MSN Messenger come out 2005. oh yeah I was using MSN by this okay okay yeah yeah oh yeah when did him at 2005. I chatted with my sweetheart 09. that was Yvonne's handle with all the like cringy like x's and brackets and stuff and everything around it yeah this is my bedroom yeah the green how did you get a match desk that was one of my parents most proud Christmas gifts for me I asked for Warcraft 2 and what I got was furniture yeah they were super pleased with their way of supporting my computer hobby without actually getting me any computer stuff or games ever I was fine with the desk I had before in fact this desk was kind of awful how much uh mousing space Also that we got here 2002 first computer I ever built for a client there's your MSN Messenger who's Tyson uh my friend in high school wait so you built a computer for your client and then installed MSN on it and talked to your friend don't ask me why I was doing that I mean his computer was probably better than the one I had at the time so maybe I was using it for a little bit before delivery I don't know burn-in period I suspect Lyle is like an alter ego and he just got it for himself no no he's dead oh oh my first gaming PC with a dedicated GPU let's go wow that is it like translucent plastic yeah it was meant to match that era of iMac which my parents thought was super cool and got for me not realizing that my keyboard was in fact about 40 percent wider than the Apple keyboard at the time and therefore in order to use it this is the technique I developed yeah you figured it out right you're actually using an ergo keyboard hey yeah well that really that was what I was given ah somebody cared about you yep you're 16. you could have got a job oh I had a job I had a job many years wait no which is how I afford it look this is two years after he's 18. he should have moved his ass out by then this is my first build with a dedicated GPU this is still Athlon XP so same CPU as my original build but I've upgraded from a motherboard with onboard Graphics to an Asus motherboard that's pretty big I feel like you guys aren't looking closely enough oh my God I saw that see my problem was I was completely fine with that yeah see like I don't know if he's the best person for this video have you seen some of the Jake he's done beautiful see I yeah this works for me is that just cable management electrical tape yeah but there's no window so who cares uh no this can this case had a window oh it had a window oh yeah do you have unplugged headers in the bottom right no back then your audio headers were either standard HD audio or you had to do the old PC 97 audio where you had to do each one individually so that was the extras hanging off did you plan on having more hard drives you just put the fans there for looks I mean looks is a bit I think that's for the GPS yeah it's for GPU cooling that's my all in Wonder 9600 Pro cable manage is great all right I expected you guys to roast me for the cable management oh no I just was no sarcasm I see all that fan whoa was that something you could buy or you painted that I found some UV reactive waterborne paint on an art supply store I mean at this is 2004. you went to the store no I had to order this online really no you can find this stuff in store this was this was Niche you painted the blades too I did however Buy AI also online this UV reactive IDE and floppy cable set this UV green sleeving and this Arctic Cooling GPU shroud I was going to ask that's not a new GPU is it nope nice it's got its own slot caption for this you merely adopted the three slot GPU I was born in it molded by it I need like some tape to cover up the top so you can't see that I mean tape in here that's the old P6 connector I apparently just cut it off so wait you said you got a cable kit no no it's leaving oh and there's just that one IDE cable thing so yeah really good quality UV heat shrink here those cables that he bought would have come all pre-done oh well these ones yes yes oh yeah I see the girls and then the the stuff that looks terrible would have been what he did yeah I put some UV accents on the top of the heatsink here is that on purpose or you just dropping that's actually just Jank like that actually just looks terrible I'm I'm like quite Pro like the like dude what you can setups but just painting poorly painting the tips of that heatsink half of them Wow Let's Go I mean is that how you left them the heatsink still looks like trash that's what I'm saying the rest of it the rest of it's like not that bad but the heatsink looks terrible not that bad yeah okay those sleeves look okay are they managed well no but this like he doesn't have the Shroud on in this picture yet so I think this is an earlier picture I think this is actually where he's like testing the UV it's like you know what this looks like to me when you when you see a horror movie and they have like props that were designed by somebody that doesn't actually know what the like the thing is supposed to look like they just computers they throw things in there yeah that looks like a computer that's what Linus made is this where the lambo Ram is that really just you left that there you just were you actually having cooling problems with your RAM or you just wanted pink the UV paint came in a kit oh my God you've painted it orange that was a choice this was when I bought the UV pen I didn't think I had any pictures of this I used it oh my God I must have cleaned the GPU at some point because I think I had problems with that makes sense I think that was here I can't even give you those points I just like that the CPU Cooler was two-tone he did green underneath and orange blades my first surround sound speaker setup I like the height one of them is Linus height the other one was hung by his dad still learning the alphabet there I see okay this is the other oh so that's your Aid your next set yeah yep Logitech Zed 680s this is post UV paint hey you got a new keyboard though yes and that Logitech MX Duo big upgrade and a freebie mouse pad you're not even using it well it was awful yeah it was truly awful ah no that's cool wow no I'm I'm on board I would unironically use a power supply like this today if I could why is your blanket on Twitter I don't know insulation man what are you even really trying to take a picture of right now what is that on the side of the desk that is a UV light I wasn't happy with the amount of UV light that I could get from just the the little computer-sized ones so that's why your side panel is always off because you had an external UV light oh that might be it and external Powers that's a full that's a full dick like black light from probably Spencer's Gifts or like San Francisco or something that was a chain store here that had Novelties and sex toys and stuff whoa this was an exciting upgrade Athlon 64 baby and one of the dumbest decisions I ever made this heatsink from Swift Tech was awful oh I'm sure and very expensive these were helical coils I have no doubt they spent a ton of money building the thing but the performance was dog crap and I bought it completely sight unseen no reviews learned a valuable lesson yeah this is my test bench and literally my mom's basement what is that spray yeah lubricating spray fun fact I still own this can it is at my house on a shelf I used it using it for it I used it to lubricate the back door like a month ago no but what we're using it for here I have no idea nice see I I think that's cool it is cool okay this is I still don't understand like what why did you take a picture right now though you're like 80 of the way to your cable management being done and you're like a picture was that painters tape like on the power supply yes that's funny hey that actually works okay though yeah but you can see them all inside what difference does it make it would be worse if it wasn't there uh I don't know can I you can see the cable still go to the next photo like are we gonna get another angle where you can still totally see the the rainbow spaghett yep nice okay done a better job oh man Intel inside no AMD AMD did you do that yourself no I bought it from ADP I was gonna say that looks actually pretty good so I doubt it oh yeah yeah also I could play you got a desk only the finest games yeah yeah big desk upgrade big desk energy he finally got the mouse pad upgrade piece of A4 paper he cut it to size though nope nope that's full size it's just taped down to the desk so it doesn't move I was a speaker's boy I spent all my money on speakers and I was literally in my parents basement hey is that a tire that oh these are those ones this is threaded Rod just like some weird bracket um piece of metal you had laying around and a tire that happened to thread into the thing did you take it from like a wheelbarrow or you bought that at the hardware store no no my dad helps me with this he bought this specifically this is all new designed like this yes by Design I mean it worked it was probably cheaper than buying I grew up in shanty town you got to make stuff happen not everything needs to be perfect I'm still I still can't uh let you go on the the paper Mouse you clearly had the the funds to get a mouse pad I was buying more lights UV paint all right it's 2005 baby oh this is an iconic photo it's your village called the idiot is missing what's on your screen what's going on are you pirating right now is that like LimeWire this is probably pyrus that looks like some form of I remember the icons at the bottom of like LimeWire and FrostWire I'm pretty sure that's LimeWire I literally have five hundred dollars speakers and a broken three dollar desk yeah you have two monitors now hey yep yeah was that one also a hand-me-down no the black one is super expensive you bought that p95f plus did you have a job at this time oh yeah what were you doing and I'm lifeguarding at this point you can't tell because I wear shirts that are too big for me but I'm actually like kind of jacked because I'm doing martial arts and lifeguarding quick flex but okay yeah no this is the best shape I was ever in in my life I look like a tool obviously but the monitor's good I mean it doesn't compare to how far we've come but pure site probing the LED touch screen on this thing is 3K resolution so literally four times as many pixels as that monitor a hundred percent coverage of the srgv DC ip3 and Adobe RGB color space automatic switching and a Delta e of less than one out of the box that thing by comparison actual garbage first Rattle can paint job I thought it was just like dark lighting yeah I feel like this has been like you and Bob spray painted a silver case silver I feel like it's pretty similar no no my compute no no no I reject no heatsinks on your RAM I'm kind of disappointed wait this is this is later this is my first water cooling setup I was gonna say thermaltake big water SC baby hey there's my UV paint though have you bought like multiple kits at this point nope remember it was hard to find special order it was oh my God it's baby Yvonne fun fact same did she just like wearing that or did you take a picture set desktop backer and then take another picture truthfully I don't know this is when I moved into Yvonne's parents house oh man you had class back then moving into your girlfriend's house girlfriend's parents house sorry sorry shout out Sophia and Albert guys are awesome still got the speakers they're actually in surround configuration now not rear right beside your head I think the desk is an upgrade though because the the previous one was uneven yeah and now he's got space for his UV paint yeah I will say despite all of the changes he still doesn't have his speakers behind his monitor Athlon 64 X2 there it is still the single most expensive computer component I've ever bought it was about 700 750 for a CPU that's when things started getting like actually kind of sick though what 2005 2006 baby this is 2005 on the photo then the metadata must be wrong this was uh yeah so late 2005. I don't know why this picture exists well thanks for sharing it with us my first SLI setup yeah these are 7 800 GTX did you paint those heatsinks too yeah those look like official those are from salmon those are just blue heat sinks oh you just put them on aftermarket yeah my first custom water cooling setup a few big jumps are you making more money now did you job switch at this point I'm at NCIX at this point okay okay yeah because I'm like there's the iPhone X2 is a big jump custom water cooling is a big jump in expense wait am I at NCIX yet no I'm not at NCIX yet I'm painting houses now oh so now you got some money yeah I have a little bit this uh that Swift Tech Block we still have that don't we we do up into the left of the what what's that what a wonderful question that is a fan I destructively clipped off of an Arctic cooling freezer something it was this weird l-bracketed fan that they built specifically for one of their Tower coolers and I was like you're useful and I added all these heat sinks to my vrms and then clipped that fan there sick maybe double-sided tape I enjoyed I enjoyed the like aftermarket heatsink stuff when that was in Vogue for a little while that was the pump got the classy Worm Drive clamps yeah well you don't want it to leak do you flash photography oh you upgraded the tape the tape is better no it's not tape that oh wait is it this is giant heat shrink it didn't shrink I just stretched it on there by putting one of the cables in at a time and we're like reefing on it yeah it looks worse than the tape really worth level your level your shirts look at how stupid I am was The Village Idiot now Evolution went wrong oh my God this is a big step forward I posted this on Extreme systems so I had these little captions to explain what I was doing because it wasn't evident from just the picture itself so this was a birthday present yes this was a birthday present from Yvonne can you tell she's a keeper yeah I bought windshield de-icer but I used water for the test run this seems like a good time to point out how far we've come in terms of performance and cooling this has a custom 13th gen Intel processor with a smaller package that allows the same performance in a smaller chassis and up to a RTX 4070 laptop GPU with time saving machine learning and media acceleration for industry-leading Creative apps the pro 9i is also custom tuned with Lenovo X power to deliver the best possible performance in all applications with high speed ddr5 and mdme storage efficient Cooling and software that optimizes power consumption based on the application you're running see I didn't have so I needed Sub-Zero cooling I love that you bought like the windshield de-icer and then used it to prop up the cooler and and then like to fill extra space you didn't have to get as much water it's almost like you could have just poured it in to do the same thing and it wouldn't have frozen over also did she figure out all the stuff or did you like give her a list of parts we went shopping together okay yeah we went shopping for my birthday okay that's cool is she a sweetheart or not is this just glue that is silicone there we go oh I was pretty sure it wasn't bad that ain't coming off oh my God I have not learned about that yet and this was a brand new motherboard this is my Core 2 Duo upgrade even a 6600 baby even if you like tried to peel that off you probably rip those caps oh yeah oh yeah yeah you're destroying them yeah and it's oh and the CPU is in there too oh my God this was a mistake believe it or not I actually attended Lan parties with this system as it is see I wanted trash on it but I'm so into it I absolutely love this I've got real UV fans now oh yeah was this like you'd unplug all the cables and then you could like card it or did you undo a lot of this in order to get like you take the the block off I imagine I think I just got help carrying it just I think I had to carry it as one piece I don't even think I drained it and you didn't like Dolly it or anything no I just carried it I didn't have a dolly like what are you talking about death change again Logitech g15 baby massive keyboard upgrade that most was so cool because it had it had these batteries so it was Wireless and it had rechargeable batteries and you can see the base just to the top right of his mousepad oh yeah you'd flip the Mills over press a button and it would like fire the battery out you'd press a button on that base it would fire that battery out and you slot it back in it's like reloading like magazine changes yeah battery it was actually so for the time it was amazing you were he wore deodorant that's good um why is there any bond sticker because this is Yvonne's bedroom oh right so you're just using her desk now so we we had the same keyboard in the same Mouse yeah I had a better monitor than you though that's probably my second biggest ever personal investment because it was like six seven hundred dollars on a monitor which seemed crazy to me at the time oh is that the really big one it's the 2004 fpw which isn't big more it's a 24 inch monitor but it was 16 by 10. yeah I was just gonna say just like the Lenovo yogo Pro Yogo that extra vertical space makes such a big difference for everything 16x9 was a mistake especially on a laptop yeah we've undone that mistake so happy what was the wait what was the name of that last file hold on go back why do I keep my computer in my girlfriend's bedroom this is not my personal rig but this is the first water cooled PC I ever built for an NCIX customer there's the okay you can see the inverter box that like weird like off light blue they were all like that I actually delivered this to a client which is embarrassing to me now uh we fast forward a little bit my girlfriend bought me a Silverstone tj07 so this is never side panel on uh no this is mid working on stuff because well the tube goes out of the case that side panel is flush that's my t-line um when we're done that will wrap up here and hide away that is nail polish ah so that's what you used no it was something else before I don't know just anything that can fit in the end he just needed the coolant to go down so we could take the block off pretty clever right we have a bunch because every time I saw them I grabbed them and took them home so you started the trend it's really just company culture at this point oh why is actually starting to have some like Swagger with his building I like this a lot I was never a fan of that Sata cable wrap you did it a bunch of times yeah I know it was never enough yeah but other than that this is like actually sick well what else would you do I guess just zip tie it behind us oh was this after you got it painted too yes or sandblasted yes this is after I got it powder coated by Mountain mods so he had to ship the whole case to some guy like this wasn't local wow oh I'm doing maintenance on the CPU and the GPU so it's empty no Jake pointed out what'd you do to your rat he did that on purpose no no that was a deal Thermo chilt was based in the UK couldn't figure out how to package their products and a solid like quarter of one of our shipments was bashed in so I negotiated a little discount on this radiator that I checked to make sure was in fact still working can I just buy this as is he did it with a lot of things hey just coil stuff around why cut when you can manage well even the light this is pretty dope yeah this is sick like it was it was bad before but we're getting there can we bring back UV man I love it you're missing some some cables no 24 pin isn't it there that wait what is this isn't that dual monitors oh I didn't even see it the the Casual couch monitor yeah it's just sitting on the couch is this isn't in her bedroom anymore you've upgraded to the living room oh yeah I'm in the family room wow the parents must really liked you no they are just extremely supportive of their daughter oh really supportive they weren't a big fan of me in the early days I was gonna say have you met him [Laughter] man very supportive holy so you like trashed their family room oh my God sure what did you take this photo with like what happened took a test bench home from work uh oh yeah yeah that's what the couch monitor is for that's a test bench I'm probably benchmarking FX this is that story that I've told so many times about how AMD promised me this thing was great so I like pulled an all-nighter to get great performance from it because clearly I was doing something wrong and then in the next morning I found out it was a piece of  when all the other reviews came out not so were you just benching it because of being a PM or being interested or was this actually like for an article NCIX had launched Hardware Canucks by this point which they didn't disclose belonged to them but definitely definitely belonged to them if they ever disclosed that well it doesn't belong to them anymore so I guess if it has anyone ever brought that up before online uh I don't think they ever publicly acknowledged it that's fine Avon probably studying yeah oh yeah Yvonne's studying to pay for you know me to just do nothing but this all day okay 2008. so this must be the night before a launch of something how's that keyboard oh that's a good question really nice keyboard quiet one and a half millimeters of travel concave keycaps really comfortable nice large track pad and machine learning enhancement on the 5 megapixel webcam with physical privacy shutter no it was it was it was Phenom I call it Phenom because it was part of their their spider platform so like venom venom and that's what they that's what they sold to me everyone else calls it Phenom but that's why I do it amd's fault our side-by-side gaming setups like you're renting a whole house or uh this is the house I grew up in I borrowed a house from my dad who was traveling abroad and didn't have a tenant at the time and Yvonne was doing her practicum in tuwassen so it was actually really close so he just let you live there for free so we were just living there for free the desk is so much worse than yours um they're both awful yeah they look pretty bad this one you see these supports oh I didn't that's rough yeah this thing just Falls over because these don't lock at all oh no so when these would pop out it would just oh yeah racing wheel in the customary spot in its box because whoever uses those damn things hey hey recognize the Samsung true direct DVD drive that I definitely didn't steal from work you still have that too I know most pad upgrade pretty massive finally cares still seriously steel series I was starting to get free stuff by this point that akari and that mouse pad definitely made their way to me from steel through store handsomething Mike Yvonne's first custom gaming PC oh my God this is the first wifey PC that's a bunch of cop okay so this is a lot of this is reused stuff from your old builds not not a bad thing yes not a bad thing yes did you have to talk her into this or she was just like whatever I don't care no she was she was down the game with me okay well I mean like to make her computer like this yeah she's like she's she's all about just like doing whatever I do I mean look at this company yeah this is true this is true it's come a long way thank you hon this is is my desk at work yeah I can explain this isn't that yours my work PC somehow got requisitioned with a really good power supply do as I say not as I do all of you don't you guys like my monitor stands I want to zoom in on the screen so let's see what kind of work Linus was doing oh that's steel series I see you're talking to someone at steelseries hey can I get another free mouse pad I'm ordering I'm ordering OCC ssds I'm gonna go over to the right here's our prices hold on hold on these are this is interesting oh I can't really read it that's got to be a 250 gig no no there's no way that's that's probably 60 gig at 180 bucks I am skewing up some stuff this is the mcix internal sales report uh and then MSN all the chat rooms open I see a bunch of pink texts because Linus used to do that pink Comic Sans bold italics this is work we actually used this for internal messaging at work and he ran pink Comic Sans boldly towel we still do now teams fun fact I called my office the box office not because I was a video celebrity but because it was literally made of these Banker boxes in the background that's a wall that you made there was no wall oh my God I my entire office was made of Banker boxes um I was just in a hallway a reappearance now we're back at Yvonne's parents house taking inventory maybe oh that's funny those boxes I was using as monitor stands did were those the boxes for these hmm were they at your house oh my god when you see it which part the water bottle is that we're talking about the reservoir yeah yeah yeah that's great yeah oh so sick are those Gunners those are polarized 3D glasses oh for the ized 3D gaming monitor that I took home for testing it was awful I was doing work here that is not me getting free stuff that is work that monitor was a piece of  can I ask like okay throughout all of these years of photos there's always Tums on your that is the same bottle what in every single one because I always intended to take calcium supplements oh you never remembered to do it and so I would just always have it on my desk because I'm like I'm totally gonna start taking these this time you were taking Tums as a calcium supplement well that's intended to but never did I mean I apparently never did well I just okay if people go back in in archeology it yeah it might be a slightly different bottle I guarantee you I never bought more than like two bottles of them oh my God 3D Vision surround wow where did you post this probably on the Forum or something I was testing something for something this is in the Linus Tech tips era so this might have even been in a video this became the nursery for my kids but until it was the nursery it was my benchmarking room oh yeah Rockin and Rumble they they deserve they deserve to be in the video okay this isn't my computer I don't think this ever saw the light of day but I found this oh my God that's really Korean judge yeah so I used to like mushkin so that sucks no this is not munchkin I did this oh I'm pretty sure they rejected this campaign yeah that's good yeah it's pretty bad what a goof I learned a lot I was the PM for mushkin we had some MDF to spend and I was like this must have been Tom I was like we should do like this and I'm pretty sure this never went out but if you ever saw it I'm sorry he still took photos you know like pretty sure he also still stole that chair from work no that's from work isn't it oh yeah or go direct moving on you're gonna make it Luke you're gonna have to run that'll be his boss oh nice nice Flex though and Lenovo
