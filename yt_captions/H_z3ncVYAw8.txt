hello everyone I'm pleased to announce my new tour for 2024 beginning in early February and running through June Tammy and I an assortment of special guests are going to visit 51 cities in the US you can find out more information about this on my website jordanbpeterson.com as well as accessing all relevant ticketing information I'm going to use the tour to walk through some of the ideas I've been working on my forthcoming book out November 2024 we who wrestle with God I'm looking forward to this I'm thrilled to be able to do it again and I'll be pleased to see all of you again soon bye-bye every culture on Earth has used fasting as a healing intervention or a religious intervention hypocrates knew about this Jesus knew about this so this has been known for millennia that fasting can help it is a physiological way to induce healing and it you basically are tapping into the body's innate ability to heal and repair [Music] itself hello everyone I'm speaking today with Dr Chris Palmer he's associated with the Harvard medical school and with mlan Hospital which is perhaps the world's preeminent psychiatric hospital and uh we talked today about material Associated for example with his book 2022 book called brain energy Dr Palmer has been pursuing the hypothesis that many mental disorders especially the really severe mental disorders schizophrenia bipolar disorder major depression intractable depression with no apparent environmental cause let's say or psychological cause might be associated with metabolic disorder um mediated primarily by mitochondrial dysfunction the mitochondria are basically the energy factories in every cell and so mitoch and that's not all they do mitochondrial disorder therefore is very very serious problem he's been experimenting with ketogenic diet uh K in some sense to the diet that my daughter has been promoting the lion diet um making the case that use of such diets can not only reduce the effect of potential toxins on mitochondrial function but also increase mitochondrial metabolism and also help the body heal by putting it into a state known as a autophagy or mitophagy which are are states where the body is actually taking itself apart as a consequence of food deprivation and then rebuilding itself anyways he's um he makes the case we'll discuss the probability that this kind of hypothesizing has gone beyond the merely anecdotal to the point where there is a tremendous amount of research supporting the proposition that dietary factors play a major role in The Genesis of such severe mental disorders and not only mental disorders also physical disorders like obesity heart disease cancer diabetes you know the common enemies of mankind and so we're going to discuss that in detail thank you for joining us Dr Palmer let's start out at the level of conceptualization in your 2022 book correct me if I get any of of this wrong because I'm I don't want to put words in your mouth you're concentrating at least on the relationship between I would say brain dysfunction biological dysfunction um metabolic dysfunction and what we generally think of as mental disorders and so the typical more abstract psychological conceptualization would be that a mental disorder something associated with Psychopathology and undue suffering let's say with dysfunction in the social environment and so forth might be a consequence of faulty beliefs and perceptions and so they can get bent to the point where they're indistinguishable from delusions and then also skill deficits which is often what behaviorists remediate and it's obvious that a skill deficit in Social ability for example isn't equivalent to a metabolic disorder but let me start by asking you how you lay out your conceptualization of metabolic disorder and what implications you think that has for the diagnosis and further understanding and treatment of of so-called mental disorders you know it's a complicated situation as you even just began to hint at and you know that maybe one easy way to outline my conceptualization is that there are mental States and there are mental disorders so all humans will suffer All Humans will have anxiety at some point or another in their life all humans will get depressed or most humans will get depressed if they experience tragic loss um or humiliation and shame um and those are not brain disorders as far as I'm concerned that is the normal state of of being a human being and as you alluded to depending on your upbringing and your experiences you might learn maladaptive themes or maladaptive lessons in life people aren't trustworthy you can't trust anybody and you go through life that way and that can actually have very serious consequences for people but I don't think those people have brain disorders the the reason they believe what they believe the way that that happened is all obvious once you understand the person's full history and so there are Myriad ways in which humans can suffer and and develop maladaptive patterns that do not include brain disorders and Psychotherapy can be helpful and just being human and all of the life skill SKS that you talk about apply to those people and yet there are other people who have brain disorders their brains are malfunctioning they have anxiety or Panic for no reason they have crippling OCD for no clear reason they have crippling unrelenting depression for no clear reason they have hallucinations Illusions manic episodes and other types of symptoms and it is largely believed in the psychiatric field that these people do in fact have brain disorders and that their brains are malfunctioning and at the end of the day what I am arguing is that there is in fact a central theme to these malfunctioning brain symptoms and they revolve around metabolism and that if we take Take This Global picture and understand that these brain conditions are actually metabolic in nature number one it can help us better understand how all of the risk factors can come together to result in mental disorders or mental illness but much more importantly it gives us clear actionable treatment that we typically do not use today and they span a wide variety of different treatment strategies but they include things like changes in diet changes in exercise uh looking for hormone or vitamin deficiencies um thinking more kind of in a more sophisticated way about substance use and thinking in a much more sophisticated way way about the medications that we prescribe for psychiatric conditions because some of them can improve brain metabolism but we know that some of them are actually harmful to metabolism let me outline a diagnostic approach to you with regards to the differential diagnosis of depression and I've thought about this a lot so tell me what you think and then we'll turn to a discussion of the list of contributing factors to to phys ological brain dysfunction or illness and we can tie those togethers okay so one of the things I noticed as a clinician and I think that this is key to solving the mystery of Perhaps Perhaps of differential response to serotonin rapake Inhibitors and other anti-depressants now I don't think it's the only key but I think it's an important one I don't think it's one that's been attended to enough so I noticed in my practice that there were two broad classes of people with depression okay so we can Define depression first for everybody watching and listening so depression looks like a condition analgous to an excess of pain It's associated with grief and shame and guilt it it it's characterized by a decrease in positive em motivation so less enthusiasm less curiosity less hope often hopelessness per se and a proliferation of negative emotion so and those are separate biochemical systems to some degree so if you're really depressed you have no positive emotion you have way too much negative emotion and then that manifests itself well it can manifest itself as a virtual inability to move even no motivation and often an overwhelming sense of Doom and a proclivity even towards suicide so that's the depressive realm it's a psychogenic pain condition and it differs from anxiety um even in its in although they overlap now I had clients who were in that condition but then imagine that those broke into two classes I have the odd client who by all appearances by all standards of multi-dimensional assessment had fine lives so these would be people who were reasonably healthy apart from the depression let's say who had a functioning marriage who had friends that they liked and and a marriage that they liked even though the depression might have been twisting their perception of that so for example they may have thought that they were now so useless and and contemptible that no one like their wife could possibly love them and that they were you know a burden to their family but they still had tight family relationships they often had careers that were welldeveloped and going fine they were about as educated as you could expect they didn't necessarily have any substance use disorders they did productive things outside of work but they were profoundly depressed okay so that's one category person now the other category of person wasn't like that at all they had no relationships they had no stable marriage they had no friends they had no job they had no their educational history was fragmented at best they had no plan for the future they didn't have a life now both of them were miserable and maybe even equ in in in an equivalent manner but the first group of people with a function life was very much unlike the second group now what I noticed and I've never found any literature directly pertaining to this maybe you know of some I found in my practice that if I recommended to those clients the ones who had a functional life that they try and anti-depressant it was often likely to have relatively miraculous effects whereas the people in the second category the anti-depressant could maybe help ameliorate the worst of their suicide side liation and possibly tilt them a little bit more in the direction of positive motivation but generally speaking not a very effective treatment now and logically because if all those things were absent the mere offering of a biochemical treatment wasn't going to you know provide someone with no partner with a highly functional marriage so and I think in that differentiation we can also see a distinction between the biological and that would be what was hypothetically plaguing the people with functional lives and the and the conceptual because it was the absence of the ability to go about forming all those relationships say and pursue all those Pathways in the latter case so the first thing I'd like to ask you is for your general thoughts about that diagnostic approach to distinguishing between the biological and the so-called psychological and then well and then how you go about doing that because you already pointed out that you accept the distinction between biological mental illness let's say and well conceptual disarray something like that or or lack of skills yeah so I I think you just did a great job of articulating that framework that I just outlined that there are some people who have brain disorders their brains are doing things that don't make sense they don't make Common Sense the first person that you described or that first category of people you described it doesn't make sense that that person's depressed they've got a good life everything's going well for them and they will often even say that they will say I don't I don't know what's wrong with me doctor I don't know what's wrong with me my wife loves me my kids love me I have a good job we finally saved up enough money to get that re that vacation home that we wanted my I just got a promotion at work by all intents and purposes I should be happy and I am miserable and I feel like a burden and I don't know what's wrong with me please help me I would argue that person has very likely has a brain disorder the pathways that are hardwired in the brain to trigger the depression response are malfunctioning they are misfiring they are causing ing the sensations and all of the experiences and perceptions of depression when they shouldn't be and here's an easy analogy so there's you know all humans will experience pain pain is a normal human experience if we injure ourselves we will feel pain if we get surgery we may have prolonged and extensive pain those are not disorders they cause suffering and people often want help for that and people often want treatment they might even take pills for it or they might need physical therapy or something else um so it's not that we don't treat pain it's not but we but they don't have a pain disorder and then there are other people who have pain disorders their pain system is malfunctioning and causing the sensation of pain when there's no clear good reason for pain so that gives us a framework of you know normal and extreme like when if you get surgery you may have extreme pain but those aren't disorders and then somebody who's got a pain disorder where they have chronic unrelenting pain for no good reason their pain system is malfunctioning and so that that first category person I would say their brain the networks that cause all of the different experiences of depression those networks are malfunctioning that they are either overactive or underactive depending on what symptoms we're looking at but they've got a a malfunctioning brain that is causing the experience of depression the second category that you mentioned the person whose life is just a a tragic mess they have NE they've never had anything good going for them they don't know how to create a good life they don't know how to take care of themselves how to have good POS positive relationships maybe they have no purpose in life those people will in fact experience depression and if they don't experience depression that in and of itself is a disorder anybody in that circumstance should in fact be depressed the human brain is hardwired to make that person depressed because the human brain is trying to get that person to get a life to integrate themselves into Society so that their tribe so that other humans actually accept them integrate them into the culture or the tribe or whatever we want to think about it and so that and that creates safety that we as humans are supposed to be connected with others and that means that we are supposed to be connected not only in terms of loving relationships or work relationships but we've got responsibilities we've got responsibilities to ourselves and to others and if we're not participating in that culture in that society that means we are an outcast we are being shunned we aren't integrating there's something wrong and and those people will and that's a danger it's a danger well so one of the things I let me let me ask you what you think about this I mean so one of the so you know there's a relationship between the degree to which a given brain is likely to produce serotonin and the relative social status of that person so higher okay so and this is gerine biologically to the problem that you just described because it turns out if serotonin modulates the magnitude of pain-like responses to negative circumstances to stress let's say and if you're low status which means if you're low status you're more likely to have an exaggerated response to stress and that can kill you across time that's very well documented very high relationship between relative social status and risk for mortality um but the reason for that and you're pointing to this because someone might think well you know your claim that you need to be integrated within a social Community is just an arbitrary claim there's nothing based in reality about that that's just a it's just a it's just a supposition of normality and there's no reason to assume that it's related to mental health but the reason that's erroneous is because you are much likely much more likely to have opportunity and to have security of the genuine sort so that's the kind of security that can save your life if you have a very well-developed and functional social network and you're very well regarded and respected and integrated within that and as you intimated we do have systems that perceive that and that causes pain in in the absence of that and that is definitely a contributing factor to depression that's not some arbitrary moral presupposition it's hardwired into the fact that we are incredibly interdependent and social creatures and that's so much so this is something for everyone to think about too we're so wired to need that social harmony and interaction that we can even punish the most vicious and psychopathic antisocial criminals by putting them in solitary isolation so even those guys can't do it alone okay so depression can be a valid marker of the inability to be integrated right and it can become counterproductive even under those circumstances but the condition in itself just like the condition of pain isn't an indication of pathology so okay so let's talk about differential diagnosis So Okay so we've already agreed as far as I can see that that that there's a difference between a physiological disorder and a more abstract or mental disorder now the other thing I tried to do in my practice was to rule out the physiological before proceeding with the psychological okay now you pointed to a bunch of potential contributors to the physiological so let me list those and then maybe you can tell me if I missed any if you dispute any and how you go about that diagnosis so here's some things that can make you mentally ill apart from the contents of your thought or perceptions um we know that depression is associated with often associated with markers of excess immunological activity so if you're if you're in a cyto kind storm you can get depressed there's all sorts of dietary reasons that we could delve into there's all sorts of illnesses that can produce depression as a side effect um there's an issue of adverse response to medication um it might be that you're in bad physical shape and need to exercise more and some people are more prone to depression in the absence of exercise there's a huge um potential complication of toxin exposure uh environmental and otherwise and then there's the associated problem like one of the quick Pathways to depression especially if you're biologically tilted in this direction is to drink to relative excess three times a week because then you're always in alcohol withdrawal okay so another thing that a good diagnostician should do is think well this person presents with depression but maybe they're ill and here's you know 10 things we should look at to rule that out so so so tell me what you think about that and how you go about doing that when you're actually seeing your your patients so I think all of the things that you mentioned are absolutely spoton I think that they can all play a role in the physiological brain disorder type of depression that all of those things can result in the brain malfunctioning and producing the experience of depression when in fact the person doesn't have the psychological or social reasons to necessarily be clinically depressed um you know you mentioned medical diagnosis I think and and that's a very broad field because numerous medical conditions are associated with increased risk for depression all the way from all of the neurological disorders epilepsy Alzheimer's disease Huntington's disease Parkinson's disease to to hormone imbalances hypothyroidism or low thyroid hormone women's hormones a lot of women experience mood changes mental health symptoms just around the time of their menstrual periods they may have significant changes around you know around the time of pregnancy and immediately after pregnancy um and they can have significant changes around the time of menopause men can experience similar symptoms if they have low testosterone so there are a wide range of medical conditions that can all result in the exact same symptoms of major depression and that in my mind is very curious and we in the mental health field just shrug that off but what it suggests is that all of those things are somehow connecting through some common pathophysiology yeah yeah and and in my mind that is actually a really important clue to solving the puzzle of mental illness like what causes mental disorders what causes this tremendous suffering in millions and millions of people around the world how can we develop better treatments by recognizing that all of those things must share something in common to produce the exact same constellation of symptoms that's actually really useful information and in my mind the Common Thread is that they all impact metabolism and more specifically these tiny things

physiological causes for exacerbated pain sensitivity let's say and and the entire depressive spectrum of symptoms but not not precisely on the metabolic front so when so why why did you given the plethora of contributors that we've already discussed to the problem of depression and then the broader problem of mental disorder why did you feel that concentrating on the metab abolic on metabolic dysfunction per se was the most useful tack to take and and maybe so let's do two things why don't you tell us in some real detail what you mean by metabolic disorder all the way down to the mitochondrial level with perhaps an explanation of the function of mitochondria and then tell us why you think that's particularly worth worthy of focus given all the other contributors maybe as a common final pathway even given all the other contributors to depression yeah so so right now if you ask the leading psychiatrists in neuroscientists in the world what exactly causes mental illness and and we can stay focused broadly on all of the mental disorders or we can just hone in on major depression that first category of depression that we talked about that somebody they don't have a reason to be depressed psychologically or socially and yet they're showing all this the signs and symptoms like what is going on if you ask the leading people they will say yeah it's just too complicated nobody can figure it out but we do know our risk factors and we talk about this bioc psychosocial model of risk factors and we say that there are biological things neurotransmitters hormones genetics that play a role but there are psychological and social things people can develop mental disorders like the brain disorder type typ of thing from prolonged trauma or social adversity in childhood or um loneliness and disconnection and that those things also contribute to Mental Illness but exactly how do they come together right now the leading people will say no one knows it's too complicated the way that I came to metabolism is because I had some really important kind of pieces of information that were quite shocking um that I was actually using dietary strategies pure Serendipity I did not set out to do anything special but I was changing people's diets to help them lose weight and noticing dramatic Improvement in psychotic symptoms and mood symptoms and other symptoms so okay so you came at this you you started to understand this because you started to examine diet and you were examining diet you were examining diet why exactly what was just to help people lose weight this will take me on a tangent from the question that I'm going to come back to you asked me a question I'm going to come back to it but uh the the this tangent is that I had this patient with schizo effective disorder he had been my patient for eight years schizo effective disorder is a cross between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder this man was tormented and disabled by his illness he had chronic hallucinations delusions he was paranoid he was convinced that everybody in the world was out to get him people were laughing at him spying on him trying to hurt him he had tried 17 different medications none of them helped his symptoms um he had gained a massive amount of weight and as for my help to lose weight and I put him on a ketogenic diet to try to help him lose weight and within two weeks Not only was he starting to lose weight but I not began to notice this powerful anti-depressant effect in him and the shocking thing that led me ultimately on this path was that about two months in so it doesn't happen overnight but about 2 months in he starts spontaneously reporting that his hallucinations and delusions are starting to go away that that man went on to lose over 160 lbs has kept it off to this day s years later he was able to do things he hadn't been able to do since the time of his diagnosis he was able to go out in public and not be paranoid he was able to complete a certificate program he was able to perform improv in front of a live audience he teaches karate now now he was able to do things that were all but impossible for him and somebody with his diagnosis and that initially I was just in disbelief I couldn't believe what I was seeing and I'm thinking this this can't be happening kitso effective disorder doesn't get better and it certainly doesn't get better from a change in diet what on Earth is happening so I initially set out on a journey need to understand what on Earth is the ketogenic diet doing and I was quickly led to its use in neurology so although a lot of people know the ketogenic diet as a fad diet or a weight loss diet it's actually a 100-year-old evidence-based treatment for epilepsy and it can stop seizures even when medications fail to stop seizures and the reason that's so important to me is a psychiatrist is because we use epilepsy treatments in Psychiatry every day in tens of millions of people we use pills that were originally designed to stop seizures and we use them for a wide range of mental disorders including depression anxiety alcoholism dementia and schizophrenia bipolar disorder and others and so initially that was a really important connection because I thought well maybe that's why this this diet is changing his brain symptoms is whatever it's doing to stop seizures maybe that those same processes are also reducing his psychotic symptoms like reducing excess neural activity for example if you because you could imagine that that delusional state is a I I'm not saying this is the case but you could imagine that it is the case that it is a consequence at least in part of excess neural activities now if you have too much neural activity you're going to get the electrical storm that characterizes epilepsy but you could imagine that a man could be in a psychophysiological neurophysiological condition where the spread of ideas around the core idea is too rapid and too wide and that you know that a delusion certainly looks like that to some degree especially a paranoid delusion and you even see that to some degree in depression because in depression one sad idea will trigger an avalanche of sad ideas so so so well just a thought with regard to the potential overlap with epilepsy okay so you started looking at the dramatic as you pointed out dramatic effects of ketogenic diets on epilepsy treatment and started to think if that given that that dramatic effect on brain States exists which is clearly documented right and no one disputes it that there's no reason to assume that there couldn't be more subtle but still important effects of dietary transformation and then you became partly convinced of that as well because of the I mean the story you tell of that one client that's a ridiculously dramatic story because skitso effectiv personality disorders are notoriously difficult to treat skitso effective disorder is a complete bloody catastrophe because it has all of the aspects of Personality Disorder that'll produce social alienation plus all the intense suffering that's characterized is the whole hallucinatory nightmare of delusion so it's a very very serious personality disorder Neuropsychiatric condition and then you saw this dramatic transformation in this one individual not only on the weight side which is dramatic enough and unlikely enough given that most people never lose their weight right they'll lose it for a time but they gain it back and more and also the cessation of the symptoms and also this makes it even more complex because it took 2 months this is not an easy thing to discover right I mean the person has to be pretty damn committed to the dietary transformation and also unlikely to cheat in the interim so okay so you you you you encountered those let's return to the metabolic story and so so initially well and I want to back up just a little bit and just forgive me but I want to just correct something that you said so because I'm talking about schizo affective disorder which is really the fullread cross between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder oh so oh so this more than the personality disorder opposed to the personality disorder which is schizotypal Disorder so he had oh I see so you it was even more serious it was even more serious he basically had full-fledged schizophrenia and full full-fledged psychosis full-fledged psychosis and I see oh okay and so as I went on you know initially I'm starting to use it with other patients and I'm seeing equal equally transformative and sometimes even more transformative results so I know I'm on to something but I also recognize nobody's going to believe this nobody in the medical field is going to believe that a diet could change something as devastating as schizophrenia so I need to come up with at least a potential mechanism of action I need to understand enough science to to be a able to make the case to be able to report this in the medical literature and so the great news is that I had two bodies of literature to call on so there's an entire body of literature in the neurology field on how on Earth does the ketogenic diet stop seizures and there are all of these known mechanisms of action including changes in neurotransmitters um changes in the gut microbiome decre ining inflammation um all of these things but one thing stuck out at me it improves mitochondrial function and it B which basically means it improves brain metabolism the other body of literature that I had to look at though was the schizophrenia literature and the bipolar disorder literature to see well what do we know about the neurology the Neuroscience of those disorders and is there any overlap and and the the widely held view is that schizophrenia is just too much dopamine it that's what that's what schizophrenia is too much dopamine but that didn't sit with this this kind of observation that the ketogenic diet is dramatically reducing symptoms the dopamine thing didn't fit in and so I had to look elsewhere and I was led to this entire body of literature two decades long now documenting that mitochondrial problems May in fact be the central root cause of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder okay let me let me ask you a question there so well the dopamine hypothesis has been around for a very long time and it is the case and it's been a while since I reviewed this so if if I have if there's anything that I'm saying that's no longer like that's out of date let me know um part of the evidence for that was that at least with some forms of schizophrenia you could exacerbate the symptoms with amphetamines and that you could also produce amphetamine related psychosis that's part of the body of evidence the other part of the body of evidence is that the antis psychotics the major antipsychotics do seem to work like anti- cocaine or anti- um amphetamine and they do quell the more forid symptoms of schizophrenia especially in its acute manifestations rather than the sort of burnout schizophrenia that's characteristic maybe of the much longer term illness so so and and so given the prevalence of that hypothesis and the support for its validity did you see any overlap between the metabolic hypothesis and the dopamine hypothesis like is the is the dopaminergic malun function in your estimation a secondary consequence of a deeper mitochondria malfunction or do you think that the dopamine hypothesis is more something you know more akin to observation of a symptom pattern rather than the core cause because no one knows why the dopamine system disregulation anyways I think that's the key is that you know so first and foremost I want to say that everything that you just said is true and that is in fact the basis for the dopamine hypothesis however it doesn't fully account for all of the information that we currently have we know that serotonergic antidepressants things like proac and zolof can also exacerbate psychosis in people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or other disorders we know that sleep deprivation can exacerbate psychosis in a wide range of people C certainly people with schizophrenia but even in normal healthy people if we sleep deprive them long enough they will begin to hallucinate or have delusions so that that starts to suggest wait serotonin now plays a role and sleep deprivation how does that all fit together is that does that all converge at dopamine it does not it does not converge at dopamine however if we think about well what could cause dopaminergic neurons to be overactive and spew out more dopamine than they're supposed to be spewing out then we actually come back to the mitochondrial or metabolic theory that I'm proposing the metabolic Theory can actually explain to us exactly why neurons might be overactive or the Neuroscience term is hyper excitable but we've got Decades of science neuroimaging studies cell biology studies and others where we know for sure that people with these brain conditions have hyper excitable neurons that there are parts of their brain that just start firing when they should not fire kind of like a pain cell starts firing when it shouldn't fire and and so if in order to understand well what would make a cell start to fire for no reason what would make it hyperexcitable or overactive we actually can turn to the metabolic or mitochondrial Theory because that actually connects all of the dots that can help us understand why would Zoloft or proac cause psychosis that can help us understand why would sleep deprivation cause psychosis and it certainly confirms what you outlined why would amphetamines or cocaine cause psychosis um so I think that you know the way that I came to this is I started looking at the entire field initially just trying to connect the dots for how on Earth could a ketogenic diet stop psychotic symptoms and somebody who presumably had a lifelong genetic disorder that is what most people think of as schizophrenia it is a lifelong genetic disorder it's permanent it's fixed there essentially is no hope for this person so I'm trying to understand how on Earth could a diet do that as soon as I put all of that together though and started focusing in on mitochondria and Metabolism I started branching out because to other diagnoses and the reason I started branching out to other diagnoses is because because we have a problem in the mental health field although we have all of these nice diagnostic labels like schizophrenia or bipolar or alcoholism or anorexia or OCD and we pretend that they are all separate and distinct disorders the reality is that a lot of the people that we treat in mental health clinics have more than one of those diagnostic labels it is rare for somebody to have schizophrenia and only schizophrenia almost always they have schizophrenia and some substance use problems and some OCD oh and depression well wouldn't you be depressed too if you had schizophrenia and oh and anxiety well wouldn't you be anxious if you had skiz I we we rationalize it away but it cuts across all of our diagnostic categories that there's this overlap and so I so I started looking into is there any any meta is there any evidence that metabolism or mitochondria could play a role in these other mental disorders and at the end of the day what became overwhelmingly clear is that we for decades have been accumulating this evidence and nobody to date has really put it all together but it is in fact a way to put all of the evidence that we have accumulated for decades it's a way to put it together and have it fit and have it make sense but once you understand that science it leads to solutions that may actually help people heal and recover from disorders that we are currently telling people are lifelong incurable disorders starting a business can be tough especially knowing how to run your online storefront

First the fact that there's a tremendous amount of comorbidity or diagnostic overlap between the hypothetically separate categories that we describe as the various mental illnesses now we know that's true not least in the fact that for the mental illness to come to the attention of a um of a psychiatrist or a psychologist or an MD for that matter it's usually a consequence of the exacerbation of negative emotion and the decrease of positive emotion so there is a place where there's immense overlap right because it's just not a problem with the possible exception of mania it's just not a problem that comes to people's attention unless one of the major areas of overlap is a preponderance of negative emotion the suffering we described but then you describe that even more densely pointing out that these hypothetically separate diagnostic categories when you when you when you aggregate them they have a tremendous area of even symptomatic overlap I know for example can't remember the study now but showed that if if you do have a person with a so-called personality disorder imagine you could make a list of all personality disorder symptoms and the one thing you would get to know from that list checklist was how many symptoms the person in front of you had that's a much more useful prognostic indicator than diagnostic category right so there's tremendous overlap of symptomatology now you think that points to an underlying commonality of cause right and that and that and you're hot on the trail of this metabolic insufficiency so let's start if you would walk us through what the mitochondria do tell us why deficits in mitochondrial function like what they would produce because well one of the things that happens just as you age is your mitochondria start to become less and less effective so and not everybody who ages shows signs of mental disorder although depression and pain Etc associated with aging are far from uncommon so take us down to the mitochondria tell us what they do tell us how that would manifest itself in Neuropsychiatric disorder and then maybe we can move to that because the next question is okay fair enough why does the keto diet specifically work and is that the best of all possible intercessional diets then we can think about well where should that also fit conceptually in the Armament of Diagnostic and treatment practices okay so let's start with what do mitochondria do so most people who have who are even familiar with the term mitochondria know them is the PowerHouse of the cell and what that means is that they take food and oxygen and they turn it into ATP um so mitochondria are the things that are actually using oxygen so we breathe in oxygen and we breathe out carbon dioxide mitochondria are using that oxygen and they are producing carbon dioxide that we breathe out mitochondria are taking the food so we have you know our digestive tract and other kind of enzymes throughout our bodies that are breaking food down but ultimately most of the food at least 90% of the food that we consume ends up inside MIT mria so mitochondria are the processors of food and when they get food they convert it into one of three things there I could probably come up with more categories but I'll one of three things the three things are they converted into ATP which is the power unit of the cell and that's why they are called the PowerHouse of the cell they're creating energy or ATP the second thing that happens to food that we consume is it may not go all the way to ATP it we might just break it down into smaller molecules and then we use those smaller molecules to produce enzymes or proteins or neurotransmitters or hormones or cell membranes so our bodies are in fact composed of food that we ate the food that we eat gets broken down and it turns into our cell and our neurotransmitters and everything else and the third thing that can happen is that mitochondria actually can sometimes divert that energy and instead of making ATP or you or making molecules to build cells they make heat and in fact mitochondria are the reason we are warm-blooded animals without them we would not be warm they they can subtle they are the things that are making heat if you get a fever they are creating that fever if you're too cold it's because they're not firing enough there there's something wrong with their kind of um system that's what most people know research over the last 20 years has completely shattered that simplistic notion of what mitochondria are and this is the reason so some people ask like Chris Palmer how on Earth are you coming up with this and if it's really true why hasn't somebody else come up with it part of it number one a lot of other people have kind of sort of come up with what I'm arguing and they are hot on this Trail and continue to be hot on this Trail so I am not alone but one of the reasons most people have not put it together is because this is a Cutting Edge area of research over the last 20 years not really in the mental health field it's more in the obese field the cardiovascular field the Aging field the Alzheimer's disease field all of these are looking at what do mitochondria do so that they can better understand their their kind of diseases and let me just give you a brief snapshot of what mitochondria do and you'll begin to understand how it starts to connect the mental health field mitochondria make and and they help create regulate and release neurotransmitters including serotonin dopamine neopine phrine Gaba and in fact those neurotransmitters then impact mitochondrial function so it's a two-way street the neurotransmitters affect mitochondria mitochondria are making and releasing are helping to release those neurotransmitters mitochondria help control the expression of genes from the cell nucleus that's the whole area of called epigenetics mitochondria are Central to epigenetic expression in cells mitochondria help turn inflammation both on and off mitochondria control the first step in the synthesis of some key hormones including cortisol estrogen testosterone so we long known that HPA axis kind of disregulation so too much cortisol or too little cortisol that we've known that that's disregulated in people with mental illness what would cause that disregulation actually mitochondrial disregulation is in fact the leading theory for what could cause that disregulation because they are controlling the first step in the synthesis they are affected by our diet our exercise drugs and alcohol impact their function but here's the kicker trauma childhood adversity directly impact mitochondrial function and health and so it is a way for us to begin to integrate the bioc psychosocial risk factors that we know can play a role in what we call mental disorders in mitochondria their function or malfunction can begin to help us piece the puzzle together okay so let me summarize that and and tell me you tell me if I've got my understanding right so you pointed out that classically speaking mitochondria regarded as the furnace the energy source of the cell and therefore the body have been studied in relationship to their ability to produce from the food we eat ATP which is the fundamental molecule by which we we fuel ourselves let's say and then a plethora of chemicals and molecules and also produce heat now it sounds to me like what you've claimed is that over the last 20 years that chemical and molecular production function of mitochondria has been differentiated and delineated far more comprehensively so now we understand that mitochondria are crucial for the production of various hormones and neurotransmitters they're part of the factory that does that they're also Associated as you said with the initiation and sensation of inflammatory responses and also the regulation of of Gene operation and that's where we got into a discussion of epigenetics so for everybody watching and listening and correct me if I've got this wrong Dr Palmer is like genes are part of the biological code that lays out our physical pH psychop physiological function from the ground upward genes can be turned on and off and they're turned on and off according to environmental demand there's other reasons they can be turned off and on but that's one of them and so you're pointing out that mitochondria are play a role in the switching on and off of genes like they do in the switching on and off of inflammation and the production of hormones and neurotransmitters so that's another reason why delving into the cell down to the level of the mitochondria is a good place to be looking for the common pathway that we're searching for with regards to the generation or the initiation of mental illness okay so I've I've got that right yes that's that is that a reasonable okay so then let's go to okay good good well let's then let's go to diet now I want to lay out another question for you so as you may know or may not know and the same would apply to people who are watching and listening my family has been experimenting a lot with a radical keto diet and that an all beef diet with salt and there's a variety of reasons why it's all beef which I won't go into but here's the fundamental issue from the scientific perspective and you can tell me what you think about this more broadly and why you're investigating a keto diet which is less strict than a carnivore diet so one of the things we thought and experimented with when we were trying to sort out my daughter's autoimmune illness was well see we had her tested at one point for allergies to foods for example and the basic test came back and skin test and showed she was allergic to everything now we thought well what's the probability that she's going to be allergic to everything it's like that just seems un unbelievable but I did know at that point and this is to your point with regards to diet one of the most reliable treatments for arthritis and this works with virtually everyone is if you fast your arthritis goes away now the problem is it comes back when you eat anything it's like well wait a second anything is a lot of things so then you might say well if you were going to investigate a potential dietary link with pathology you'd want to find the simplest possible we had are on some like so-called elimination diets but they made no conceptual sense and so what we decided on eventually was to search for the simplest possible diet that could actually sustain you over some reasonable period of time now a carnivorous diet can do that as we know from the Inuit for example and the mai you can live virtually Forever on a carnivorous diet now the advantage to that diagnostically is that it eradicates a tremendous number of variables right and so you could try a carnivorous diet if it worked you'd know that diet is a reason and then knowing that it worked and being in a condition where now you've recovered to some degree you could conceivably add Foods back one by one and see if you could regenerate the symptoms now I'm I'm curious what you think about that practically and as a diagnostic and step or and a step in scientific reasoning but also how you see the relationship between that extremely restricted diet and the keto diets that you described it's it's a really important question and um and it it gets a little more complicated than sometimes people talk about it so bear with me so the the ketogenic diet and certainly a carnivorous diet like you just described is probably a ketogenic diet um unless you're eating very lean meat if you're eating meat with fat ribeye steaks other types of meat if you're frying it in beef Tallow or anything like that it is a ketogenic diet as well and I just want to start with the observation that a Keto enic diet is actually trickery in a way it's tricking the body into thinking that it is fasting when it when it isn't fasting oh I didn't know that oh that's very interesting and so you also get all the advant do you get the advantages of of what is it I can't say it properly Auto autophagy autophagy absolutely self devouring yes so it does mimic fasting it does mimic fasting and that's actually yeah okay so that was actually the basis for the development of the ketogenic diet originally is that a a neurologist 100 years ago he knew that fasting could stop seizures but if you fast people for too long they starve to death and it's a really bad treatment so so right so he actually tried to figure out is there a way to trick the body into thinking that it's fasting get those benefits of fasting but not have the people starve to death and like you said is there a way to actually provide adequate nutrition and when we're thinking about these interventions in children with epilepsy for instance we not only need to think about adequate nutrition we need to think about nutrition that can help those children grow and Thrive and gain weight and develop their bodies like they should and so it was this ingenious neurologist who developed the ketogenic diet for that purpose and and so first and foremost I want to say that there are kind of two big issues one is that some people are allergic to things that they are eating or maybe they are having a toxic reaction to things that they are eating and we can get into processed foods and all of the artificial stuff and and and that is absolutely happening in some cases and therefore the treatment plan with that model in mind is figure out what the problematic foods are eliminate them from the diet and then you're good to go but actually fasting and fasting mimicking diets like the ketogenic diet like your dog 's kind of heart lion diet that she's the the lion diet that she does that that is actually mimicking the fasting State and what that's really doing is is it's actually changing metabolism in the entire body it is dramatically reducing inflammation it is highly upregulating autophagy and from my hypothesis really important something called mitophagy which is mitochondrial repair so it's basically getting it's getting rid of old and defective cells but also old and defective cell parts including defective mitochondria that when you're in this fasting state or fasting mimicking diet State your body is doing all of this repair it's getting rid of old parts and then when you eat replacing them with new ones and that can actually have profound healing potential independent of whatever you were eating whether you were eating a healthy diet or an unhealthy diet or anything in between okay okay those benefits can be helpful to people and the the fascinating thing people have known this for millennia every culture on Earth pretty much just about has used fasting yeah is a healing intervention or a religious intervention was often paired with healing yeah for Millennia hypocrates knew about this Jesus knew about this to in in one of the versions of the New Testament his disciples called him to say this child is seizing and we are praying and it's not stopping this child they thought it was demon possession actually so they describe you know frothing at the mouth and demon possession and they said you know Jesus we're praying we're praying and it's not working and he said this child needs fasting plus prayer and the fasting plus prayer stopped the seizure stopped the demon possession so this has been known for Millennia that fasting can help and it's people back then weren't eating processed foods so it's not a processed food problem it is it is a physiological way to induce healing and you basically are tapping into the body's innate ability to heal and repair itself that's what you're doing when you fast the 40 days leading up to Easter lent starts on Ash Wednesday that's February 14th this is a time of intense prayer fasting and giving Hallow's

and not eating and the not eating periods are are the repair periods and so in a culture like ours where you can eat any damn thing you want all the time and everyone does what that implies is that not only are we making ourselves obese and and and increasing our proclivity to diabetes at a rate that's absolutely staggering but we're also perhaps never allowing ourselves to enter into the bio biological condition that's associated as you said with the repair processes that go all the way down into the cellular and now with regard to the relationship between fasting and the ketogenic diet is the ketogenic diet a sufficient replacement for fasting or a carnivorous diet like is do you know maybe we don't know this yet are there benefits to ceasing food intake alog together that can't be acred from merely eating let's say a carnivorous or a keto diet there are and um and even the even the epilepsy researchers have found this and they were initially a little surprised um that that was the case but fasting is in fact different than maybe the carnivore diet which is different than a ketogenic diet which is going to be different than maybe a whole food plant-based diet or or the paleo diet or the CrossFit diet or whatever diet you want to talk about um and the reality is th that range of dietary interven iions can play a role for different people and people don't need the same dietary intervention for their whole life necessarily so sometimes you can do a fast get some healing or repair or just a reboot if you will and that may be enough and there are plenty of health and fitness gurus who say that they do a two or three day fast once or twice a year for that reason that they are trying to stimulate autophagy they're trying to reduce their risk for cancer based on this science we don't have long-term studies to know for sure if that really works but the science suggests that it might but I think I think other people in fact are really sensitive to different types of foods your daughter is a perfect example of somebody who might be sensitive and she may do best with an all meat diet and a very simple diet and are there other things that she might be able to eat and remain healthy there might be but she would have to go on that kind of exploratory pathway and one at a time introduce a new food and see can I tolerate this food can my digestive tract tolerate this food do my autoimmune symptoms start coming back when I eat this food or not and and so I think first and foremost I do want to just point this out that I think that there's a range of options for different people I'm not here to say there's any one diet for all human beings because I don't believe that there is one and only one dietary pattern that's optimal for All Humans I think different people need different diets or can benefit from different dietary patterns at different times in their lives and depending on what health conditions they have and I think on one hand that's really hopeful and useful on another hand some people get really frustrated with me because they say Dr Palmer just tell me what to do exactly and I don't I don't know them at all and they're just on social media or whatever and they tell me exactly what to do I'm like I don't know you I don't know your health conditions I don't I don't know what your digestive tract is like I don't know what your food preferences are how should I know what you should eat it doesn't mean it's not a solvable problem it is a solvable problem it's not rocket science it really isn't rocket science your daughter has put out amazing information for people very practical stepbystep instructions for people who want to try her dietary pattern to see if it might help them there are other plenty of other people who also put out similar kind of instruction manuals if you will how to follow a whole food plant-based diet how to follow this diet how to follow that diet so what I would encourage people to do is kind of experiment figure out well what works for you what are where are you at in terms of your health what sits well with you what are your overall fit what are your overall fitness goals if if it's a if it's a man who's trying to build a lot of muscle and he's working out a lot he needs more protein if if he really actually wants to achieve building muscle you can't build muscle from nonprotein kind of plant sourced Foods you just can't um so it's a range of options but we have enough science we have more than enough science for me to be able to say it is very clear and understandable why your daughter experienced such tremendous health benefits by doing the diet that she did it is not quackery which I know people ACC I I actually well no wonder your daughter I mean because well because it's so Preposterous like it it took us a long time to swallow the fact that first of all she couldn't eat anything and my my wife and I basically have the same diet I mean it's a very radical solution and everyone should should be skeptical of radical Solutions but so let me agree with you for a second and then point out a potential area of confusion or disagreement if you don't mind sure well you pointed out very clearly that the advantages of a reductive diet are twofold one is you may well be um not able to tolerate a given food so your body's actually treating it like a toxin and that's going to be a more or less serious problem for all sorts of people in different ways in relationship to all sorts of different foods okay so a restricted diet can enable you to start to evaluate where you might be reactive um and then there's a separate set of benefits that go along with the keto diet SL fasting and that's the that's the encouragement of a autophagy say that again how do you say that so autophagy mitophagy autophagy it's and mitophagy yes okay so you want to initiate that now the the the point I I'm less I'm more confused about is you said there's there multiple Pathways and that there is a point in experimentation and I agree wholeheartedly with that but the practicalities tend to get in the way you know and so the reason that we concluded that it was worthwhile let's say to publicize the carnivorous diet is because it's actually it's the fastest and simplest way to reduce the variable problem to Unity it's like okay if you just eat beef that's all you're eating it's one thing and you can do that for a long time that seems to me to give you the optimal chance to experiment because when we played with like the uh I don't remember what the other diets were called um there's one fmop f is that right fmop diet fod map yeah fod map fod fod map diet right well it made no sense logically and there were still things within it that looked very contradictory so so I understand your impetus your your your insistence on the utility of experimentation and your proclivity to presume that there's no one siiz fits-all solution but we have said that having said all that a keto diet and a carnivorous diet does produce autophagy and mitophagy and that's a very necessary thing and it also is a very simple approach even though you know it's behaviorally comp and that's a problem cuz it's actually hard to only eat meat so so what do you think like what do you think are you willing to speculate on what might constitute a reasonable generic approach to dietary experimentation because it is a complex thing to undertake so I completely agree with your approach and your kind of I agree that a carnivorous Di diet May in fact be the gold standard Elimination Diet to see to see if to see if a change in dietary pattern can produce the health benefits that a person is seeking um the reason I'm hesitant to recommend it for everybody is because I already know the nutrition experts will vill vilify me along with you and Michaela and others and and so I want to throw are those the same experts that recommended the food pyramid don't get me St don't don't even get me started on that because that food pyramid really messed up my own personal health but um but so for the people who say well no there's no way I'm only going to eat meat then I I I want to I want to at least meet them where they're at and say fine you don't have to only eat meat there are lots of options you could try the fod map diet you could try other diets you could try a whole food plantbased like I don't want to give up on them and I don't want to let them know that it's like carnivore or nothing so I want I want be able to understand however if somebody is really really sick and needs an a drastic intervention doing a water only fast Maybe with some electrolyte supplementation and other things doing a maybe a medically supervised even because if this person is really sick they're already down and out and so maybe we need to monitor them but doing a water only fast is really the ultimate Elimination Diet because we're eliminating all food we're really letting the digestive tract rest and repair if the digestive tract is inflamed we're allowing maybe that inflammation to subside we know that there is a gut brain connection and that that plays a role in a wide range of mental disorders all the way from autism to depression to anxiety to schizophrenia to binge eating disorder to bulimia nervosa like there's a wide range of mental disorders we have growing a growing body of evidence that the gut actually problems in the gut get transmitted through the vegus nerve and through other endocrine pathways through serotonin actually and other Pathways up to the brain and that that directly impacts brain function and or brain metabolism brain metabolic function which then impacts neurotransmitters and everything else so water only fast would be maybe the most Dam drastic intervention but again you can't you can't fast for too long because you're going to starve to death and I wouldn't want to do that in an underweight person and this the second best version is exactly what you've described the the Lin's diet which is meat just meat beef alone it's enough nutrition to sustain a human there will be people already I can hear people already saying fiber fiber is really good Dr Palmer how dare you get rid of fiber or this is I'm not saying you don't need it if you don't produce much waste and you don't produce much waste on a carnivore diet and well and so the thing is is I think you're right though that if if somebody's really in trouble with serious symptoms or if somebody just wants to do maybe a one month or three Monon experiment to see will this improve my symptoms I would actually encourage people to give it three months right that's about what we've concluded too it's about three months do a carnivore diet or or a ketogenic diet if you don't want to do that because I have some patients who you know I've talked about the carnivore diet with them and they're like no way no way I'm like okay well let's do a therapeutic ketogenic diet the therapeutic ketogenic diet I can solidly stand behind and the reason I can solidly stand behind that you know the carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet but there are other variations of ketogenic diets and the reason that I can solidly stand behind the ketogenic diet is because we have an enormous evidence base all the way from animal models cell biology models to human clinical trials of ketogenic diets for seizures for weight loss for type 2 diabetes for type 1 diabetes for kidney disease for cancer and other conditions and we have good evidence that a ketogenic diet can in fact be safe can be highly effective for many of those conditions and and so I just stand solidly behind that science or on the shoulders so to speak of that science but I don't disagree with you in terms of what you're saying about the carnivore diet and some of the benefit well and well also I should say too like as a behavioral psychologist I mean there's no sense suggesting something to someone they won't do so if you can generate a plethora of Alternatives some of which aren't quite so extreme and they might work more power to you so okay so let me ask you a specific question I have a specific reason for this so I'll start with a bit of a proma so my wife had a very rare form of cancer a bini tumor in her kidney and the 11mon mortality rate for bini tumors which have only been reported about 200 times is 100% And she lived through it now she had surgical interventions and it's a complex story but we believe tentatively that the reason that this didn't kill her apart from the surgeries and various other factors that came into play was perhaps because she was on the carnivore diet and very and very religiously so to speak now I have a more personal reason as well more specifically personal at the moment for asking you this question um I know of someone who's in very deep trouble who's suffering from cancer and I'm wondering you know if you have a loved one who's Afflicted in that way and they're starting to run out of options by the way on the treatment front and facing the proliferation of their cancer I know you can starve cancers so as a practicing physician at what point in the progression of cancer do you think it's reasonable or unreasonable to say look you got nothing to lose from a water fast for three days followed by like a month or two months of pure carnivore diet and then we could re-evaluate your circumstances at that time and so what because I'm C I'm thinking about having a chat with this person about exactly this and so I'm wondering like what do you have to say I'm not a physician right and so I'm wanding out of my territory to some degree on the dietary front although that became necessary for all sorts of reasons but I'm also extremely interested in the Neuropsychiatric implications so what do you think on the cancer front so I'm not an oncologist so so I want I I want to say for the record this is way out of my territory and I've I've actually been asked this question by some close friends even should I do a ketogenic diet I have cancer I'm fighting cancer I'm going to do the Cho or radiation or surgery or whatever but should I also do a ketogenic diet and and my my honest advice is because I am out of my area of expertise I really encourage people to work with their oncologist fair enough and the reality is that we we have an increasing number of clinical trials that are ongoing right now where they are adding ketogenic and other dietary intervention to the chemotherapy or radiation or to see if in fact it may play a role and we know that you know in general my sense from the published literature um Dr Thomas cied is kind of an expert in this area of ketogenic diets for cancer what's his name Thomas CED s y f r i e d I think um Thomas Cy and he so he's written a book on cancer is a metabolic illness in general once cancer gets started at that point it's probably too late for a dietary intervention in most cases to cure the cancer however we have strong reason to believe and this is why these clinical trials are getting started we have strong reason to believe that a a dietary intervention like a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet or water fasting or intermittent fasting may slow the growth of that tumor May and and slowing the growth of a tumor gives us more time to do the definitive intervention to get that cancer out of that person's body well also there's good evidence that fasting reduces chemo and radiation induced nausea so that also makes the treatment more tolerable at least in principle absolutely and and these dietary interventions are decreasing inflammation they are decreasing insulin and insulin is a growth factor and it is a growth factor for tumors as well so again we're basically doing everything we can to try to slow the growth of this tumor while the oncologists are trying to kill the cancer with surgery chemo or radiation and it you know it sounds you know thank you for sharing your wife's story it's it's a really well it's an anecdote you know but anecdotes are good well look man they're not data but they're good sources for hypothesis generation I think they are great sources they are fantastic sources for hypothesis generation and again you anybody who says well that's just an anecdote I would want I would want you to push back and say no actually there are clinical trials underway and that is not anecdote anymore right she she is an example of a scientific theory that is progressing through the oncology field F already so anybody who tries to say well you know that's just an anecdote well no it's not just an anecdote there's a tremendous body of science there are clinical trials underway now there are animal models supporting that ketogenic and other dietary interventions can slow the progression can actually shrink tumors um the reason I'm hesitant to say cure is because so Dr cyre the reason I brought up is you know he has published a couple of case reports in the medical literature and there was one woman who had what was built is an incurable brain tumor a gleo blastoma and she went on a very very strict medically supervised ketogenic diet calorie restricted even and in fact her gleo blastoma shrunk to the point that it was undetectable but after about N9 months so they thought maybe she was cured cuz it shrunk a lot she stopped the diet the tumor came back with a vengeance and she died so I just point that out that I think that we still have to encourage people to work with oncologists and try their best to kill all cancer so so maybe we could close the this off well first of all we can close it off if you have anything else that you need to bring to people's attention but one of the other things I'd like to hear from you you know you told that story of your patient with schizo effective disorder and his remarkable recovery with regards to his accompanying obesity as well as his mental illness what else have you seen that was part of what motivated you to pursue this so assiduously tell us more stories well so I can tell you lots of stories but I don't want anybody to come away from this thinking this is anecdotal anymore right for me as a professional it started with that anecdote it is no longer in the realm of anecdote anymore we have hundreds if not thousands of patients with bipolar disorder with schizophrenia with chronic unrelenting depression with OC D with anorexia nervosa with alcoholism for God's sakes of all things we have people with all of these different diagnoses who are coming out of the woodwork sharing their stories of recovery and sometimes remission some of these people are able to get off all of their psychiatric meds and remain in remission um we have clinical trials underway at least I think 15 clinical trials underway now at Harvard Medical School at Oxford at John's Hopkins at UCLA at UC San Francisco um and many other institutions literally around the world we've got clinical trials underway so anybody who wants to say well this is just anecdotal ex evidence no it's it's Way Beyond anecdotal evidence now at this point but the stories that I want to share that I just alluded to a woman who had bipolar disorder had become psychotic when she got manic so awful awful illness she is sharing her story publicly about how the antipsychotic medications and mood stabilizers that she took made her clinically obese made her gain massive amounts of weight she felt awful she had lowgrade depression she was plagued with recurrent suicidality after starting some of the medications that she had to start and she has now put her bipolar disorder into remission for over two years she she heard about me she heard me on a podcast she has read my book she implemented the treatments that I've outlined mind and she is off all her medicines in full remission I have literally I have thousands of people reaching out to me for help so I should say for the record unfortunately for your listeners I'm not taking new pages or consultations I'm really sorry because I've I've literally got a weight list of over 2600 people already but I have treated I've treated patients you know one person in particular I can share their story publicly because they are very public already so I am not breaking any confidence they are billionaires literally billionaires their son had bipolar disorder a really bad case of it he had tried 29 different medications in in and out of hospitals in and out of Residential Treatment programs seeing the best bipolar specialists in the world and they as a family he is an individual she as a mother we're told in no uncertain terms your son has treatment resistant bipolar disorder he is going to be disabled for life you need to accept that he is going to be sick for the rest of his life you are in denial your denial is the problem stop denying that your son has a serious mental illness and he's never going to get better just accept it and move on they came to me about three years ago now saying we heard about you and this diet and bipolar and we we're we're not giving up yet we're not ready to give up even though everybody's trying to encourage us to give up will you help us I talked with them I met with his treating psychiatrist and we partnered together because I'm in Massachusetts there in California so I wasn't legally allowed to treat him as the treating psychiatrist so I was a consultant it is now 3 years within 4 months of starting a ogenic diet his bipolar symptoms were in full and complete remission he is off of probably 75% of the medicines that he had been taking so he's not completely off medicine at this point but he is slowly but surely tapering off but he has not had an episode since he does not have bipolar symptoms his illness is in remission he has finished College he works fulltime time he has a full life he's excited to be alive and this was a man that was being told by the best experts they were they are billionaires they had access to the best of the best and the best of the best in the mental health field were encouraging them to give up hope they were encouraging them to just give up just write him off just accept that he's going to be disabled for life life and they refuse to accept that and he's living a new life now and so they have created a nonprofit organization called metabolic mind they have funded I they don't share their financials with me but to the best of my knowledge at least probably $70 million of research now focused on bipolar disorder and metabolic strategies they are really help helping to move this field forward and we've got an international team of psychiatrists neuroscientists mitochondrial biology experts metabolism experts all working together to move this field forward I just got a major gift a $3 million gift from a different philanthropist to start a new program at mlan hospital the metabolic and mental health program and oh yeah we are going to be launching this so for people who listen to this and are skeptical I get it you have every reason to be skeptical this is new and shocking information and I am and I am trying to encourage people to not give up hope I am trying to encourage people that even if you're told that there is no hope that you just need to accept that you've got a chronic horrible debilitating illness and that's just the way it is I want you to rise up I want you to learn more about this work I want you to learn more about what you can do and I want to empower people first and foremost with hope and then with knowledge and then with practical strategies that they can Implement just like you and your daughter and your wife and others have implemented you take control you learn things you take control and sometimes it really works out beautifully and people get amazing Health outcomes and that's the way it should be hey Dr Palmer that's a very good place to stop and so we're going to stop with that um thank you very much for taking my questions and walking everyone through that congratulations on the new gift and I'm very much looking forward to seeing what's H what happens with your Center please don't hesitate to stay in touch and let me know whenever you come across something that you think is new and particularly compelling I mean this is a ridic I mean I've seen literally hundreds of people on my tour now who've come up to me in the meet and greets afterwards and have said you know I've lost 150 pounds in the last 10 months people told me that was impossible I've got my life back my psychiatric disorders are in remission I'm wondering maybe this is a closing thought tell me what you think about this because I think we're at this point and I think this is perhaps what you're pointing out my sense is that with the really severe mental disorder so intractable depression especially in the absence of Life circumstances that would point in that direction manic depressive disorder the the serious psychosis that as mental health professionals as Physicians our primary assumption at the moment should be that these are metabolic related or other physiological disorders until there is compelling proof otherwise 100% I am firmly committed to that and again there are de there's Decades of science to confirm this the neuroimaging studies all of the genetic studies when they look at the genes that increase risk for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and when they look at what do these genes do guess where they converge metabolism and mitochondria it's not it's not dopamine it's not serotonin it's metabolism and mitochondria and in many ways this is a game Cher and the reason it's so important is because there are solutions available today like dietary strategies that people can implement we don't have to wait 50 years for some novel treatment to work its way through the development and kind of you know review process with the FDA we don't need to wait we've got things we can do today all right sir well I'm going to continue my discussion with Dr Palmer on The Daily wire plus side of the interview dividing line let's say and so uh I want to find out from him a bit more about what shaped his interest in the medical community in medical practice I want to find out why he focused on Mental Health I want to see what his vision is for his new center into the future and so on if you're inclined to join us for that additional
