jay mazzini's wife has been arrested and it's a story you're not going to have expected in this video i'm going to talk about what happened who's responsible and what it means let's go ladies and gentlemen welcome to coffeezilla home of the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host the internet detective now ladies and gentlemen before we go any further don't forget pump the stock pumpzilla uh that means smashing like and subscribing it really helps the shareholders thank you for doing that now let's jump into this jay mazzini was a popular instagram star known for his supposed philanthropy he was always doing but in reality he was running complex fraud schemes including fake giveaways a fake capital management scam and a bitcoin scam which he was charged for by the fbi now we investigated him and our story was a huge success we exposed the scam as it unfolded we have a whole playlist where you can watch all those videos um here and the fbi press release ended up sort of sounding a lot like our victim stories to be honest which was incredible to hear those victims justified but in the end the final episode was about jay mazzini himself getting arrested but not just on those bitcoin charges for kidnapping charges actually see jay mazzini had become increasingly erratic as the walls closed in around him and right before the bitcoin charges landed he allegedly kidnapped a person who will remain nameless here but he he kidnapped this man and basically it looks like uh beat him up here he is right here this is opposed by ballerbusters showing the aftermath of some of this stuff i mean you see cuts on him a pretty big bad cut or bruise on his head even you know what's been eating me alive about this case and the reason i haven't really addressed it too much yet is that i actually spoke to the kidnapping victim only days after he was attacked and we recorded an exclusive interview but unfortunately he got kind of cold feet about it going public and so it has remained unreleased so to be respectful of this victim here i haven't talked about any of this until today but now with new evidence coming out and jay mazzini's own wife getting arrested i can't stay silent anymore about this i will only be speaking about the public record of what we know about this kidnapping story because we do know a shocking amount and so this is the press release i want to share with you guys today wife of instagram celeb with all that background jailed in plot to kidnap terrorized new jersey man who kid who trashed him online that was the guy we were just showing right there the one that was kidnapped um here is the mug shot right alongside jay mazzini's mug shot and this is just insane i mean this is the daily voice but we also got a press release from bergen county which is the same place jay mazzini was arrested out of and it basically says that the wife was arrested on july 14th here's the press release arrested on july 14th for conspiracy to commit kidnapping not only that on july 22nd she was also charged with witness tampering and bribery holy crap so this one she didn't even just get the kidnapping charge she also got a witness tampering and bribery charge so obviously the question is who was she bribing what are we talking about here apparently several accomplices including this guy repeatedly tried to bribe the kidnapping victim into dropping the charges said the prosecutor so that's what she's in trouble for her along with other people are charged with trying to bribe this guy right here who got beat up by jay and uh i guess his squad his goon squad and now obviously that's a really stupid thing to do after you kidnap somebody and your husband goes to jail for it then to try to add bribery to the list and then you get arrested so that's pretty dumb so then the question is how bad was the kidnapping if they're willing to bribe someone to drop the charges well there's actually a lot we do know about the kit uh the kidnapping and so i'm going to share that with you right now just so you have some context for how bad this thing really was again this is from the daily voice they did a good story on this igbara that's jay mazzini picked up the 25 year old victim at the 7-eleven on palisade avenue in fort lee on march 15th on the pretense of wanting to talk over coffee the victim who'd apparently trashed him online apparently got hinky okay uh when two of igbarra's associates got into the 2020 land rover so he got off and sped off in his own car the crew chased the victim down beat him shoved him in the back of uh ibarra's suv the complaint says they stripped him naked held a machete to his neck and told the victim to remove negative social media posts he'd made about igbara it says this was about social media people like what where has society gone that social media is causing this come on dude you've gone too far listen if you're chasing someone down kidnapping that person machete too much they also um threatened to kill him if he went to the authorities and said that a video of the kidnapping would be released to social media if he didn't do what he was told according to the complaint now remember just a few sentences ago they said they stripped him naked so that might be related to like that we threatened to release this on social media i don't know why they would incriminate themselves like that that's pretty stupid though anyways finally they dropped him and his belongings in the city of uh passaic the victim was hospitalized with a concussion a swollen eye a left ankle injury and various other bumps cuts and bruises the authorities said wow no wonder they wanted these charges released these are horrific juries aren't going to look too kindly on this stuff and again it seems like this is all about social media posts which is just like go touch some grass dude go walk outside reset jay mazzini really had gone too far he had really um gotten so erratic by the end that he would do this stuff it's frankly unbelievable and you know what's worse to know of course is that his wife was involved because now her charges accuse her of conspiring in this kidnapping a kidnapping that we know include violence a machete and according to the press release this is just in the press release the victim was also whipped with a cord-like object and the very fact that his wife is being charged with this it seems like she knew and participated in some of the bribery turns this whole thing this whole this whole case from a crime of maybe passion a non-premeditated crime into something that looks much more insidious much more disgusting and frankly unforgivable it looks like a premeditated attack on this man and um you know my heart goes out to the victim i do hope he's doing well that said ladies and gentlemen i just wanted to give you guys this brief update to let you know what was going on i've stayed silent mostly on this because i wanted to respect the people involved and their wishes but given now so much of it has just entered the public record i wanted to update the story on this so like i said guys just remember that everyone is innocent until proven guilty but um i do hope they face the fullest extent of the law that's all for now thanks for watching see you next [Music] all the time you said you'd save but what a shame what a shame you're a fraud are you the same as so you're saying no you're not okay bro know your story made up apologize but really somehow [Music] i can't believe it still the truth you need a spill you proof the greed is real you can't delete it chill from the start it was doomed i heard
