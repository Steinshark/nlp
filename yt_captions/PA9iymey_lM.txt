[Music] ah the internet there is no shortage of controversial opinions out on the internet of course you can always find great analysis and awesome thoughts and wrap-ups of things everywhere but tucked into the corners and in the comment section there's always just a couple extra little controversial fun statements people are willing to throw out into the world the hot take now I love Hot takes because they are guaranteed to ruffle some feathers and get people worked up but also by definition there's got to be just some some element of truth to it just just a little hint of Truth so today I've gathered some of the hottest takes for you guys from around the tech world and we're going to actually see if they are good takes or not also shout out again to Jimmy highy roller for the initial concept and the inspiration for this series if you haven't already seen his NBA hot takes they're hilarious they're incredible I'll leave a link below go watch them and also I'll leave a link to the Chevron sweater below because it's the perfect time of year to get one of these things okay let's jump in to the hot takes so here's our first one cybertruck Tesla cybertruck isn't as overpriced as everyone says it is for everything you get with the price you pay and you know this is a fun one I like this one this you know if you if you search up Twitter or threads it's not very hard to find a lot of harsh reactions to the Cyber Tru right it's it's obviously not a cheap truck it's an expensive truck but also Al I think the key with this one is this has got to be the biggest Delta between what was promised and what was delivered from Tesla on paper I've ever seen like it was a massive overpromise under deliver moment for them like if you literally go back and and watch the 4-year-old event now when they first unveiled the cybertruck and the specs they had all the stuff on stage they were saying 0 to 60 and as low as 2.9 seconds up to 500 plus miles of range 14,000lb toone capacity 3500 lb Max payload capacity and starting at $39,900 that seemed killer but today the new specs are out and the truck that's actually starting to ship now in 2023 is 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds which is it's crazy it's a party trick but then up to a maximum of 340 Mi of range 11,000 lb towing capacity 2500 lb payload capacity and starting at $60,000 going well up into the six digits so when you compare what we were promised versus what they actually delivered Not only was it late but it just feels like oh this this thing is crazy overpriced now I would have been happy with a $30,000 truck with hundreds of miles of range but now they're trying to sell us 300 mil for 100 grand like that seems it feels overpriced but if you compare it to the exact competition in its segment other electric pickup trucks that are shipping right now let's say then it actually kind of Falls right in line I mean there isn't really things that we're talking about here it's F-150 Lightning and rivan r1t and the Hummer EV pickup truck that's kind of it and it's right in line with those so I'm not going to be counting the Silverado pickup truck because again they have a promise but they're not shipping it yet so just for truck shipping right now either they're all overpriced or none of them are and that's not even mentioning any of the other Innovations related to the cybertruck that might have taken some serious R&D whether it's the durability or the 800 volt architecture or the steer by wire system that that's first in any truck we've seen if people care about that stuff at all I actually think the real honest take for me anyway is that if this if this cyber truck came out this week and didn't have that announcement event four years ago with all those over promised specs it would have been a much more universally uh interesting car it would have been very very exciting for a lot of people in a way that it isn't now because it had these promises that weren't met so that's my argument for not announcing things until you right about to be ready to ship them cybertruck isn't overpriced maybe but probably overhyped good take all right next one the iPhone Mini would have been the most popular phone if it had the battery of the max this one will never not be funny to me because there there are always lots of when I ask for hot takes there's always a lot of like this gadget was the best of all time versions of that sentence and seems like the manyi iPhones just have this like cult following where everybody loves them now they only produced this thing for 2 years it was the iPhone 12 mini and the iPhone 13 mini and they were definitely great now yes the iPhone 12 mini did have a tiny battery and some real battery issues that came with it some of that was fixed with the 13 mini but it felt like the second it was announced and people started reacting to it it had this like this cult like fan energy where when it went away you would have people believing the only reason it went away is because fitting that amazing flagship phone and all of that capability and such a tiny body would be a battery sacrifice and that's the reason they didn't keep doing it uh but they would be wrong I mean they'd be right about the fact that there is battery sacrifice but look I love small phones as much as the next guy I give a trophy out for the best small phone every single year but the simple fact of the matter is people just don't really buy small phones like when given the choice it just feels like people think they're getting more value or they just prefer the bigger screen whatever it is but people are just gravitating towards the bigger version of phones in general but then on top of all of that just have a look at the arc for the most popular iPhones ever like the best sold iPhones of all time it isn't the newest iPhones it's the iPhone 6 like we're talking in their absolute Peak like 200 million plus units sold of that phone so in a lineup of several other iPhones like it was the 12 mini and the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max there was no way even if you had world class battery and the best everything and a dozen other exclusive features like there's no way the mini would have outsold the bigger phones it was Noble of Apple to try but it underperformed so much that it is even below Apple's expectations and they they discontinued it and literally replaced it with the 14 Max the opposite of the mini iPhone cuz people they want big phones so yeah all all the takes about the mini iPhone being a great idea and being one of the most well-liked phones ever are true but once you add the it would have sold a ton part that's that's when you lose it bad take okay this one hear me out 4x3 is the best aspect ratio for most video content so okay yeah that it's clearly a pretty crazy take but the reason I I likeed this one and picked it out is because think about this for a second back in the day not even five six seven years ago I was super against vertical video like if I saw someone taking a video or a photo like this i' be like hey just just turn it like that like the widescreen video the video I'm shooting right now WI screen the only debate was like what's better 16 by9 or a little wider 2x one what's your favorite everything was horizontal video and that made so much sense today in 2023 I've had to soften my stance on that because look the default for most people now when they go to take a video is this and then there's Tik Tok and Instagram reals and YouTube shorts and even if you're just somebody texting someone a video from your phone to someone else they're going to view it on their phone like this so just people just take vertical videos by default now so it's kind of hard to argue vertical video has its place and so now it feels like there there has to be some sort of compromise like how do you just decide on one ideal video format and I'm not saying 4x3 is it but what I am saying is if I could only capture video in one aspect ratio from now for the the end of time from now till I die I'd probably take something closer to squarish so that I could either crop it horizontally or vertically to its appropriate medium does that make sense but I think the tiebreaker again just to level it back on Earth here is the future seems like it it might actually be going back towards horizontal because of all the VR headsets all of the spatial video and all of the horizontal video that works with VR headsets fun fact iOS 17.2 just came out and there is a feature in the video formats where you can start shooting spatial video on your iPhone I think it's only the pro iPhones first of all you can only watch those spatial videos in the headset the Apple Vision Pro but the other key is when you go to shoot that spatial video on your iPhone it requires you to turn it horizontal again because it's using the horizontal distance between those lenses for the videos it's taking to match the distance between your eyes and that's why it gives that spatial video effect so spatial videos are going to have to be shot horizontal as as long as camera orientations look like this so I don't know 4x3 it's just kind of a a general square tall wide aspect ratio it doesn't mean it's the best aspect ratio to shoot but I'm just saying if I had to shoot one I don't know it's a it's a bad take but it's a good take but it's a bad take all right hot take if Apple came along and made dedicated gpus it would be over for everyone else wow so this it's an interesting thought initially anyway kind of more just because of the fact that there are lot of things like if you're Apple if you're a multi-trillion dollar tech company like there are lots of things that people want you to make that you don't make lots of things cameras cars printers and so it's pretty fun to to let our mind wander and wonder if Apple made some other thing would it also be this super premium well-made amazingly performing thing so we did get the moment where Apple silicon was a gigantic leap for Apple especially for the laptops like we went from Intel chips and discrete gpus to all of it including the GPU baked into one chip and those laptops having amazing performance and great efficiency awesome does that mean that if Apple made their own GPU would also be amazing no matter of fact Apple's just never really been into gpus in the first place and to this day they now make an M2 Pro Mac Pro Tower with a bunch of PCI slots in it with a tiny tiny tiny list of supported gpus for very limited functions they really are not into discret gpus now I think I think you could argue that if they made their own discret GPU graphics card just for their own Mac like the Mac Pro and you could slap that thing in it could probably be awesome it would probably be amazing it could perform well for whatever functions they've designed it for but that take said it would be over for everyone everyone meaning Nvidia AMD heck even Intel makes gpus now and they all make those for PCs and if you think apple is going to come along and make a great GPU for a PC I just I I just don't see that happening I don't think it would be over for them I think they'd be totally fine so yeah I'm going to say no shot bad take all right this is one of the best ones I think it sparked the most conversation at the studio a flagship Smartwatch that doesn't have a 3 plus day battery life is unacceptable looking at you Apple so strong take take true but also not really true I think the obvious rebuttal is okay you're saying it's unacceptable but the Apple watch is the most popular Smartwatch in the it's the most popular watch in the world and it has a two day a one and a half day battery life so clearly people do accept it right but why do we accept it it's not good like that's at the very least we have regular watches have superlong battery lives months and years obviously but they just tell the time they don't do much but there are even SmartWatches out there that have weeks long battery life months long battery life I just reviewed the cmf Smartwatch which is under a 100 bucks 69 bucks and that thing has a five six 7 Day battery life if you just treat it like normal and there's the Garmin SmartWatches that have all these GPS functions and features and they're pretty big but they'll last weeks at a time so then what is the deal it feels like a 3-day two day or like a one-day battery life for a smartwatch kind of is unacceptable right but then I zoomed out a little bit and actually mentally just try this for a second second just replace the word SmartWatch with smartphone just think about it okay 3day battery for a smartphone would be pretty good because a decade ago a one-day battery life for a phone was nice and today a full day battery life on your phone was nice so manufacturers have clearly they haven't stopped trying to improve on Battery Technology that improves all the time but they also have kept aiming for that one day point over and over again because it's accepted and continue to make the phones more powerful more capable more useful brighter screens better cameras all that stuff that takes more power as long as they can still hit the full one-day battery life it will be accepted that's like the industry standard now and I do feel like with enough volume Apple has kind of decided the same thing with the Apple watch if you go back and watch old presentations with the Apple Watch series 7 Series 6 Series 5 Series 4 every single time they quote the same thing 18 hours of battery life and if there was enough push back and if people didn't accept 18 hours I think they would push for 24 full hours 36 full hours but because people have accepted it they've started to push on other things like the always on display a brighter display a faster processor more sensors more powerful more unique more capable as long as they can still hit that acceptable 18 hours and people accept it it kind of reminds me of this beorn tweet uh about how his Nokia 2310 used to last a month and now phones these days only last like one day like how are people really happy with a one-day battery life and it's like yeah you're right you're definitely right about that but also that was a Nokia 2310 it didn't really do anything like it had a postage stamp size screen and probably three or four colors and about 75 pixels that of course that phone lasted a month if you use a phone today it's doing a lot more things so if you want to use a noia 2310 today by all means go for it and you can still get a regular watch but if you want a much larger screen if you want fast processing a whole bunch of sensors the Health Data the smart stuff that happens with an Internet connected computer and you want it to be small enough to fit on your wrist well you're going to have to charge it every night and people have accepted that bad take all right that's about all the time I got for this one but I think this is pretty fun I enjoy reading your guys' hot takes because some of them are are crazy hot but some of them are kind of cold it's just let me know if you have any more in the comments below I would love to continue this series and react to more good internet Tech hot takes until the next one catch you guys later [Music] peace
