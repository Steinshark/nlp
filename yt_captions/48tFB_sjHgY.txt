PDF has established itself as an interchange format now did people get it straight away as to what it was for was it like postcript was relatively a howling roaring success from day one I mean people couldn't wait to buy postcript in 1985 I I'm not kidding they were pressing checks into Steve Jobs and John wal's hands saying how much how much I want that now and I want it quicker next year wasn't like that with PDF wasn't at all this was brought home to me in the most amusing but at the time scary way um in I think it was the mid 90s my guess would be it would um be round about 1996 I was visiting Adobe fairly regularly doing lots of stuff with them on PDF and so on and uh on this particular occasion San Francisco immigration gets hold of my passport and said purpose of visit sir business or pleasure and I said well it's business oh which company you're visiting I said uh oh it's Adobe they're in San Jose now oh that's interesting so what work are you doing with them I think it's the usual thing that we all get used to is are you an illegal immigrant are you actually working for Adobe or are they paying you um so are you an employees sir I said no no no it's just we're interested in the same things we're doing research and I'm just here for for a a catch up and various meetings with people as to where we are with our project um and he said but what kind of work do you do with adober and I said well you may not have heard of it but they do have um a product a format if you like called PDF and you can read it with a free thing called Acrobat Reader and his face froze and I thought oh dear I he took his glasses off he put them down and he turned my passport to her put it to one side and said sir that PDF what is it for I just I'd heard similar things from other people I just grinned I said well do you want the five minute story or the one hour story I said I'll try and keep it as brief as I can I said to her look you know you probably exchange documents with people and you've been Cho you've been told you should use this root PDF and use PDF as your standard interchange form he said yeah yeah that's quite right we can't understand why we can't just send each other word files and I said well you'll know some of the problems sending each other word files everybody's got a slightly different version and oh dear some people have running it on Mac toos and not on PC and it doesn't look the oh tell me about it he said and I said well and and then there's the refus Nicks who say Word Perfect is far better and I absolutely refuse to use anything from Microsoft or whatever oh yeah we got a few of those as well so I said well the thing to remember is it is about document exchange but it needs to be ideally you want a a general Solution that's of high quality that could serve all sorts of other use cases just consider newspapers they want something which is accurate and will print out on a enormous sheet of paper but yet they want to preview it at smaller sizes and they want one document to fit a whole load of sizes and resolutions and to move seamlessly between them taking quality all the time that it doesn't start breaking up even if you inflate it to the almost the size of a barn door and I said newspapers really really value that capability of it and he said so like they have a route to this PDF I said yes they've got to have a route to PDF and I said the other people let me give you one more example I said is that many of my colleagues think it's just magic for output from a program called AutoCAD as a you know computerated design it's used could be used for Architects drawings could be used for electronics engineering circuit diagrams but the great thing for them is that when you scale it up to a different size it keeps the quality and by that I mean that if it's drawn as a nice smooth looking Circle at this kind of size you scale it up and the circle still looks like a circle it doesn't start breaking up into dots it's a graphics model it's a sophisticated scalable Graphics model inside the thing and that's why Engineers love it as well and at that stage it was the like a great grin came over his face he said sir puts glasses back on sir thank you so much for that thank you thank you took my passport back welcome to the United States sir so I went away thinking I'm not too surprised by that a lot of people really don't get it don't understand what it's for and I did think I don't think it was quite on that trip it might have been the next year that I'd been involved uh with Adobe on and off for many years but particularly in early 93 John warno and his colleague Chuck gesi chose us here at Nottingham to be one of the first be to test sites for PDF and I think it was maybe the year after my interaction with the immigration official and uh went to see John I said first question was I said John PDF how is it going he said David it's a long long long uphill struggle and I said yeah I can tell it's not been kind of the overnight success that postcript was and he said no it isn't and he said and if you want to ask me how much I've spent already on PDF the answer is $100 million it dawned on us straight away if we want people to adopt PDF you absolutely have to give them a reader and it must be free the moment you start charging for it people will just refuse and will not use your format so he said we've had to live with that but he said I'll say it again we are sure we are right so I went then downstairs to uh talk to my colleague K who I think it was my Leo on person at the time and told him this story he said David those of us on the technical side of things we know that JN and Chuck are absolutely right but said I have to tell you that within this company there's Jitters there's nerves because particularly among the sales staff you see they say we don't get any bonuses out of PDF people don't understand what it is you know and all that please put me in charge of Photoshop I'll make loads and loads of money and bonuses out of Photoshop and I said yeah it's understandable and having heard from friends at Adobe about how being in charged of Photoshop was deemed to be the real oh no I thought well you know the measure of PDF success is going to be when if ever will its sales revenues overtake those of Photoshop and the answer to that I think it's in I've got a book somewhere called the Adobe story I think it was April 2004 when finally PDF revenues overtook those from pH Photoshop in my visit round about that time uh great hilar the Photoshop mobs I recall were on the lower floors of the Sant building around about 4 to six or something like that the PDF acrobat post group people were much higher up floor was 11 and 12 the top management John and Chuck and so on were up at the top of the tower and uh I was told when I got there that to Great hilarity the moment the sales results were announced and PDF had over and acrobat sales had overtaken Photoshop large quantities of champagne were sent from floor 4 up to floor 12 with ribbons and congratulations cards and the message was the pressure's on you now have a nice day the other two canisters are actually butane cylinders uh which were discarded and um they act kind of like a um gas capacitor they're called accumulators and they store gas close to where it comes out so that it can come out quickly
