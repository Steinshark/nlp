how do we make these videos who is on the Mr who's the boss team what do we actually do with all the tech that we buy I had a lot of questions about what it's really like to be a YouTuber so here are the 60 most surprising things that I've never told you before my biggest fears are spiders and Heights this is what happens if you put me in a fighter jet is not the first business I've ever ran when I was 12 I set up my first online store I'd buy toys in bulk from China for a discount and then sell them individually on eBay and then every time I'd sell out my stock I'd place an even bigger order and get an even better price per unit and this is not even the First Youtube channel I've set up before Tech I was really into animation I'd see people making all these really cool stick figure fight sequences and I tried to make my own on my little HP laptop keyword being tried and it's not good it was only when I got to 14 and my brother bought me my first ever smartphone funny enough using his first ever paycheck that I just fell in love with it and realized how passionate I was about tech that's when this Channel and everything else actually kicked off which is a good reminder to not expect things to work out on your first stab at them and then the first product that I ever got for free to test was about a year and a half after that it was an Android Tablet from the company anal which I was very careful not to mispronounce I get a lot of questions about my family so my mom came to the UK from India when she was 15 and it was very tough right like you had to do your exams you have to do your degree in a language you didn't really get while juggling a job so you could afford to stay there so mum what's your fact my fact is I'm just I'm just the two very gifted child it's lovely thank you and my dad came from Leicester which if you know the UK is basically just India again okay so Dad tell everyone a fact about you I'm passionate fencer is that why there's a sword in your office yeah it kind of helps me Focus you get to the point [Music] textbook dad joke really isn't it my biggest pet peeve is when people don't bring their charges with them when they go places on the bright side I carry like three power Banks and probably like nine cables wherever I go so was it USBC and you just I fidget but when I fidget I don't bite my nails or pull my hair I just keep flipping my phone in the air my brain has zero idea I'm doing it and it seems to put everyone around me in a persistent state of anxiousness I mean the way I see it this is an ongoing durability test I am working right now my favorite snack is always cereal It's Not Unusual for me to have like three bowls in a day obviously cereal goes in first milk second I'm not a psychopath before we had WhatsApp and iMessage whenever someone would text me with something that didn't specifically need replying to like I'll pick you up from the station I used to just reply to them with the word scene which in hindsight I probably could have just said thanks my teachers at school used to find me really annoying not because I used to mess around but was in any way cool but because I used to ask questions about everything I didn't stop asking questions until I understood the topic from every single possible angle you could look at it from and I guess that's kind of the feeling that I try to give you when you watch our videos now the entire base of our operations for literally everything we do is my old bedroom in my parents house it's kind of funny because we've had like Tech CEOs come over news reporters and every single person walks into this room takes a look around and it's just like this isn't it right the room only has 12 square meters of usable space but I love it it's the perfect example of just work with what you have fancy studios are fun but you don't need it so when we film our videos I sit here and Josh over there basically moves between each of these two seats to get to the two secondary angles problem is there isn't enough space to navigate so once every three videos we knock the camera sorry and it takes us a full 30 minutes to get it lined up so everything's symmetrical again oh my gosh you've actually properly that's a shocker actually now's a good time to meet the team they are all here we need a bigger room so this is Josh he does most of the filming you hold yourself to a very high standard right you like every shot to have meaning Josh and I do a lot of late nights together as well we get excited about certain video Concepts we decide they need to go out soon and we don't sleep till they're done Josh is showing me his fact now are you looking for Milo so Josh's fact is about how much Milo loves him and he can't find Milo he's not here Josh so then this Joe is who is the first person I ever hired and you've actually taught me a lot about what looks good in a video and what doesn't because I could not edit before you started my fact is Barack Obama follows me on is it well Twitter or x what do you want to call it wait Barack Obama follows 553 000 people yeah fan then there is Alex who is the most technically proficient person I know I feel like you use scientific methods to calculate like the perfect color grade for each scene at least I try we also are pretty convinced you work for some sort of Secret Agency I'm not gonna say anything about that what is your fact so I actually made this crazy python script that from now on can just edit our video for us what did you just press the button it takes a couple of seconds and um what have you done it's all ready so then there's Mark who is a very funny guy edits a lot of the more Whimsical videos lots of fact about you I hate myself in a video you hid yourself yeah I made myself look really old was that you I thought it was your dad no I mean he he left the work so that is the long form video team but there's more people that we need to make sure that all the other stuff happens for example Connor so Connor is a writer and researcher you've spent a lot of time looking for a lot of the weirder products that we feature in our videos yes I've been very desensitized to the internet lots of fact about you I play the diatonic button accordion and that is so then there's Jack who is shorts master so he I do feel like shorts Master today but Jack is insane like he plans the shorts he comes and films the shorts he takes the shorts away he cuts them he edits them it is a lot for one person so what's your facts I am the cookie Master no you've been saving those oh you still use the boss cookies this is not free it's like what's coming to Josh um Jack brought cookies he was hiding them this whole time we actually have something very special for Jack that we're just about to give him now we've just worked out that Jack himself because he owns shorts has managed to get us a total of 10 million subscribers between our shorts Channel and our main Channel Jack we have something for you so this was the entire team's idea because funnily enough the shorts Channel combined with the main Channel has just hit 10 million subscribers this is heavy our way of saying thank you amazing I never thought I would if I get one of these smash that you smashed it and then the person who keeps it all together oh I just I just swiped you there so Joseph is our everything man we want to book a location for a video he's on it start a fire so we can test a fire extinguishing what's the fact about you in my first week I was fantastic to go to North Carolina to film Mr Beast there's like a b cam secondary cameraman so if you didn't like that video oh how it was shot I'm sorry that was like our best performing video ever good job I didn't spend any money from this channel buying fancy clothes or fancy cars for myself I actually don't even own a car literally all of my top 10 biggest expenses have just been on things for either this Channel or family but hypothetically my dream car would be the Lotus Evita it just looks like a spaceship it's insane one of my favorite things to do if I get a weekend off is it's very weird it's process refinement so I'll look at things that me or someone in my family currently does and think how do we make this more efficient like I just recently realized how much time it takes to move the lawn at my parents house so I managed to find an automatic gardening robot that can do it for them or like am I in-laws's house seeing how much time that they would spend de-weeding their Garden I decided to just kill the weeds once cover the mud with a plastic sheep so they don't grow back and then turn it into a zen-like stone feature I find it really satisfying to put in a little bit of short-term effort to save a lot of long-term effort but there are a few things that I do like to get for myself like my guilty pleasure is probably my Pokemon card collection I've always loved Pokemon and so when you combine my attachments to the brand with this lottery ticket like feeling you get every single time you open a new pack it's hard to say no I'm actually going to Japan later this year mostly just to go to Pokemon stores and Pokemon cafes and then aside from cards I'm also just really into gaming oh it's like our 15th attempt I was so passionate about consoles and games that really that was most of my content when I first started this channel after the consoles I then spent a long time covering exclusively phones like just back to back to back phone videos and Ernie recently thought what if we just tested a gaming video it couldn't just be any gaming video of course it had to be Mr who's the boss quality which meant that I decided to buy every single PlayStation brand new as well as a TV from the time of each one's launch I filmed the entire history and the joy it brought me to see that people loved that video so much that I love too was incredible my actual favorite drink is a thick chocolate milkshake but ever since I did the whole Fitness transformation thing last year we subbed those out for kombucha and ginger ale such kind of funny I buy them in industrial sized batches now my recent obsession is board games specifically Seven Wonders Katan and Ticket to Ride they're all actually strategy games which says something about me my favorite console of all time is the PSP my favorite game on it and the one I've sunk the most hours into is Monster Hunter Freedom Unite I try not to think about what this works out to in days but I do remember being quite surprised to learn that my playtime did pass a thousand hours and then my favorite phone game by far is Bloons Tower Defense 6. I've always loved the strategy that you get with Tower Defense games the idea of being the decision maker positioning and upgrading your forces in the most tactically advantageous way I actually like it so much that most of the videos I watch on YouTube to relax myself are videos about this Bloons game that I play which may sound really weird and sad but everyone has their niches right if I wasn't a YouTuber I could probably be an artist to spend days sitting in fields with my fiance Trisha painting what I see it's a good day I don't know why I'm doing it like this you're right here so Trisha let's get the most important question out of the way offenders I have an iPhone 13 Pro what does that mean yeah that's you I actually convinced you to get an iPhone as well okay she's right we got engaged on the 6th of February 2023. it was a pretty fun video go watch it if you haven't what was it like it was the most unbelievable unreal surreal insane day of my life how many times have we watched the video Back Together We are half of those views sometimes if I want to make her emotional I just play the song that I played at the end of that because he said later but probably the biggest bit of news is that drisha has left her job to join us so he used to work at the BBC then he worked at Tick Tock now you work for Mr who's the boss on YouTube yeah made it round the media world you're kind of like a media Mogul I'll take that we recently did a spreadsheet and we tossed it up how many hours I've been working in a week it came to 90. too many hours you're the big picture creative genius Vision I'm the detail organization love a spreadsheet and now you're on the team what's your fact just gonna be controversial but for me it is clearly milk before cereal oh it's no no it's always better we get a lot of products in for reviews and so one of the biggest questions I get asked is what do you do with all of them well we actually built a flowchart okay fine Russia built the flowchart because I mean she is the most organized person I know so with any given product we can answer a bunch of quick yes or no questions like could this be used in an upcoming video is there a family or team member who would want this and the answer for what to do with it will just pop out the other end for the last two years it's true that Rick Astley has made an appearance in every single one of our videos bar too why well because I'm never gonna I just started a Spotify account which has one song which is the song that I proposed to drisha with I'll leave a link below to follow me so when you see our videos I always try to make sure everything looks neat and tidy and Polished but behind the scenes it's not always a smooth sailing like a while ago we made a video about inventions that were out of this world and what you saw was actually the third time we tried to make that video the first time the cameras crashed and we literally that day had to head into town and go from store to store to store to see if anyone could repair it within a few hours the second time the camera worked but it turns out that we were recording with an SD card that wasn't fast enough to store the quality of footage that we were recording in so we finished the entire video got to the editing stage and then realized we actually had no file or one time as part of a review for a phone we were filming a sponsor section of a case for that phone I was really excited about it because I've been told it's a really great case company but you know as part of our case testing we just kind of casually Chuck the phone around against a tree or against a brick wall so I did that but then the phone in question broke that's actually an underexaggeration IT shattered which meant we had to call off the ads we had to tell the company that we didn't want to work with them going forward and the review we were about to make and had completely scripted we could no longer film not a good day kind of like right now actually there was a time when I got really obsessed with robot dances so I spent a long time on YouTube looking at tutorials trying to figure out how to do it myself and now my neck hurts I am really trying to improve the quality of our top downset all of those unboxings and product shots from this perspective and for that we used to have a tiny little camera that was fixed up here we have just upgraded to a cinema camera resting on a counterbalance jib so you can move it around freely like this and we have also just last week rigged that to basically the best microphone you can get I want to get to a stage where when I'm unboxing a product and recording it that the experience is so visceral that you as the viewer feel like you're there right next to me experiencing it too let me know in upcoming videos if we're getting close to that vision a couple of slightly less fun things about me so I have something called restless leg syndrome which basically means I find it really hard to sit still in one place so you'll constantly find me shuffling and changing positions that's actually a big part of why I have a desk that's both sitting and standing as well as an entire assortment of things for my legs to do while I'm working I also have allergies like a lot of allergies everything from peanuts to soya to Grass to cats which I only found out after it was too late and then recently my body kind of went into overdrive it was really strange but I think just the stress of trying to manage like every single role on this team at the same time it started making me physically react to foods that I was normally fine with just throwing up not sleeping all related to stress so I decided to head to a tech free cabin in the middle of nowhere to try and separate myself from it I went with drisha we locked our phones in a box completely for four full days we went back to basics with a pen and paper and a map as our only form of entertainment and honesty I think it killed me it was one of the best things I've ever done and besides there is just so much to be grateful for like late last year we won the streamy awards for the best tech channel in the world for the second time in a row we just got nominated for the third time and it just gives me shivers thinking about this and then thinking about what I thought my life was going to be when I was 14 and I just started and we just hit 15 and given that it's not just me solo winging anymore I feel like my team has played just as big a part of it as I have so I actually got every single one of us a custom made 50 million sub play button they're really cool they're like Mr Who's The Boss blue they're made of metal I'm pretty proud of this and then the craziest one is that we're closing in on overtaking Apple this channel started by a geeky 14 year old who thought he'd be lucky to have a job could surpass the most profitable prolific Corporation in the world so if you can help us get there well that'll be the most insane thing I've ever witnessed sorry bye love
