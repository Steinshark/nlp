oh yeah do we we've reached it we've reached it boys we've reached Peak terrible internet great stuff if if it's okay with you I'd like to dive straight into it can you tell me about a product that you've launched that you're proud of and why certainly one of the products I'm most proud of is a mobile app that we designed to streamline online shopping for customers it integrated AI driven recommendations and a highly intuitive UI sign did did he say certainly pled interview all right let's pretend let's pretend it's a planted interviewer and it's all fake sure well let's pretend it's not for a second okay let's just pretend that it's not don't you realize that this is just right around the corner this is just right around the corner now here's the best part is that it's not that you the programmer are going to be like aha I'm about to go off and I'm about to AI bamboozle for this job application no that's not what's going to happen that's not where it gets shitty it's going to be the inverse my friends okay it's going to be you sweating bullets getting all freaked out and you're actually being interviewed by an AI real talk like that that to me that's actually the bigger that's the bigger risk we're running into coming up here is that we are going to be getting graded by an AI now think about this think about all these people coming in and and and you don't even know that you're talking to to an AI or not an AI other than the fact that they keep saying certainly dead giveaway by the way certainly uh but like you don't even get graded by a person and remember do you remember Gemini do you remember that it had a couple biases built into Gemini can you not wait for the bias builtin AI robot making decisions for the company on your behalf the racist AI yeah that one that one it is really scary I'm so [ __ ] yeah dude we're all going to get [ __ ] by the by the AI Revolution okay uh but the worst part is it's not going to be like this great the thing is is there's I don't know how I wish I got to figure out how to have like the proper the proper meme format for this still I'm still thinking about this tweet for so long now but there's like the ai ai as what people think it it is currently and it's like this really fantastic brain with a bunch of you know Sparkles you know you know what that mean right there's the AI that uh that VCS are trying to sell you and it's going to be like flying cars you know it's going to be so effing awesome how amazing everything is right but really it's actually not all that awesome at all right on there you go nice car right station wagon and then there's like AI in reality and then it's probably going to be like that that phone cord with a it's probably going to be that phone pull with a bunch of cords we're right here we think it's fantastic it's actually right here but we're being sold this and you know in the future it's going to be this thing that's just going to totally absolutely not quite be that great you know have you ever had like this idea about something you're about to play like some video game that's about to come out or something like that that you have this like really big image in your head or have you ever watched a movie this is particularly true with movies or shows where you come in with this like preconceived notion about how good something's going to be and then it just ends up being absolute garbage Starfield Starfield might be the perfect example of this right you come in with this idea of Starfield and you're just like this is going to be the greatest thing that has ever existed of all time and you get in there and you realize it's just a travel simulator and then you're there you're there just traveling over and over and over go check on the scientist oh there's the scientist hey go pick up this up here we go again and you're just that's it travel loading screen simulator $70 quadruple a game just go get married better it would be better but like I mean that's that's that's kind of how I view the the next like the the next 10 years honestly it's truly how I view the next 10 years is everything is going to be like this like this uh this Aura of being something that's really good or it has this reputation of being something that's going to be amazing but when you actually use it it's just a loading screen simulator I mean Devon is literally a loading screen simulator with 133% accuracy and probably cost $800 per usage like it's not going to be this crazy new Revolution of everything people keep on wanting uh people keep wanting things to be like they keep thinking that things are just going to fast forward really instantaneously and it's just going to be absolutely mind-boggling how great AI is like just think about our entire world like have you ever had a lived experience that's been like that anyways I just you know I watch this and I know people are like losing their crap and all that but I mean real talk tell me just for a second Let's Pretend This was real and you were interviewing this AI remember like remember yesterday when we read these issues going through and how it just started like it just started getting worse cuz remember like as your slightly inaccurate compounds over time that slight inaccuracy becomes an like impact possible golf so even if a even if an llm is Right 99% of the time which it's not remember it's not even close to 99% of the time after 10 Rounds it's it's going to be like 10% off after 20 rounds it's going to be it's going to be pretty dang wrong right like it just starts the inaccuracies start like growing as time goes on yeah it's a stacked buff stacked buff except for inaccuracy we got to go back to flying in candidates for inperson interviews that'd be sweet I mean it sucks I don't want to fly but I do like inperson interviews anyways that's my thoughts on all this stuff type one in the chat if you disagree with me strongly and you think AI is going to change the world completely in one year I'm actually curious is there any person that actually thinks that like any person don't don't no no no I just want I want to see the people that really do okay for the people that really do uh NG whale anybody can can can somebody give me a compelling argument why AI is going to greatly change in one year hell I'll give you two years I'll give you two years give me something any reason why anything that you can point to that actually makes some sort of sense do you agree that in five years no I do not think in five years self-driving in two years I think we'll be closer sure capitalism will keep pushing it further and further yeah sure but that's not that's not real the problem with Moore's Law is that the amount of training and energy needed to expand in AI will grow exponentially I don't think the AI itself and its abilities are going to grow expens exponentially we can't have we can't enough infrastructure to Power City so AI can't do [ __ ] yeah yeah la does have rolling planned brown outs just so you know all right so let me let me say a little something let me let me just let me just say a little something I want you to think about that now okay let's pretend we are in day one and AI are significantly better better radically better 10x better than they are right now and we start integrating them into companies and start making decisions well right away what you're going to have is you're going to have an extremely long period of time of people using it and finding all sorts of failures even at 10x better like insurmountable failures so much effort is going to have to grow and what you're going to see is you're going to see a large Dev team shrink to a small Dev team shrink grow back to this large Dev team trying to figure out what the hell's going on trying to get it an entirely new Dev team that's not comprised of the old set whatever they were right whatever these people were it has been changed this new one's going to be a new set with different sets of talents and skills and we're going to rehire everything but we're still not going to be AI taking jobs it's just going to be AI changing jobs and this will take literally like 10 years before anything happens you got to remember that companies move extremely slow companies don't want their code being looked at by AIS companies don't want any of that to be happening and so there's this like super slow moving like Mass that's just not going to change on a dime and so we got at least a decade before any sort of real change is going to come about from this and then at that point it's going to be such a cluster [ __ ] like Real Talk how many co like seriously how many code bases do you go into that still use react class components that thing's been out of Vogue for almost a decade I want you to think about that functional components came in when 2016 2017 you just think magically the AI is that you're not going to have these weird iteration these weird Legacy issues brought on and understood by AIS dude IM maintain. net 2.0 applications and I had the change to it Rec I'm just saying I'm just saying the world moves way slower than you realize okay the problem is is that so many people's opinions are at the tip of the spear because they're on Twitter you know they're like ah yeah but then you forget that the spear is this gigantic piece of Machinery that's containing every last person this is Twitter this is reality okay this is this is a shitty spear shitty spear okay and so if you think that the world's going to change if you think that everything's going to be different in a year it's like it's not okay fine here people are saying SS okay shut up here super shitty spear there you go sometimes what was the original topic uh the one AI thing we were just looking at here somewhere oh gosh I've lost it this one we were looking at AI interviews and we got to dog whistling and diarrhea well the name is the primin I'm very sorry I am so sorry flip the editor I love you you're great you're beautiful you have wonderful hair you're strong you're lean you're fit you got it all a Jen
