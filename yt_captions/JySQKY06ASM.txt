ladies and gentlemen have you ever looked at someone or something and thought wow I feel so bad for them I really hope it gets better and I sure hope something like that never happens to me well that's what you're going to experience when you watch today's chess video got a game for you that was played between two 700s on chess.com and words cannot really describe what happens on this board uh this is this is really Sensational stuff you know what else is sensational the fact that my book this one has sold over 10 000 copies already it's August 5th 2023. the book is not out for two and a half months ten thousand people have pre-ordered one and you can still get a signed copy signed like with my autograph not Magnus Carlson's because it's not his book but I'll ask him too maybe you know maybe he'll want to add one uh link is in the description if you'd like to check it out if you're watching this in 2024 the book is already out uh link will also be in the description um here we go we've got Jan who is playing from uh or or I don't know if that's Yan or Lon but they're playing from Namibia uh and sajal who was playing from Bangladesh uh and this yeah you're not gonna you're not gonna wanna look away from this game um this is a this is a fantastic game this this game is going to improve your day if it's going poorly and if your day has been great so far this is right here this is going to be like the the your favorite dessert at the end okay uh and we're gonna learn okay because you know I have a series here on YouTube called how to lose a chess where uh the games are bad but the material and the learning is still good so white begins with C4 um no 700 in human history should play the English opening the English is not a central opening and to play it you need to control the center with your Bishop from far away uh and it's it's very positional opening there's a lot of subtleties uh but black just plays D5 I mean black Black's just worse on move one uh that's not good because now you can trade a flank Pawn a c Pawn or an F Pawn for a center pawn and this would simply leave black in a slightly worse position after Knight to C3 attacking the queen and then white would take the entirety of the center and the other night some of you might be confusing this with the Scandinavian which is this but this is a very different story because in this version white has actually lost the Central Pawn whereas in this version uh White has not lost any Central Pawn anyway none of that is important because white is now worse on move two you can't play D3 what what D3 that they're just gonna take was the idea to go here and lose the right to Castle on the third move of the game I mean my friends I understand you're 700 but this is why you need this book okay because one of the earliest chapters in this book is how to play openings for white like just the general ideas and what you should be doing and I I mean what are we even looking at here D3 now of course black should take remove White's ability to Castle and develop the knights uh but black plays D4 now I don't hate the move d4 I I would have hated you know other moves more um D4 is not a bad move it's pushing upon in the center it's preventing white from natural development also now white has three pawns blocking the light Square Bishop so the best move here unquestionably is Pawn to G3 and Bishop to G2 trying to put this bishop on the long open diagonal uh that doesn't happen instead white here plays the move E4 just just pushing in the center which you know you should have done in the first move now in this position black can actually take on pass home uh but this is not a good decision I mean I I know I know I know that's a controversial thing to say you have to demonstrate to your opponent that you know how to do it uh but the point is this just helps white develop there there's no benefit here whatsoever white will just be very happy but okay black plays E5 and and we have a very locked position very close position locked Center in close positions you are looking at a couple of things you're looking at Pawn breaks the spots on the board where you can trade pawns to try to make forward progress you're also looking at where to put your pieces Knight to F3 do not hate this move at all beautiful move uh develops tonight attacks this Black's two bus moves here Knight C6 and Bishop to D6 okay uh black could also maybe play F6 not like not a great move but building up this brick wall and then put the bishop here so it always guards the king but what black should not do is develop the queen uh you should not develop the queen before the other pieces that's just shouldn't do it might work out for you but you shouldn't do it okay uh now white here needs to stick to basic principles finishing up your development and castling and then figuring out what's next instead white says me see Queen me attack Queen that's just generally how 700th thinking goes you play you think oh can I play Bishop to G5 and attack the queen and it's defended and like it there isn't zero long-term planning whatsoever you just do it okay it's like you're building a house and you want a gigantic statue uh of of a of a butt naked King in the front you know it's gonna take you over the budget but whatever like you want it in the front of the house so no problem Queen to G6 uh and and now the bishop has absolutely no target uh the Knight is also stuck defending the bishop so you can't even take the pawn which would have been nice because you would lose the bishop uh and and now white does in fact play the move Bishop to E2 here's the problem with the way white did this white now has a very clear Target right like a move ago white didn't have any clear targets why would one here Castle life would have been good but beginners are very simple-minded okay the bishop just moved there so what is black going to do obviously black is going to attack it which by accident is a brilliant move I know it's not reflected as a brilliant move but you have to remember stockfish is a college professor standing in a classroom of five-year-olds telling them that they don't know what they're doing all right stockfish is a is a scumbag is a narcissist okay and uh and needs to be removed far from society H6 is a good move why not only do you attack the bishop you now attack the pawn over here which was not a problem before because the queen was on that square but white inadvertently put the queen there and then now is going to lose this Pawn now black is not winning here um black is better but black is not winning because white will just play Rook G1 or Rook F1 of course as a human you should do this the queen will go here and then maybe you play Bishop G3 and then maybe you try to take this Pawn okay uh and and and black is uh slightly better according to the computer but I I don't I really don't think it's that bad instead of that um Ian from Namibia dude dude just goes absolutely nuts uh the The Rook is hanging so you would think okay well you know my Rook is hanging so I could go here or here right yeah dude goes King D2 now I have absolutely no idea why would you why you would move a king into the center of the board when you have no need to do so you have lost the right to Castle you have also put your king in the middle of everybody it's like it's like imagine there's a dance party at a nightclub and there's a four-year-old stumbling on the dance floor they shouldn't be there okay because you might step on them you won't see them the same thing with the king the king is is is is the four-year-old stumbling on the on the Dance Floor okay or stumbling in a kitchen full of chefs like they're either gonna trip over him the king should not be there and on top of that this is like this is just telling your opponent where to go this is like the bank robbers coming in and you being like right this way this is this is where you gotta go it's all over here King 32 is a crazy move but it is also the beginning of something absolutely brilliant and I think Ian is actually a stronger chess player than I am black here plays G5 I like that move the computer doesn't but the computer's opinions are irrelevant Pawn to G5 attacks the bishop and takes a bit of space uh of course black at this point you know has played like nearly 10 moves and has not developed anything else so what black should do is develop another piece the computer thinks that black is worse because after a pawn to F6 uh it traps the queen so the queen is now trapped the only way to take is like this uh and now Rook to H2 or Rook to G1 uh both trapped the queen this doesn't because it loses a rook so H3 is kind of the trapping mechanism and and really any time your opponent stumbles and like this you you gotta make sure that the queen doesn't get out that's why G5 is considered a mistake Bishop G3 now here's something absolutely fascinating happens uh black clearly has a pawn just hanging here so the best thing to do when you have a pawn hanging to a knight and a bishop is to defend it with a pawn because neither of them can take it but black plays here that move doesn't even begin to make sense because the idea of this move is I'm gonna trap the bishop that move not only hangs E5 it also hangs G5 like this is such a selfish move and this is why you lose chess games because y'all are like I'm gonna go here okay now white plays Rook G1 giving an inaccuracy by the computer and now uh you know again H4 is the idea so you've got to go Bishop takes pick up a couple of Pawns and now you're just in good shape instead of that white plays Knight takes E5 and again the reason y'all lose games is because you make your opponents seem better than they are okay that is why you lose um that that is why you lose um and now H4 Now The Bishop's trapped Bishop's completely trapped you got your Bishop trapped you didn't take G5 you didn't take E5 with the bishop You've Lost Your Bishop now white in this position I like what white does just goes Queen A4 check all right thinks for a while thinks for a long time one minute and 30 seconds and plays Queen to A4 check which I don't mind you know I really don't mind that Queen A4 I don't mind it at all trying to attack black hoping for something like this and then Bishop C7 uh but black plays the best move black doesn't spend a huge amount of time plays Punta C6 stops the attack right in its tracks and white is gonna have to lose the bishop now White's also gonna have to get a little bit of development going because White's King is in the center it's all locked maybe you try to play F4 here try to open things up I know it's not the best move you know I know there's Queen E3 and stuff but you gotta try to open up the position so white does play Knight to A3 if I'm playing Black here I just take the bishop and uh and I start cleaning up all right start cleaning up start trading off all of this uh and and that's what black does black play spawn takes G3 and now Rook takes G3 and black plays Queen takes H2 black is up three points of material you've been watching this video for 11 minutes it's a very very big battle black also wants this and this and there okay two ways to win a winning position trade everything win an end game go for mate if you don't trade everything and you keep your opponent's pieces on the board you've got to make sure that they can't actually counter play okay white plays Knight to G4 don't hate this move but at this point you should be thinking ah I'm down material is there anybody I haven't gotten a chance to move yeah you gotta you gotta bring everybody I mean you gotta bring everybody uh because you just haven't moved this Rook at all and if there's an opportunity to it's probably going to be the best move Knight G4 is not good because you're down material and you're just inviting exchanges not only are you inviting exchanges uh you're you're also just gonna lose this okay so after something like Rook G4 you know Knight F6 Queen F2 they can't even go here because of check so it like it's it's made I mean mate is coming at Bishop G4 you've just got to be thinking with black I gotta simplify my opponent's position the less pieces my opponent has the last chance they have of counter play and I can play Queen takes Pawn instead Queen H7 is played and what I always tell all of you if you're a beginner intermediate player a backwards retreating move especially one that's so dramatic like for example even Queen H4 would have been probably better such a backwards retreating move is almost never the best option in this case it has to be because you either Retreat or you take but you just just look around there might be something better Queen to H7 and now white being down three points of material decides that's not good enough I would rather be down six points the craziest thing is this is a 15 minute game with 10 second bonus okay with 10 second bonus that means that this move was played with 8 55 on the clock that means that this person spent 40 seconds on Knight to F6 I mean that is crazy can you imagine that 40 seconds on this move what was there to think about like this should be the first thing you see the first thing you see in this position should be Knight F6 and queen C6 you know why because there are checks and you should always be looking for them but after you find Knight F6 you either play this immediately because you think it's a fork or you think about it for I don't know 10 seconds and you realize that that night has the exact same trajectory to that square Knight F6 maybe they got a phone call maybe they were getting a colonoscopy while they were playing the game I don't I don't know what you guys are into okay Knight to F6 check and black response Knight takes up six which can I just say Knight look at how much time black spent 50 seconds on this move 12 42 was the amount of time black spent nearly a minute what were the alternatives was blackening a colonoscopy in the Next Room at the same medical office like what are these people thinking about Knight takes F6 now you know you're you're down two pieces now maybe Rook G5 maybe Rook E5 okay Pawn to E5 don't hate it Knight H5 now at this point the Rook is hanging and I would recommend Rook to H3 here pinning the Knight to the queen and the rook and then the best move of course for black would be to take but black didn't take a move ago right black didn't take this which is shorter distance so what makes you think that black is going to take the longer distance right I mean I'm just saying you can't bike three miles what what makes you think you can bike three and a half miles right it's just one of these things okay anyway Rook takes G5 Rook takes G5 is a great move because it attacks this unfortunately here black is razor sharp on the tactics I mean my God and black just goes Bishop a that is incredible Vision because a lot of people would go midnight hanging Knight F4 and I don't even hate them for that that's not even a bad move but this is incredible board vision from the 700 to spot the king here and guess which Bozo played King D2 for no reason do you see the problem with playing the move King to D2 now your King's in the middle of everything so you can't even take with the rook and the rook and exhibition around the Knight because the Rook is pinnable to the king and the king is not supposed to be in the position at all you did this all of you not even that dude Bishop H6 none of this would have been possible she didn't play the move King to D2 F4 Knight takes F4 The Rook escapes but not for long because it's discover check again rookie three Bishop E3 C2 white is now officially down 11 points of material black is not stopping Knight F4 Bishop is hanging the queen is opened and that's it that's it beautiful game by black black played this game like a real chess player a real Grandmaster white played it a bit a bit a little bit you know a little bit goofy but that's life now white here down 11 points of material sees a bishop hanging and hangs a knight as well Knight to B5 is just losing a knight uh and what you should do at a point like this with black is you should just try to take everything uh you should also try to take the pieces that are most menacing to you like this one because for one check it is not worth it you could even move your king and win okay you can block with literally anything because even Queen B7 is losing after Queen H2 Queen E2 instead uh black respects the threat when you are up 11 pieces of material stop respecting the threat of course you need to be cognizant of this but you are up so much like you have to just end the game you you gotta be thinking just end the game night A6 Knight A6 is still a great move it does allow Knight D6 check but it prevents Knight to C7 check what do we know about 700 ELO chess Knight to B5 is played hanging the night it's not taken instead covering Knight to C7 check so white plays Knight to C7 check now you will notice at this point that the time usage for white has been like a minute per move so what I don't understand is why do you guys start thinking about your moves after you've lost half your pieces can you answer that question why do you decide to spend time when there's nothing to spend time on anymore can you answer no okay well you should feel embarrassed Knight F4 Knight B5 Knight A6 Knight C7 is played anyway Knight C7 black is now up 14 points of material and eight minutes on the clock and hangs the bishop I why I don't even and by the way that wasn't even the best move the best move was to go here and take okay 92. now I like what white does here gets a little closer I like this it's good stuff there's only a few ways to defend a losing position okay and one of them is to try to create chaos one of the ways to create chaos is to attack your opponent's king now make no mistake white has absolutely zero attack here uh if White had a knight if white could monster Reborn the Knight on e4 and put play Knight F6 they can't do that okay uh so black black plays this and and that's it uh there is absolutely no white can't move this forward why can't move this forward white doesn't even know that they have a rook uh so rookie rookie okay maybe they do Knight F4 that's Checkmate uh that that is made in one move uh it is prevented by the way I mean can we just address that Rook to D1 was played with one minute on the clock and white actually survives Checkmate I mean that is crazy stuff Bishop to F5 black is getting everybody's coming to the party have a real good time one of the best bands ever uh Bishop takes D3 is is also going to be Checkmate uh and if you don't believe me Queen F6 is played by white which literally threatens nothing Bishop takes D3 white now doesn't take and get mated instead the clutch defensive move King to B3 and my friends those of you who had the patience to watch this far in the video will now realize that all the way back in the opening when I criticized this move King to D2 I was a gatekeeper I was an elitist I was a snob I was a grandfathered artist in the creative space telling a painter that they couldn't do a certain technique that's what I was a musician who told people they couldn't play a certain note because when push came to shove that King made it out of the castle and that King is now going to run in the field to his horse which will take him even further he doesn't have a horse in this position but you know the metaphor still stands Bishop to C2 check and now the King has been fully looted black is up 23 points of material do you know how much material you can even be up in chess like 38. this is the position two of these pawns haven't even participated in the game one of them do you know where this Pawn is is from that pawn is from the first move of the game it has been 30 moves and the king is out there with the pawn that pawn hasn't moved Bishop C2 Bishop D1 and white plays Pawn to E6 the last effort to take like this doesn't even work and black starts hunting the king Bishop to D2 check and it's over as long as every move you play is a check you will find mate King to C5 now Queen H5 is easy Knight to D3 is easy and then you have Bishop checks from the back you can also show off your angle with Queen H2 and Checkmate in the next move black plays Queen to H5 white plays King to D6 and now Bishop to B4 is the ceiling deal which helps those forces the king over here and in this position up nine minutes on the clock and 23 points of material black decides that right now is the best moment take this Pawn and white checkmates in one move with 23 seconds remaining on the clock
