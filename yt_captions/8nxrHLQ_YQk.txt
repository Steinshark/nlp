this is a [ __ ] site all right so Andrew is saying goodbye to Twitter and Reddit this just happened like less than 48 hours ago fresh off the press and uh I would just first and foremost like to say that I think that Andrew Kelly is a champion and that he has produced a lot of good stuff and he has birthed onto this universe Zig uh in fact one of my most popular tweets of all time was him uh doing this uh tweet about or this stack Overflow question about how to open up a file in C plus and I thought dang he went from that to creating Zig and it was just glorious and I've always had a huge huge huge uh just placing the heart for what he's created you know lots of respect for the guy and since he's leaving I figured it'd be good to do a little homage here for him deal deal all right so it's been over three years since my last blog post classic Tech blogger really um I think it's personally it's been 20 since mine uh I think that uh the website code started to feel like uh it uh had a bit rotted and so I'm making a new blog post uh became onerous but I've taken the time to redo the website using Zig so it's quite easy to add blog posts now and plus I've added dark mode but I see that he did add no CSS okay maybe a little maybe a touch of CSS could do you okay HR look at that HR you know that's an HR you know for a fact you know it that that is nothing but an HR called it called it HR horizontal rule right there by the way I'm not banging drugs that is just a bee sting just in case someone in a video is like Hey sir why do you got a big mark on your arm are you banging cocaine before all of these uh no over the past few years I am asked a healthy number of followers on Twitter by posting screenshots demos and small progress updates for Zig programming language it felt good to gain an audience and to have my perspective and efforts weighed more heavily in the court of public opinion um yeah I think this is great I mean you obviously built something people really really I mean lots a lots of people love it even uh what's called the guys over at Tercel when they're building their uh one of their tools just absolutely have raved about and they've continued to Rave about it and they really seem to just love Zig and so I take their word pretty high and so you know who knows me okay my phone shut up it's literally it's literally Warren buffering not shutting up however I always knew that it would need to end it's not really possible to use Twitter without at least a little bit of Doom scrolling and that activity took a toll on me emotionally you know there's something that feels so horrible about scrolling Twitter I don't know what it is I literally cannot scroll Twitter without getting anxiety I don't actually Twitter has become a uh a read or a write-only platform for me because it just keeps giving me so much anxiety so I I just go on there I say something stupid and I've just been scrolling less and less because I can just feel it eating me you know what I mean I think that that the core concept of a tweet is fundamentally unhealthy because by design it promotes angry and extreme content nuance and subtlety is impossible to distinguish from dog whistling uh most users don't understand that by dunking on someone they are actually promoting the content in summary it gave me a darker feeling about the world in general and in exchange did not offer much to enrich my life oh well that's sad I know to be completely fair for me uh I really enjoy looking at Warren buffering tweets and pick tweets and trash tweets and milky tweets and so I kind of just have like a list of people that I like to just look at for their stuff and for me that's fun it kind of feels like we're just having this weird public conversation of of who can just say the dumbest thing possible and it's just been so much fun someone actually saying 4chan's greater than Twitter now that is a statement of the century I don't even know what to do with that what do I do with that what do you what do you want me to do with that what uh so when the N shitification process kicked into high gear with the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk this was a perfect opportunity for me to make an exit yeah that's that's good feels like a clean break it has now been a few months since I downloaded all my data and deleted my account and in retrospect it was so so worth it I feel more optimistic about the world than human society in general I interact with people around me with fewer preconceived judgments about their belief system and finally I have more nuanced conversations with my wife and friends about politics and other Hot Topics without worrying that I'm going to come off as a dog whistling or naysing uh personally my general rule of thumb is I just don't worry about that at all because I hang out with people that I know aren't going to be worrying about that there's something about that where if you're always worrying about dog whistling I feel like you're just hanging around with the wrong people right like if you can't just talk to someone without them thinking you might be a racist there's something weird about that that's just like totally uncool it's like I do think that it's probably if you're at that point of mindset it's probably good to walk away from Twitter honestly it's probably a good time to walk away because I feel like you've just developed a an echo chamber and which is just giving you such an unhealthy look on life right uh I just assume most people aren't horrible people and then life just works out pretty well you know what I mean one thing I do miss is to have the ability to correct misinformation that I stumble upon in the wild for example somebody linked this tweet this is this was my favorite tweet of all time okay why am I being accused of misinformation here what have I done to you I cannot stop thinking about this Andrew created Zig and 15 years ago asked on stack Overflow how to open a file in C plus plus first off that is correct information to the T I would like to just be completely fair this was 15 years ago this is Andrew I nailed it okay I literally nailed that show me my lie show me show me my lie that's because there is none there's none okay well maybe I said 15 years ago and that's 14 but I put a little I put a little I put the little uh little shooter in front of it uh and anyways um if you take this in any other way then this is incredible and motivating that you can accomplish anything with the time plus effort you are then sad nuts yep I definitely said that and that's true it's a sweet sentiment unfortunately it's based on one bit of misunderstanding if you look at the date uh or the the date the question was asked it was August 11 2008 according to Wikipedia stack Overflow launched on 2000 uh in September 15 2008. what how's this possible well where the hell did I get this I see I'll tell you if you look at the citation it's a link from the launch announcement on Joel's spokesley's blog a Blog that was a huge fan of when I was 20 years old and the fact is that stack Overflow actually announced before that I was on a podcast with Jeff Atwood what the hell is happening here I've been I've been hit by fake news I've been hit by the fake news being a board intern at Lockheed Martin because they failed to find me anything to do besides learn XML what I enthusiastically participated in the launch of stack Overflow including asking basic questions such as how do you open a file in C plus so he did ask it got him in order to farm Karma points it definitely worked by the way to be completely fair I too have farmed Karma points back in the day on stack Overflow my favorite question is always which is more pythonic put a star on it anything ass ask anything which is more pythonic not a and b or a not n b you'll get like breakdowns of byte code you'll get people jumping in they love that crap they love it they're in it how big okay the [ __ ] one is a little bit different but I get that okay so maybe I got one and it definitely worked I have edit powers on the website now and you can bet your ass I use them to clean up misleading suggestions and stinky opinions wherever I see them now I don't want to poop on the private just parade you are pooping on my brain you're pooping on me so I could find in the replacement lore so here you go enjoy this one oh okay okay I will this this could be some this could be some good there's some lore in here I'll have to scour this to understand what the hell is happening in here but that seems very exciting uh I don't have a clue about binary files I'm a good programmer and I have read more programming books than I can count but still have no knowledge about binary files can you read them will they look like text is it good to use them how can I print it to a binary file and then retrieve from a binary file I was 14 years old when I wrote this cringe Fest I think Prime gen's take can survive transplant from stack Overflow question to this forum post that is awesome that is awesome this is a great this is great I love the fact that I've made it into a an announcement I made it into the announcement for being a purveyor of misinformation can we just take a second here I've officially reached I've reached I I believe I've done it I've meched I have reached mainstream media I've done it everybody come on bring it in rain it in rain it in I need I need a desk I need a desk somewhere just anyone offered to me we're going in I'm going in I'm ready I'm ready to deliver I'm ready to deliver some fake news Prime equals CNN put me in the game coach put me in the game I'll be on Fox News I'll be on CNN I'll be on MSNBC you tell me give me a desk I got some takes now I'm gonna rip my shirt off and sell vitamins hell yeah brother so much fun anyways all right let's keep on going uh unlike Twitter I don't know how am I supposed to keep going I got you guys all riled up talking about I'm gonna tear off my shirt uh and now you guys are like hell yeah get them and then now we have to answer the question is why are you yelling to get my nipples Out Boy something about that seems a little sus chat Prime on Infowars put me in Infowars do you know how sweet that would be if I could make one appearance on Infowars I would do it hands down if I got invited I would run to that opportunity oh it'd be so great uh unlike Twitter where I find the uh Elemental unit of socializing problematic wow that is that is quite the sentence you just used there in and of itself I think that Reddit formula is solid gold this is the one case of malevolent platform stewards what I expect this from every platform run for uh by for-profit entities where the goal is not to serve the users but to milk them for capital gains the Grim Reaper of capitalism has come for Reddit oh whoa this is such this is such an intense this is so intense I was not ready for this right now Venture capitalists are freaking out about AI publicly traded businesses with access to structured user speech that can be used as training data or rushing to build a moat around that data that's why Twitter prevented viewing tweets from logged out users and Reddit locked down its API despite its uh it's causing a massive protest from the moderators who do the actual labor to keep the website running yep we remember all of this we've talked about all this uh detecting that to Reddit uh and shitification was reaching terminal levels I decided that during these protests was the ideal time to close the r Zig subreddit which I was currently a moderator of I closed the subreddit downloaded all my user data and permanently deleted my Reddit account leaving moderation uh to Loris Crow okay VP of uh community of Zig software Foundation okay okay uh cool I think I mean I mean it's always sad when you close things down and all that right like you gotta whoops it is you definitely want is it is it back open is is R Zig like are we back oh we're so back okay we're so back we're so back you know uh once Loris was uh the sole moderator he decided to change the subreddit to read only mode however this was uh thwarted today when a troll checked their common history performed a hostile tuck Takeover in broad daylight and reopened the sub what it appears that Reddit admins are perfectly willing to forcibly replace moderators in an effort to keep the system churning out the user's datas really what is this hold on hold on hold on Auto mod hey useless options thanks for requesting this sub uh please reply to this comment with the following information to complete your request failure to do so uh will result in your request being denied what are your plans for the subreddit please message the moderators of the subreddit that you requested letting the mods know why you uh would like to mod and include your link of your message okay okay okay where where where's useless where is it okay it doesn't look like I don't see I don't see it anywhere oh wait approved we encourage to check out mod support wait approved oh gosh it happened what happened to it what what just happened here approved where's where's the comments click the load more oh yeah I see again I don't know there's only eight comments I think I see them all where's the load more oh load more comments sorry that didn't that somehow didn't do anything to me yeah that did that didn't do anything load more really I don't think did anything uh or a stepped oh oh a Reddit admin oh you're right Reddit admin stepped in yeah I don't use Reddit as you can obviously see Zig reopened um I mean I think that it's very healthy I mean the problem is is that okay so I'm gonna just you know I don't like to yeah I'm gonna do it anyways um I don't like that there's a hostile takeover but having a place for people I mean the problem is you need an area for your community to be and Reddit is a fairly good place for the community uh you could also argue a Discord would be really really good discord's probably better kind of uh there's something really nice about Reddit that it's searchable it seems weird to close it down and not let anybody open it back up you know because then you just have Zig you know r slash zig2 you don't really change the problem space you know you nothing happens but I'll I'll look at I'll look at the next paragraph I'm just saying that out loud like when I when I hear this and see this I don't think I don't think this solves any form of problems I think it just makes things more complicated if anything right uh anyways anyways I don't consider this to be a problem it is outside my control what Reddit does with its own data I just want to make sure it's Crystal Clear that Zig Zig software foundation and myself are in no way affiliated with Zig okay yeah I mean I think that that's a perfectly reasonable State it's a subreddit let's see that subreddit is now run by a third party and all signs points to a high likelihood of problematic Behavior happening there which I definitely want to avoid being associated with if you want an alternative to Zig subreddit give zigget a try what is zigget uh is that some sort of version of um is it some sort of a version of I don't know what the some it must like a Discord telegram whatever just yeah okay uh this is a discourse Forum software oh run by a do by dude the Builder a friendly Zig Community member and I find it to be a healthy and rewarding way of socializing with other community members okay moving forward uh I have a mastodon account but I don't love it no one loves being a mastodon I swear for the same reasons I don't like Twitter in addition I think the way of consuming content is generally like watching mainstream TV or listening to the radio with ads you're letting a bunch of people who aren't really that important to you or qualified to do the job be the content curators for you well I mean that's I mean it's a judgment to make right there or qualified for the job because the thing is is that it's it's up to the people to decide who's qualified right like who gets to decide that well as many people listen to them and so in some sense you're very qualified you're very qualified if you get a bunch of people to listen to you in some sense you're qualified to speak you just may not be that knowledgeable about it got it I get that I mean I'm a dummy some people listen to me for whatever reason I think you guys are all stupid for doing that why would you do that I took my hoodie off for this one uh Discord has been decent for a while I suspect that end certification will commence soon we should be able to look out for an alternative over the next five years I'm gonna look into setting up an RSS reader for myself and starting hunting for high quality blogs and finally I'll be redirecting my microblogging energy that was previously wasted on Twitter into actual blogging energy here well that's good I think that if you have longer things to say I think having your own blog is is like the place to be for sure absolutely uh the thing that I see I mean overall like I think Andrew Kelly's done incredible stuff out there really really really amazing stuff I kind of see the sentiment uh among um some people in the programming world and I kind of feel bad for it just because there's under a current all of this is there's this idea that that your view of the world is the correct one and everything else is shitty because it doesn't align with whatever you think that's how I read this View and maybe that's not fair and I'm not trying to dunk on him or anything like that it's just like you're constantly taking yourself out into these smaller and smaller circles where only more and more people just agree with you and I feel really bad for that like you should really reconsider and think about what you're doing I'm not saying come back to Twitter leave Twitter behind Twitter's a [ __ ] 85 of the time 15 of the time it's incredible it is fun I have a great time on it absolutely love it and then there's other times I could call the racist fight people rustiness right and so like or if you just get these annoying tweets like I get like every now and then I'll get someone will be like who who's the most annoying content creator I'll get take like five times right it will always happen inevitably you know no matter what that's just life on on Twitter right I'm okay with it it just is what it is I just go bam I just go block block block because I don't care I don't care if you don't like me go for it it doesn't bother me and so you know it just feels it just feels interesting to block yourself off or to create your own walled Gardens because I don't think you're I don't think you're fixing anything right if anything you're only making whatever perceived problem you have worse by creating an Ever more narrow channel of people that you communicate with in other words you just create a progressively smaller Echo chamber to the point where how idealized to do their reviews have to or how aligned do their views have to be with yours to be a part of this and so I never have a problem you know listening to things that I find annoying or Yaki you know I I don't have a problem with that I just usually ignore those people if they're especially egregious I'll mute or block them just because I don't want to see that right and then I just move on with my day hey you know and I think that there's a there's something up I'm just okay with not being okay if that makes any sort of sense you know I actually in some sense I really like when someone challenges me even if they do it in a mean way because even if I just go all this person's a dummy for a brief moment I think am I the bad guy here and I do that every time because I could be wrong I very well could be the wrong person I could very well be doing the wrong thing and I need to constantly reassess myself and even if it's someone that absolutely has no right no knowledge no anything to look into my life still if they're saying something it gives me a moment to reconsider the things I've done and does and do any of my activities align with what they're saying because obviously they came to that conclusion for some reason you know it's a chance for me to to realign myself but I think the best thing that I do is I have a life greatly outside of all this and I think that that's something that really helps here's the part where I brag on you where I have sex in children I have a beautiful wife and I we've made lots of children and so like my life doesn't revolve around y'all's opinion you know what I mean uh yeah yeah no I like Aspen's take as well if someone's genuinely critiquing you it's good to consider but if someone's just attacking you just block them that's what I do too that's literally what I do and so you know over the weekend you know what I do instead of going on Twitter I go to my kids soccer game this this Saturday this Saturday I get to play two rounds of golf 36 holes and out of every person at the place that I'm going golf with out of the literal hundred people that are joining in this tournament I have the single highest handicap I am the worst player there and it's going to be a great great time you know instead of like instead of instead of like being worried about all this crap yeah I'm out there playing golf and feeding the horses pick oh pick I got an image I'm gonna get an image for you uh but it's just like one of those things where you know it's just I I feel bad about this ever need and you do see it a lot of I do see it a lot among a lot of uh prolific uh or uh not prolific but legendary content creators legendary people have done great things in this space uh hang on there Cowboy we didn't talk about the soccer thing hey you know Judo I agree with you but I don't have a choice on this one okay my wife loves soccer okay and my kids are young and so I just want them running and using their body right now but I see it a lot you know they keep on closing themselves off to the world because of some perceived differences and all that and uh you know I feel bad about it but also it could be the right move maybe it's just not for you and that's okay too right that's okay too I don't blame you either um but I really do genuinely appreciate Andrew I think he's done amazing things in the community and I don't want you guys to to dog on him it's his choice and it's his life to live and so we should wish him the best and hopefully he gets a good group that can really push Zig forward and make great progress into this and hopefully there can be some other area like if there's an area better than Reddit for Zig and it truly is a good area then yeah hell yeah right like hell yeah I think we can all agree that would be awesome right because I don't think any of us love Reddit I think when you go on Reddit you go like this ew gross it turns out touching grass is good for the brain absolutely so Andrew deserves a hug listen I I think soccer is an amazing sport great exercise it's supposed to a team build and working well with others I think every little girl in twig-like boy should play it men however should grapple hey Juno if it makes you feel better my boys want to do BJJ and so what we're gonna do we're gonna do some we're gonna do some martial arts of some form as well uh depending on what's available okay so don't worry I get it [Laughter] uh I'll I'll be doing it with them uh anyways so many many appreciations to all of you guys I hope that you guys all uh I hope you guys all just realized that life is not that like life is serious these social networks and stuff they're not don't take them seriously don't go on there for Amazing Life advice don't go on there for amazing everything okay uh I think at the end of the day you'll be disappointed and sad and you'll feel completely emotionally like the ocean being tossed up and down if you just go there for meaning okay because there's there's no meaning there okay it's a bunch of people making 280 character assertions that may or may not be correct at all okay the name is I think Zig is an incredible language agenda
