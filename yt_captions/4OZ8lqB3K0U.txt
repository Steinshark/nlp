many of us were familiar with this sound back in the era of dial-up but in this age of gigabit fiber connections streaming 4k video and cars that connect to the cloud ai in real time seems like dial-up should be a distant memory but did you know that people still use old-school dial-up as their main home internet connection as of 2021 well over a quarter million homes in the united states relied on dial-up and in 2020 it was estimated that around one percent of canadians or around 38 000 people also dialed in to connect but hold the phone how is this possible well it turns out that quite a few folks in rural areas don't have many other options the main alternative to dial up in many of these places is satellite internet which is much faster than dial-up all you need is a clear view of the sky to get a broadband signal so it's available from at least one provider in most remote locales but that's about where the advantages end although satellite internet is high speed in the sense that it isn't dial up it's still much slower per dollar than the average fixed connection like cable or fiber basic plans tend to start at around 65 bucks a month just for 10 to 25 megabits per second plus you often have to pay initial and or monthly costs for the equipment spacex's starlink promises faster speeds but had even higher rates and an initial 600 fee for hardware i guess elon has to come up with that twitter money from somewhere satellite internet is also notoriously sensitive to the weather much like satellite tv and usually has high latency making activities like online gaming a real chore but even if you can put up with that it's simply cost prohibitive for some folks in underserved areas especially considering some dial-up providers now even provide a fixed number of hours of internet access for free each month the low cost of dial up also means that devices like atms and card readers which don't need much bandwidth to begin with still often have a dial up connection at least as a backup but hold please what about dsl it runs over plain old phone lines and is much faster than dial up so why don't people in remote areas just use that we'll tell you right after we thank freshbooks freshbooks is the invoicing and accounting solution that's built for owners and their clients freshbooks users save a ton of time and money we're talking 11 hours a week that they used to spend sorting through invoices and keeping track of financials plus 94 of freshbooks users say that it's super easy to get up and running and with award-winning support you're never alone switch to freshbooks today and join over 24 million people who have used it and loved it try freshbooks for free for 30 days no credit card required go to frashbooks.com techwiki to get started today still on the line good although higher speed dsl can run over phone wires it requires specialized expensive equipment at each end compared to traditional dial up because it's slower than cable or fiber many isps are killing off dsl because they don't want to deal with the upkeep costs which has caused some controversy since there are people in outlying areas that rely on it to connect to the internet at respectable speeds not to mention fiber deployments tend to reach wealthier areas first cost is also the reason rural areas tend to be underserved in the first place the low population density and vast tracts of land mean that cable companies have hang-ups about building expensive infrastructure to every home it's the same reason many of these same houses can't even get cable tv as if they'd want to these days and of course this isn't the late 90s where the internet was a mere novelty or luxury it's a practical necessity to participate in modern society so many areas with limited options for internet access are losing population giving the isps even less of a reason to serve the folks who stay behind but the hope is fixed wireless technologies where an internet signal is delivered to a home via a cell network could help bridge this digital divide in the years to come as large mobile carriers continue to build out more towers it'll take time and money but it could end up being more cost effective than laying cables everywhere and a lot quieter than listening to google dig up your backyard thanks for watching guys like dislike check out some of our other videos comment with video suggestions down below and don't forget to subscribe and follow
