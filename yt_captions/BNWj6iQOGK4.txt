I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how stories what a story is and how stories shape what we point our attention to okay so I understand that relationship between pointing and and verbalization but also pointing and specification of attention Okay so I'm going to I'm going to bring in some other ideas and I'll get you to comment on them so I was quite taken by my studies of JJ Gibson so Gibson wrote a great book called the um ecological approach to visual perception and I think there's some brilliant things in it and I've been elaborating on Gibson's ideas in the context of of narrative and I guess narrative is relevant to the idea of sharing because a lot of what we share are stories and I think stories are Pointers to Value that's a way of thinking about it so so let me lay out a phenomenological world for you and tell me what you think about this so imagine you specify uh a point with your aim okay so now you're determining a destination this is what FL what bees do when they communicate about where the pollen and the and the nectar is in flowers they specify a treasure House of value okay so that's the that's the point that's the destination okay so from the from Gibson's perspective once you establish a point then the world lays itself out as perceptible objects and some of those are tools they're all what he called affordances they're all they're all the phenomena that are now relevant to that goal and you can break them he broke them into roughly into two classes tools and so a tool something you can use to move yourself along your pathway and obstacles and I've been thinking about elaborating that so I think what happens when you when you specify a point with your let's say your your perceptual system produces a pathway forward right that's your root and then the root is accompanied by the things that are relevant you you talked about the fact that know we we are taking in 11 million bits per second but compressing that to 16 almost all that we perceive is obscured as irrelevant it's not even part of our conscious experience so what stands out well Pathways then tools and obstacles so those would be like material those would be material entities but then I think there's a parallel in the social domain friends and foes so friends that share your aim and accompany you along the way and they can be helpful and foes are human obstacles but also can obscure or interfere with your aim so tools friends o obstacles foes and then there's one other element which I think is very cool I just figured this out I think the other thing that we perceive are agents of transformation and those would be like magical creatures in a fairy tale and an agent of transformation changes your aim and the reason they're magic is because the world of the aim that they specify doesn't play by the same rules as the rule of the aim that you inhabit right so okay so now the the reason I'm telling you this that's relevant to it's relevant to the pointing idea because that's kind of the landscape that emerges as a consequence of pointing but it also is relevant to the sharing idea um I've been thinking that you know when we speak with each other we're offering each we're offering the fruits of our imagination that's a way of thinking about it each word is actually a storehouse a value or a pointer to value and so you could say the reason Consciousness evolved and this seems to be very much in keeping with your thinking is that we can offer people pointers to a destination or specify a destination and again that's not much different than bees do when they're you know when they're doing a dance to specify where the honey is and so it's the fruits of our imagination that we can encapsulate in words and maybe we have that private Consciousness our ability to think on our own so that we can build up a story St House of value so that we actually have something to trade with other people okay so well so that's a that's a take on the things that you just described so I'd like to know what you think about that it I come to think of of of the uh of the Paradigm of predictive processing which has been very uh uh influential in the past 10 years in in understanding how we perceive the world Carl friston a British guy is one of the leaders of of the field and and the basic idea there was a philosopher involved very much in in in explain yakob hovi explaining this Paradigm predictive processing who was kind enough to say that the that the Deep idea behind it actually was in this book the user illusion oh oh that's cool that's cool it's nice of him to say so yeah yeah yeah but but the point is that what I what US illustion tries to say is that first we take in information and then we create create a sort of a simulation of what that information is and then only then do we experience we don't experience the right take in we experience our own retelling of what we take in and predictive processing Paradigm is is is basically saying that all we experience when we go about in our stuff in the world is our predictions of what will happen next what will this guy do what will this monkey do uh will there be a fault in the rain when I walk there so it's all about predicting so in that sense it's all about storytelling everything we know about the world is storytelling and then of course it it turns out very often that our stories are wrong we are corrected uh we we we understand that there was something wrong and so we correct our storytelling we we make it more and more qualified and we and and when we get to know people we we have a better uh ability to to know what to expect from them and so on but it's all a question of creating a story not inconsistent with the information we take in and there's one thing here that's I think is very deep and that is if you take children they're afraid of the dark you go into the forest in the evening uh as a kid and you are scared uh because of of what could be in the dark if go there in the daytime you're not scared at all why is that that's because there's nothing to contradict the inner fantasies of the kid when it's dark there's no information that runs counter to the idea of many many weird trolls and demons out there but in in the daylight there's so much information that contradicts your ideas so in a way all of our perception of the world is a hallucination we create under the condition that it does not cont contradict the sensory data we take in so we are constantly constantly telling stories so telling stories is what perception is all about and of course human beings have taken this to a higher level than we expect a mouse to take it to but it's basically the same phenomenon that we we try to create a consistent idea of what the world is like but it's what we experience is our own dream if you like or our own fantasy or better word is our own hallucination um and it it so this will explain all the things we see uh in in when when when the light falls and and you you enter into to Twilight Zone and then suddenly there's not enough information to contradict all the weird ideas you have in your head
