what is this how much you didn't want me on the show i was worried we were gonna get accused of rigging it because you're related to an employee but now we're gonna get accused of doing it the other way look he picked them i had nothing to do with it i'm not david blaine up here oh wow you are three for five you are three for five picking the highest value items if only you could have picked so well on your first shot we got the stickers in here i'm pretty sure at this point you have to pick one more before you even get an offer okay 23. ray what do you got help me out buddy um let's see i want him to walk away with something there's no way oh this to be rigged you would have to be in on it you'd have to be in on it it's impossible you suck at this like you're the worst sorry i'm supposed to be on your team the scalper's the enemy but where is the scope you're terrible where's my offer oh my god man okay first of all you're huge yeah yep you look like you get your power by eating other virgins well like but i'll make it easy on you since you're so obviously eager to get home back to the bridge you live under uh i'm just going to offer you a hdmi cable 20 value take it or leave it like this game is already over here i'm not taking the hdmi cable man that that's not happening so you're on my side i i'm on your side but it's really hard well it's kind of like rooting for the canucks these days yeah okay fair enough it's like you can only you can only be disappointed so much for so long are you disappointed in me i think you should just take the hdmi cable is that what hitting that button does that's what hitting the button does and this one does not take the hdmi cable all right i'm not taking it i'm not taking it scalper's laughing your next offer is going to be even lower all right pick a case uh 14. thank you scott let's have a look at it sega dreamcast that's fine honestly you don't even care all right hey one i do not want to i do not want to drink let's take the small victories we can get you still managed to pull out a silver prize though it's valued at 325 with the four controllers that it comes with right so should i be worried about should i be worried about value then that's what the show is i guess right yeah yeah all right all right here we go here we go here we go you could still get a giant tv or an rtx 3070 which is amazing and that's why i'm not going to take a 20 hdmi cable right yeah that's fair yeah i really had to take it uh let's go with number three number three okay tris okay lttstore.com merch bundle were you hoping to walk away with that i'm gonna i'm not gonna lie i bought a lot of stuff from your website already so okay then that's a good one yeah that's still 400 stuff yeah i don't think i realized what i was coming into when i got here i don't think you did either no i lost ten thousand dollars already you did and eight thousand yep and i think five thousand yes you did and more what is left on the board value-wise right there macbook pro is worth a couple grand okay 37 eti is worth about 1200 okay that tv is in the couple grand kind of neighborhood yep you can still walk away with something decent sure okay so how many more cases do i have to pick right now three more cases okay uh let's go with 15. scott case 15 if you please [Music] there goes the gaming monitor oh it's a really nice monitor too i was starting to think that maybe like everything in here is just high value but if you look at the screen i literally have chosen one of the low tier prices it's shocking how bad you are at this i didn't know that there was a strategy to this game i mean we would have booked more rounds of the game if we'd known that you were going to bomb this heart because we want this to be a feel-good story intel doesn't want to sponsor gamers getting swindled by scalpers here what's going on man you got to be a smarter savvier consumer oh okay okay help me out brandon okay um uh do we got 21 still up here no wait is this 21. you got 12 that's kind of the opposite of 21. let's go with 12 then i mean i don't want to be a variable number watch watch me pick something decent it's all your fault all

brothers you have another supporter oh what's your brother's name aidan aiden and is aiden also younger and therefore better than you he will be eventually he'll be younger than you eventually he

what i'm wearing a bra oh there goes the htc vive cosmos vr headset now now it's starting to hurt i'm not gonna lie yeah yeah you're gonna have to watch x-rated videos the old-fashioned way i'm afraid actually there's no monitors left so you don't even have that option i'm not gonna lie i broke my vr set like a couple months ago too i believe you because you can't do anything right it's very clear i got this wait do i pick another one nope scalpers do to call us any moment to make you an offer and i've got a feeling it will not be a favorable one oh what oh sorry i got so bored oh okay what did we uh how about a keyboard i mean the 500 was a good you should have taken that i'm offering you a mountain mechanical keyboard bye you're not even gonna look at it i'm going all the way fox it's great that's actually a really nice box at least look at it [Music] all right get out of here matt it's beautiful i'm sorry i'm sorry it's a beautiful keyboard dude that might have been the best offer

think is number four a good choice like help him out here please hear me out there's eight cases left right i think so number eight you have to it just makes sense okay num number eight all right um somewhat flawed logic there's nine you didn't have this one that didn't even make sense to me ally let's see what we got i mean nothing in a case like that could be bad okay all right uh i mean for you this is a w i think the 600 nano leaf lights are off the table i'm starting to think that the nintendo 64 might actually be in my box and you weren't joking before that's actually what you want i mean obviously looking at the prizes after that i realized it wasn't the best option that's why i kept that is pretty cool all right let's see what the scalper offers well let's uh see what i got in my little bag here [Laughter] i'm gonna give you the pc equivalent of one of those it's an rog 1200 watt thor power supply very sexy okay just like you bye hey it's an amazing jacked power supply that's just totally useless because you don't have a computer to put it in that is true so i can't say can i counter offer that hey james oh my god he's back i mean hey scalper how did you get this number do you have anything better than a power supply for me do i have something better he has something better i doubt it's for you though what is this okay here's my counter offer a pack of cable ties from ltteststore.com that's pretty good i'm not gonna lie i think there's 20 cable ties in there you need something to hold your life together wait wait you gotta phone a friend what you guys are right there he doesn't have to phone you maybe mom that's who wants to be a millionaire i don't have my phone on me i'm losing control here i'm losing control here this is going to be a great video you need to take the offer or reject the offer i'm not taking the power you're not taking the car not taking the power supply [Applause] because the tv is still up there it is so is the rtx so is the 64. oh my god what is the fixation you can get them on craigslist for like 100 bucks hey i got it from youth though i guess so there you go okay all right go ahead and pick two more cases for me yeah let's do 13. look at the they don't want to know they're miserable no they don't want to open for you they don't want to be here okay geneva you got to do it i'm sorry okay hey there we go there go the 75 amazon basics peripherals okay okay last case in this round okay uh i'm gonna have to go with number four this time do you have to i have to okay tris oh right in the middle i'm not very good at this man no no you're not you know you don't really seem like a pc guy so i'll tell you what i'll make you happy 600 value it's a dyson hair dryer what you look like you need a blow dryer yeah you look very confused it's um you get out of the shower and your hair is wet and then you use it to make it unwet you don't like this offer blow dry me i almost want to actually take this one i'm not gonna lie wait did you you say he's confused look at his hair it looks like he's a hair dryer he just has a perpetual look of confusion on his face yeah um no i'm sorry you're not gonna take the dyson i can't take the dyson the tv and the 64 are still on the screen man okay all right you only get to pick one on this round make it count i'm nervous for you i can't even relax while i'm standing the number of the case behind her seven seven's a pretty good number yeah but is it lucky to choose it or is it lucky because it has something really good in it it's a very good question yeah i'm gonna see what's inside of seven because i don't think that you put a good prize inside of number seven i didn't pick they were random we used a random number generator oh tris why don't you prove it oh no [Music] there was one thing i'm so sorry you guys i couldn't have prepared you to destroy people like this all day you put the 64 in seven i didn't put them anywhere why'd you do it they explained the game to you didn't they i can't believe you've done this the good news is that that was one of the lower value items remaining and the scalpers offer maybe a little more favorable oh that's true that's true let's see what the scalper comes back at us with you really you're sad because the n64 is out of play i'm sad because that actually made the valuation go up you're really starting to become a thorn in my side here's what i'm gonna do to get you out of my face peripherals a mouse a headset a brand new mechanical keyboard that thing alone is worth like 200 and i can probably sell it for more please take it and go 700 value goodbye what'll it be you took my 64 from me pc or no pc you took the 64. i took nothing you took it from me took my 64. [Applause] okay it's time to pick another case okay we're picking one case at a time for the rest of the game okay what does that mean for me it means we talk to the scalper every time pick it up okay uh aiden what do you think what do you think man i have to pick a case you have to pick a case decide all right let's go with nine ali please open case number nine your dreams of owning an rtx 37 eti they're dead you look like you're going to cry if only you knew if only you knew i don't blame you okay i don't think the scalper's offer is going to be unfavorable did he see me smiling you seem like you need to recharge enjoy this 900 value jackery charging battery thing i guess i don't need it either see ya these things are legitimately pretty cool okay if you ever go off grid no 100 and i actually do a lot of camping okay yeah but it's not a tv i don't have a car and uh i don't usually drive myself camping so i usually just use other people's stuff and this probably wouldn't be as helpful for me to own as for one of my friends to own right you'd hate to be the one actually contributing gear too no yeah i'm a leech and i think you see that by now welcome to the game show linus so um no this is my show i'm not taking it you're not taking it and and now i want you to pick the next case you would like me to pick the case yes okay i'm willing to do that for you because i

mag mini what are the specs uh it's an m1 mac mini m1 m1 mac mini yup sponsored by intel sponsored by intel yes the show is in fact sponsored by intel um so if i ended on this prize it's a little off because i wanted that prize um i don't control how the game plays out i'm not taking the m1 i'm not taking it exactly i'm going all the way look at those prizes we got prizes on the board still man do you even know what they are absolutely not okay well the tv is a tv yeah the gpd win three i know what that is you do i do you can explain it little tiny laptop play games on it yeah it's actually pretty sick better than a mac mini and it's got an intel processor which is great thank you intel for sponsoring pc and opc all right let's go as for the budget gaming rig you might not be as happy with that one it's respectable you can definitely play games on it but it's like cobbled together from second-hand parts i don't know how long it'll last oh let's go for the budget game review you want a bunch of gimme pizza stop it no which one do you actually want i want a straight answer i want the tv i'm not gonna lie i want okay you want the tv then don't pick the tv or the love of all that's good okay let's see what's in number five okay number five peony you could please open up case number five let's go [Applause] okay we're taking it back man i'm telling you we got this linus it's you and me you and me back together what are these guys chopped liver yep okay you get one more offer from the scalper okay let's hear it leave me alone ah you're worse than ethan an alienware laptop two thousand dollars yo actually no they're kidding that's pretty sweet what's inside of it fast stuff fast stuff yeah intel obviously so i would use it for work and it would be a little weird to have although it is amazing an alienware pc at work right do you need the cheap i think that i just go for the tv it's such a good offer man how much is the tv worth tv's worth three thousand that's a nice laptop though that's a really nice laptop i wanted to go to the end it's a really nice tv too [Music] what am i doing man i actually don't know i would have taken that off that was a really good offer the adrenaline but that's the past let's look to the future at this point you can trade your case or you can open it which one contains the 75-inch tv and which one contains the handheld gaming pc what would linus do linus would linus would have taken the alienware i'm taking the alienware too late okay so we don't have what linus would have done okay gonna have to go with what you would have done all right and hopefully it's not i too bad can i phone a friend you can talk to your brothers do you have your cell phone on you do you do you have francisco's number yeah no i don't oh you don't yeah you do no you don't i think it might no only ask your brothers okay bro what i don't know should i keep my case or should i open that one is that how it goes i honestly i i wasn't you decide i decide which one i want you're shaking a little oh i'm shaking a lot yeah so do i decide which one i want right now you decide which one you want okay you can either open that one and keep this or you can trade okay do you go with your initial gut feeling or do you take what's there you have to choose i'm going to take your case you're going to take case 10. i want to see
