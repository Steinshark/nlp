so hello everybody i am here and i know everybody's excited i'm here with father stephen de young the host of the lord of spirits podcast he is also an orthodox priest and his new book the religion of the apostles has just come out i guess yesterday or just few days ago and i was i heard that it is flying off the shelves and i had a chance to read it i'm one of the lucky few that had a chance to read it uh before and so i'm really looking forward to having this discussion with father steven this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world so father stephen i uh before we got of get into the to the meat of the book and also of the lord's spirits there has been so much discussion around the symbolic world and there's this strange confluence well not strange actually wonderful confluence of interest between the the different worlds and so tell us a little bit about what it is that prompted you to uh to write this well this this book is sort of filling a niche i decided early on that if i was gonna write things i wasn't going to write my version of a thing that already exists right yes another version one of the things unfortunately in english english-speaking orthodoxy is that we have a very high concentration of a few things and then very little of a wide range of things i'm only qualified to address certain little parts of that um but fortunately some of those little parts are completely unrepresented now and so this is this is one of them uh so the religion of the apostles is a bunch of things looked at in different ways but one of the main things it is is a sort of one-volume orthodox biblical theology yeah which is a thing that until this hasn't existed in english well i think that there it's such an opportune moment there's something about the state of biblical scholarship which you could say that until you know until a few decades ago was quite was quite aggressive and was quite was used in a way to kind of destroy christians to destroy their faith and what i really enjoy about your approach what i see in the book and also what you're doing on lord of spirits is you're flipping the tables and you're using you know kind of this second temple um these second temple theories and these these new biblic this new biblical scholarship to to then point back and to to point back to the the uh the liturgy and you know the sacred space and all of this type of thinking which had been discounted by the 19th century type of scholars but now is is has there's room for it again so that's exciting yeah one of the one of the uh good elements of what post-modernism has done is that it's kind of trashed modernism [Laughter] yeah it's made the reason the rationalist materialist world insufficient and and and and and so there's a crack that's open that we can actually speak it to right and so that i the idea i mean it seems so strange when i tell people this but the idea that hey if we go and look at other jewish writings from the time of the new testament that could help us interpret the new testament it's an idea that did not really exist in biblical scholarship until the late 70s and early 80s exactly right but then you realize that these texts like even though some of the texts maybe were lost or semi-lost the contents of the texts were kept in these medieval traditions in these kind of medieval legends and so the content was still there in the iconography and so it's as if all of a sudden this kind of new biblical scholarship is is shining a light on some of the elements which were there but so it's actually supporting the the kind of liturgical point of view let's say right right and and the previous modernist approach it said well we need to be skeptical of all that right all those any christian writer is lying right he's not objective and we need to go back and we apply these objective laws of history and make our reconstruction of what really so you have all the quests for the historical jesus stuff and all that um but then post-modernism says well there is no objective right yeah we're at least that the world is bound in stories and that the world is is is from a point of view let's say and so you know and then with with kind of cognitive science and these new these new approaches to emergence and to attention and all these problems coming up even in the in physics you know in terms of the limits of of uh you know the relationship between attention and even uh phenomena all of a sudden this idea of ritual doesn't become so stupid anymore it like really it really becomes something that that is that is makes sense even for a secular person right and there is always a subject right that's what subject see we use objective it's objective in this weird way yeah exactly but the real idea is just that there's a subject there's an observer it's from someone's point of view yeah and that doesn't mean that it's that it's arbitrary right and that's that's what people have been trying to to push is that that if something is subjective it means it's arbitrary but that that's not it because the the the perce human perception has a pattern and human communion has a pattern and all of these things are are not at all arbitrary because even if you go down to the most materialist level it ends up flipping the tables because you're like you know if you're going to apply materialist rules to to things apply to everything and what happens is you have to talk about consciousness you have to talk about you know your experience all of this now has to flood back into the story and so it's like a surprise sometimes i even see it as slightly akin to the trick that christ plays when he goes down into hades where you know the the scientists thought oh we've dealt with all this stuff now we've got we're going to deal with consciousness and they tried to pull consciousness down to their material world and it did the opposite of what they thought it would do it actually shot it actually like was shining light on the world in a way that they didn't expect it flipped it you know yeah yeah thomas dagel who's the contemporary great philosopher of mind right right now talking about human and other consciousness said there's no view from nowhere right so you you can't write something you can't describe something from nowhere right you have to have a point and so that's that's really the approach of the book that's why it's titled what it is yeah is saint paul the other apostles right from the perspective of saint paul and the other apostles so you they're not writing an abstract quote objective treatise about some unformed reality they're they're writing from their perspective from their own conscious experience and so the book is trying to approach the scriptures from that viewpoint not from our modern or postmodern perspective but what was their perspective to understand what they wrote from that perspective but what you do as well like there's a lot there's a lot of stuff what i what i sent from the book what i got from the book let's say is that it takes what you're doing lord of spirits but it's not it's as if it ad there's a lot more than what's happening in the holy spirit the word of spirits is like a section of the book let's say uh but the the the rest of the book is really trying to show also even in the old testament you know but you mentioned this in lord of spirits a few times where the idea of the monotheism that we understand today like the kind of late you know this more modern vision of monotheism it just wasn't there it was never there it's not there in the old testament and second temple definitely not and that there really is a sense of different hypostases already in the old testament right yeah well i mean the the term monotheism doesn't start getting used until the 16th and 17th century and that's not because the words didn't exist monos were around for the church fathers and everyone else to use right and the apostles used if they wanted to they never did right and they did use the term polytheism to refer to paganism yeah they usually called what they were doing monarchianism but that distinguishes it from what we now call they actually use that word monarchicalism really yeah yeah that's tainted now yeah yeah it's a wonderful it's a wonderful world in this set it's a wonderful word in the sense of understanding the hierarchy but it is problematic in the sense that it can give you the sense that god is inside the system um but in terms of just a understanding an analogy to understand that there is all this whole stuff happening between god and us like it's not just god and us yeah they they meant it at the at the in the root meaning right that there's one are he one first principle yeah okay yeah yeah monarch right yeah and that's that's principle right but there are lots of beings yeah aside from that first principle they just aren't separate independent first principles right yeah and in a way that i guess that was why there was so much emphasis on the idea of uncreated the idea that there there's a there's a cat there's a chasm between the uncreated and the created but the created is a lot bigger than what you think like it includes all of these hierarchies of angels which are so present in the liturgy you know once you start to notice it you realize that they pop up all of these different little places even in your prayers like in your daily prayers you see that there is these references to uh to to these hierarchies of beings that are that are that participate in this cosmic dance i guess you could call it yeah a lot of what we do on lord of spirits is if if you're already in the orthodox church and you're attending the services and paying attention you have a lot of the dots but you don't necessarily know how to connect them or how they connect to each other to make a picture right you can just start drawing lines but that doesn't always give you anything cohesive you know and so kind of what we're doing is well here's a few extra dots that you may not be aware of and now here let's start connecting some of these and then people sort of take off on their own yeah once they start to see those things and the picture starts to take shape and the image i think the image that god is calling us to participate in the divine council the formulation i think is so useful it's it's so useful for so many reasons and i think it's going to be useful even in speaking to protestants and to people and because it's it really can help you understand like what these saints are about you know without that concept you can still get it but once you have that idea that it when christ tells us we're going to rule with him christ says that's what we're meant to do and so this image is already there in the in scripture and if you look at the iconography it's in the iconography it's like it's so crystal clear you look at this image of the last judgment and you have christ up there with with you know with the mother of god and and and the foreigner and then the apostles and the angels behind and so you can just see that if that's what it is it's obviously a divine a divine counsel it it it it is this court that is that is judging the world with christ right and it's it's when when people have an issue with that it's usually because they're coming at it from the wrong side they come at it from the side of well why do i need anything or anyone but god right or why would god need anyone but himself but that that destroys the whole concept of christianity and salvation right god doesn't need anyone or anything yeah but that shares you can really like i always just bring it back down to the most i always like to bring things down to the most common experience and and i always say okay so why did you ask me to get that plate then like why did you just didn't just ask god like why did you ask me to help you with your car like why didn't you just ask god you know it's it's it's and and then usually then this argument would be something like yes but you're asking for spiritual things and i'm like really let's talk about that like like if you if you ask me to help you because you're not doing well like what do you think you're asking you're asking for consolation from me just get it from god right don't get it from me uh and so it's it it as soon as you bring it down to everyday experience you realize that it becomes a silly argument you know like it destroys not only christianity it destroys the entire universe like it destroys the world if you think that that god didn't actually create all of this to participate in the way that he reveals himself and manifests himself in our life you know it destroys the world yeah well yeah yeah and it's this utilitarian approach of well i just need god to save me right because i have this problem which is i'm worried i might go to the bad place when i die and so i have to see but i don't need anything other than that other than that i'm good you know so i could just kind of do my thing you know once i get those boxes checked to get that taken care of yeah yeah exactly and then i could move on it's it's not about need it's about again it's about love there's sort of a self-centeredness to utilitarianism right of i'm only going to interact with other people the minimum amount i need to and i'm only going to interact with god in the spiritual realm the minimum amount i need to for my own benefit you know whereas god is the opposite of that god doesn't need any of this it's just pure love and sharing of what he has and who he is yeah and it's overflowing i think that that's the thing that once you start to get a sense of what's going on in in the in the liturgy and in the orthodox tradition is there really this kind of overflowing and and this um this kind of joy right the joy in bowing before each other of giving each other the holy kiss not now but you know before kobet hopefully after kobit uh you know giving each other a kiss gotta get away with it again sorry down here we can kind of get away with it again yeah i know in canada we've got the gestapo like uh we we celebrated pasca uh on sunday morning because we couldn't do it on saturday night and uh the police came by three times drove in front of the building slowed down and tried to see what was going on inside three times wow i mean can you imagine it's just scary it's scary stuff yeah we're kind of through the looking glass when americans look at canada as a police state [Laughter] yeah we've got we've got we've got justin we've got uh anyways let's not go into politics too much that could go down a slippery slope pretty fast um all right and so i have okay i have i have some major questions like for myself because i've been following lord spirits obviously everybody knows and i've been really excited to see how it for me at least how it connects a lot of the dots i would say in the sense that a lot of intuitions i've had a lot of things that i've noticed on my own but sometimes i don't have the information and so you know you're giving me a lot of of tools one of the one of the most powerful image that you've given me is the image of um the idea that the angels of the left hand right this idea that that the demons are actually in the end kind of doing god's will um because sangre of nisa talks about that at an individual scale he says that each person is given an angel and a demon and that you know the angel is kind of carrying you up and the demon is pulling you down let's say really like in the cartoons like you see in the in the with the angel on the on the one side but the idea that there's a cosmic that in the cosmic vision that the fathers already had this this notion um is really helpful in terms of understanding how reality can work and my big question this is my big question so there's a there's an individual level and there's a cosmic level but do you think or have you seen traces that there are other levels like at other other places so like an example a simple example would be let's say you have the angel of a city like would there be would there be like the demon of a city that's pulling things down let's say i don't know if you've seen traces of that in the tradition at all well yeah i mean the place you most clearly see that is for example the roman empire during christianization right where uh the city of uh now thessaloniki right thessalonika you know had artemis presiding over it that was a spirit who was presiding over that city and is sort of overthrown by saint demetrius okay yeah in that sense who becomes the patriots here of that city uh but that that didn't mean that all the pagans just vanished right there's like there could be like a haunting of of artemis that could be for if people continue to worship her in the city like there could be a there could still be some tension in the in the in the city let's say right and there's a constant theme in ancient near eastern literature and even into the greco-roman period that there are these demons in like ruined places ruined cities and abandoned cities who are the gods of that place that now have no worshipers right and they're so they're kind of these residues these kind of like the titans or these these the these these beings that are on the edge and they're kind of falling apart or fragmenting let's say and sort of haunting the pla and they're weak but because of that they're also sort of vicious and need to be avoided and warded off and you know exorcisms need to be coming done on the place you know to to rededicate it so the way that i'm thinking of it is mostly like let's say like a modern city so you think that imagine new york new york has a pretty strong presence like it has an effect on the world it it has a it's pretty important and so could it be it would it be possible to imagine that there's a that there's like a battle for principality happening in that for that city let's say right that there's that there's a battle for the city and you've got let's say christians praying and you've got other things going on and so there's this battle for the for who for which principality is going to rule over the the way that the city is going to to lay itself out that's that's the that's what i'm wondering about yeah sorry that's the short answer he says yes that's the short answer because yes because if that's true like that that i like i basically if i if i can if i can think that then i i feel like pretty much my very much a large part of reality is going to be solved for me yeah well i think i think the last time we we we talked we briefly touched on pan psychism i think for a second but i think it's even correct to say that they're battling for the soul of the city yeah in a sense yeah exactly kind of like segregated the image that he gives of the angel and the demon let's say pulling on each side and then you as the person uh you know either following your angel or following your demon and that will that will direct your your soul like you said that'll direct your your your life and and it'll manifest itself in in your actions and in everything about you right right and we tend to think of soul as something that just humans have that's not the way any ancient or even medieval person thought of it right animals have souls area all these things have souls they just have different types of souls plants have souls right but you could go beyond that to the idea that a community right a a town a police right a unit has a has a shared life yeah well christ seems to point to that when he talks about judging cities like when he says woe to you you know it'll be worse for you in the time of judgment than it was for for sodom and gomorrah he seems to be treating the city as a being that you know that that that has a life that will be judged as well in the in the age to come yeah and this i just reflected in orthodox praxis in some cases for example after communism fell the the russian federation had a long period of public mourning and repentance or the death of the czar in his family the murder of the czar and his family almost none of them were alive at the time the people who were there repenting of this but it's almost like there needs to be a kind of yeah there needs to be a repentance in order to set things set things right and to kind of realign the city you could say towards the good right right the the the community's life has to be reoriented put back in order right justified yeah and the taint the taint was actually in the geography and and this is not quite yeah and it's not it's not it's like you know you can even see it's not superstitious it's like you could actually measure it almost you could see that the taint of the killing of the tsar it manifested itself in the in the destruction of the the churches and the the sacralization of of the land and you know the desire to not just it's like because it this idea of desacralizing it's not just we're going to get rid of it if we're going to twist it like we're going to make it and we're not going to just destroy the church we'll make it into a stable we'll have like feces in it we'll we'll try to it's a it really is this this kind of embittered action that is more than just a a calculated political move let's say yeah well that's because atheism is a myth not the sense i usually use myth in a bad sense in the way they used it i'm not really existing because every atheist is dragging around the dead body of the god he doesn't believe in yeah behind him right because a negation can't exist there's there's a a joke from an old movie that uh slavoy jishek of all people uses to illustrate this that a negation can't exist where a guy is in a restaurant and he says to the waiter uh can you bring me a cup of coffee uh sugar but uh hold the cream and the waiter comes back a few minutes later and says i'm sorry sir we don't have any cream can we hold the milk instead that's amazing so to to have no cream right you have to have cream exactly geisha can't exist without the thing it's negating no you're i think you're so right that's something that i've been kind of pointing to i did a video on this this like weird kind of on one division and the montero video like this kind of weird satanic moment um and i also did one on the inverted pentagram talking about this how in fact these kind of satanic tropes are this strange dark mirror that ultimately will reflect back to god even if it's not in their will to do that even if they're doing it despite themselves it ends up bringing back the image of god even you know because like you said the negation can't have doesn't have can exist it it always is pointing to its in the and the the the parasite needs its host you know you can't the parasite can try to feed up itself but at the in the end it has to reaffirm the host or else it's going to die itself can't live without the host yeah and so there's no sort of secular there's no sort of neutral there's no sort of bare bones well we've stripped away all of the you know or banished any kind of meaning or spiritual significance to this place person thing idea right it's yeah it would cease to exist it would have to just cease completely cease to exist for you to banish any form of of sacred from from a person or from anything because it's that's the actual shape of how it exists is the the actual pattern of how it's there and how you even notice it out of the millions of things you you don't notice you know it's because it has a it has the same pattern as the this little holy place you know where you see things come together and are in communion uh you know in communion into something so yeah and that's been probably the hardest nut to crack on lord of spirits has been people's idea that existing means you know this mug exists because i can bang on it you know like right it has physicality to it that means it's exist as opposed to existence meaning it has an order and a form and so the opposite being chaos not an imaginary void or whatever it is that they think yeah but i think you know i think i think we're getting there i mean i feel it i i can see that you know the people that are close at least to the to your podcast the people that are close to what i'm doing i can see that they get it like i can see they understand it but for sure it's somebody who comes in kind of just cold on these ideas obviously sometimes they i've had people tell me that i don't know why but they've said that for two years they listened to what i was saying and didn't understand what i was talking about and then i don't know why they would continue to listen to it dude that's the curious part but then they said oh finally i get what you're talking about and i'm like well good i guess i maybe i'm not explaining it well enough then but it's a difficult thing because we're basically breaking a pattern of of thinking like that that has been prevalent for 100 years more so yeah yeah i mean literally the the words uh that that get translated as nothingness or non-existence in english usually in greek is uh tomion right which literally means that which isn't being being is a verb there it's a participle so it's that which is not doing the action of being or existing so when people try to push back on me and say well no look see there's nothingness in the ancient world i say okay what's that what's the pronoun referring to right because a pronoun has a referent right yeah and so that referent is chaos right that referendum or prime matter or pure becoming depending on your ancient philosopher however you want to yeah the only nothing you could say the only nothing in in this is going to sound weird to people but the only nothing is god in the sense of that he's not a thing right and so the object of the world right and so when we say that god created out of nothing we don't mean that there was this nothing that was there that god created out of it just means that that that that god is the origin of all and the origin of chaos even like the origin of all possibility and of all actuality is in this infinite no thing no beyond being whatever you you know going up straight into uh dionysus theopa guy you know trying to find words for things that can't be named but but that's really the only thing that is really nothing in the in the the strict stance let's say i i like the way saint john chrysostom phrases it in his anaphora because he talks about god bringing all things bearing or carrying the moving all things from that which is not being to being hmm so then you really have this idea of moving from potentiality into actuality right and of course right of causation right yeah and putting and being the one who puts things in order yeah that makes a lot that makes definitely makes a lot of sense in terms of understanding but i i really see that i i think we're getting there not only do i think we're getting there i think that at this point i think that they're that this is the future like there's no other way you know and and that this type of this type of thinking and the people that are going to be able to to kind of use it how can i say this that the fruits that are going to come out of this you know they they're going to be the ones that will be able to answer the madness of the of the post-modern world because using the old arguments doesn't work anymore there's no room for them yeah the the the whole hubris of modernism the whole positivist project looks laughable now but like no i could i could send if you read the preface to hodges systematic theology from old princeton in the 19th century you would laugh out loud where he's talking about how theology is a science and the biblical text gives us the data and so we just need to extract the data from the biblical text and follow good sound deductive logic and then the truths of theology are just as objective as the law of gravity right i mean it's laughable like no one christian pagan atheist anyone can buy that now right and at the same time post-modernism has proved completely unable to get past nihilism yeah no matter how much they try yeah and so the only other option is to try to go back to some of what we set aside in those pursuits in the first place yeah and reinvigorate them because you know the idea for example like i just want to say like you're you're i've been wanting to talk about first enoch for you know for a long time and i've just been avoiding it because of the problem of the angels in humans and because i know that that was such a hangout for hang up for people and i i was like okay i'm not going to talk about it but that book offers so many solutions to our problems even in terms of the idea of technology coming and technology and you know power to act in the world coming from these demonic forces and how it basically led to corruption moral corruption but also physical corruption and then leading to the flood i'm like this is what's going on around you right now i mean if we could have that access to that tradition again and the uh the the solution that you give which is the nephilim ritual which is that this was a ritualized practice uh and that it was done through humans but through this ritual that still exists today in japan and still exists and existed you know you know continue to exist in the world it just solves all the problems and all of a sudden the book of enoch doesn't like it can't bother anybody anymore because even the reason why it bothered the later fathers is solved now like you don't even you don't have to worry about that anymore yeah yeah and and it becomes and we talked about this on the show a little but it becomes clear when you read those fathers and you have to be very clear what they were bothered by they they weren't bothered by the idea of sexual congress between spiritual beings and humans because like saint augustine who was one of the great opponents of that view probably the greatest in terms of his influence uh believed in incubi and succubi for example so in other places he talks about them it was the idea of reproduction right yeah that they they would be able to reproduce but when you look at their arguments like you look at saint john cashion's arguments and one of his key arguments is well if that was happening then and it was happening after the flood why isn't it still happening now and it's like well because you're living in in you know 430 a.d and so there aren't any pagans around anymore to do it but there were people doing it in mesoamerica and in japan you know china yeah and there if you read like when you read the hammer of witches uh that's what it sounds like they're talking about yeah because they they talk about how the women are having uh relationships with demons but they say they say you can't it's not possible but they just say and then they just say it's just through secondary causes they don't like them even it's like for they're so they're so like you know they're such thomas that they don't need to explain it like we don't have to explain the secondary causes we just know it's secondary causes you know it's like it's it's the seed of other men that is they say something like the seed of other men which is gathered by uh succubi uh and then then are given to the incubus which will then impregnate the woman which is also like okay you didn't explain anything at least not like in the way we think of explaining by saying that but it's like i i i keep how can i say this i keep joking that we have versions of that now it's called artificial insemination like that that is actually that process materially manifesting itself where you know you gather the seed of a man and then you put it into a woman she has a child from a man that's not her husband and i know that the guys who wrote the hammered witches would have said that's witchcraft like that's actual witchcraft it seemed like it was going on because it's how they talk about it in like the 16th century in in and they didn't have access to these theories that at least not that i know of right and and our modern view of science has skewed a lot of those connections right but with going just going back to the book of enoch right they don't draw a distinction between like sorcery right knowing how to make ambulance right and do inscriptions that will ward off evil as know-how as technique as technique right and on one hand and metallurgy right forging iron weapons yeah it's all the same it's all the same it's just it's using meaning to affect the world like using these essences to affect reality right right and so we now have these you know this schism between those but they're the same you know for it from that that approach and also the same in the book of enoch is the art of applying makeup and perfumes and seducing people that's right yeah there's that one of my favorite parts of that book is when it says azazel taught them the art of metallurgy and the art of of painting the the eyelids i was like that's it like in one sentence it's amazing well because i think it's also because the the the thing they were using for paint on the eyes were were made of metal this idea of this like metallic paint that they're putting on which is perfect in terms of the symbolism as well but it's like that's the hope the whole idea of the garments of skin seduction is part of that like seduction is part of this covering of yourself to hide yourself but then also to increase your power let's say and power of seduction or power to kill someone is also that if you use an artificial manner if you use an artificial means to increase your power it doesn't matter what you're increasing it towards it's it's the it's the same it's the same uh process let's say um yeah right right and that and so of course we have the same thing right in our world people using an understanding of how the world works whether that's on a physical material level or a social level you know or a spiritual level you know psychological understanding sociological unders in order to accrue power to themselves to control and dominate and you know i mean that's who the giants are they're tyrants a witchcraft it's all winter they're able to do that because they have this knowledge you know that that and that's how they're using it and there's an interesting there's this so there's this interesting idea that it's like that hubris is what leads to the flood and like one of the interesting fascinating narratives that i've been seeing you know the kind of environmental narrative that has been popping up it's very fascinating because there's something of enoch in the environmentalist narrative and you know even though i don't totally ascribe to a lot of the tropes of the environmentalist narrative if you look at it it can help people understand what it means like what the judgment of god is you know what it means that god judges the world and destroys it it's actually it's actually playing out of the very processes themselves it's not it's not like this arbitrary god that just arbitrary judges the world it's it's kind of like the the things that you do will have repercussions and those repercussions will be the judgment of god on you it's not arbitrary at all right and that's um you know regardless of what anybody thinks about climate change and the science and all that stuff right that's a scientific question fine but the idea that our actions and the way we relate to each other and the world affects and changes for the positive or negative the world around us at all levels is well was clear to everyone in the ancient world and it should be clear it should be cleared yeah but even that there's like a no there's a point of no return right that's the thing that you see in the flood is that a lot of people um a lot of people don't like the flood idea because they think you know how is it that god could you know could do that because they can't imagine that there's actually a point of no return where the the the mechanisms that you've laid out are are your they they're rolling and you can't stop it it's just going to you can't you know it's like a ball rolling down the hill you can say well it's just rolling down the hill you can't stop it anymore and the environmental narrative has that in it it's the idea that at some point you reach a point of no return and then it's it's over um but it can help us like i said i don't i don't totally ascribe to it for other reasons but i think that it can help people understand what it means like what what the flood narrative is and what it means that uh god can judge the world let's say yeah and you see you see that tipping point all through the scriptures um the the the next book i have coming out that's a process right now is about violence in the old testament and so it's dealing with a lot of this stuff but you have this imagery of a given people's cup of iniquity being full or not being full right or the the land itself reaching this level of pollution right and the cries of the victims you know coming before god and that reaching a point where now he has to act he can't allow right he's trying to show mercy to the wicked by not cutting them off immediately their wickedness but that reaches a tipping point where his love for the victims he has to put a stop to evil at that point and you see that with the flood you see that with the giant clans you see that with um when joshua comes in fights a giant clan so you see that with oh if you see that with israel itself later on yeah even within israel that that some aspect of israel gets gets judged and gets you know is basically falls apart yeah it gets it gets past this tipping point um where where the god's mercy toward the victimizers gets overtaken by his mercy toward their future victims yeah so here's my big question this is kind of like my big question i think you probably i know what you're gonna answer but i think it's important uh so this this one of the things that i see you're doing and and that i really appreciate is i would call it restoring the the mythology of christianity which some people are going to think sounds horrible but i know you you know what i mean when i say that and and my question is do you think that we can live like we can live in that story again you think it's possible for modern people to to to live once again in that that kind of grand story yes that's the short answer yes i would like you to elaborate i will instead answer it [Laughter] so um this is gonna go a little deep again right but um and this gets into some phenomenology but we've been talking about this lately on lord of spirits so if people listen to that not gonna be totally familiar with that but the world we live in right our actual umvelt as a person um is constructed by the interaction of reality which actually exists right interacting with our human consciousness uh and um it's always been true always will be true as long as humans are humans right but what we've mainly lost even in most of christianity that's become very materialist what we've mostly lost is that there's a third input there which is god not just the spiritual realm in general but god the divine energies god himself acting in the world and uh that's perceived by we're gonna do a future episode of the lord of spirits talking about the news but we have a perceptive organ yeah to perceive that and to quote unquote here or quote unquote see that that's we've closed off mostly on purpose and that's why we've lost that sense so it's a question of sort of reawakening that so that we're correspo we're interacting with all of reality and with the the full scope of the world but this is somebody asked in the lord of spirits discussion group on uh facebook a while back um if anybody they talked about an experience they had and asked if anybody else had had an experience in their life with the grace of god just a direct encounter with the grace of god and my response to that would be have you ever had an experience in your life that wasn't a direct encounter with the grace of god right and because the divine energies god's work pervades all of creation right subject and object right yeah it's our incapacity to actually to to see it because it's there all the time yeah right and we experience it unaware and we're perfectly capable of experiencing things unaware we experience oxygen unaware all the time yeah right i'm not aware of the atmosphere surrounding me right i'm not aware of this but um it's it's there and we're unaware of it and unacknowledging of it and because of that we don't understand anything right it's not that we understand the material element of reality really well and don't understand the other because we don't understand the other we don't understand the material either yeah it doesn't make any sense either um because we're missing this other people but so that's that's what it's about and when that comes alive um that's when you start to live that way and it's something that happens it dribs and drabs and drips and drops you don't like one day like all of a sudden wake up and be like okay i'm going to now i i see the light i see the divine light everywhere yes like that isn't that hasn't happened but it hasn't happened to me if yeah that's for sure not yet little bits and bobs right little drips and drinks exactly the way that person who posted that in the group experiences they had a moment of that right they had a moment of that and it's it's giving that the space to grow and but we tend to banish it yeah when it does happen we tend to push it away and explain it away and we're scared of it we banish it or some of us go the opposite direction pursue it in all the wrong ways right through psychedelic drugs through right whatever yeah it's right now this is very right now there's it's a very popular thing that's going on the whole psychedelics is coming back in a frightening way so yeah right because that's i mean uh if you want to find sort of technique again sort of the the method for the noose for opening the eye of the noose and all this hey read some hindu literature they've got all about it um but i don't know if i'd go down that route because you know we've seen with the giants at all what technique does when it's applied in the wrong context yeah and just it's not fun the whole psychedelic things is hilarious because a lot of people that are coming to me talking about it they they have a weird they have a more kind of traditional vision or kind of a traditionalist idea let's say you know even if times are not totally christian but you know this the psychedelics came out in the 60s guys it's the psychedelics are part of the reason why we're here like we're in this this crazy world because of the psychedelics and so now bringing them back isn't necessarily going to bring us in a better spot than than what happened in the 60s at least i don't think so there's not like there's more capacity to discern now than there was in the 1960s right and and artificially inducing a state or experience does not give you the ability to understand and assimilate and process and find meaning in that experience right it just gives you an experience and that experience can then go very badly right and if you need an example other than psychedelics for that just look at sexuality yeah right we have all kinds of artificial technological means now to induce sexual ecstasy and a sexual experience but people who go down that path end up with a sexuality that's very disoriented and and bent and confused and not healthy you know for them or anyone else right and it becomes very hard to come back from that yeah not impossible with the grace of god but very difficult to come back and so long answer is that you you think that it is like i'd say for the post-modern world right now in north america um that we have the capacity to re to to live once again in this story let's say the story uh this grand story that that you're presenting in lord of spirits i think so but yeah to make a beginning of it yeah to make a beginning of it um yeah yeah and there's what i was i was just talking to somebody about this today one of the real problems we face frankly and i'm not going to get into politics especially not canadian politics but but that is one of the problems we face because there's this whole territory of our our communal life and our social life that's been bracketed off now as oh that's politics you have to stay out of there you can't go into there that's not connected to anything else and nothing else is connected to that and they've kind of made it sacrosanct and eventually it's not going to be able to be right because because eventually it's not enough to just reshape my personal life eventually i've got to reshape my family life yeah and then community life and i mean it's gonna hopefully progress out from my personal life right that's the place that it starts yeah but down the road we're gonna smack into that fence around politics and there's gonna be a kind of a reckoning where we're going to have to things are eventually going to have to kind of dismantle in that arena to yeah because it's happening one of the things that one of the things that post modernism do is doing is it's breaking down the material stability let's say the materialists they at least had some kind of stability they they didn't have access to the angels and they didn't have access to the demons let's say so they were protected from a little bit protected from one side but also protected from the other and so as post-modernism kind of breaks down that solidity you know a lot of dark stuff is seeping in and so the the you know the politics themselves are already being let's say taken up by these weird demonic forces and you can see it it actually appears to you right you see possessed people like i don't know literally possessed but at least you know they're they're they're semi-possessed at least they're being ridden by demon however you want to say it um and so it's happening and it has a weird coherence to it like a kind of weird uh dark coherence to what's going on and so and so i think like you said that at some point we also need to be able to understand that as those that are looking to have discernment in this breakdown and hopefully look up and look towards god and see how all this can come together you know it's it's gonna it's gonna have to face that we're gonna come face to face with that uh at some point too yeah there there's there's a very good book called uh earthly powers that's talking about uh 19th century european politics on the european continent and it shows how in terms of iconography the civil iconography in terms of patriotic songs in terms of you know the structures of government how all of the things that were associated with religion before the french revolution yeah all the iconography all the music all the everything gets transferred to political parties and political napoleon you know political yeah yeah and personalities and i don't want to be a total downer but that line of development gave us world war one and two that's right and bolshevism and stalinism that's where that leads and i think the same thing is now happening in north america we're seeing the iconography that used to be attached to albeit the protestant puritan kind of american church right now getting transferred into [Music] politics and and and uh you know political more political morality you know that's yeah the whole last year was uh was just a symphony of insane religious upheaval like there was just all this religious imagery flooding back into the world um and uh and and it's scary like it's not it it doesn't look good it doesn't it doesn't have it it doesn't have the transformative uh power you know that christianity does because the likes we're seeing the scapegoat mechanism kind of get brought into the world um and you know christ gave us the solution to that and which is self will which is self sacrifice but now that's not what's going on there once again is this this demonizing of of of groups and this and it's done in a in a very strange sacred way using this imagery that is very religious and so yeah it doesn't it looks like we're going back to paganism that's what it looks like yeah there's i was i was recently listening to some comments from believe it or not a uh marxist university professor who was talking about what he called the great awokening uh which is itself religious language yeah that's um but talking about the problem with sort of woke liberalism and he said you know it's just too protestant for me that they're all out there arguing about who's going to heaven and who's going to hell yeah he's like i'm trying to do politics but that's those but it reveals to us what really drives these things like it reveals to us what that the the passions that are behind or the desires that the the hidden desires that are behind these political actions are actually spiritual you know and they're distorted and they're contorted but you know if he thinks that it was any different during the bolshevik revolution oh no no what do you think was going on back there it was exactly it was very religious the way that i mean this deification of lenin and uh you know like the embalming of his body all of this like what do you think is going on this is not politics absolutely but the the you know puritanism is always sort of associated with you know the the american right you know that that they're they're not only that they're puritanical but that they see themselves as sort of pure in terms of the elect you know they're the good ones they're the good people and there's these other sinners but now we've got the exact same thing on the other side you know where we've got women like marching on washington dressed as puritans in an ironic way to tell men they need to act more like puritans in an unironic way yeah it's it's yeah it's getting crazy out there and and yeah and the the whole cancel thing uh all of that is just like it's exactly this kind of excommunication like there really is just an excommunication uh but it's like almost like a democratic excommunication very strange racism in the greek sense right we all write the name of the person and we throw them out of the city that's what's going on that's exactly what's happening and so we really are seeing a kind of flooding in of paganism and paganist pagan structures and pagan gods i would even say and so so we've got work to do you know but but but now that i've had a negative nancy all right let's get a positive answer finish with the positive thing here to be positive i guess positive p i don't know um what one of the things i grew up in southern california which was sort of ahead of the curve on this so if somebody there was a pagan they had a big license plate saying they were a pagan they said proud pagan right yeah and if somebody was an atheist they were an atheist or someone right you know everybody was pretty clear on on who they were and i went to co under my undergraduate in east texas which is very different culture right there everybody went to church right the the the county that school was in was the only county in east texas that was not a dry county it's the only place you could get liquor yeah so the county was just packed with bars and strip clubs right but all the strippers were in church on sunday morning right like everybody went to when you met people in this town they said that they asked you what church you went to that was like the second question yeah what's your name and what church do you go to what church do you go to because that i mean that was how class divisions worked that was how you know i mean that so it was all what church do you go to and the people there were no more committed to the christian faith than the pagans and atheists and stuff i grew up with in california right they were just fooling themselves and sort of being performatively christian sort of publicly so as that breaks down everywhere i think we're actually in a better position because at least we all know where we stand yeah we there's no advantage like the the advantage of being a christian is going away and is it's gone pretty much and so it's it's so it's it's harder well there's probably still some but it's they're less they're very in certain places but let's say that it doesn't have the same the same effect as it used to and so like you said then it definitely going to wean out a lot of the the people that weren't that weren't serious about about why they were there and what they were doing so and that that opens up the possibility of actually having real conversations with those people because if you approach someone who's in this bad place in their life and lost but they insist that they're a good christian and believe in jesus right i'm very limited in what i could say to them you know and as an orthodox priest they're gonna you know think i'm roman catholic first of all and they're gonna critique you know try and do some kind of surface critique of my theology and just disregard me yeah you know um whereas if someone knows you know no i am lacking something spiritually maybe i want it maybe i don't but that kind of person in that kind of position is much more open to hearing what other people have to say yeah you know yeah i've seen a strange and it'll be interesting to see like i'm being more involved now here in quebec i'm trying at least it's like almost like a therapy for me um with these french canadians and so uh i've seen the younger generation they they actually don't know anything about christianity the the the like the people in their 20s like late teens and 20s they don't know anything and so they're actually not even hostile towards it they're just like i don't know what this is like uh what is this what is your thing uh and so it actually it's like a clear slate that you can speak into um and uh yeah so it'd be interesting to see how that how that's gonna how that's gonna play out it definitely it's not it's not it's not a battle it's not the same kind of battle it's just a more like real conversations yeah yeah and we have to we have to approach it that way too uh and not make assumptions about who people are and where they're at and what they think yeah exactly i've had some fascinating conversations with pagans since we started lord of spirits because when you start out by saying like no i believe all those gods exist yeah yeah that's been my move for like several years when people say you know a christian is just someone who believes in like one just you know like one what did they say like one uh less god or whatever like i'm like what are you talking about i believe in all the gods like i've always believed in all the guts and so so let's have another discussion because that one's definitely not going to work on me yeah yeah and sometimes they just look at me in disbelief and i'm like no that's what christianity is and i talked to them about theosis and stuff and they're like wait what you know yeah exactly so so last question i guess before we go um so what are you hoping for for the book like what are you hoping the discussion would what it will bring about you know the effect that it'll have i'm i'd like to know how you see it being how you hope it's going to be received yeah well i started out saying it's a bunch of different things and that's the main reason i say that is that i think or i'm hoping that that there'll be a bunch of different gaps that it will fill right i sort of deliberately structured it as a biblical theology and i've already gotten feedback from some people because ancient faith released the table of contents as part of a sample earlier i've gotten feedback for example from a lot of protestants who are sort of interested in biblical theology like they look at the table of contents and they're like okay this is the structure is familiar to them right the layout is familiar to them and so they're interested in what the contents are going to be yeah and it it really it's it's i was surprised because i wasn't expecting when i got it i wasn't expecting it to be like a kind of apologetics book but mostly in a way that's what it is in like a biblical theology but done trying to help people see people who are interested in biblical theology understand what it means like what it means in terms of the tradition that was actually there in the early centuries that you discounted and and so it's like you're studying this on this side you're ignoring this on this side now let's see if we can connect them together and then all of a sudden a lot of things are going to make sense to you like one of the best things in the book i don't know if you want to spoil it but you give the best ex you give the best explanation for the baptism for the dead that i've ever heard and when you when i read it i thought i'm such an idiot for not having thought that before it was just so obvious i know if you're willing to spoil that for for the people watching yeah well i i kind of go in i get kind of granular with the greek on that one um and and there's sort of a bunch of of pieces to it in terms of the way it's but again i'll try and do a shorter version that that um essentially this is this is talking about a practice that we still do today in the orthodox church which was at that time in the first century someone being baptized and taking the name of a martyr right who had gone before within the understanding in the greco-roman world of patronage and of how when you take someone's name your actions bring honor right to to that person it makes so much sense because all the other explanations don't ever satisfy they just never satisfied me you know it's like no matter how people tried to explain it to me i was sometimes they would say well they did it but but it doesn't it's not saying we should do that all this kind of weird explanation and this the idea that you're baptized for in the name of someone basically the way that we do it now it makes so much sense and and and it explains the origin of a practice that is like you said is is just totally common in in christianity and has been from from the earliest stages when we hear of people being baptized and taking a new name and then we have the idea of naming a child at their baptism all of this makes so much sense when you understand it uh when so so it just to me that that was like it's so such a small thing but it can help people see the type of argumentation that you're giving which is saying if you look at even at the liturgical practice of the church later on it actually helps you understand it's like have second temple type thinking how the liturgical type uh type uh world that we live in and take those two look at the new testament again and all of a sudden so many things make sense that you didn't understand before and so like i don't think you're doing many things like if i could say the one thing that you're doing i think that that's what you're doing and it's a and it and it's a it's a wonderful for people that are interested in the bible it offers these wonderful keys that you didn't think were there before so yeah and i think that's a good example too because it shows a place where it's our it's our modern view that gets in the way because the ancient view of identity is that you know sort of like ogres and shrek right there's layers that your identity is is the composite of these light right your family right who your father is in particular but your family your community the city where you're from i mean how many people in the ancient world their quote unquote last name is actually the city they're from yeah right that's part of their identity the place where where they're from the place where they live the community they're a part of their trade right right all of these factors are layered and that's your identity the modern sense of the individual is the inversion of that right yeah your identity is the negation of all those things and you can say that you don't have to go to shrek family we can just go to the to the to the tabernacle like the temple is made that way right the the garden of eden the temple all of these are that's exactly what what is is happening and the idea that we are made in the image of the macrocosm like that we are microcosms in the in the image you know the temple can help us see how we're made that's how we have the same structure as the temple that's why we talk about circumcision of the heart that's why we talk about going into the heart or even protestants talk about you know like you know uh having jesus in your heart it's like all of that is is because you're made like the temple and this idea of identity as these layers is actually what makes the world coherent or else we have these atomized realities that are not interconnected so right and and that's and if we're if we're going to be wrapping up here right this is another place for hope right because if you look at your average human life right when you're a child your identity is kind of given to you right you're born into a family you're born in a place you're born into a community you get brought to a church or other place of worship without choosing right you know all of those things all those layers are placed upon you and given to you and that's your identity then when you become an adolescent you rebel against all that right you become very modern and individualistic right i'm going to be my own person i'm going to be who i am not you dad not you community not your church right but then when you become an adult right you reappropriate all those things that were given to you as a child and really make them your own and they really become your identity so if that's what we can do collectively as a people right as an american orthodox church as as people if we can go back and reappropriate some of that that was given to us when we were young get past the rebellion right then we can have that identity again and have it for real yeah in a real integrated way and there's a kind of maturity in the new way that we perceive it you know not in the naivete that we had as children which was fine at the time but as adults you know coming at it through this different way of seeing the world all of a sudden there's a maturity we can bring to these to the story to this to this reality um and it like you said it's more integrated so thank you thank you for the book i want to tell everybody so get the religion of the apostles it's out now we want to we want it to be on the new york times best seller list so let's do this everybody i have student loans yeah i've seen lots of pay all right thank you father stephen and thank you for a load of spirits uh you know everything you're doing i'm really excited about the future and what it what it brings um you know i really do feel i really do feel like i i i have this kind of extended team members that that were all kind of working in the similar directions and working towards similar things and so um so it's great i i don't feel alone it's a cinematic universe there you go there you go all right thank you father thank you
