all right so I was wrong about the Z flip 5. kinda kinda all right so this is the new z-flip 5 from Samsung this is their smaller folding phone again starting at a thousand bucks and in nearly the same dimensions as last year's four and I remember when it first got announced we had some well-respected reviewers saying this changes everything this is the big upgrade it's the biggest upgrade ever and my impression was they've settled here now to be fair my video was examining both the flip 5 and the fold five and looking at how much like the foldables world has evolved in the past year and how much Samsung seems to be sticking to their tried and true form factors so it just feels like they're refining and settling into their positions but now after using the flip 5 much more over the past couple days I gotta say I was wrong about this phone uh this is actually one of the biggest updates yet so basically there's three main new differences with this phone over the Z flip 4 which are the chip the hinge and then the new outside display and I'm gonna go in order of importance here actually because I think it's a pretty clear order so first of all well they got this new overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip in here great it's now up to date with the latest flagships it's the same one that's in the s23 and s23 Ultra and yeah it's been a great chip you know the phone is super responsive it can handle multitasking since it's paid with eight gigs of RAM it's Snappy apps open quickly there's no issues here it can also handle heavy gaming and I don't even gain much on my phone but it can do it it's great the other half of a great ship though is efficiency so when I saw Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy I was hoping to see maybe an improvement in overall battery life but I didn't and I mean I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering the physical battery size is still the same it's still 3 700 milliamp hours but it's got way more pixels now to power which we'll talk about that in a second so the new chip fine but y'all have heard me talk about the hinge though the hinge being the most important physical part of a folding phone you can't Ace a folding phone without acing the hinge and this hinge is nice so Samsung for the first time has actually taken Parts out of and simplified the hinge of this phone which has resulted in less moving Parts which is typically a win for long-term durability but also means a little less volume and a little less thickness around the back of the phone shout out to dave2d for this graphic basically illustrating the new internal multi-axis folding mechanism that allows the OLED inside to have this slightly gentler wider radius when it's folded up which should put less stress through the middle honestly I don't notice a huge difference with the crease it's still clearly there like it's one of those things where you turn the screen off or look off axis and it's very obvious but once you get into the flow of using the phone it's very easy to forget about honestly the most important difference here with the hinge is actually just that it folds completely flat now so every z-flip up to this point has folded shut with just like a little small Gap that could get you know a little bit of dust a little bit of sand a little bit of dirt inside which is not great when the inside screen is the most delicate part of the phone so now all these folding phones across the board from everybody they're all working towards this gapless close it's still technically not fully dust resistant I mean it has an ipx8 rating again the 8 means it can be splashed but the X means no official dust resistance yet but it's also an even more satisfying clap now and yeah it's also just it's slightly more firm it's a nice sturdy hinge every year which is hard to appreciate until you go back to the earliest folding phones and see how loose those were I still personally hardly ever use those like half folded features where you can like prop it up and use the camera like this or like watch videos or whatever but look a good hinge is a good hinge but the biggest change to this phone is clearly the bigger screen on the outside so let's talk about it so the z-flip has gone from this tiny little 1.9 inch slot to a full squared 3.4 inch 720p cover screen called the flex window this is huge it's a massive Improvement that's way more screen for checking the time or reading notifications way more screen for framing up pictures with the primary cameras on the outside it's a huge win for all that stuff and then also sends us this huge new screen they've sort of organized this UI of up to 11 pages of apps that you can flip through uh sort of encouraging you to use the outside screen more you're using a phone without even opening it so you can fully unlock and then just start swiping over to either quickly View and organize your notifications or move between all these full screen widgets I have a calendar widget of course which is scrollable you've got a scrollable weather widget basically these are all not even really widgets they're more like mini apps that have been specifically Built For This outside screen to be fully functional and optimized and then it if you're feeling bold you can also jump into the lab settings and start enabling other non-optimized apps to also work on the outside screen so there's no question you can do way more with this outside screen than you ever could before on the flip the question that's up to you now really is just will you actually use it like how will you use it and it's a surprisingly hard question to answer like when I first saw the phone get released you know at first you see that gets a bigger outside screen but I honestly thought I wouldn't use it much like I thought I would just continue to use the phone mostly open and I would enjoy the barrier between me and endless Doom scrolling and maybe I'd check the time or some notifications a little bit more on the outside but I was wrong basically the thing that I found I do much more often especially like early in the day is notification management just triaging going through at the beginning through a bunch of notifications and clearing through the ones I don't need reading the ones that I do need to see that's way better than opening the phone and like accidentally starting to Doom scroll through Tick Tock or something so in the lab settings there's basically only a few apps that you can actually officially enable on the outside screen it's basically Maps messaging apps and then Netflix and YouTube for some reason for you psychos out there I definitely tried to answer some texts with the full qwerty keyboard that shows up on the outside screen now and yeah it technically works but it's like all right do we really want to be doing this like my hands are too big to be typing on this small of a keyboard regularly maybe a few quick responses to stuff here and there maybe voice to text a little more often but nothing too crazy there's actually also even a whole app in the Samsung Galaxy store called good luck with an extension called multi-star and basically if you have both of these it lets you add a launcher to the outside screen with literally any app on your phone and so you can go through and experiment and find all kinds of weird stuff that kind of works here like you can technically just scroll through Twitter through X if you want to you can flip through your favorite Reddit app before it disappears or you can move around Spotify playlists and these are all kind of not bad there are also plenty of apps that are an absolute nightmare that look ridiculous in a square so I wouldn't recommend that but I still feel like the whole point of having a flipping phone Remains the Same like I this barrier between open and and shut like it's nice to have the outside functionality but this action really signifies okay now I'm about to get in and like actually do something on my phone it just really becomes up to you where that line is of like when do you open it versus when you do something on the outside and I think that my theory is it's just time it's just how long does that action take so if it's just checking your notifications or just reading the time or something quick like that or pausing your music that takes two seconds green light like that could be on the outside screen but watching a two-hour Netflix documentary or something that takes like writing an email you don't want to do that on the outside screen that's that's a red light and then there's a whole bunch of stuff kind of somewhere in the middle like flipping through a new playlist in Spotify maybe or checking your calendar or just like little brief stuff that's up to you so yeah if I could give Samsung any feedback on this thing that they've made here I mean I think they will continue to settle into this General shape I think they're pretty locked in with it but two things one the outside screen is 720p and if you look closely enough you can see some pixels so maybe a little resolution bump would be nice but I think more importantly actually is ltpo this is a 60 hertz outside screen so it's 60 hertz all the time and I think if you had an ltpo screen first of all it would match the 120 hertz Max refresh of the inside which it's not the end of the world that they're different but also that could save battery life being able to go down to one Hertz when you're only just like play pausing music or reading a quick notification or something that could help with the relatively small batteries on these phones oh and uh maybe add decks that would be kind of nice too so all right at the end of the day should you buy the z-flip 5. honestly the truth is that I think this is the best folding phone on the planet for the most people right now it's a great high-end chip the cameras are still solid the battery life is at least decent like the fingerprint reader is super fast it hits a lot of fundamental stuff it's not missing any massive features you got wireless charging ipx8 and they raise the base storage from 128 to a respectable 256 gigs for the thousand dollar starting price which is about as good as it gets with foldables and yeah the colors aren't that interesting but I do love a extremely easy to install dbrand skin on the back since it's literally just a square of glass so I'd drop the icon skin on there easiest install of my life but yeah until they do make some big jump in the form factor or some change to this thing as long as they're settling into this this is the safest easiest to recommend foldable on the planet easy and it even has a five year window of security updates like this feels like this feels like the iPhone of Android foldables I made a video about the iPhone of Android I'll link that below if you want to check that out too but either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace
