So this is a lego Mindstorm robot which we've hacked together into a semi Autonomous Robot which should be able to drive around the room on its own this robot is a lego Mindstorm with a battery pack strapped on top and a raspberry PI underneath and raspberry Pi Send signals to the little receiver on top to control the motors now once you have control like that You can you can program the PI to essentially control the robot it can drive around on its own Semi autonomously currently I've got this infrared controller Which sends in print signals from the remote to the receiver on top? This was initially how we received the robot with a few bits and bobs plugged on top including the Pi Then we've just hacked together a bit of solution, so that we could automate the control using the sensors instead We've got a raspberry Pi on the back. Which is Pi model B And we've got a breadboard on top for only little wires on and we've got infrared led which sends out a signal we pulsed this led at a certain oscillation which Corresponds to the Signals you can receive from the receiver on the machine so that essentially allows us to control the robot itself we also have some ultrasonic Sensors plugged into the front or back left and right Obviously on each side and what we do here is we essentially we do recall what we do Marcopolo And then we calculate the distance to the objects Immediately in front back left and right they send that one signal and it will bounce off all of the obstacles in the room It'll send a resultant signal back which will get received by the receiver So in a sense you're screwing Marco, and then polo getting the signal back and then the robot does a bit of a naive Naive search and essentially moves in the direction where it's not going to hit things Now this isn't perfect The robot itself is actually quite naive So the sensors on the front the back left on the right they're good for about thirty degrees of range But there are blind spots on the corners and the front and the back by the wheels Yeah sometimes this isn't great because you can hit very thin obstacles which the sensors don't necessarily get in range something such as a pole or something So it's it's not it's not perfect But it's good enough if you want to send it into an environment where you can't necessarily go here We're just trying it out with some different objects in a smaller environment we hacked together so we've got a small PC in a bit of wood and Just a small little cage to drive around in the idea Is that they should robot should be able to drive around on its own and not crash on the walls most of the time? Again, not perfect, but it's a good little demonstration of a naive a naive search Row Potentially, so I'm just going to plug it in to the monitor. We can connect to this wirelessly This robots normally setup on a static ip but due to some difficulties in the new Network. We've got installed. It's not working right now So I'm just gonna plug it into the monitor and do it that way instead So it's a raspberry Pi model B And it's got the standard operating system on which is a thing they call it noobs in terms of wiring each Sensor has a ground and a five volt rail, and then it's got input and output signals so the white wire is to send a signal to pulse the sensor and The back wire is to receive a signal back so essentially each one of these sensors has four cables And those four cables are powered and controlled by the raspberry Pi which is underneath the breadboard We would have soldered this together but We're a rapid prototyping when we made this and we just wanted to get something that works the raspberry Pi operating systems booted up now So we should be able to access the come online. I've written a program called Roma in C++ We should allow the robot to drive around semi autonomously Such a hack it's taking in data from the sensors, and it's thinking about where it's going to drive So the idea is it should be constantly polling the sensors in order seeing what data it can collect from the environment so this data will consist of Distance Data around it and more specifically the measurements are in centimeters So the the Sensors themselves have a range of about four meters which means the robot can drive in an area of about four meters Squared but again It's it's a naive robot so it may not pick up things below the sensors or may not pick up things out of the range Of the sensors, but it's not got a tilt sensor either has it no no there's no. There's no accelerometer on it It would have been something related if we had more, but and I think that's what's called backing yourself into a corner. Yeah nothing's perfect So it reaches the right depth in your brain We're taking a baseline now that means we're asking max to relax while we take an average of his brain activity
