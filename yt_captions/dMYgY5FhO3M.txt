it's probably algorithms I can't remember who it's by the textbook of algorithms is fabulous lots of formal Theory um yeah that's a terrible sign check question so before we start um have you got a favorite computer science book or a book that you uh you know just so I can get your levels right okay um of course the best bit would be about human computer interaction and research methods for understanding how software helps people rather than like how to build software fair enough build it right build it right okay what's your favorite computer science book so it doesn't have to be specifically computer science but maybe that relates in some way Ah that's a good question um well one of the first computer science books I liked I don't want to rank them in order but the first one I liked was on Advanced algorithms something that I don't do anymore but it was the first thing that really excited me it got me into computer science when I found a book that does an undergraduate course at the right sort of level and Andrew Tannenbaum you know from Friar University in Holland writes very good books and certainly the stuff of Brian's Brian's history and Memoir of eunuchs have greatly enjoyed but in some ways this is more General and I I would certainly put it on my top shelf no top shelf accessible shelf for sure shortlisted shortlisted yes sound check question then favorite can be a size book at the moment my favorite book is understanding cryptography by Christophe Parr and Jan pelzel wonderful book about cryptography I've been using it to teach but it's that for me it's that nice combination of practical interesting how this actually works and a bit of maths in there not too much math because then I get scared off viewers if this one looks crap it's because Sean has got a new camera and he doesn't know how to use it it's true it's fine anymore there's some great stuff going on the screen but I don't know what any of it means or is it it may even have image stabilization uh yeah it's really good there's there's very few computer books list all my God what's your favorite book though Pride and Prejudice okay there was no hesitation though whatsoever fantastic all right I know there's changes over the years so yeah well for me I would say say to a few people that I think it depends on which week you're asking me the best question because it would be different I recently got right into books through audible so I wrote about 300 in the past four years oh there are some bangers in there which do I like um a bit of medical drama things like bad blood about fairness and Elizabeth Holmes that was a very good book there's a book about sack the family but anyway also um for some reason you can't help you like 1960s um sort of Soviet era spying things like uh Kim philby um Ben McIntyre writes a lot of books don't know why I liked it so much but yeah it's um it must be pretty tense getting a sticky situation is fine wasn't it yeah like every day and now who do you believe who do you trust all that stuff is crazy just so I can check the mics working what's your favorite book my favorite book is uh I think it's called an English the glass marble game by uh Hermann Hazard a Herman has okay I should check that out yes it's a really good fun book about uh sort of the relationship between Academia and the real world um for all it's been written in the 19 30s I think it's still quite relevant you have one I'll tell you the book I've read recently that I liked the most and that was a book called Spy game by William Buckley and it's based on the life of a very famous counterintelligence officer in the CIA known as James Jesus Angleton and it was it's a quite well written book although Angleton basically only appears in half the book but I would recommend that to anyone if there are if they're looking for favorite book for a books to read it doesn't have to be computer science could be anything could be a novel can be a could be the dictionary I don't mind whatever it is what's your favorite book uh that's a tough question but it may have to be House of sleep by Jonathan Koh okay we'll see about is it a novel is it yeah it's a novel about yeah it's a novel a work of fiction about uh The Institute of the stories about a group of people that uh so if there's like a study about a group of people that cannot sleep and they put them together but it's a lot of there's a lot of uh human introspection and I don't want to spoil too much but that's I I think it's a also a lovely way of writing and I was so engaged with it and yeah I very rarely read for pleasure because I tend to read quite a lot for my job and so I find I do other things like coding and stuff for better or worse uh I can read um I do like a John Grisham uh yeah yeah nothing wrong with that bit of lawyers and you know murders and stuff just to check the microphones working then um what's your favorite book um so my favorite book is the first 15 lives of Harry August by Claire North uh contemporary British writer should I tell you what what it's about yeah so I don't want to spoil it too much for people who still want to read it I it's highly recommended so I'm not spoiling it by telling you that the protagonist is one of the people who can relive their life over and over again while remembering the previous lives and if it sounds very philosophical it's not it's actually this um premise leads to very interesting science fictiony and uh um a kind of psychological right implications like every life would be slightly different um and what happens to the knowledge that he acquired before and how does he use this knowledge um anyway highly recommend it what's your just checking the microphones working what's your favorite book uh favorite book I well the one I've read the most often let's get let's get let's give the intellectual answer pretend to actually know what I'm talking about which is I really like the acidity's history of the uh Athenian Spartan War mostly because it's has things like a description of a tsunami in there uh 500 BC something that I didn't understand existed until 2010. all right so uh just to check the mic's working uh what is your favorite book I I'd say um good Lasher Embark by Douglas hofstetter which is yeah I think you're smiling like you've heard this answer probably several times okay it's an absolute classic it's it's old now I think it was the 70s or 80s you call me a little by surprise with the question but um it's really imaginative playful look at what is AI in the sense of general intelligence before AI just became a whole bunch of neural networks talking to each other what might it mean to think it's absolutely wonderful and it's actually it's really comic um so it's it's funny intelligent very worth reading if computer science is your thing my name is Perla mayodino my favorite book is Alice in Wonderland ah very good very good okay so tell me your name and tell me what your favorite book is in computer science then my name is Marco camuri and my favorite book in computer science is a modern effective C plus plus my favorite book that's uh that's not an easy one I've got a few a few books that I particularly enjoyed reading but one book that I've really enjoyed lately was uh it's not actually a book it's a is a series of Five Books if I remember correctly by Martha Wells the first one is called all systems red and it's about a robot in the future a security board to be more precise that uh somehow manages to override its uh Governor which is like a a sort of module that guided Behavior and what is your favorite book my favorite book is a book called Hyperion by Dan Simmons the strike scary monsters yeah
