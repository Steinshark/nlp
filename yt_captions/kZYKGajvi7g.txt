when the Sony fx3 first came out a lot of the internet seemed a bit confused about who it was meant for like what made it more than just to re-house day 7 S3 or why pay more than 500 bucks for a top handle was the lack of an evf a deal breaker for me though as soon as the fx3 was announced I knew I'd be picking it over any other mirrorless camera on the market including the a7s III and I ordered mine just a few weeks after it went on sale since then I think it's out of a bit of a PR boost of sorts and all kinds of people in the film world like Danica verts and Mark bone are using them and now that I've been using mine regularly for over a year and especially since the much cheaper fx30 has come out I figured I'd share my long-term thoughts and let you know whether or not the fx3 is still worth it at the end of 2022 or whether or not you should go for the fx30 instead who is this camera for and who would be better off with the fx30 or maybe something else entirely what's good about it and there's a lot to like and what isn't so good would I buy it again for documentary filmmaking if I had a time machine I'm going to talk about all of these things in today's video and at the end whole way in on the accessories you'll be really get the full potential out of this camera also I'll go into whether or not I'd go with the fx3 or fx30 if I were buying in today so let's get into it hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is Luke Forsyth and on this channel I teach the skills I've learned over 10 years of working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to hit the Subscribe button because I've got new videos coming out every week the first thing I'll say is that once I sat down to shoot this video I immediately wished I had an fx30 because then I'd actually be able to hold the fx3 while I talk about it but that's not going to happen quite yet so we're just gonna have to make do with a bunch of slow-mo cutaways instead when I started making these YouTube videos I didn't really think I'd possibly need more gear but here we are again can we get serious now this also isn't going to be a technical review because that's not really how I decide what cameras I use anyways and high-end cameras from any manufacturer are all pretty amazing these days I'm personally more interested in whether or not this is the kind of camera I can use out in the world to film a professional quality documentary for a paying client instead of analyzing what happens if I shoot this camera at 250 000 ISO or something someone like Gerald undone or Phillip Bloom could handle a technical review so much better than I could anyways so I'm going to leave that out to The Experts and stick to what I know which is using this thing in the real world okay so when the Sony fx3 was first announced it seemed like not that many people online were excited about it a lot of people seem to be saying that they'd be going with the A7 S3 instead and that Sony had made a camera that no one wanted but for me it was the opposite finally Sony had made a mirrorless camera that I could use for my professional work and I ordered one as soon as I could the few things it did differently than the A7 S3 were game changers for me and even though the a7s3 is an amazing camera it would still be pretty inconvenient to use full-time as a b cam like I do with my fx3 now with that said the fx3 isn't perfect and I'm also going to touch on a few things that drive me crazy about it and whether or not the fx30 might be a better option but first let's start with the good stuff right off the bat let's get the obvious out of the way and that's the image quality the size ratio having a full frame camera as small as the fx3 that still shoots log footage with high dynamic range is huge I'd still probably choose the fx9 for my acam because when you compare the footage side by side I can definitely see a difference but there are a lot of situations where bringing a camera like the fx9 can be more hassle than it's worth like maybe you're trying to shoot under the radar and don't want to attract much attention or if you're following someone up a mountain or through the jungle and you don't want to carry something that big or maybe you have to shoot inside a car and hate constantly banging into the Windows like I do I also think at this point it's no secret that the video quality coming out of these cameras is ridiculous the files from the fx3 are beautiful they're easy to grade and they just look amazing but honestly that's sort of to be expected out of the top of the line mirrors camera from pretty much any major manufacturer I'm not a super technical reviewer though and there are about a thousand videos already on YouTube that have gone over this camera in so much more detail than I can so I'm not going to talk about bit rates or sharpness tests or any of that I really only want to talk about my personal experience using it in the field and I'll just say that you definitely aren't going to be disappointed with the footage this camera shoots especially given how much smaller it is than the fx9 also for comparing the fx3 to the super 35 fx30 I honestly doubt whether you'd really notice any difference in image quality other than the crop factor unless maybe you put them side by side on the monitor which I'd never do anyways the depth of a full frame sensor is really nice to have and I really love the image quality but it's hardly the most unique thing about the fx3 in my opinion if you spend a few thousand dollars on a mirrorless camera these days it's gonna look good so there has to be more to it than a nice sensor in documentary shooting the images are super important but it's audio that forms the backbone of your story if you don't have good audio you're going to have a very hard time making something more meaningful than just some slow motion b-roll layered over interviews and for the most part mirrorless cameras are an audio nightmare speaking of getting good audio the sponsor of today's video is actually audio but more on that later on a normal shoot for me I typically have a minimum of one character miked up at a time and I also like to run the best possible shotgun mic I can for environmental sound with the typical mirrorless like the a7s3 or Canon R5 it isn't that easy to feed multiple channels into the camera at once you can get an external recorder like a zoom H6 or a mixer box that screws into the bottom but they really just add bulk and more complicated workflows in post the fx3 with two XLR ports and a 3.5 millimeter Jack solves this problem and it makes it the first camera that I can really use to follow characters with audio coverage I can't stress enough what a game changer this is for the way I work like I can mount a high-end shotgun and run a lab at the same time both of which I can monitor through headphones using professional XLR ports most other mirrorless cameras out there can't do that natively and it is a big part of the reason I chose this camera I can't stress it enough two channel XLR audio is huge for professional work if I need to cover more than one character I can always put an internally recording lav mic on them like a technical trackie and feed audio time code to the camera 3.5 millimeter Jack and a little while ago Sony also announced that they've released a dedicated time code Jam cable that should make this even easier if you don't know what time code is I'll link to a super detailed Bloom video in the description but the short version is that it's a system for keeping different cameras and audio sources synced together so they can all be easily matched up in post most other mirrorless cameras out there at least the ones that I can think of come with just one 3.5 mil Jack you can plug a rode videomic Pro into or something which is great for a lot of things but if you want to start working at a professional level it's not quite enough at least for how I work if you're able to get the job done without having multiple audio options on your camera that's great and I'm not going to try and tell your gear isn't good enough or that you have to throw away your camera and get an fx3 to make good work but audio is a big deal in documentary in the fx3 just does it better than the rest the XLR ports are built into the top handle that ships with the camera and the handle itself has quickly become another thing I love about the fx3 shooting with the top handle on a small camera like that helps so much for controlling jitters getting low angles and just generally carrying the camera around comfortably for ages I've been adding like small rig or wooden camera top handles to my mirrorless cameras and they're good but they're just held on with a thumb screw and it's honestly not that secure of an attachment the screws on the fx3 handles go right into the body of the camera in two places and when you tighten it down it's rock solid I think Sony did a great job with the top handle but I also have to say it's a little bit too small for my hands and to make it perfect I've added a cheap accessory that I'll talk about later in the video with all that said the fx30 is also compatible with the same top handle and if you end up deciding to go that route and save some money I'd say the top handle would also be very necessary to add so if you're comparing these two cameras and trying to figure out which one is right for you I don't think either one has the advantage in the audio department as long as you get the fx30 package that comes with the handle while we're talking about sound this seems like a good time to talk about audio which is the sponsor of today's video as a doc filmmaker one of the challenges I'm constantly facing is finding good music for my edits not to mention YouTube channel I've used pretty much all the major providers out there so when audio first reached out to me I wasn't really sure why I'd think about using a new company but I'm really glad I did for starters audio's library is extremely well curated which for me is huge some music and sound effects libraries out there are just so massive that when I'm trying to find things I get lost and overwhelmed by the amount of choice so rather than focus on pure quantity audio prioritize qualities that you spend less time searching and more time just editing I think there's something like 6 000 hand-picked music tracks to choose from and over 30 000 sound effects since the focus is on quality over quantity like I said it's going to give you a ton of choice for your next project the audio Pro Plan that I personally use covers me for any usage and it covers me forever which is huge as a filmmaker I want to be able to use a music service for all my projects from YouTube to Big features without worrying about getting sued and audio is perfect for this you're never gonna have to read the fine print and figure out if you're actually allowed to use a track in the way you want the Pro Plan covers you for everything and on top of that and maybe most importantly audio is a crazy good deal financially whenever I start hearing words like Pro thrown around like Pro Plan I'm always a little suspicious about what it's going to cost me but audio is definitely the most competitively priced service out there that I know of at least seriously if you sign up to the link in the description and use the code Luke 70 you're going to get 70 off bringing the price down to under 60 bucks a year which is just insane for a service like this that's like a quarter of the price that I'm used to paying for audio services like this so it's a really good deal that I'd suggest to take advantage of while you can because I honestly can't imagine that they'll be able to keep the price that low for long especially for new filmmakers and content creators getting high quality music and sound effects this cheaply is amazing and if you do cancel down the road you'll still get to keep what you've already used honestly it's probably the best deal out there and if you do need music and sound effects whether you're a filmmaker or a YouTuber or a podcast or whatever so give it a try and use the code Luke 70 for that ridiculous discount the link will be in the description like always and let's get back to the video apart from the ability to capture professional audio for the first time the other major draw of the fx3 for me was the low light performance in dock work we often don't have the time to light locations and so we have to shoot with whatever light is available so by having the ability to shoot s-log at a native ISO of 12 800 the fx3 opens up a bunch of options that aren't even available to me on my fx9 which tops out at a native ISO 4000. if you put a 1.4 prime lens on the fx3 and set it to 12 800 you can pretty much see in the dark and that's made some creative possibilities that never existed to me before I absolutely love the low light performance of this camera and I would recommend it to anyone who shoots with available light and this is one area where the fx3 looks like it has a major advantage over the fx30 which has a much lower native ISO range which makes sense because of the smaller sensor size it's obviously a smaller sensor means less light hitting the pixels the Sony website says the ISO on the fx30 goes up to 2500 natively but I'm not quite sure if that's in all the picture profiles or if that goes higher in log let me know in the comments if you fully understand that one but if it does only go up to 2500 that's a major difference between these two cameras and it's something I'd really think about if you're going to be doing a lot of natural light work in challenging conditions like I do having that extra range might be super handy now whether or not it's worth almost two thousand dollars is another question but for me I'm happy I've got the fx3 in this department this generation of Sony cameras has also made massive progress in the battery life Department I remember shooting on the a7s II which was really cutting edge for a long time and we need to carry around six to ten batteries just for a day of shooting it seemed like you get about 20 minutes of battery out of one and since I like to use mirrorless cameras as a b cam for interviews this gets pretty inconvenient the difference between the old batteries and these new fx3 batteries is insane the fx3 I only own four batteries and even when I might have a two hour interview in the middle of a shoot I've never managed to get through all of them in a day for Doc shooting where you often have to wait to the end of a long day to recharge stuff this is big so well done so need these new batteries well I guess they're not new anymore because the a7s3 uses the same ones but anyways they're great the fx30 is the same batteries though so there's no advantage to the fx3 here lastly let's talk about autofocus mirrorless cameras have had good autofocus for a while now but the fx3 does an insanely good job in the right conditions now I'm not really saying and I don't really have enough experience with other high-end options to say that the autofocus is better but it works well enough that I don't even worry about watching it during interviews like I keep saying I use it a lot as a b cam for interviews and because I can trust the autofocus to just lock onto someone's eye and not lose it it means I can just pay attention to the acam and let the fx3 do its thing but when I use it on a gimbal the autofocus means I don't have to spend extra time setting up a wireless follow focus and I can pretty much just tap the screen to lock focus and forget about it with all that said for most Veritas shooting I still much prefer a manual focus lens with a long Focus throw and I normally wouldn't ever cover a scene with autofocus but for situations like I just described it's pretty amazing pretty much every Sony camera out there from the 6500 up has good autofocus though so I imagine the fx30 will also be a champ in this department so I don't think there's much of a difference there all right so I know I just sort of fanboyed out on the fx3 for a while but unfortunately it's not perfect and there are a few things that I really don't like about this camera the first one has been the most annoying for me by far and for some reason I never see anyone talking about it online now maybe that means there's something only wrong with my unit but whenever I shoot the highest audio bitrate which I think is 48-bit 4 channel the clips won't play back with audio in anything else but the newest version of Adobe Premiere if I open the shots in VLC or QuickTime or something or just hitting the space bar on my Mac like I do with other video files there's no sound and I get an error message about Dakota if I import them into Premiere the audio Works since I have Premiere and so does my editor it's not the end of the world but it does make it way more annoying to review footage on the go and for camera that I bought mostly because of its audio options it is such a shame that this is an issue I'm really curious if anyone else has this problem so if you're an fx3 user let me know in the comments if you've noticed this or if anyone from Sony is watching please let me know why this is happening it drives me crazy another thing I don't love is something I already touched on and that's the length of the top handle now I do really like this handle and like I said it's one of the main selling points for me it's about an inch and a half too short and when you've got a large shotgun mic and a big lens on the camera it can be hard to get the right center of balance it's such a shame because Sony nailed it with this handle in pretty much every way other than the fact that it's just a tiny bit too small luckily there are cheap fixes for this and that makes a nice segue into the accessories I'd personally recommend to get the most out of your fx3 the first one fixes this top handle length issue and that's an extender I use one from Condor blue that I really love and it works great but I know small rig and probably other companies make ones that work just as well I'm sure it's super simple just two screws and a piece of metal and extends the handle out to the length it should have been all along I wish I didn't have to buy this thing but at least there's a fix and it costs less than 40 bucks the next thing I'd add to this camera is a monitor of some kind now the camera works just fine without it but adding a five inch monitor really helps the odds that you don't go back to your computer and find out that all your best shots were slightly out of focus I would also get the Sony time code cable now that it's been released I mean if you don't do multi-cam shoots and you don't deal with multiple audio sources often you can skip this but for me it's huge being able to feed time code right into the camera means I can hand the fx3 off to a second camera operator while I shoot on the fx9 and I know that we're going to be able to sync everything together in post without having to listen to that crazy screeching sound of audio time code it's cheap and it really improves the professional applications of the camera so for me it's a no-brainer finally I suggest grabbing just one of the CF Express cards these things are ridiculously overpriced in my opinion so I personally wouldn't use them because you can pretty much shoot in every video format other than Max quality 4K at 120 frames a second by using much cheaper v90 cards but I do shoot in 120 from time to time and having to drop the image quality every time isn't ideal but you just need one of these cards to be able to get the super slow motion you need without having to drop the codec down in quality and I think one is more than enough don't buy five separate 400 cards when way cheaper ones will do unless you shoot a ton of slow-mo so with all that said would I still buy the fx3 if I could go back in time knowing what I know now or would I pick the fx30 instead the short answer is yes I think the fx3 is still pretty much the best mirrorless camera out there and for someone like me who rents their gears to production companies we're usually expecting to have the very best stuff out there it makes sense for me to have the fx3 the amazing image quality Stellar low light performance and most importantly the ability to run professional audio via XLR ports all make it the Top Choice is it perfect no I've had a few gripes with it since I got it a year ago mostly over that weird audio codec issue but in general I'm really glad I got it and I plan on keeping it for a long time when it comes to dock shooting I would definitely recommend it over the A7 S3 or the equivalent from Canon or whoever any day of the week and if you can swing this deep price tag I think you'll love it too but the fx30 gets us most of the way there for much much cheaper it's not full frame but in good light I doubt most people would be able to tell the difference you also have the same audio options assuming you get the handle which means you can actually use it to follow characters around the major disadvantage is its worst low light performance but considering the area Alexa has a native bioso 500 I think and they used to shoot Blade Runner it's not like it's going to ruin your shot especially if you get a decent timelines as well with all that in mind if I were a new Doc shooter just starting out I think I'd probably go with the fx30 if you have the budget and you're doing lots of pay jobs then for sure the fx3 is the better camera in my situation it makes sense and I'm happy I have it but if I think back to where I was 10 years ago I would have been much better off saving the 1500 bucks or whatever and investing in other stuff for the price difference you could get a sigma art lens and a decent lavalier mic and still have some change left over even if the sensor is a bit smaller and the low light performance a bit worse you're still going to be able to do some amazing stuff with it and most importantly you'll be practicing your storytelling skills which are the most important thing of all alright that's it for today's video hope you found it helpful to hear what I think of the fx3 after more than a year of heavy use maybe it helped you make your own decision about whether or not to pull the trigger on one for yourself or if you should go for the fx30 instead if you did like the video think about subscribing so I can keep this channel going or maybe watch this other video I made about five essential camera accessories for new filmmakers see ya [Music]
