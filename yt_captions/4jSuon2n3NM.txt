everywhere you look one of your colleagues friends maybe even a family member is learning something new new technologies learning something new and I don't know about you but I feel like I am constantly feeling like I'm on my own and kind of behind the game I mean there are so many different things to learn and where do I put my energy going into 2024 all right we've done a lot of these videos where we talk about where to put your focus going into the new year what technologies you should be learning I thought this would really fun to kind of go back in time a little and take a look at some technologies that already are existing already out there for quite a long time which I will not be learning in 2024 also as a side note got to jump in here again well I I just moved over a little bit but if you haven't signed up for takeoff yet you need to I have seen such an influx yeah an influx that's the word right registrations on takeoff it makes me so happy and if you haven't heard about takeoff yet this is this is a new platform that I founded a few months ago and the reason being is I kept on getting asked from people like yourself around where do I go to network to build these relationships where do I go to find mentors I want to keep up on the latest and greatest technology that is out there where can you go where this is all housed in one place and that is Takeoff we've started with speakers we're releasing a speaker probably right now about every two weeks in the New Year we will also be releasing different workshops both Technical and non-technical the first one that someone is already working on is around AWS and I'm just going to leave it there very broad but it's going to be amazing so really takeoff is a place where you can come and learn at your own pace from real industry insiders people who actually work in the tech industry you're not learning from influencers you're not learning from YouTubers you're learning from people who actually work in the tech industry for many many years and can provide their expertise their guidance alongside with the workshops for both Technical and non-technical so if you are someone once again technical or non-technical but wants to stay up to date with tech have those online mentors build that Network go join takeoff I get very passionate about this we're going to stop it there because it's [Music] amazing all right let's start I've done a few of these videos on Technologies I would no longer learn I'll link them down below but I'm telling you the challenge for this video is because I've done a few other ones I really had to dig deep as to what technologies that I haven't spoken about already would I not be learning in 2024 now there are a lot and some probably controversial because they're still widely used when I say I will not be learning I want to share with you some context I mean I will not be going out of my way on my free time to learn these Technologies it doesn't mean they're bad it doesn't mean they're not in demand it just means it doesn't make sense for myself anyways and I would say for most people to pick up these new when they're not new technologies they're old Technologies but to pick up these Technologies if you are looking to invest your time into learning something that is in demand relevant high paying and will really grow with the future of tech all right coming in at number one is traditional manual server management and deployment so first of all what exactly is this before we get into why I wouldn't learn it in 20124 so in traditional environments server management and deployment involved a lot to say the least of manual tasks so here's how it kind of mapped out first of all there are physical servers set up so physically installing and configuring in data centers still very common obviously software installation so manually installing operating systems middleware and applications then we have configuration setting up configurations for each application which could vary from server to server this is a very manual process Follow by scaling I mean you have to physically add more servers to handle increased load and then of course there is maintenance so here's an example as to what that used to look like so a company runs a web application that requires setting up and maintaining several physical Ser manually installing the web serice software databases and managing network configuration so what would I learn today in 2024 instead of all those manual processes for me it would be more modern practices such as containerization orchestration Etc so let's look at containerization such as Docker we've all seen this cute little whale here I mean why is it a whale can we get to the bottom of this please so containerization involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a container that can run on any Computing environment so of course this really helps ensure consistency across multiple development testing and production environments it really can be consistent across different platforms let's go through an example of Docker though so using Docker a developer can package a web application with all its dependencies into a container this container can then be around on any machine so it doesn't have to be your specific machine where does that mean when we need it where it's like well it works on my machine all right let's dive into orchestration so let's say say this is a great example of kubernetes orchestration tools manage the life cycle of the containers that we just spoke about in large dynamic environments so these when you think large environments of course large tech companies that have a massive environments that need to be managed so with something like orchestration tools such as kubernetes the benefits are they automate deployment scaling management and containerized applications so let's use an example of this a company that uses kubernetes to manage a cluster of containers kubernetes can and automatically handle the deployment of these containers across a cluster manages their health and scales them up or down based on traffic the next one is soap no not the kind of soap you're thinking of soap meaning simple object access protocol for web services so this is still something that is widely used but I'm going to share with you well first I'm going to share with you what it is and then why I wouldn't be learning it soap was widely used for building web services which are applications to communicate over a network typically the internet and it's really known for it strict specifications and Reliance on XML or extensible markup language it really requires often times extensive setup and is very heavy weight in terms of bandwidth and resources so what are the Alternatives well the Tech Community really shifted towards more lightweight and flexible Alternatives like rest and graphql I mean everywhere you look now people are raving about using graphql that's something I would learn in 2024 by the way so let's dive into both of these rest representational State transfer rest uses standard HTTP methods and it's considered more efficient easier to understand and better suited for web applications needs then we have graphql which is a newer I mean it's not really that new anymore but newer technology and it allows clients to request exactly the data they need nothing else other than what exactly they need which of course makes it more efficient especially for complex applications all right number three is something I've spoken about before Pearl why am I speaking about it again because I feel like like the first time I covered it I didn't do it justice as to what exactly it is and also to why I'm not going to be learning it that was one that I got got to put the green screen down I got a lot of comments being like why not Pearl I love Pearl I use Pearl there is no hate towards Pearl I think Pearl is still very wi all right let's just explain what it is first okay Pearl Pearl is known for its versatility and used for system administration Network programming web development and more so it's really versatile and used across various really different platforms and if you're familiar with C it uses a lot of simil or it has a lot of similarities to the programming language C so that's kind of a similar uh aspect to it and it can be used across various different platforms however here's why I would not learn Pearl in 2024 well I mean the first one is I don't know the last time I've seen a job posting requiring Pearl I mean obviously there are specific niches within that and I'm sure it pays really well because of that so why did it decline definitely because you know when you think python JavaScript they have risen and pearl has started to decline because of that and this is because you know there I mean many different things from python being so much easier to pick up and learn to being more versatile even and same with JavaScript not to mention with python it's been so widely integrated not only into web development or software development but also too into data science machine learning pretty much many different buckets within the tech industry all right and my last ones I had to add these in mainly for fun because it's really cool to look back on Old Tech I will not be learning in 2024 and I hope for this one you will not either which is Adobe Flash and then also two Microsoft silver lights so let's go through what I these are so Adobe Flash was a dominant platform for producing rich media content on the web and it was really used for creating animations it was popular for web designers for its ability to create visually appealing and dynamic websites so it was often difficult to achieve these interactive uh things with HTML and CSS and it was often used before Javas cript yes there was a time before JavaScript so why did it decline what happened well obviously with the rise of JavaScript that is a main one but also there was a lot of other issues one being security concerns so flash had a number of security vulnerabilities leading to it being really easily targeted by uh hackers and malware and actually Adobe announced the end of flash support in 2020 so it's not something that's even supported anymore however I think it could be fun just to no it wouldn't be fun I was going to say to build something with it maybe I don't know would you flash even though it's still not supported all right let's move on to Microsoft silver light we are doing another Back to the Future or back to the past I guess so basically you can think of uh silver light as Microsoft's answer to flash so is used for streaming media graphics and animation and similar to its competitor Adobe Flash when different programming languages such as JavaScript came onto the scene we really saw a decline in silver light similar to I didn't even mention this with Adobe Flash but also to Microsoft silver light they both require plugins which can become a really big barrier as browsers and users moveed more towards a plugin-free web uh for security and performance reasons so we really saw a decline as the web really shifted all right those are my top four technologies that I will not be learning in 2024 curious to hear do you agree with me do you disagree what other ones would you add in the mix leave in the comments I think this is such a good discussion to have and a really important topic to cover because we need to look back on the past to see how things have evolved some better than others as to learn where we are going and moving forward with technology also as a side note I make all my YouTube videos based on what you want to see questions you have so leave in the comments any topics you want me to cover questions you have and I will ensure to make them all right thank you all make sure to hit that subscribe button if you haven't and I will see you soon [Music] bye
