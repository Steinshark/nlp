I really want to talk to you about um computer generated plants right so you know how we can how we can produce these things inside a computer how we can render them how we can draw them uh and and you could imagine this be useful for a game maybe or for some kind of film or for a movie um but actually this goes back to the 60s with this guy called Linden Meer and he was a biologist and he was really interested in modeling the the growth of filamentous organisms which well you know I'm not a biologist uh at all but um my my Wikipedia searching tells me that a filamentous organism is one where in fact I got a picture here where you have a row of cells and these cells can do different things they they're differentiated in some way right but there's no there's no tissue there's there's no filling in what he thought is that you could represent these things in a computer right you could model this growth computationally and by doing that you're kind of formalizing things right you're you're you're making it very clear you know what what can happen what can't happen um and yeah this started as a biological thing right it's a bit like kind of The Game of Life commo Game of Life yeah it's it's very similar it's one of these examples of kind of an emergent property yeah very very similar okay what is an L system so we have some symbols uh in this case let's say we have a and we have B and these symbols represent cells right in in an organism so for example here you know each of these blobs is going to be a symbol right and um the the particular symbol it is represents some some some chemical property of it or some hormone it might have inside of it some something going on inside this cell and then we have rules so let's say a maps to a b this means that at every time step a is going to divide into two cells and one of these cells is going to be a the other cell is going to be B and we can give a rule for b as well and in this case I'm just going to say B is converted into an a you know these are very simple rules right these just cell division cell differentiation but uh the interesting part is when we actually start drawing this as an organism so I'm going to say a corresponds to a straight cell just like a a cell there's nothing going on there and B through some chemical property which this symbol represents is like a curvy cell like that and then if we had um an organism say a b a a b we can actually draw this out right so we've got the straight line from the A and then we have a curvy line from the B and then we have a straight line here from the A and we have another straight line for the A and finally we have our B here which is a curvy cell you know this is unremarkable in itself but the interesting part comes when we start applying these rules we can start from like a seed organism like like you say call maybe the egg or something and we're just going to start with an a here and then we want to apply these rules so for each symbol in our organism we replace it with what the rules tell us to so in this case we just get an A and we can repeat this the a gives us another a and then this B here gives us an a I can repeat this again this a gives us an a this B gives us an A and this final a gives us an A and A B I'll do it one more time so you know here's our organism and this has grown naturally from this seed according to our rules and if I draw this out again and here's our organism you're probably going to say this doesn't look much like a plant and this isn't a plant actually this is one of Linden Meyer's original L systems for modeling algae actually so this is meant to represent an algae very similar to this one here which is a a filamentous algae so uh okay later on lyen me became much more interested in plants so he was speaking to some of his botanist friends and they thought well you know this is all well and good but actually this could map quite nicely into plants as well so here's a new L system so we have five symbols we have a b c d D and K and then we have four rules so a goes to CBC B goes to d a d c goes to K and d goes to a and we want to start off with just a single a and that's going to represent the C so if I start with an a we're then going to get a CBC we're going to get the c maps to a k the B gives us a d a d and then the final C gives us a k since there's no rule for the K this just remains unchanged this D gives us a final a a gives us another c b c this D here gives us an A and this K uh is there's no rule so it just stays the same and actually something we can see happening is that this is symmetrical and you know we can kind of see by the rule that is always going to be symmetrical which actually saves some time in in the calculating this so I can as soon as I get to the midpoint I can just copy it over so I'm going to do a few more of these okay here we go so we have some we have some organisms here these each represent an organism in varying growth stages and now I'm going to tell you how to draw them we have some rules on how we draw these things so I'm going to tell you that the A and the B both correspond to a sharp point so like this the C and the D correspond to like a shallow curve that kind of thing um and a k corresponds to kind of like a deeper curve like that kind of thing and if we have more KS then the curve is deeper so so what I can actually do now is start drawing these things out so I'll use a green for this one my a gives me this Green Point here my CBC so I start off with a curve and then a point at the top and then another curve coming down the side um so I can try and label this so C and then we have a b at the top and then a c here and then my next one here I start with this big scoop shape uh and then I get a color lobe and then a point at the top with the A and then symmetrical again so k k d d a at the top I can draw out the next one now I'm going to draw the next one and this b is another point and now we've reached the halfway point so I can actually just copy over this side again looks like Holly looks like Holly it does look like Holly you'll see it even looks more like Holly next time and there we go I mean like you know that's Holly right yeah yeah or a Gothic cross or a Gothic cross the Gothic cross curve just fill in these lesss here okay I mean so this is this is something which Lind and my was really interested on early on is modeling leaves that's well known in biology apparently again I'm not a biologist but apparently it's a wellknown fact that leaves actually form from the margin so from the outside of them and so he said that um if you can model how these cells kind of grow on the outside of the leaf you can model very well how how the leaf itself grows but there's another really cool thing here maybe you can see by looking at the symbols at the top maybe you can see by looking at the pictures but actually if I look at say this sequence here this is exactly the same sequence as this sequence here okay and it's also exactly the same sequence as oh it's kind of split over the line here but we start here and we continue to here and furthermore this sequence here in the middle is exactly the same sequence as this sequence and in general this is the case right so if I want to say call this is sequence one S1 this is S2 S3 S4 five and so on we can say in general that SN equals a k so these K's on either side followed by S of nus 3 so that corresponds to the S4 here followed by S of n minus 2 followed by S of nus 3 again followed by another K and um this really nicely represents this kind of recursive nature of these leaves and actually you can see this in the picture as well so if I look at this Leaf in the bottom so this is S7 uh then I can actually Circle this part here and um you can see that this is exactly the same as this one here uh which is a bit hidden within within the jumble of s but this is just translated over and interesting we can also see that this top um kind of section is exactly the same as this one here and um yeah this is the case in general right so um this is a very very simple way of generating recursive leaves which is pretty cool later on Lynden Meyer and um and his friends became a lot more interested in modeling entire plants rather than just organs of the plants um and so the problem here is you have branching right so how do you represent branching in a in a in a single dimensional array and um here's an L system which does represent branching the idea is that X and Y both just are a stem they're part of a stem right that's just a line plus and minus are are rotation so these kind of say move the next stem a little bit to the left a little bit to the right um and then you have these square brackets so these square brackets actually represent um a branch right so anything inside of these happens in its own world you can think of it happening in parallel and this lets us represent uh proper like trees and and and plants and things like that so if I start off with Y and then uh this becomes very quickly quite large so this becomes X open square bracket minus y close square bracket square bracket + y um and then we can do the same process again so we get XX bracket minus and then we get the whole Y part again so X bracket minus y bracket + Y close bracket bracket plus X bracket minus why I don't want to make a mistake here because I'm whole plant's GNA look off I'm not going to go any further because this is getting absolutely massive already but um you can see kind of where this is going to go maybe if I draw these out in the exact way that I've I've set forth here the Y is going to give me just a line so this is y uh this is like a very maybe maybe this is just the beginnings of a plant right so this is It's just sprouted up from the soil and then here the X and the Y both have the same property visually so they're both just lines so here's my X um and then we have two branches right so this Branch here um happens independently to this Branch here so I'll first do the left Branch um and this says minus which means the next thing is rotated to the left and then I have another Branch another stem here so this is my Y and then this is independent that means I can now go back here and do the other Branch so this going to be rotate to the right and then do a stem so that's Y and I'll do the next one as well so we have two x's to start off with that's x x and then I have a branch at the left uh with a rotation so uh and then X so here's my X and then I have two more branches right and then these happen independently once again so I'll do this Branch first so I have a minus and then a y y and then I'll do this Branch here and then this is going to be pointing upwards um that's the end of this Branch then that's the end of this whole Branch Al together so now I can start on this branch uh and this is actually exactly the same thing except from it starts with a right rotation and then a left rotation so I can actually take a bit of a short hand and just fill that in so are they always symmetrical these or is it just the way the rules work they're not always symmetrical actually so you can see the thing with these rules is that um they are very symmetrical looking rules so so we when we whenever we copy a y we have one on both sides but if for example you did something slightly left on each branch then you're going to get very different results but okay we can maybe see these as very primitive plants right there's some branching going on there's some some kind of stem and some kind of maybe even a canopy maybe this looks like a tree uh but I'm not going to go any further by hand because I can't draw anything bigger than that uh so so what I've done is I've written a little python script which I'll share the code to that uh somewhere in the description probably um which can render these for me much faster than I could do it by hand so you can see currently this is just um drawn out this single line from the first one but if I press enter it's going to draw the next one and um you can see that it kind of comes back and it does these branches separately just as I was drawing it by hand um I can press enter to go to the next one again and here we go here's exactly the one I've just drawn here the nice thing is that now I can go to much deeper ones here right so I can go to the next one and um you can see there's a lot of kind of teleporting around and um behind the scenes what these brackets are actually doing is they're keeping track of the position we're at before drawing and then when we get to the Clos bracket we kind of recall this and and teleport back back to that position to continue with that Branch um so I actually have a fast mode implemented here because um it's very slow otherwise so here we go the next one and here's the next one and and you know this just gets bigger this is this is really infinite growth here but we can get some some very tree like things right you know this this looks like a tree there's a you know you've got a canopy you've got you got branches you've got a big trunk in the middle so it's just another really nice example of kind of how you can get this this amazingly complicated behavior from really the simplest rules there're just two two very short rules here so just to kind of hammer that home I really want to show you uh one which I've um spent a little while making earlier with some with some extra little features to make it a bit more realistic so yeah here are some rules I made earlier these are a little bit more complicated than what we've seen so far but yeah there's nothing too different going on again it starts off with a very very tiny bud at the bottom and I can press enter a few times and you can see this is starting to grow we got some white flowers on top we have some some some branches we're starting to see I can do this a few more times and um this is actually making some really cool patterns uh you know this is looking a bit more realistic and I'll I'll tell you why in a second but um if I let that grow kind of to full the screen um here we go we have we have a really nice picture of a plant does this remind you of anything so there is actually some randomization going on here so uh you can see the stems are kind of curving over to one side there's a bit of um unevenness and that's just to make it look a bit more realistic it's kind of simulates maybe there's some wind going on in the background another interesting thing actually is that I'm simulating tropism here so so actually these these stems are trying to go to toward 60° so this is actually supposed to be Cowley very common here in England cow passley and hello pretty close yeah pry close as I could get can I ask how you did the color the white yeah so whenever this program draws an F or a g what it does actually is it draws the stem as usual and then it just draws a little dot at the top uh and that's all it takes um so it really comes back to this idea of uh you know you can you can encode some very very complex Behavior just um just in these symbols really so these leaves actually come from this paper which which Lynden Meer wrote uh in 1974 so a very very long time ago and this is a really cool paper but uh no world station will begin or continue its own transmission and this is really is the core the heart
