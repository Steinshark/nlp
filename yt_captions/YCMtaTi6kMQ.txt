I accidentally saved a half million dollar I saved my company a half million dollars in about five minutes this is more money than I've made for my employers over the course of my entire career because this industry is a sham I clicked about five buttons let's start with some background because it's it is a [ __ ] wild that an inefficiency that took me five minutes to solve in a gue configuration panel was allowed to persist we cancelled someone's contract this week before I did this someone lost their job because no one could get their acts together long enough to click the button I told them to click it's just like I my first job out of school it was like at a larger Corporation and there was red tape or everything and this this is like this is bringing back some flashbacks we got to have a meeting gotta have some meetings about clicking that button before we can get it got to get some sign off before you just start clicking buttons let's get let's get let's get the Tactical Team together then presented to the VP about how we're going to click this button I've been at a company that was both High paste and high red tape and it was crazy it was crazy all right a few years ago at this uh at this company uh let's see or sorry a few years ago this company decided that it wanted to create an analytics platform following the decision to become more data driven they hired someone some incredibly talented people to make this happen and then like five times as many idiots dude this article is just coming out the gates at the time this was happening I had just graduated and joined the organization as a data scientist I'm somewhat of a data scientist myself now is he part of the idiot camp or a part of the part of the Smart Camp unclear I mean he's the one that saved him half a million dollars so he seems like a genius you know genius uh we well he also said it was on accident and now saying that he's been telling people to push this button but for a long time we of course did not do any data science because the organization did not require any data science to be done what they actually needed to do was fire most of the staff in every team leaving behind the two people who actually had good domain knowledge then allow them to collaborate with good engineering teams to build sensible processes and systems instead they hired a bunch of big firm Consultants you can see where this is going already can see have you been in a big consultant uh Workshop TJ yeah well I'm thinking we should start big firm Consultants like as a company just name it big firm consultants and we can come in and promise to 0.5x any progress the company has we will be able to successfully make you the most unsuccessful company of all time skip the drama we'll do it at half the price I like this idea big and firm LLC LLC yeah that might be the best chat you might have just said the funniest thing you've ever said you should just retire now you've just done it no more chats please no more chats uh all right nonetheless at the time I was young and took the organization at its word Executives would tell us constantly how excited they were for us to roll out new AI initiatives then tell us there was no time so we uh so could we please get back or get that report to them in a spreadsheet and yeah I mean I've this is this is actually a really a real feel and I'd ask for some sort of compute to perform some machine learning or even set up data pipelines it never worked instead we were told that we were just uh we just had to wait for the advanced analytics platform AAP to be deployed you see it's December it's launching in January then in January I was told to be patient it was coming in March then in June I was told it had to be put on hold due to coid this was a very convenient excuse because they had absolutely effed the whole project up already but it brought some valuable time or it bought some valuable time by the by next December I had left the organization and the AAP was still nowhere to be seen how long do you think we'll still be able to blame projects missing timelines on Co like I know Wheel of Time is still saying that their show is bad because of Co but I'm like wondering when that excuse doesn't work anymore yeah the wheel of prime is probably gonna is g to probably ride that out as long as possible yeah we just just it's still season 8 we're still struggling to catch back up yeah just we never caught back up just never quite got there you know it's I I I still see some people referencing it but it's largely I I haven't seen it in a while to where someone actually realistically uses CO as an excuse because it'd be pretty hard at this point it's pretty hard to sell that as an excuse yeah especially like you've you're an all remote company already no one's in the office well actually you know guys it's just we can't do it I don't know been remote for three years I know we pretended to be locked up for our entire life as a remote company but now it's really hard we skipped ahead three years the AAP is finally ready to launch three five what is that five total years in development yeah wait a second I just then okay three years later and now it's now okay so that means five years ago they started it and now it's going to be shipped it turns out none of the features I needed were ever planned so I guess they were just lying to me before I left nice okay four Engineers leave the company in the same week and I speak with the directors uh because I know they need a real engineer in and they can't find them I am substantially less experienced engineer than many of the readers here but suffice it to say that I can read documentation without panicking okay I mean that's I mean already I can't read so like that's that's a that is our I mean he's you me all right which is consider uh in this uh country yes it is uh my conditions a big pile of money and they had put uh me on the AAP team because they're they're the only team that gets actual toys to play with part two it sucks the more you curse by the way YouTube videos tend to demonetize cursing it's true I don't know if you know this uh it's an insane dumpster fire spider web of technical debt and it's uh only like one week old here are some fun details well it's five years of somebody making capital D design decisions yeah let's see I get a friend of mine hired a big fan of nepotism and he finds uh on day one a file in the project repository that deletes prod using our cicd wait wait what that deletes prod using our cicd pipelines if it is ever moved uh into the wrong folder yeah I don't even get that even design such a system it's a common strategy instead of GI hooks they just were like what if we delete everything instead of checking this before you commit we just delete broad I just want to I would like to walk through someone's head that this was a valid strategy to begin with like the team meeting so what are we G to do if they move it burn burn the whole ship down burn everything and we don't do backups here that's for the week we don't mess up we intentionally delete I bet you use a seat belt oh no this makes no sense it was produced by by a former lead engineer who has moved uh to a new role before his sins catch up with him yeah this is completely reasonable it comes oh sorry I missed this part it comes complete with the key and password required for admin account let's go Sweet Nothing Like checking in the old credentials and plain text the entire thing is stitched together by spreadsheets that are parsed by python dropped into S3 parsed by lambdas into more S3 the S3 files are picked up by mongod DB then [ __ ] records are passed to another Lambda into S3 the S3 f are pulled into snowflake via snowpipe the new snowflake data is pivoted by a JavaScript stored procedure into a relational format and that's how you edit someone's database access the whole process is to upload like 2 KB uh CSV into a database that has people's database roles in it let's go this is impressive again I I want to meet these people like how did they ship this in 5 years this would have taken me a lot longer I I don't I like honestly I'm not sure if I could accomplish what what they have accomplished this is impressive to use that many individual Technologies imagine creating a scaled mongod DB sharded instance because does it like [ __ ] at this point takes like three mongos to run right and it's there's like this whole sharding strategy that you have to get into like imagine putting all that together just to put it back into Lambda they literally just they part a CSV and then put it into a database like it's practically a database in CSV like CSV is Poor Man's database that's all it is it's just a table uh this is considered more auditable everything is transformed into a CSV because the security team demanded something that could undergo easy scanning for malicious content they never uh let's see then they never deployed the scanning tool so this hurts so we uh have all the downsides of the csvs and none of the upsides perfect I like how they're like worried about malicious content but they also just save the admin credentials in plain text like guys we really got to be careful someone could do something bad with the system by the way here's the password oh no this is not satire I I actually honestly don't believe this is satire I actually believe that this is real because I've seen things like this where it is an insane setup to accomplish sometimes the most trivial tasks yeah uh every Lambda function the backbone of all the ETL pipeline start with counter equals 1 because one of the early iterations used a counter and people have just been copying that line over and over senior data Engineers have been copying that line over and over I mean that's fair here's the deal whenever you do whenever you put something in the code somebody else is going to copy it because they don't understand why it's there okay to be completely fair and you know you know what happened is somebody at one point deleted counter equals one on one of the scripts where they actually used the counter right so then at from that day forward that's the first thing you warned people and they make one guys okay don't delete the counter equals one like it has to be there otherwise it takes down prod and you're going to get paged you know it to be true uh the test Suites and cicd pipelines have been failing for months because someone during debugging chose to use the Linux T command to log any error to both standard out and a file at the same time by the way I love the T command great for some command line Foo not sure they probably watching your stream yeah I don't think I'd use it in cicd though but T successfully executing was overwriting the error code from the failing tests nice it's green baby it's so green to get access to to the password for any API we need to hit uh we need to hit you search for something like service password for an a uh in an AWS service which Returns the value service password as in literally all the values are the same as the keys then you use that to look up the actual password in a completely different service no one knows why we do [Laughter] this I also believe this like this is just something I completely believe exists the script that generates configuration files for our pipeline starts with six AR lines of comments because senior Engineers have been commenting the lines out in case uh they're needed later the lines are just setting the same variables to different values and they're all on GitHub anyway nice they use GitHub though I'm impressed there's something yeah I'm confused at how they got all their deletion going someone wrote a GI UB workflow that deletes everything based on that one f move that's impressive let's this is an organization that some percentage of readers will recognize on sheer brand strength if uh if they're in my country oh that's funny see I don't recognize this I'm not even getting started but we have to stop for now because I'm going to catch fire these details are important because you now understand the kind of operational incompetence that allows you to waste so much money on processing less than a terabyte of data per day that it dwarfs your team's salary nice all right number three the budget this is literally my workplace is this literally your workplace uh oh uh bash bunny we're not in the same room we're on this is Ping by the way the same room um but TJ will be in the same room with me in what like a month two months yeah about a month yeah yeah it's going to be good it's going to be great you're going to come over and hang out with me true all right the next thing to realize is that this platform never really had a chance of making any money for the organization they do little accounting they do a little accounting trick read lying uh which I'll talk about in another post that makes it seem like they they've had huge wins but really this is just many times more expensive than our previous operational model I love this this is a genius strategy uh the deal is that we pretend the whole team is doing something or other and we stay within budget because the organization can't afford to spend infinite money on this social fiction uh however the budget for our database costs was being drastically overrun I'm not sure what the original estimate was but I think uh it was intended to cost something like 200k a year uh of operations but we were no we were now close to a million dollar let's go okay I'd be surprised if you did database like database operations when they say operations is is he talking about the cost of running the thing or the cost of maintaining the thing no I think he's saying literally oper operational costs for the whole pipeline like with S3 and and Lambda and Snowflake and and like all the things together okay it's like a million impressive this is truly impressive uh let's see some quick facts we use snowflake as our data base which charges you based on the size of the computer you use to run your queries okay I'd have to understand that more that sounds like a confusing way to measure uh you will pay uh for let's see you only pay for the computers while they're on okay that seems reasonable we probably run a few thousand queries per week mostly developers experimenting with little tweaks for power by reports this is the second time I've ran into this power by thing Power by is like a no code tool isn't it I don't know but I feel like this space is ripe for someone to make an alternative maybe power try or something like the next level uh and you could make something that works power bi as I'm being told is a data Vis tool like Tableau oh it's it's a data Vis tool like Tableau it's Tableau but by Microsoft oh shoot that sounds awful well that sounds productive yeah cool didn't we used to call that access o access is actually kind of cool though what was that TJ dude access was the first time I ever saw a database and I was like wow you can see what's in there cancel TJ yeah you we have some people in access was cool he said it access was not cool okay TJ I'll stand by it I've already been banned from chat three times today Nightshade ban night shade you can't hurt me here buddy you've been banned again reason access oh man it was in my first time I ever ever saw a database chat okay it's pretty cool if you've never seen a database before the computers are set to idle for 10 minutes after every query I assume that is because it's trying to optimize not having a startup cost maybe startup cost some amount of time and therefore if you keep it on when another query comes in it should be good but if if I'm reading this correctly they're running a few thousand queries per week which means that you're probably never going to hit this 10minute idle business I noticed this about a month into joining the team and suggested we uh don't have the computers run for like two orders of magnitude longer than they need to for every query I literally can't remember what was said there was some agile [ __ ] about doing a discovery piece then it just never happened dude all good ideas go to die in agile I swear this is real I swear this is absolutely real you come up with a great idea that takes almost no effort and then you have to go and like do discover you got to you got to prove that the idea can work but the proving that the idea could work is 10 times as hard as just like actually trying it can I just flip a switch and we'll just see what happens no no no no no no no that's an next Sprint material that's totally next Sprint material you never go we need to decide how many story points that is dude what's the user story for this all right can we we need the scrub Master come on scrub Master come in here number four just do the thing uh anyways months later they finally give me a card that says Discovery optimize costs yes there it is now I have to optimize cost so that I uh have something to say at the next standup and fortunately I know just the thing I test my hypothesis that this is all a sick joke and I'm going to push the button that I secretly think should obviously have been pushed we uh we've got a new guy on another team who seems excellent so I ask management if I can give him admin credentials since we need competent people they say no I flick him some lower level database credentials that I technically wasn't uh told not to do since they aren't admin credentials and he sanity checks that I would save money at 4M on the last day of the week I ping the chat full of good engineers and no managers to make sure I not about to Nuke everything then just do it let's go the secret group chat that's running the company dude if there I don't know I don't think that exists at Netflix which means that a I'm not a good engine or B we're all good Engineers there's only two things there there is the only two options but I am not in a secret I am not in a secret slack Channel I'll tell you that much which emotionally hurts right now I feel actually I feel emotional pain I'm a manager now damn it I don't want to be one oh man clueless noted this is actually painful and no managers very clearly stated oh my goodness uh I return to work the following Monday I suspect Ed that this would save a bunch of money and guess what our projected Bill drops from a million to a half million dollars and everyone is losing their minds uh my team has spun this huge cost saving uh when we really just applied a fire extinguisher to a pile of money that we had set a light Fair other teams are attacking my team insisting that it can't be a coincidence that the new guy joined exactly as we did this and how was this Poss how was it possible we didn't know how to generate that kind of savings without his help they're all saying this because it makes them seem higher status and their team only produce money in the land where you lie all day but it is a fair question you know they're they're just trying to read the signs this guy came over on Friday and you guys saved half a million dollars ain't no way this ain't a coincidence here you hired a stealth senior engineer didn't you yeah um yeah dude you guys are always supposed to have three seniors why are you getting this you know they're all like angry about Staffing problems you know I always get confused by this in some sense which is whenever something good happens I've seen this done right we've seen this done like uh you can think of balder's gate balder's gate happens and then a bunch of people get upset about balder's gate happening being good being like a good finished game that's just the game as it is uh yep and it's funny I have a Charisma by the way but it's funny that this happens and it happens more regularly than we realize that something good happens something in which we should all go and instead there's like there's like infighting that has to happen because people are upset about a good thing happening yes has that ever happened to you um I think sometimes it Happ I see it more like in uh like open source stuff I feel like where a project does well and then like other projects are upset that it does well you know because their project isn't as doing as as good as they were hoping for um I guess maybe it happened a little bit more in some of the like corporate world stuff but I I usually just don't do company politics so then I I'm not I'm not in the chat room with the people being angry I let my boss manage that yeah that's fair uh yeah I Tred to avoid the whole politicking as well because I I just emotionally can't handle it yeah uh while my managers are very happy the they quietly suggest it may be unwise to roll out the changes to all the computers I only did a few to be safe because it would be over it would oversaturate the department to hear about us all day and invite unwelcomed questions the subtext is that if we do this all slowly enough it might seem like it took a lot of effort instead of just clicking buttons that I said had to be clicked almost a year ago let's go this is removing like sleep 10 it literally is remove put a bunch of sleep tens in your code and then throughout the year remove them one at a time it's literally the the recommended strategy this is emotionally painful this is actually emotionally painful I am asked to write some PowerPoints which included phrases like a careful statistical analysis of user usage patterns indicated an opportunity to more effectively allocate resources implying that nothing was wrong we just needed to collect more data before deciding not to let the expensive machines idle all day every day I dread someone ask me to explain what the change was because I will have to uh Yeet some managers uh I like under the bus but they can't resist talking about the change non-stop because it's the uh it is the closest some of them will ever get to impacting the bottom line that's like the saddest statement I think I've ever said out loud ever in my entire lifetime this is like reading a DM with the old man Judo and he's making fun of twitch Chatters it is this actually reads like a Dax line or an old man Judo line it's true yeah either one would be good you could you could just substitute any of them in and it would just be a perfect fit mhm and judo's already in here well hold on let's see and many of them are actually decent managers it's just that this whole department like many departments is some sort of weird political scop to get Executives promoted it's cosplaying as a real business and the board thinks the costume is convincing so many good absolute Banger lines in this one it really is whoever wrote this we got to get this guy out here uh number four the aftermaths and the takeaways by identifying a handful of good engineers and going totally Rogue we outperformed the entire department pretty uh effortlessly the competent people are there just made totally imp uh impotent by the organization and I'm con still convinced that this place is probably better than the median organization dang that is quite the phrase I asked management for a 30k raise after saving 500k and my me message is still unread I suspect I will eventually receive either nothing or 5K nice let's go hey 5K come on uh I I have beened more meetings now because everyone wants to talk about how we saved money I had to make a PowerPoint kill [Laughter] me that is so good uh I would have been better off not doing anything let that be a lesson to you do you hear me I applied myself for 5 minutes against my own better judgment had the greatest success of my career and immediately been punished for it learn from my mistakes I beg you PS while this is doing immense uh while this is doing immense traffic any similar Stories being sent to Lucidity hackernews at gmail would be greatly appreciated so I feel less alone in this mad house that is just so just so hilarious oh poor guy I know he he doesn't even get the right code anymore he doesn't get to play with the AI tools he signed up to be a data scientist for he is now a PowerPoint end engineer it's really where all good Engineers go to die is Powerpoint yep true man you know at one point I will say that I became I you know I became somewhat of a PowerPoint engineer myself uh I had to write a lot wait and I got canceled for saying access wasn't the worst thing in the world this is not fair this is pretty much all normal no it's not Judo uh yeah I I mean this is why I do like I like the idea of working at startups I think the reason why startups work and then they stop being great is that people had to actually build something and then it gets bought by a big company and then they're not it's not real anymore well at like a startup he would have just been able to click the button right like like they would they wouldn't have gotten this far along they never would have been spending twice as much money because it would have just been like well what if we click the button guys like okay yeah sure you want to do that yeah Okay click it on a weekend so it doesn't bother us yeah exact just don't do it on Friday afternoon that' be like he did it on Friday afternoon that's like the only thing he wouldn't be able to do in a start up it'd be like just wait till Monday morning at least dude I want to take a nap this weekend I need to go get some Phil's Coffee and get a few more stickers on my MacBook bro like stop dude wait till Monday it's pretty good by the way you've been retimed out for 1.2 million seconds just so you know that's a lot of seconds you I don't know what's been going on in chat but your your timeouts have just been going on and off I haven't been able to read any chat messages this whole time I've been baned my whole appearance today um so yeah I became a somewhat of a PowerPoint engineer when I was doing some open source stuff at its particular company you may have heard of both of them and uh you know how emotionally painful it gets when you're on like day 22 of just writing Google Docs explaining why what you're doing is a good idea yep and you you're the company spending 10x as much to solve the problem as you like as you'd be able to do to just fix it which also hurts really bad like people I feel like sometimes don't have any concept that like the time of things costs money you know what I mean yeah like at work like when you have a meeting and there's 10 people and like if the meeting's an hour that's a whole work day you know yeah I mean that's assuming everyone's equally paid but you know that's not the case sometimes there's true you're usually pulling in someone yeah there's someone higher up they just sit in meetings all day for the for the ones where you're trying to get something approved where you need some sign off there's somebody getting paid twice as so it's like two days worth of yeah of time yeah it's wild hey soy chaotics here the scrum master of all scrum Masters oh my goodness nice Bing Bing chat for Halloween Bing chat for Halloween she was Bing chat for Halloween she was genuinely I saw it all right hey the name the I'm banned in chat again again
