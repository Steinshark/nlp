are these are fully wireless headphones yes I can't read that but it says fingerprint it's probably unique the cool thing is actually this part right here two thousand milliamp hours oh it's like the actual charger itself like you put the headphones in the little carrying case it has a battery bank inside yes okay that seems pretty clever so so these look to be fairly okay look look at this awesome podcast I found it's just it's called the test drivers if you haven't heard of it it's hosted by this really cool guy named Austin he talks about technology links in the description I'll listen to it make sure the headphones sound great of course what a great theme song this podcast that I have no affiliation to whatsoever has if you're interested and a pair of fully wireless earbuds while they don't sound incredible it does have a nice punchy sound and I feel like for the money you could do a lot worse now is it as nice as something like you know a pair of ear pods or galaxy buds no I would say it's a punch your sound but it's not quite as a neutral of a sound we were also considering that this is less than half the price and you get the added benefit of a battery bank built-in plus it's nice and magnetized that's pretty cool did you buy everything from mystery tech from Japan 20th anniversary yes ding graphics card you did not just buy a graphics card that's a graphics card what is this then yes then 20th anniversary Radeon rx 5700 XT is this like some weird Chinese 5700 XT except it's got some anime chicken on it yes mascot this is the brand mascot wait have you seen this before Ken where did you get this how much was a 5700 XT imported from China $600 remember when you lost that other round of interest of course of course what are you doing what is this it looks like a Barbie grab these cards look at the back you see this let's go just clear plastic Oh doing it's probably like some stand or whatever floor doesn't it oh okay well that's just a lot of things that's a lot of things so we have the mascot stickers I'm not gonna we also have a keychain we have a gonna guess mouse pad [Laughter] [Music] great yeah that's that's the word I was looking for so now there's the next step but we have to put that in a PC right sure let's build a PC why not ready I already built one you built a PC specifically for yes am I better now they get it all you disappoint me be right back it's like helping an old man down all right the road come on come on come on I don't why I need the blindfold but you're right well what why that's just fun for me okay all right okay look now yes what is that a screen built into the side of this PC it is how much money did you spend on all of this what is inside here you've got the cheese skill the RGB Ram you got an RGB cooler yeah what are you doing oh this is really cool what is this what is this case so I'm impressed when the screen goes black I can't see inside like it's fully opaque how much is this case with the screen inside ok so the case is 300 ha ha I'm just gonna take a wild guess and say that this entire setup is about to go home with you cuz you were to have better components you've stolen from the office you gave ok to give you some things this is very cool all right it's so bright in here ah so socially you can't see the screen at all from this side but as soon as you close that you can see it yes that is really cool it's clever yeah this is very cool I don't think it's particularly practical it's still a very expensive case but if you want something different this is way way better than I thought it would be good job Ken thank you very much for watching if you would like to help support us when we inevitably do get canceled from YouTube definitely be sure to go check out the test drivers podcast available at the link in the description until next time I need to wipe the lipstick off my mouth don't I I didn't get all that off I just saw that in the monitor [Music]
