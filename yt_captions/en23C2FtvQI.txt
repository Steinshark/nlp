ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the candidates 2024 this is the biggest chess tournament of the year and the winner of it will play for the World Chess Championship later on this year now this is round number N9 out of 14 if for some reason you just stumbled into this coverage there is a playlist on this channel of all the previous rounds the players are playing a double round robin there are eight players both in the open and the women section and the race for first place is heating up yesterday hikara Kamura defeated Fabiano Carana in an exhilarating game winning his fourth game in a row against Fabiano in major chess events when hikaro has the white pieces and today Oliver zarua put on a dazzling display of attacking chests against none other than Yan pishi a man who has not stopped winning the candidates in now two and a half editions of this tournament more uh in the recent years and that is where we are going to start today's recap um Ali Resa showed up today and played the move Knight to F3 in fact earlier this year Ali Reza met yanomi in the Tata steel tournament in January and played Knight to C3 and promptly defeated him in some 25 to 30 moves so I think basically Ali Reza just says you know what I think Yan is really well prepared Yan has prepared two times for a World Chess Championship Match there is literally no greater time that you do any sort of training and so I'm just going to play Knight F3 when he plays the move D5 I'm going to play B3 and we are completely out of theory oh and by the way there was a massive drama surrounding this game which which I will get into when I show you the final result Knight to F6 Bishop to B2 and now nepo plays Bishop F5 okay there are many many many ways to play you can play C5 Knight C6 generally White's next move is going to be E3 and the next major question is will white play the move d4 at some point or never uh nepo plays Bishop F5 so Yan plays a reverse London I mean this is always we we know the London is uh you know like not like the Rolls-Royce it's kind of like the Maserati of uh top you know of of openings uh and uh it's uh you know it's in it's pretty reliable against most setups uh but requires a lot of Maintenance and then alza does this so he plays a double fian ketto at the candidates so he just basically says you know what I'm going to throw all the openings in the garbage and Jan and I are going to play something like this so we have C5 Jan spends a little bit of time takes the center Knight C6 very principled approach Pawn to E6 by Yan very normal stuff developing his pieces the bishop doesn't go out to B5 so it's not going to get rid of the Knight and now aliv Resa plays D3 you notice he has spent 21 minutes in seven moves so and he's playing in a in a very very very kind of very non-standard way in a way that we see mostly in Blitz games like he plays Knight bd2 and his major idea is going to be to play the move E4 he also could play the move C4 but E4 is a little bit better Rook e one and there is literally no greater indication that he would like to play the move Pawn to E4 now nepo here plays this and the idea is to bring the bishop back to H7 now what's interesting is that the the critical plan here uh for black generally involves a very quick queenside advancement and the reason you need to do that is because white is standing like this black can't play D4 shutting out this bishop because that allows white moves like E3 as well as Knight C4 and A4 where the Knight will be planted so black doesn't really D4 but black does have advancement with the pawns but Yan plays this in a way where he keeps the tension in the center Aliva puts the Knight on E5 the idea is to trade off Black's Knight to maintain more or less everything else in the position but it's to open up this push all right now Yan plays Knight D7 and you'll notice both guys have already spent about half an hour each and that is one of the benefits of playing the way that Ali Resa has played uh and and and the reason for that is that he's just basically saying like we have to play chess I mean there's no memorization this is not a memory test we just both have to make good decisions and Jan's next move is not a good decision he plays the move d4 and I mean I'm not going to I'm not going to overstate like whether this is a a mistake or not but it's not the right plan and the reason it's not the right plan is once you lock the center white just kind of gets a free play whereas when you keep the tension and the center is open black can offer exchange yes you will be shoved backwards but there's a difference because you never played the move d4 so you actually still fight for very important squares in the center and actually white blocked himself so this is not a Checkmate and black will go back with this plan of B5 and hammering away at White's position so D4 is the move Yan chooses and very quickly Ali Reza stops black from advancing and plays F4 and gets a very very pleasant advantage and already has the makings of a beautiful attacking game if nepo takes takes moves like Bishop H4 don't do absolutely anything and also not to you know not to understate but black could get the bishop just straight up walled away like white could I'm not saying you got to do this right now it's not a good move but um who is who who who is saving this bishop and also you can play E5 creating a wedge not allowing either of these pieces to get forward so it's a really bad position and after Queen C7 Queen F3 it just gets worse I mean alyza just has one very simple plan and his Simple Plan is Advance over here like the Terminator and handy on his first loss of this tournament he has not lost it's been eight games and I will remind you of the statistic that I've been telling you that for the last 28 plus 8 which is 36 rounds of candidates Yan pishi has never not been in first place never not been some of you have never been in first place he has never not been so Yan pomi has been first or tied for it every candidates every round Ali RZA plays Bishop H3 and he's just making improvements every single one of his pieces is getting into the game game black plays Bishop D6 you'll notice Jan is playing pretty quickly and the reason for that is he knows alza takes a lot of time alza is now down 37 minutes on the clock and he has 40 minutes to make 22 moves because that's the way the time control works so it's a very big moment here for Ali Reza who now brings the bishop around but the advantage has grown the entire game and at some point Ali Reza is going to make his breakthrough Queen C6 played and officially we have reached the biggest advantage point of the game white needs to do something white now either needs to take take push something like that or he just has to go for it with the pawn and leave his pieces behind the problem with leaving some of these pieces behind is once you play F five this bishop kind of loses its role so then you start thinking well what what if I take and play F five let me tell you something that's what I would do I'm not playing in the candidates but I would do that the reason is I really like this Knight and I like the pressure that it's putting on the black position what is black going to do black is going to play F6 white is going to play G4 and sensing that this is coming right black needs to evacuate so black is going to play King F7 and then you're GNA play H4 and then black is gonna play King E7 and this might look completely ridiculous but this is like you know this is like uh what is it the wolf and the and the and the and the is it the pigs I don't remember I didn't have a childhood um they played chess the whole time and listen to my parents argue so yeah you know uh what the blowing on the houses and then they fall over or what I think it's the three little bigs uh and uh yeah you got you got to get out of there right like this is Big Bad Wolf right here so Ali Resa think things for a bit right Queen C6 and he does in fact take but he takes the bishop this is a major decision I mean I for whatever reason he decided to make this trade as well he made that trade and that trade I wouldn't have done that but maybe he has an idea he just plays at5 and now it's basically Unstoppable Force immovable object black has eight pawns on dark squares white is going to infiltrate on the dark squares something is going to happen here comes G4 Jan is evacuating Here Comes H4 Here Comes Rook e 2 the preparations are being made to make a break through with this now Aliva could also play A5 that very well could be the best move and then forcing black to make a decision you play B5 now I play A6 so now your pawns can't separate I you can't hold together so there there's a there's a there's a hope that in the future I'll play Rook A5 I'll play Bishop A3 and maybe I break through at the same time this could be a liability for white and maybe black is actually the one that's going to leave this Pawn here and end up winning it so tough decision Ali Resa decides you know what I'm going to allow Yan to play A5 and I'm going to focus fully on G5 and either I'm winning or I'm not and the engine really seems positive about the black about the white position Yan plays Bishop G8 it is it is by the way can I just say it is utterly ridiculous this position is not a win for white like black literally can't move two pieces how can you just have eight points of pieces completely immobile but you're not losing now if White had a knight like if this Knight KN would be there yeah white would probably be winning in some lines or maybe if white pushed this and didn't allow black to do this there was a couple of moments in this game where definitely Ali Resa could have done things slightly differently but he still gets a fantastic looking position and he plays Rook G6 and I mean this has to be winning this absolutely has to be winning for white because when black takes you now have a pawn that is two squares away from queening it is defended permanently and all and I literally mean all of Black's pawns are waiting to be captured by this bishop and then I'll finish this and I'll draw a heart that's kind of a that heart probably would require some sort of surgery Bishop E1 Bishop H4 maximum pressure has been applied by Al Reza but Yan defends himself and somehow despite doing absolutely everything right in this game there's no way in how is that possible how does yanomi have some sort of Angel of the chessboard watching over him during the candidates it it it's he has a fortress and you might say how is this I don't understand how's the Fortress well black just does this and you can't break in Black has everything protected there's no way to Kangaroo you can't just you know you can't hop in and you can't even play moves like C3 like for example let's say queen F3 right like this and let's say here Queen D2 and then black plays King A7 you play C3 trying to break out guess what you just created a target for yourself you're going to lose so Queen G2 Rook C6 the players move around and they make a draw Ali resera had a mammoth a mammoth attack barreling down toward yanomi and I don't know where he went wrong maybe he went wrong when he allowed Yan to play A5 maybe he went wrong when he traded the Knight for the bishop like maybe he should have just traded the bishop for the Knight I think on a high depth the engine likes this position more it wants to keep the Knight and I kind of don't blame him you got to wonder like why did Ali Resa give up this night now uh the next game uh that I'm going to show you I will show you in a moment but right after uh came this series of tweets from alza from the bottom up which reads shameful uh action by the chief Arbiter toward me during the game in the middle of the game the most intense moment when I was walking during Yan's move the Arbiter came up to me and told me to not walk around anymore because my shoe is making noise on the wooden floor he told me not to bring uh not to walk and also bring new shoes for tomorrow but I've worn the same shoes for a year and they're approved big distraction for me during the game I completely lost my focus and I honestly all these unprofessional things are happening to me in almost every tournament really taking its uh toll on me to the point of exhaustion that's wild we really just I mean we were going pretty well there was no drama in this candidates um look obviously none of us were there uh oliv res also uh is tweeting this on you know like if Oliva wins this game he probably would tweet it but I I think it would be received slightly better um yeah look I mean based on what he said we don't know what the chief Arbiter said we don't know the situation uh and he also commented that like uh somebody joked were you wearing high heels and he was like no I was wearing regular platform shoes uh there's women there the women are wearing high heels and nobody's stopping them so yeah I don't think that you should ever walk up to a chess player in the middle of a game unless something is I don't know wrong or there's a earthquake outside like they I guess they would have felt that uh and we don't know what what what moment he meant right like we don't know where like if it was here that's a really big problem because this was the critical moment of the game and we just don't know and I mean we had this drama with anayah Kazarian uh some months ago with the shoes and getting a fine and but we don't know we don't know this is alza saying it and uh as always on this channel I'm trying to stay relatively diplomatic but I do just kind of laugh at the concept of there is just always chess drama like we don't know actually what happened the chief Arbiter hasn't said anything but how is there just some always some drama like just and Ali Resa was unable to actually win this game and he had an unbelievable position and Yan just I'm telling you has an angel watching over his games it is it's incredible some of these games that he is he is playing now a turn a player that has has really uh struggled actually uh oh and I didn't have her point total up let me add it she had two and a half points and she has lost three of her recent games of tongi tied for first on the women's side plays a sicilian and uh this one relatively nice position I have to say for Vali from the opening um and uh you know white just has these two very very nice Bishops probably the best way to continue here is to play a move like rookie one get black to Castle and then begin various attacking mechanisms the computer really likes Knight H4 preventing this Vali plays B3 so she tries to fight back on the queen side and then she goes for an attack with Queen F3 and so on uh and this game gets very spicy very quickly but there's a moment here of a lot of tension but sh spends a lot of time and she lunges in with her Pawn giving up this Pawn in the center and tanong Y has been a nightmare this oppon this tournament she strikes back just plays F6 and just kind of calls the bluff like the Knight is hanging the queen will hang next this is hanging and Vali goes take take and C5 and is losing she can't defend D4 she can't defend her Knight she has to back up she loses this she's going to lose the C5 Pawn she goes here this is a fork Queen E7 and Rook seven defends everything and black wins by sh resigned that's four losses in a row now unfortunately for Vali and Tanis in first with six out of nine she is she's in first place she was tied last round with leting and um Alexandra gashina but unfortunately vashali is spinning out of control I mean she had two and a half out of five she was on 50% I think she was even two out of four or two and a half out of four but suddenly and unfortunately it has gone so very very wrong uh for Vali and this one was over in 20 moves against tanang uh another massive game vidid guti versus Hikaru Nakamura yanomi is still undefeated he is the only player in the candidates right now that has not lost the game uh which is incredible and he almost lost this round but it was not meant to be now vidit vidit and Hikaru are on two separate trajectories right now vidit lost a couple games won a couple of games very up and down yesterday he lost to gukesh so he lost to both youngsters of India with the white pieces he has white again he's playing hikaro Hikaru just beat Fabby hikaro full of confidence right vidit plays the Italian yesterday uh vidit got hit with this move A6 this time Karu plays H6 so everybody is trying to take vidit out of prep like that seems to be the strategy vidit will spend a lot of time navigating the early Waters he plays C3 all right D6 this approach by black is intending to play G5 if you play H6 D6 in the Italian you're going to put your Bishop on E7 or you're going to play G5 you don't play Bishop C5 anymore right like here was hi Caro's last chance you could have played Bishop C5 with the H6 system gkes did kind of something similar with A6 and lo and behold it is the most aggressive Italian known to humans all right H6 5 I mean it's like it's an Italian it's like you insulted his mother and and his Pudo at the same time I mean it literally doesn't get any worse than that um and his favorite football team terrible stuff just I ju ju not not terrible I'm just saying terribly aggressive iaro has come to brawl vidd plays Knight bd2 now uh the most principled way to play against this setup is actually exactly what vidit does Knight BD 2 and Bishop to B3 this really interesting Retreat allows white to put the Knight on C4 and the Knight on C4 pressures the black pawn so it negates D5 it also allows the Knight to reroute to E3 you don't have to know any of this you're going to play the Italian at your level and have diarrhea and so will your opponent it'll be really gross but um like this is the meta strategy of the Italian all right and that is exactly what vidit does vidit knows how to handle Hikaru spark plug of an opener right Hikaru is playing very aggressively Bishop E6 Rook E8 great job by vidit he navigates the position and now we're sort of in New Territory and it's very very tense and one of the two sides is about to strike vid plays Bishop to A2 little bit of hesitancy 27 minutes down but for vidit that's like you know a regular day at the office and now Karu has the chance for this G4 move and I mean in this opening if you're going to play G5 you better play G4 and you got to play Knight G4 and I think I think Hikaru didn't want a position where he was going to have to deal with a lot of exchanges I think he just didn't like this take take here here the White Knight could go to F5 hikaro might need to play D5 but that might have been the best approach because instead he goes here spends a lot of time he spent he spent his entire 27 minute Advantage not playing Pawn to G4 and then he trades the same thing happens and now vid takes the center and vidit says vid does the max Holloway Max that was can I just quickly say for the UF fans Sensational what a fight I felt kind of terrible though I felt did any of you feel bad for Justin gatei like broken nose eye poked and has to get knocked out with one second left but vid says like this like right now we're fighting Ed CD4 Hikaru Strikes Back the center gets locked and now vidit plays Rook A3 and he's just bringing the Rook he's just going to meet Hikaru on the C file Hikaru strikes on C5 and and now in this position the engine loved the move Knight G4 it was like the game chat was like both guys are blundering they're so stupid because that's you know live chat nowadays um but we have dc5 instead Rook C5 Queen D1 vidit is just playing very well he's got a very nice control of the center he's going to infiltrate on karo's weaknesses the Knight is going to come in V doing a nice job dealing with hikaru's aggression Knight F4 now another well queenside strike with B4 the best move here is to go take take but Hikaru doesn't like that very much so instead he backs up and he's just giving vidit a pawn it's like poker he's just giving vid a pawn and vidit takes the pawn and he calls the bluff and he says show me what you got right just show me what you got now hikaro has the option to move this Knight there or there he chooses this way the bishop comes back to C3 and now well Black's just down a pawn I mean it's not just at the high level but it really makes you wonder like somewhere along these lines vidit just understood the necessity of the position a little bit better than Hikaru and Hikaru decided to gamble and take the pawn back and vidit finds the best move he finds Bishop takes Knight Bishop takes Knight takes D5 opening up a discovered attack on this and if he count the pawns he's is going to be up a pawn at the end of all of this maybe hear thought he had Queen D6 here defending the bishop and attacking The Rook but then you just take and you can't take the Rook because of Knight F6 check so Knight D5 Knight D5 and vidit is completely winning against Taro for a second game in a row and he just gets straight in there wins another Pawn gets in with his Queen and mate is in the evaluation and let me tell you something right now when m is in the evaluation like a BMW it is really bad news he sacrifices the rook and Hikaru resigns vid GTI just beat Hikaru with white and with black in the candidates who is this man he is now on 50% he has four and a half out of nine he's back to 50% vid has had an insane tournament he has had seven decisive games or six I mean who vid yeah they call him vid 2.0 uh in the in the in the Indian live stream like the chess base India live stream I mean he is playing some crazy chess he's fight he's fighting like a heavyweight that's what he's doing he's looking for those performance of the night bonuses and Hikaru after just being half a point out of first place loses insane completely nuts what a game from vidit now going to go around late in first place against nurul salimova nurul plays a filor I mean we are literally going to travel the entire planet of chess openings in this event and leting please one this is not a technical glitch my friends the idea is to play G4 and H4 leting G is looking at the game between V and tanan saying listen nul is the lowest rated player in the field she is also the youngest player in the field I need to go for an attack and nul spends 20 minutes on the seventh move and leting Jet is immediately barreling down Knight E6 Queen D3 look at look at 97 just going backwards bobbing and weaving and rolling and ducking under the punches the Knight strikes on C5 and from the opening actually you know despite her getting out her pieces she was worse and lay did not hesitate she went straight to G5 Bishop went back to D2 that move not loved by the engine the computer really liked Rook G4 stopping the advancement of the Knight and then looking for moves like Rook D1 and Knight D4 but then black could play Rook H1 which this just looks really idiotic but white is actually doing very well Bishop D2 was played and Nuru trades the Queens she secures a queen trade and this game was spicy for a moment but then it very very very quickly all the pieces flew off the board and I have a feeling Lei kind of went into recovery mode here she spent a lot of time and she did not find the most critical test of the black position she kind of got what she wanted from the opening but it came down to one critical move maybe she was also asked to not walk around in high heels and so uh that's that's really crazy that you just tell a player not to walk around like what if he just walked around Barefoot that would have been Alpha anyway a queed trade and not much else to choose here the pieces came off the board there was some trades White had a little bit of pressure with the bishop but a very nice defensive game and the players ultimately shuffled their pieces and lay still half a point behind tanong despite beating her yesterday now Alexandra GK another co-leader versus Anam musuk but she stays principled gach does not play for a win with black she plays the Berlin The Uber Giga solid Omega super solid Berlin now I want to show you something crazy about this game look at White's clock okay look at White's clock look at right now they're both even but suddenly G going to starts thinking okay this is a Gambit white plays a Gambit she's down a pawn so one of these Berlin lines nowadays Bishop G5 very aggressive Bishop E3 all right now look at the time all right now look look at the time span though 106 to 133 all right now C6 Queen take Knight F6 all right and look at the time spend all right white is up 38 minutes on the clock all of this was prep White had 27 moves of prep in this game more I think G4 is still pre G6 but the thing is in the Berlin like you I mean if you play the best moves you're going to make a draw and what's crazy is Anam musuk who's having a crazy tournament played all the way down here and in this position the culmination of the prep the end of the prep is Bishop G6 you sack your bishop and what you do here is you bring your king and black can't move if black plays King F5 you play King G3 black can't move black plays Knight D6 Rook E5 and Rook E6 so black can't get out but muzichuk loses the game she Lo she blunders the game here and and is potentially losing black is winning if she plays Knight d8 which is nuts it is so crazy and the reason why Knight d8 is winning is because this Pawn is hanging and the only way to stop that is to go Rook C8 at which point I play Knight E6 you can't take this because if you take this I bring my king and then I'm just winning in the end game I mean at the end of the day I'm just up a piece so gka is winning if she plays Knight d8 she doesn't she doesn't find it like this is the weirdest game ever and now black just just down too many pawns and since black has down too many pawns the game just ends in a draw because it's king and pawns but G Ed Canna was if she just played Knight d8 I'm not I'm not saying she would have won the game if she played Knight d8 but that was the weirdest game ever musuk showed up and played 27 moves of obviously preparation because she didn't think and then she just misplayed the plan the idea here to hold was to take the pawn so you had three on nothing instead she does this and this is completely the wrong plan and she doesn't actually lose and G and leting J are still half a point behind oh my goodness insane sanity now nijat basa Fabiano Carana yesterday Fabiano losing with the black pieces against Hikaru that was a crazy game and today he's got a win I mean he's playing AOS of even if he's playing with black and he plays one of the most aggressive lines in the Queen's gamb but decline this bishop before before thing it doesn't even have a name it doesn't have a name it's just a thing now we have take take all right Knight F6 E3 and C6 so something that has really not been played much at all A4 he's trying to put the bishop on the A3 Square to prevent black from castling and now in this position Fabby plays this move E5 and the point is to blow up the position to get a huge simplification takes take on C4 take on C4 trade like this Knight G4 you're going to win this back and the craziest thing here the top engine move for white is F4 sacrificing The Rook in the corner so you win it back and when you win it back when you win back the night you have all this activity and I think Fabiano desperately wanted to get into some kind of position like that I think he wanted to get into a position like that and the Jet says no but now by saying no black is just doing very well black plays Rook d8 puts the Knight on D3 removes the bishop pair and now we have opposite colored Bishops which do have a reputation of being a draw but white has very split pawns so n J is just playing in a very stubborn very annoying fashion Fabby plays C5 C4 from NJ and now a big moment a big moment in this game Bano caruana has to find the approach to get the advantage and that approach which the engine showed I'm not showing a move that I would have played that I'm better than Fabby is this move A5 now obviously Fabby didn't like something about the move A5 but in essentially you're fixing the pawns on the same color Square as the bishop he obviously didn't like something here because obviously he would have played that his next move would have been Knight C6 and maybe Knight B4 the pawn here anchors both pawns and like look in a perfect world I mean you get a position that looks like this and you were just much better I don't know why fabbi didn't play A5 instead he allowed niat to play A5 and nearly all of his Advantage disappeared and that is kind of nuts because I really feel like in form Fabiano Carana plays A5 in a heartbeat and he doesn't play A5 and that was his one big moment in this game because otherwise life is just hard at the high level we go to an opposite colored Bishop endgame a lot of pawns are about to fall off the board wh's King is out in the open but completely safe walking around strolling around the board and at some point the pawns are going to start getting traded they do the Rooks are going to start getting traded they do and the players just make a draw you can't do anything here I mean you could play Rook C7 Bishop C 7 but you're never going to Queen this pawn and Fabby misses a chance for sure I mean Fabby showed up and played very provocatively and you got to give credit to n i mean n is is drawing these 2800s these 2770 and he's only 2630 but this game was Fabiano's F the taking especially cuz n did not call his bluff did not give up the rook in the corner he just got himself into a into a very passive position you know and Fabby just missed he just didn't play A5 for whatever reason I I'm sure he's going to be asked about it I don't know I don't know what he didn't like about this move and again I'm not sitting here saying I would have played this move that's not the point of the Recaps the point is to say I don't know what he's thinking I don't I don't know and and a lot of people were surprised a lot of very strong commentators due to pogar you know today was hes and uh vishan was commentating and and a lot of people were talking about the say five move and fabbi doesn't play it he doesn't get to Five Points he's still on four and a half and um another match up for a first place finish it was humpy conu versus Katarina lagno this one similar structure by the way as the Fabiano game uh confrontational early on this kind of Gambit line humpy giving up a pawn and then getting it back on C5 and lagno came to play I mean she really came to play today she was trying to win this game at all costs but sometimes it's just not meant to be white actually had sustained pressure in this opening pushing around the black pieces but sometimes it just so happens things start getting traded and uh it is actually lagno who is going to be pushing now with the pawn on B5 she's got the outside pass Pawn she's got this kind of endgame plus here she's going to keep on pushing rook and Knight she wins the pawn and now we have a rook end game and this Rook end game uh looks to be winnable for um for black because black has more pawns but it's really not these two pawns cancel out against these two pawns and you can't really win rook in one versus Rook I mean if the right defensive conditions are met and uh LNO tried and tried and tried and tried but after some 15 20 more moves uh the position became simply deadlocked there is no way for black to possibly get here there's also no way not to keep this Pawn to keep this Pawn protected and so uh LNO Drew this game as well uh and got to Five Points it's a big race and this was the the uh this was the matchup of the day perhaps uh this one was the Battle of the Indian youngsters this is uh gukesh versus Prague uh Prague looking for Revenge after losing to gukesh with the white pieces let's not forget that is a thing that happened uh and uh he is looking to win but I don't know is he going to go all out or is he going to take it easy right cuz gkes is the one who's got the white pieces in this game and uh he'll be looking to put up something we have a Spanish and this time Prague does not play F5 he plays principled but he still goes for a sideline which is Bishop C5 and um now we're kind of in a weird anti- Berlin so basically we're in a position E4 E5 Knight F3 Knight C6 Bishop B5 Knight F6 D3 Bishop C5 and in this position it's uh it's as if we got something like uh let's say C3 castles Bishop C6 something along these lines like except in the game we have A6 and Bishop A4 included so rather than playing provocatively p goes here we have Bishop C6 damaging the structure and now we just kind of have like a weird anti- Berlin type of position both guys out of prep also their record head-to-head is four wins four draws four losses which is pretty epic V uh gukesh tied for first Prague needs to beat him to get first place and we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 versus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 opposite colored Bishops May the best man win Bishop G5 very quickly gukesh loaded up a cannon with the F Pawn and he had Prague on the back foot Prague played Pawn takes F4 giving gesh a really powerful Outlet I actually am shocked gcash did not play Rook F4 Bishop F4 is what he plays the castle is there this and now c4 blocking out the light squ Bishop but Prague right there B5 ready to meet him on the queen side B3 C5 looking to shut down the center of the board Knight to F3 trying to remove the Knight remember opposite colored Bishops benefit the attacking player look at that Advantage Queen C3 Rook G3 all would have been very very pleasant ways for white to continue black plays Knight G6 and actually it's prong who starts encroaching on gash's Queen side it's a very big moment for gukesh what is he going to do he's going to continue to attack ab ab BC BC the whole Queen side opens up PR gets out of the way but one guy has a much better Bishop than the other guy all right and now it's a it's a it's very methodical he has to be very precise how he goes about this position and Queen F2 is okay Knight E3 would have been a little bit better a computer like Knight E3 first very tough to tell the difference between the two moves but this is the big moment now this is kind of the big moment and uh is black going to get in on the queen side with counterplay is he going to and he does but GES is holding but now the bishop rerouted to a better position Knight D5 and and he's just right in time he's just going to start trading gk's pieces gukesh plays Rook B1 he doesn't quite trade but we have a trade and F six and 1 two three 3 4 five 1 two 3 4 5 both guys have all their pawns to counteract the others Bishop Rook B3 and he replans the Knight and and this game was kind of like a matter of time but gukesh was just unable to kind of figure it out he had a he had a very nice position here when prague's Bishop was sort of misplaced maybe he needed to do something a little bit better um the computer here was was shouting out Rook F6 by the way which is a really really gangster move can't take because of this but after Rook A6 I'm not actually sure it accomplishes anything um but uh yeah they drew they drew their game and nothing to choose between them and a pretty crazy round so uh o sorry uh this is round number eight round number nine is now updated tungi in first place half a point behind her are Le and gachina Katarina lagno one point away GES continues to lead the candidates he is I think the youngest ever player to play a candidates it's very close between him and Bobby fiser pretty good company and he's tied for first with Yan pishi Prague is half a point out so Prague now Leap Frogs Hikaru fabbi and vidit because fabbi didn't win today and vidit won but he was having uh he was behind and Hikaru loses so it's still very close I mean six guys are still separated by one point but we're quickly Running Out of Time huge win for vidit good day for the young uh the young Indian players that uh Drew their game in a in a tense fight and Ali resa fuja is not allowed to ever get up and walk again I'll see you all uh tomorrow tomorrow we have one more game and then we have a rest day on the 16th get out of here
