the theme for today's intel five thousand dollar extreme tech upgrade is simple nothing is going to go wrong okay nothing will go wrong i'll do my best and if anything goes wrong thank god we have this giant snorlax that we can collapse onto so that we can recover this is nolan he's one of our customer care coordinators what the hell is your job title customer support rep and that's just nick's assistant technically for creator warehouse and he is going to be getting not one but two computers a brand new tv thanks intel for sponsoring a stream tech upgrade let's get this started [Music] i don't know where to start with this because normally you do such a great job that i actually end up talking to you almost not at all especially with all the work from home right but we have to have a bit of a chat right now about your performance here because your pc performance is looking pretty good but i see a lot of consoles okay one of the consoles at least to your credit you're up front a boat okay you got an xbox series x but you tried to hide this one from me what is this nolan that's a playstation playstation box has been spray painted black and why pray tell was the box spray painted black uh because you could deceive me yeah yeah yeah what are we doing first have you ever built a computer i have you have yeah well then why don't we roll reversal we're building two computers and i'll build the consoles wait like two can be i don't see two computers well we're building one computer this is a vitamix this isn't a computer okay can i just say yeah this has got to be hands down the a most creative and b best use of intel extreme tech upgrade budget that i've ever seen sarah's all like oh i don't know maybe i'll spend it all on a starbucks gift card nolan here goes big brain this is gonna save you so much money are you into shakes i am you into like soup you know you can heat your soup i know i know so out here in the pile there's most of one computer but i have a pretty comparable system in my room that some of the parts are going so this case is not the case all right let's go get it let's go get it other than nailing people for stolen goods like this mouse pad the first thing i like to do when i come into people's rooms is figure out if they're actually a tidy person or if they tied it up because they knew i was coming and with nolan you know what i gotta give you props you almost fooled me oh god damn it the carpet's vacuumed yeah right your screens are clean but i'll show you what gave you away you didn't dust your stream down no i didn't which means that however much dust was on your stream deck was on everything else that's true and number two when you vacuumed yeah you didn't take off the power head to get the can to get the hit the top of your baseboard i did not kids can you say thankfully though this is the only thing you noticed was stolen because that monitor and that gpu are also from the office i was too busy appreciating your taste in uh graphic novels oh yeah you stream i do i i took a long break but i'm back to it now how are we building this this is already built uh the gpu motherboard and cpu are getting swapped out for the new ones okay and then the stuff that's in here is going into the case that's out there i was told today's was going to be simple it should still be simple okay all right there we are all right let's go by the way jamie's helping us today hello you can take that back i can take that back that's for the playstation the oh oh sick we're upgrading your playstation ssd yeah love it okay well um you go over there i'm basically going to end up with a pc on my desk that stays there all the time and one that i might use out here and i might use other places for streaming so you're going to be full god here with the pc the xbox the playstation and the switch no the playstation's going in my room which one's the a tier machine this will be the main pc still this is the main button the stuff that's in there for the most part is coming out okay so you're keeping your old ram the old rams going on the other one i've got two sticks i mean this is like vengeance freaking rgb pro yeah please tell me you have a ddr4 board we'll blame matt if i don't because he ordered that ddr4 thank god nice the bananas for scale bananas for scale store.com those are sold out right now okay what do you mean they're sold out so yeah sold out and you're holding them here i've had these for a long time do you work in customer care or do you really care about the customers if you're hoarding all the yellow bananas for yourself three people are going without bananas three starving children could have eaten those those plush bananas they would have had a bad time digesting those i'm surprised you didn't go with more of like a like a media center type case since it's going to be this was a last-minute addition this is actually i i got this off a oh friend one this one wasn't an initial part of the budget yeah this is the only thing i had to everything else is spare parts oh speaking of which i should go grab that i have a spare psu and stuff i mean freaking priorities look at this place okay we got this ikea ass console thing here got some ikea ass couch and and oh this thing dude and then it's just like pcs monitors tvs game consoles subwoofer do you even lift bro do you look at the legs on the couch uh no wait what yeah what happened i was not prioritizing furniture when i went to uh here oh my god that's where it's supposed to be uh-huh yeah that's where it is on both sides that'll be replaced at some point when it breaks i mean when you have got yeah all of your tech absolutely got here had to cut somewhere you know what i gotta respect it this is a what you can't see moment you know what how bad is it right now actually pretty bad and then you've gone 12700k okay well that's good that'll save us some power budget versus if you'd gone for the 12 900k you have three aio liquid coolers a corsair dual 120 an ek dual 120 and an ek triple 120 yes okay the original plan was for this cooler to stay in this case but it doesn't have the mount for the cpu for the 12 gen so we're using this temporarily while i email corsair to get standoffs or whatever the retrofit kit is right and then this this guy i'm keeping so that one's just going to go in that case yep uh sweet oh wait i still need your md oh you've got a couple i've got a few what the there's one in there that i don't use it's like an old one that i've grabbed from somebody and threw on there that moment when your csr has a better computer than you do i'm seeing a lot of storage you have a problem yes what's my problem you have too much m.2 i just like them you just you need not a problem i can stop whenever i want okay which ones go where so you've got a five you've got two 500 gig wd in there this one's the only one going in that one and that's gets a five five this one's for the playstation that's for the playstation you know that the best one is going in your playstation yeah fine okay and it's well packaged yeah yeah he's not stressed no i've watched you drop much worse now you have no excuses yes now i can drive i can do some work now got some 16 gigs 3 600 mega transfer per second memory yes okay sweet here's your screws oh nice here's my screwdriver oh okay nicole you might have a challenger for coolest screwdriver yeah practicality kind of low yeah it's a little bulky but in terms of just raw manly sex appeal that that's a screwdriver all it needs now is like a belt loop here yeah yeah it's amazing you know moore's law marches ever onward check this out these are both wd black 500 gig drives so this is an older sn750 this is the new sn 770 we've gone from a 500 gig ssd needing two nand packages a giant controller chip and on-board dram not to mention like look at just the complexity of this board by comparison to this one controller nand package and for dram it just pulls it over the pcie bus from your system memory just man this setup is crazy you've already had the kind of setup that most people have been upgrading to i mean do you feel a little guilty going in front of other people who have much worse setups than you oh man it was worse when i ordered the parts yeah that's right i had a 20-70 super in there and it was that long ago yeah and then you and then the christmas party christmas party happened like i would have just said i don't need this because i got a gpu at the christmas party but it was already on the way so now because of this man three people don't have bananas and one person doesn't have an rtx 38 yeah i got an rtx 380 i didn't need you're basically a monster actually nolan crazy pitch for you yep okay come over here i couldn't help noticing that your computer is right on the other side of this wall yeah so hear me out you sell your second machine yeah you put a little like a little wall plate thing in the wall that goes between the two rooms you put a little pass through there boom computer one computer that could be a project oh i need to put the cpu in where the heck the cpu oh yeah oh here it is i think it fell of course it did uh oh i guess we should talk about the 12700k this is basically the one to get if you've got the budget for it you go 12 400 if you don't care about overclocking and you don't need the most multi-threaded performance but the 12700k is without going you know all the way to the halo tier product pretty much all the performance you need how you doing over there jamie i'm good nice you want me to mount the tv here um no i think we'll come we'll come struggle with it with you i think okay what how big of an upgrade is this oh actually i can tell from the thickness that tv's a little bit on the older side oh the tv's not getting replaced the tv is not wait what oh what this is going in my room oh wait so you need two computers one so you can game on your monitors one so you can game on your tv yeah but you're gonna have a tv in my room with the playstation with the in the room with the with the so this is your dedicated playstation tv yes you're not gonna freaking share the good tv this guy okay he's got all the bananas he's got all the rtx those bananas are my roommates he keeps all the good tvs completely for himself yeah at least he feels shame you can tell from how red he is at least he feels some shame but not enough to change his ways no no is anyone else gonna be allowed to sit on the snorlax oh people already have yeah yeah and you consider that generous yes like that somehow makes it okay yeah i mean that thing's like 500 i'm not like i gotta i gotta pick who can go on it you know customer care more like customers don't give a customer care about myself because yeah exactly these two machines are gonna be so sick and then soon on facebook marketplace you're gonna be able to trade a long hdmi cable for nolan's second computer yeah it's gonna be great probably not although speaking of facebook marketplace if anybody wants a transparent tv oh my god are you the one who won that stupid thing i put one freaking ticket in linus one ticket where are you even keeping it's at my parents house taking up space they're like what are you getting rid of this thing we tried so hard to sell that stupid transparent tv jamie how long did we have it listed for like eight months maybe oh we had one guy message and and it was just like oh is this the one that was on the linus tech tips video and we were like yeah and it's like that's cool that was the end of it what was the lowest price we ended up offering for it almost like 600 bucks or something like that how much did i pay for it seven grand and then i said it was another few grand in shipping to get it here nolan you don't even want it no okay hear me it was a fun novelty hear me out come on over here i got a pitch okay okay another pitch you got your computer on the other side of the phone all right you got your tv embedded in the wall yeah okay you press a button boom your computer has a little app that flips around the image tv on both on either side embedded in the wall that would be very cool but very impractical yeah also there's a giant puck in the bottom of the tv yeah that was all the electronics that would be just like sitting somewhere sticking out of the wall on either side i'm sure your strata council wouldn't yeah they would love that one i'm sure how much how freaking much did you spend on rgb fans for this build uh and then you had a 2070 super to be clear it's a respectable gpu but good gravy man it was also yeah i uh it's not how i would have allocated my budget i'll tell you that much and i don't even like rgb i feel like a lot of people end up coming away from these extreme tech upgrades as like new fan favorites yeah that ain't gonna be you dude uh okay jamie let's see you seem to be you seem to be wanting something to do yeah what what what is there to do still i'm gonna put the plate on the wall for the tv and that's it he made it easy already drilled all the holes want to show the people how to how to put a plate on a wall sure all right jamie is now officially an ltt host good luck jamie thanks we might end up cutting it if you suck oh man damn it i was taking out this uh this cooler standoff and this heatsink sliced me open oh damn i'm gonna need a band-aid that's really big there's blood on that yeah yeah sorry about that i think i got i just don't want to fill out the paperwork oh yeah this is actually like like a thing you have to do no i'm like bleeding i actually have to do it you want me to just call it let the record show safety committee that i am washing my hands well i'm trying [Laughter] wow way to go hey ltp store yeah phil i have a good water bottle thanks for that oh there's a skin flap ow damn i peeled it up man now that i peel it up it's bleeding more oh this sucks put the banana on quick well i can't because my hands are wet now whoever it's a waterproof band-aid oh is it guys waterproof just means that once you've applied it it's waterproof that might be all we have for band-aids oh my god so gpu doesn't fit with the fans in so your gpu doesn't fit in your new case well it fits but i'll have to move this fan there's not clearance oh shoot it really isn't gonna fit it really isn't gonna fit i wonder if we could just i bet we could get it in there i think we could get it in there if we can yeah i mean it'll flex a little cause you you want that fan right there blowing that fresh air in it so well now the question is can you get it out hold on let me give it a little yeah go ahead this at the end here there we go live gpu how old are you nolan i'm 21 i'm 22 in a month so you do not know what a limp biz kit is then no yeah well that's i don't know i do but i don't yeah you don't know the joy of going out and buying a limb biscuit cd no i don't or any cd watching them at woodstock 99 no i wasn't even born oh god what year would you be born 2 000 wow yeah yep that's okay because at least my generation's housing was much more affordable oh geez but who needs a house when you can live in mark zuckerberg's metaverse i mean you've got all the gear all you need is a quest now yeah and i have no vr and no desire to be in the metaverse they almost cut me again these heatsinks asus are extremely sharp i kind of wish the gpu was white i'm not gonna lie yeah is the because the yeah you could pop this back plate spray it white yeah put it back on and then i think you're good to go yeah i've actually got a friend that does that so i might not gonna lie dude um i do not see a better way to deal with this than how i've already dealt with it yeah oh my god there's like extra sata power cables hanging around back here that we could purge there's it's it's a mess we're on the mount wow that is pretty simple shockingly easy i'll grab my little screwdriver and we'll just put the locking piece okay you want to mount that uh yeah that's not the playstation i'll bring it in here i think i'm going to put it over here somewhere maybe i'll line it up concerned about it like clashing with your left-hand shelf there i hear a debate yeah of where to put this playstation debate playstation how about in the garbage boom are you a disc boy i am a disc boy you're a disc boy i'm a disc well then in my humble opinion it's gonna have to be on the left so you don't have to physically leave the bed to change the disc yeah the only thing is the shelves are there but i think the the playstation we line it up if we line it up the playstation is a work of art that's true it's a top collar work of art it deserves to be there with the lego and the picture of my mother so you wanted the bottom of the plate at 14 inches or so like i'm just thinking about how freaking tall this playstation is this is the last install of the day how about i put it there and you like it you know what works for me so i think it just sits on there like that wonderful and then yeah yeah it screws in up through the bottom but i still have to put an ssd in this thing so that looks fine for me meanwhile the progress i've made has been purely aesthetic but actually pretty good in my humble opinion that is a lot better than what it was that's still going to involve some stuff just being kind of jammed behind the power supply over here i'm gonna put the commander pro up there okay i'm totally fine with a little jank come on oh there's some lights i don't see i'm not seeing fan lights i'm not seeing any lights ah good enough let's eat your old os just picked right up which is kind of nice uh do you want to go ahead and log in and then we can see if the corsair software also figures out it's shiz blue purple white what the i wanna drive yeah it's going nutty oh okay oh it was just oh i think it was just realizing that there's other monitors here look at that nice all right uh oh look at all of these things yeah no one cares six fans are connected so red yellow green yeah blue got them all so it's still not spinning though the white one's not spinning which is not spinning weird the iq is not responding at all i love iq you truly have made very little progress here we took lunch i had i had a problem with the rad lunch is not progress is this what they pay you for create a warehouse if you want to help with wiring that would be great because as you saw from my last one not my strong suit yeah no it's not what is your strong suit nolan [Music] wow that was harsh that was hard i'm kidding i've invited you into my home linus i can't help it i just love like sick burns as humor does that make me a bully part of my problem i think with my public image is that i tend to enjoy playing that character so much that whenever i do play that character on camera i just get way too into it i just love the sick burns too much wait you have another fan and you can fit another fan that is a win-win so i gotta i know i don't even think so this is my new positive i like my new positive persona nolan i'm so happy for you this is great i just i can't i can't keep it yeah i feel it felt like it felt way too fake and i think we're just going to put this gpu in here all right like is everything else installed in there it seems pretty installed minor details yeah yeah okay mine are deeper let's see if you can let's see if it'll go you're gonna go boy oh my that sounds so great yeah i'm not oh it's not in line hold on i gotta push it oh there we go good job thank you i'm halfway there it's a big process big process i'm a positive person it does feel a little condescending [Laughter] i can't win [Laughter] that is a tight fit and i got to tell you that this is not good yeah for case airflow like having the bottom completely cut off from the top yeah like i don't know where this heat's going to go you know what i'm saying i guess we'll see we'll figure it out yeah there's only one way to know for sure i'll tell you what why don't you leave this to me to finish up and why don't you go build a playstation i will go build a playstation all right i'm totally down to do that yeah let's cuddle have a seat is it the wrong side yeah it's the wrong side where do you want this boy uh yeah you can just leave it put it right there on the ground there had you given any thought to control for it keyboard i have a wireless mouse but i'm going to need to get a wireless keyboard for it okay i have a spare keyboard to use in the meantime though i'll go grab it this thing is dusty here you go that was under my bed the wind is coming your way it's coming right in it's coming right in there if i blow it i think we got to close the door that's awful oh it's flying towards me sorry brandon oh god i got it i'll protect you okay perfect why don't you guys go put the playstation on the wall i'll get windows installed sweet now everybody's working yeah okay i've got it in the in the hole i don't know if it's exactly lined up but what is going on here i think it needs to like turn there we go i got it oh there we go it wasn't actually sitting down that's fine we do it right because we do it twice yeah yeah there you go oh two person two-person peel andy would have just left it on that's true andy's a monster nolan i'm not saying you're a heavy boy but when you sat down dude this couch is it's brutal i can feel it going like that is it actually going i think it's going please oh do you know why it's because we don't have the stuff under it because you moved it off from the wall this is what keeps the couch from collapsing yeah they tore down a sushi restaurant and we took their signs okay so i should put this back on back against the uh yeah or or do that too okay that also works xbox this one's gonna be easy this is the easiest one two three installed pretty much it wasn't actually part of the upgrade like you wanted the christmas party it was on my list you've been using it for like six months right yeah it was on my list and then me and matt were like the two people who put the most tickets in for it yeah because they weren't able to get one at the time at least the tv in your room looks a lot better it's a lot better it is amazing how much gaming can be done from within just i know oh like a chair yeah i got a chair is this a steel case it is a steel case gesture oh very nice yeah whoa i haven't actually tried the just so much movement it's great this is a 65 inch 55 55. it feels when you're sitting this close like yeah when you're like hanging out on the bed right here and you're like oh yeah oh not bad man so jamie yes sir can you please take the whole thing off the wall you want me to do it just adjust a little bit yeah do it all over again i'll see you guys tomorrow [Laughter] to play this game insert the disc oh he put the disc in that's why it's up on the thing to here there's only one way to find out for sure did he put it in upside down he did it's unreadable oh that's hilarious wait what wait no that should be the right way that should be right it doesn't go in this does it go in this way it might i never put a disc in a playstation 5. so now if i click it yep there we go wow is it just gonna play we just i think it's just gonna play we just revealed our playstation five nude mist knowledge hardcore wow there we go i don't think you're gonna end up running an hdmi cable from your computer to the living room i think you're going to end up running an hdmi cable from your xbox to this tv yeah this tv is nice because this is so much better than the one out there actually crazy man this setup is amazing 12th gen rtx 38 yeah ps5 got the big tv i think you should put the xbox in here i think you should i think you should mount it there yeah flank it with the xbox and just everyone else can hang out in pleb land yeah out in the living room well whether it's streaming gaming on pc gaming on xbox playstation 5 switch nolan's got it covered this has definitely been one of our most all-encompassing intel extreme tech upgrades guys i hope you enjoyed meeting nolan actually some of you have probably met him already through uh customer support messages thanks to intel for sponsoring extremetech upgrade we will see you at the next one if you're looking for another video to watch uh the most recent one is brandon's and that's probably worth a watch as long as you have a strong forehead because you're gonna have a lot of this oh
