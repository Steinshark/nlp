software engineer what's the difference okay the age-old question are you ready for this um now I want to give you my uh personal opinion on software developer versus software engineer which uh there isn't but let's just find out okay let's find out am I a software engineer or am I a software developer software plays an essential role in how we function in our daily lives okay lovely When comparing software Engineers versus software developers you'll find that software developers and Engineers work together to ensure computer programmers computer programs are effective I work with software Engineers damn uh this article discusses developer versus engineering role engineer role including their similarities and their differences okay okay okay here we go here we go people sit down let's find out which one of you guys are real engineers and not software developers design develop and customize computer software applications for many Industries they identify customer needs develop software to meet those needs and test and modify the software as needed they often work directly with clients or as part of a team of developers engineers and programmers dude there's a third category we're not even going to discuss the third category how could you do that that can we pour one out for the poor programmers that aren't even they don't even get up they get a they don't even get an honorable mention they're just like passerbys uh to create software solutions that meet their uh specific user needs okay software developer salary and career growth hell yeah according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics uh the BLS probably dropped the L it may be good uh software developers earn a median salary of a hundred and twenty seven thousand two hundred and sixty dollars Unfortunately they do spend forty thousand dollars a year on soy lattes so you know it really isn't that much honestly it really isn't that much money like when you think about it that way they're really actually living the life of poverty you know what I mean it's like poverty lifestyle uh it's very very difficult to wear Lululemon and drink soy lattes on 127. okay the job outlook for software developers is excellent with employment a projected to increase 26 percent from 2021 to 2031 according to the BLS okay you know for all those for all those AIS taking our jobs software developer education requirements all right here we go here we go software developers typically need a back layers in software engineering applied computer science data science software development or a related discipline a degree program typically includes mathematics computer programming languages and software design courses additionally coding boot camps can be an excellent option for developing specific skills and gaining hands-on experience in skills like programming oh oh programmers are just the pieces of that's what that means you need programmers are the ones that could cut it with mathematics and so therefore they don't get to be a part of the developers but I don't know if I'm even I don't know if I'm an engineer I'm not gonna lie to you I don't know if I'm an engineer based on this article okay boot camps can give you a Competitive Edge in the job market I big fan of edging so hey if you can get some edging in you know who to call the Boot campagen wasn't there just recently a boot camp that got in a lot of trouble okay so that camp or the place that got in all that trouble like a week before they emailed me and they're like yo baby I'd like to sit down maybe appear on your stream get people excited for a little boot camp and I was like oh really and they're like oh really and then right afterwards it was just like could have been Lambda School anyways uh boot camps can give you a Competitive Edge in the job market it is not it is not uncommon for software developers to have both a college degree and boot camp training pull right now Forbes you piece of Paul Paul new poll is this true yes I have both no none I have never I have never heard of someone having both a college degree and boot camp you have both no see this is the problem about twitch y'all y'all y'all always go on here and put just whatever answer pisses me off it doesn't matter what it is somehow there's always just like you know you know that you know it okay oh yeah I knew that no you didn't okay you didn't that's three years at a uni and a boot camp count I got that damn both be in philosophy in a little boot camp okay but that's different they're saying a degree in programming followed by that damn the song is a banger okay maybe I'm out of touch no okay so 11 people apparently did it a lot of people have nothing they're just like I'm just programming doc you'll dock programming Prime was the guy in the top image wearing a bulletproof basketball coating absolutely uh maybe an English degree maybe yeah but that's different right that makes sense you went you went to college and you got some stupid ass degree you came out with a liberal arts degree why why won't they pay me money you know and you're all confused that all you can do is tell people about effectively nothing and why no one will pay you and then guess what you do you go to a programming boot camp that's completely normal and I support that I actually think that's a really great idea to go to Liberal Arts that's actually how schools used to be did you know that you do four years of liberal arts and then you would specialize right like that was the real thing in the uh for most of college degree like in a in a proper educational pursuited Society that's how it's supposed to be but we're not that anyways why am I not getting paid for my underwater basket basket weaving degree I know anyways let's keep on going okay software developer developer programming languages and daily tasks okay the requirements and responsibilities for software developers vary by position generally they are expected to be uh have Proficiency in various computer languages and operating systems what this I have literally never heard anyone be like could you tell me about Ubuntu and Windows please um the following are some common tasks that software developers May perform plan design developed customized test and maintain computer software and applications or systems that address specific user needs okay use customer feedback to upgrade existing software and systems to make them more effective or efficient uh create maintain documentation for the system applications use a variety of programming languages such as uh python C plus JavaScript Java Hold It Back Hold It Back now personally when I first read this obviously I gave them the benefit of the doubt Oxford comma issue they clearly just Oxford comma this because because clearly they understood that when you use CSS plus HTML it's actually a tour in complete language they knew but then I looked at all their other hands and guess what this one doesn't have it either right and it just keeps the test and maintained right so this is just bam all right what is a software engineer all right let's go let's go come on who's touring his name's Alan uh software Engineers are considered a type of software developer they are involved in all stages of software development lifecycle using programming languages architecture and structural design to develop I what is structural design and how does a different damn it I am not a software engineer dang it uh software Engineers typically work in teams with other developers project managers product managers and other professionals software Engineers consider all components of a project and how potential Solutions may affect the project overall software Engineers earn an average annual salary of 91. [Music] man software Engineers ain't got on software developers look at that look at that they got nothing you got nothing you got nothing nothing oh man that feels so good um this is great all right while the BLS doesn't provide job growth data specifically for software Engineers employment of software developers quality assurance analysts and testers is expected to decrease 25 weight is that the same number they set up here I thought it was oh because they threw in an extra couple classes of people okay okay all right what's the difference a bachelor in computer science information techno I got computer science by the way just so you know I'm a software engineer Ben won B1 going to B1 uh information technology or a related discipline that is often preferred for software engineering roles these degrees teach coding skills mathematics theoretical Concepts and other fundamentals in addition to their college education many software Engineers receive training through boot camp what it happened again to learn new skills quickly various boot camps offer Hands-On training and teach specific programming languages boot camps are a great option for Tech professionals without college degrees software engineering daily tasks okay let's see this uh while job responsibilities may vary on position below are typical tasks that software Engineers perform regularly solve problems using system level approaches that consider how potential Solutions might affect the entire system rather than just one component and they get paid less collaborates with stakeholders customers and Engineers to ensure software applications or systems meet requirements that reads like a that reads like a job opening I collaborate and create Synergy between several multi-disciplined branches of Enterprise Solutions like what the hell are you even saying what that what the hell are you saying use a variety of computer programming languages such as JavaScript wait a second wait a second wait a second wait a second right now wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait do that okay okay now we got that one here you forgot you forgot it you forgot you forgot something okay okay I'm gonna do this with I'm a computer scientist so I wouldn't actually read this I'd build something to help me okay there we go so I'm gonna go like this I'm gonna hit it with a little uh I'm gonna hit it with a little can I just call sword on this thing whoopsies what's the what's the proper way to do this can I can I call sword on this yeah okay that's what I thought as a computer scientist okay whoopsies all right uh there we go all right what do we got here okay so we got C plus plus CSS HTML Java JavaScript they know the same thing they know the same things what the hell are we even reading software Engineers are considered a type of software developer they are involved in all stages of the software development lifecycle using programming languages art wait I already read this I was like damn this sentence is the same difference between okay what's the difference they reordered it they literally just reordered it I can't even I feel so Bamboozled right now shippity this is jeopardy generated software developer and Engineering roles overlap but the key differences exist between them consider the following differences when making the career decision one makes a lot more money the other one doesn't so that's the answer right uh software Engineers take a big picture role consider all components on a project to ensure it made stakeholders requirements on the other hand software develop software developers develop and maintain software to solve the problems okay so hold on are software engineers are they that guy no see I talk to the customers software developers make sure software functions effectively while software Engineers ensure software meet stakeholders overall requirements but you just told me up here that they use customer feedback to improve and make it more efficient and correct and they and you ensure that IT addresses users needs so which one is it which one is it which one I I'm feeling very lie to okay hold on hold on let's I'm feeling very light too similar oh I missed the whole similarity section what's the similarity section both play uh apart in creating software programs okay both no comparable computer Pro okay both right code and tested okay both use comparable Frameworks libraries such as Ruby and rails very up-to-date hip spring everybody loves Django everyone loves Django Unchained turbo gears I've literally never heard of Turbo gears can somebody for a second tell me what that is convince me right now this is not a Roblox reference right now or I'm gonna be upset what the hell is Turbo gears python thing is that like turbo Pascal yes dude cool kids are using turbo gears see gosh look at me I'm so stupid turbo gear go crazy all right anyways software let's see hold on let's see software Engineers typically work with end clients I've always been a big fan of the old end client uh software developers and non-technical stakeholders while software developers typically work with software Engineers quality assurance Specialists and software testers wow I can't believe how ignorant I've been this whole time there's a difference between software engineers and software developers like imagine if only I knew that just don't tell Netflix the difference because right now I'm a senior software engineer and I think if they find out the difference they're going to lower my pay so can you just let's just not let's just all agree that we didn't read this article or we're all software developers can we all agree to that yeah yeah okay good good uh you are you even a software engineer if you don't know turbo gears what article stastic hot were you the name is the software developer again please give me a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars now
