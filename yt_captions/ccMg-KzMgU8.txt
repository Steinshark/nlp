hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about the anti-lag system used in the hyundai veloster end so the first thing we're going to do is listen to a couple clips so you can hear what it sounds like basically what you're listening for is after i lift off the throttle or shift you're going to hear a couple pops from the exhaust so that's what you're going to be listening to in these clips now just because a vehicle has crackles and pops coming from its exhaust does not necessarily mean it has an anti-lag system and in fact hyundai does not market this as an anti-lag system they market this as a sound benefit so what they say is that it creates an explosive sound as in race cars by retarding ignition timing but this had me thinking because this is the same method that anti-lag systems use some anti-lag systems and so i had a discussion with albert biermann who leads the development of performance vehicles at hyundai and he also has a significant history in engineering with bmw m vehicles and when i was chatting with him i was saying hey does this actually function as an anti-lag system or is it done purely for sound and what he was saying is that when you do put the car in end mode and it has various different modes that you can put it in four or five different modes and when you put in end mode it is actually designed to function as an anti-lag system and so when you're at high load high rpm and you let off the throttle then you're going to have those crackles that's going to be that exhaust trying to keep that turbo spooling or when you up shift you're going to hear that anti-lag system functioning and so how does this work what's actually done within the car in order to make this work so we're going to look at you know what happens in a normal mode and then what happens when you have this anti-lag system functioning so normally you have your four strokes you have your intake stroke you pull in air perhaps fuel you have that compression stroke where you push that air and fuel up together this is going to be a direct injection engine so you're going to inject that fuel in then during that compression stroke and then in a normal engine cycle during the compression stroke before that piston reaches top dead center you're going to have that spark ignite you know before it gets up there then it's going to start to build that combustion that flame front travel out and then push the piston down now when you're using an anti-lag system so you let off the throttle you the ignition significantly so you slow down when that ignition occurs so instead of it occurring as that piston is on its way up it's going to occur after that piston has already started to move down and then you're going to ignite that air fuel mixture and then you're going to have combustion occur and the reason why you do this is because by the time that that piston gets down to the bottom and the exhaust valve is open you still have combustion occurring and so it goes out the exhaust not outside of the exhaust i just did this to kind of show you what's going on but you have combustion still occurring as the exhaust valve is open and so that high pressure keeps your turbocharger spooled up so you're having your spark ignite significantly after top dead center rather than before how you would normally to create power so what that means is you're not creating a lot of useful power which is fine because you're letting off the throttle you're not asking for power in that moment you're you're but it would be nice to have the turbocharger still spooled up so that's what it's doing is it's transferring instead of having high pressure to push that piston down it's having high pressure to keep that turbo charger spooled up and then once you get back on the throttle it goes back to that normal ignition timing so that you can maintain power so it's to to keep high pressure in the exhaust not to create useful power and it mostly primarily does this when this vehicle is in end mode so here we just have the drawing of kind of a simplified version of what this looks like you've got your turbocharger you're going to be pulling in air here through the intercooler then it comes into the combustion chamber you have that piston moving up and down and then of course you that ignition timing when you want uh the anti-lag system to be running which is when you let off the throttle and when you up shift keeps that turbocharger spools up exits out the exhaust now as i said earlier you know you could just do this for sound or you could do this uh to actually function as anti-lag so how much uh benefit from an anti-lag standpoint you get is dependent on the ignition timing as well as how much air and fuel you put into it so if you have you know the more you delay that ignition timing the more combustion is going to be occurring inside the exhaust manifold than you know inside this combustion chamber before that exhaust valve opens up so the later you have your ignition timing the more anti-lag function you're going to have and also the more air and fuel you allow into the combustion chamber of course you know that means the higher pressure you're going to have going to that turbo so if you completely close that throttle valve when you let off the throttle and you don't allow hardly any air to get in there well then it's going to be tough for it to have much of an anti-lag system so it's it's going to be controlling things like that how much air does it allow in how much fuel does it inject and when does it allow for that a timing to occur in order to maximize you know how well does this turbo charger stay spooled up and this is primarily done in end mode you may have some pops and things in the other modes but that's primarily just for noise uh really this is just done for the end mode when you're in that performance mode and you want to get the maximum you know performance out of the vehicle so this is very cool that hyundai's done this with a production vehicle i mean something that comes with a long warranty and they have to make sure that all of these parts can last uh you know the exhaust manifold the turbo charger lasts for these high pressure scenarios where they use the anti-lag system so it's very cool that this is put in a production car which has a warranty which passes emissions things like that a neat system that they have developed if you guys have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below thanks for watching
