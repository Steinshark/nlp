foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] hey what's up I'm Kim BHD here so a lot happened during 2021 and also a lot didn't happen huh let's rewind and recap so in 2021 on the MKBHD Channel we ended up making 93 Total videos all about tech tech products Tech explainers talks with creators and people in the tech world this is the 93rd video that we're watching right here which is technically less than my goal of 100 videos roughly during the course of the year and way less than my 121 last year so it'd be easy to get down on that but this year we also started three other channels so my podcast the waveform podcast is now in video form we built up a video studio for it and new episodes have continued to drop every single week on Fridays that's why we really get into the weeds and the details on Tech stuff that's a whole Channel there's also a waveform Clips Channel started up this year I'll link both of these below that like button I'm gonna guess because I don't know but that you shoot them with an iPhone is that right and we also started up the studio Channel which is a peek behind the curtain you out into how the team works here at the studio how we cover the tech world and how we make all these videos like how we turn a Thousand Mile two-day road trip experiment into an informative structured piece about gas versus electric cars we've got members we've got the whole team most of the team here we're going to be in these cars probably trash talking a little bit and turning into a bit of a race but to see exactly how much time charging at these different infrastructures adds to a road trip so when you include all those the total goes from 93 to 93 plus 34 plus 96 plus 17 to equal 240 videos this calendar year which is amazing and I'm very proud of all of them and the work that we put into them and really moving forward the saying that's still always in the back of my head every time I'm making something like this is more better more better really anytime you try to make more of something typically the quality goes down and anytime you spend a lot of effort into making something better typically you make less of them and so our goal with the whole team at the MKBHD studio is to make both more and better and that's for you so now here's five really large movements I observed in the tech world this year so number five short form content is here to stay it's hooked it's caught on and it feels pretty permanent and you know for a while we've known short form content is is getting popular the explosion of tick tock over the past two years but now Instagram adding reels and YouTube really leaning into shorts building it onto the website it's it feels much more here to stay we always knew there was something to it it's arrived so I've experimented with shorts a little bit and I've I've done we even did one or two on the studio Channel I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up making an entire dedicated shorts Channel just to play with this short format because I do have a lot of fun with them but I just want to make I don't just want to make it because it's popular I want to make good ones so anyway stay tuned for that we'll probably play with that a lot in the next year or so in 2022 but yeah short stuff it's here then number four nfts crypto web 3.0 Dogecoin it's funny I don't talk about you know Finance stuff necessarily that much on this channel even though obviously it's a big part of the tech world this this whole crypto boom but you know there's a little bit of a peek of it here and there I did make a video about Dogecoin the rise and fall of it what exactly it is what a meme coin is but also we've been talking about Bitcoin on the podcast people sold an nft for 69 million dollars and then he hopped on the waveform podcast and we talked about it and about being a Creator and how digital art is being taken to the next level with this sort of stuff so I'll leave a link below if you want to watch that one but yeah let me know if you'd be interested in more crypto coverage or crypto videos or anything sort of like that in 2022. so the number three custom silicon underrated really I really feel like this is underrated for how much this is changing the landscape of tech and how much it will continue to do so going forward so we already knew the a series of chips in iPhones were custom designed by Apple but then they brought the M1 chip in this apple silicon takeover of their whole lineup into MacBook Air MacBook Pro Mac Mini and even iPad Pro and they did really great then we saw the next level Step Up of M1 Pro and M1 Max chips in the MacBook Pros and those had huge huge performance and efficiency gains over the Intel versions Google's tensor chip in the pixel had a bunch of advantages over the previous chips off the shelf that allowed them to make pixel 6 one of the best actually the best value phone of the year thanks to the smartphone Awards and this is something I fully expect to continue much more into next year more phone manufacturers even tablet and laptop and headphone and other company manufacturers doing more with proprietary silicon that they design in-house so if I was is Qualcomm or Intel right now I'd be paying very close attention to this then number two alternate form factors they gain just a little bit of momentum and a little bit more usability every single year really it started back to when we got Samsung Z flip 3 which gave you basically all the normal experiences of a flagship phone that could fold in half and actually launched at basically the same price as a lot of other Flagship phones 9.99 which is right inside a lot of other flagships but we've since then of course seen many others we have the larger fold three we have the midsize Oppo Find n the Razer gave us something different there's also the xiaomi Mi mix fold there's also Huawei mate X2 surface Duo 2. there's just a bunch of different experimentation playing with the form factor but it's all getting more usable and slowly coming down in price it's not immediately here but it's clearly working its way towards being arrived so there will be more and I'm sure they'll all be better in 2022 but that leaves us at number one which is ev's electric vehicles and specifically a lot of those trucks I've said this before but every year for the next decade is going to be the most interesting year yet for electric cars now for the past two or three years or so we've been getting a lot of promises you know this company promises they'll have 20 EVS by 2030 and this other company promises to Electrify their whole lineup in the next eight to 12 years great great that's all great the promises are great but now it's time to start shipping them so in 2021 we got the headliners we got rivien r1t we got the Hummer EV we got Ford F-150 Lightning announced at least we got Lucid air we got Tesla Model S plaid that's all already enough to get a lot of people interested but they're also pretty premium so you also get things like the Volkswagen id4 the Nissan Leaf the Mini Cooper S A lot of the lower priced EVS that will actually move volume and I think it's pretty easy to say they will be way more next year and it's going to be fascinating to see how they all differentiate themselves what features they'll offer how their Tech gets better how many miles they'll be able to offer at certain price ranges it's going to be good I fully plan to check out as many as I possibly can and hopefully bring you guys videos of those and I'll continue to write articles for Top Gear while I'm at it now okay in the spirit of rewinding not everything was amazing and perfectly exactly how we expected in 2021 so here's the top five things that didn't come out during 2021 that maybe we were hoping for or that we expected to so number five the Samsung Galaxy Note this is interesting we didn't get a new note this entire year the last Galaxy Note was the Galaxy Note 20 and that wasn't a great phone but we had an entire gap for 2021 where there was no phone with an S Pen built in there were phones that supported the S Pen and that was an interesting Clause the S Pen is not dead but now I wonder if we're going to ever see another note again if they're just saving it for early next year we'll have to see now number four a foldable pixel and or a pixel watch we got pixel 6 and pixel 6 Pro and they were both really interesting phones in a lot of ways the tensor chip the new set of cameras the new hardware design the new material you software all of that very interesting to watch um but no pun intended there was no watch and you know we were hoping to see maybe like an Apple Watch equivalent for Android Straight from Google and that seems to be rumored heavily but we haven't seen it yet I honestly think it could be a couple years out and same thing with a foldable pixel we have all this software support from Google for foldables now but we don't have a sort of standard Google foldable I also don't think we're going to be seeing that anytime soon the rumors keep churning in the background which is kind of interesting but yeah that's a little ways out then number three Tesla's stuff cyber truck being one and then plaid plus and Roadster being others so really the Cyber truck was one that we're I guess maybe starting to hope we might see on the road this year but it is delayed chip shortage a lot of things got delayed this year this is one of the casualties and now it's officially well hopefully coming at the end of 2022 but also Tesla announced the Plaid Model S and the Plaid plus Model S the Plaid plus ended up getting completely canceled because it was unnecessary and they ended up just shifting all of that into Tesla Model S plaid production a very strange turn of events I haven't seen a car announced and canceled like that before even after they took orders for it but that was sort of a blip on the Tesla radar and uh our Roadster friend is uh still not out I don't know I didn't think it would be out by now I was kind of hoping back in 2017 when they announced it that it would be out by 2021 even though it was a 2020 announced car yeah it's later it's like 2023 or 24 now so number two an apple silicon true desktop and I said true desktop meaning the Apple silicon iMac Pro or apple silicon Mac Pro so we have the Apple silicon M1 iMac which had a lot of really nice things to it it's a thin all-in-one for a sort of everyday crowd not too performance focused but obviously very capable now we're looking forward to seeing what they can really unleash with a bigger chip in a desktop and for me iMac Pro seems like it'll be really cool probably high refresh rate high resolution nice black bezel maybe but then Apple silicon desktop like the Mac Pro that's the one I really should be waiting for and then number one any sub 30 000 EV well almost I'll say any good one I mean we had okay the Nissan Leaf came out it had like a 29 000 starting price and I think it had about 150 miles of range something like that but what I'm really looking forward to is when we start getting the premium EV experience lower and lower in price whether that's the Tesla Model 2 that's rumored or maybe that's some other company that's beating them to the punch but I would love to see a sub thirty thousand dollar accessible Evie with let's go 220 miles of range or more to really make it more than just a quick little commuter vehicle that would be awesome to see it didn't come out last year didn't come out in 2021 I think we might see it in 2022 but anyway that's it for my rewind for 2021 Tech I'm gonna wrap it up on a positive note by giving you down below five Great Tech videos that came out this year that weren't published by me that I still think you really should watch so just open the description down below the like button and check out all the stuff down there but either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
