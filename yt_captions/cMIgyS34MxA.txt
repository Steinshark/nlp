this is the streamer I show speed and he's about to accidentally expose the scam he's been paid to promote especially For Speed just for you Paradox crypto see the moon Paradox crypto to the Moon not only that I actually ended up confronting the people behind all of this and it didn't exactly go well advertising 10x to 100x is that a get rich quick scheme yes or no no now we're gonna get to all of this but first let's start at the beginning in what started as a live stream to meet Cristiano Ronaldo and give away ps5s quickly turn into a nightmare after fans realized the Meetup was fake and was being used to promote a scam literally they used a fake Cristiano Ronaldo who couldn't play soccer and was wearing a buy Paradox crypto coin t-shirt and it quickly got worse the live chat started calling paradoxcoin a scam in the middle of this sponsored stream and called I show speed a sellout which caused him to get very angry you sold out they're using your speed this is just sad that is crazy bro like them comments like that bro this makes me like that's crazy bro the fact I ever made like I just think of me like that it's just crazy I hate that bro y'all so weird bro it's crazy bro it's crazy when people think of me as a sellout as I literally sell out now to be honest I don't watch much of iso speeds content I know he's a popular streamer and from what I understand he's followed primarily by a bunch of teenagers who think comedy is now we know comedy is subjective but I do think one thing is objectively hilarious and that is the fact that all these teenagers and kids called this guy out I mean just think about it the target of most crypto scams is gullible people and who's more gullible than kids and teenagers so when those people see right through your scam that's pretty embarrassing and it got so bad that speed had to mute himself to try to figure out how to salvage the situation the only problem is he forgot to fully mute the mic so what do I do now [Music] foreign now before we get to the rest of this audio of speed exposing the scam let's talk about Paradox coin the thing he's promoting how do we know this is a scam anyways well I checked out their website to learn more where they call themselves the future of gaming but the one thing I really took away from Paradox is that they're not one thing the Paradox metaverse is actually seven things each one possibly dumber than the last and I'm gonna explain them so first up is the Paradox game which has Graphics out of the PS2 era which made me wonder why they'd be giving away ps5s I mean are you trying to make your games look worse by comparison but it gets even crazier because I spoke to the founders and they called their game Triple A quality and I took issue with that we have worked day and night for the last year to make this as you probably know you've probably done your research it takes two years on average to make a triple A game right yes yes or no on average anyone that does a bit of research in Triple A game you know it's roughly takes between two and three years for a triple A game as far as we are concerned and frankly I have to take Serious serious that this is a AAA game yeah this looks like designing Unreal Engine I'm sure you have defined it but you admit wait a second can you describe yourself as an indie game you describe yourself to you but just give it you are interrupting me of course you are you you call yourself an indie game on your YouTube channel and then have the audacity to come on my channel and call yourself AAA yes we are a self-funded Indie Studio a UK based Indie gaming studio Indie studio so yeah I'm not buying this AAA game story because not even they believe it and even for an indie game studio uh things seem unfinished I mean in one of their gameplay trailers I found like the starter weapons HUD in Unreal Engine in their game so how many day and nights did this really take this isn't just any regular game of course it's a blockchain game so they sell nft avatars which you can used to play in game and if you play in game it earns you para coins now follow me here uh to earn these pair coins you complete missions which apparently require up to eight hours of gameplay to accomplish and once you do that you have to wait 24 hours before starting another mission uh I guess if you do that full time they estimate you make 500 a week based on four hours a day of playing weight I thought these missions took eight hours to play okay I'm a bit confused but whatever let's press on they even have an answer for people who don't like grinding themselves apparently if you want you can rent out your avatar to someone else for para coins and passive income uh okay so now you have para coins right what are you gonna do with them well you can sell them but why sell them when you can lock them up and stake them forget this even more paracords if you do this your paraccoins turn into P Save which then you lock up for a period sorry trying to maintain my a composure here you lock up for a period of 28 to 288 days the longer you lock up your money the more you earn in a process they call delay and get paid sure I guess now if you want to understand how this entire staking process works um their flowchart will leave you even more confused here it is and instead of explaining it I'm going to label all of this Ponzi nonsense this is a pro tip for you guys out there if you ever see a flow chart that seems almost impossibly complicated uh it's Ponzi nonsense they're trying to confuse you because if you actually understood how a Ponzi scheme worked you'd never truly invest so I know all of this at this point seems stupid but hey that's only the first exciting opportunity for you there's seven more so if you're not a gamer they also give you other schemes you can get involved in for example there's the Paradox Dao where you can stake pedal coins to earn up to ten percent a year in returns and if that's not your thing you can try the Paradox pad where they promise 10x to 100x multiples if you invest okay now I asked them if they thought this was marketing a get rich quick scheme and here's what they said it's hard for me to be quote professional when y'all are dodging my questions if you want to answer questions advertising 10x to 100x is that a get rich quick scheme yes or no no why because every single day of the week in the crypto space please get knowledgeable about what happens in the crypto space so much of the crypto spaces again him oh God we got you gotcha we got you buddy you're a Bitcoin hater you hate crypto that's why you don't like us that's why you call us a Skype cause you hate us crypto guys repeat what back what I said repeat back what I said word for word I said that's right on Twitter that's right on Twitter yo I don't know what the gotcha was here but uh anyways from here it derailed and so we're gonna get back on topic uh they also have Paris swap where the average user can expect to earn up to 20 on staking rewards all right now if all of that sounds dumb you can even get your friends to invest too with with Paradox affiliate oh my gosh it's so bad uh every person you get gets five pounds okay whoop-dee-doo now the last one we're gonna cover is paradox events sorry I've got to take this seriously Paradox is a very serious company we have to all remember that so Paradox events is not really a direct scam per se it's an event company put together by the founders of paradox you guessed it they claim they want to sell you YouTube boxing pay-per-view which is only available with their little para coins right which seems very stupid and like it never would work only they claim their first fight is Andrew Tate vs Jake Paul uh I found this out because their founder told me about it in their Discord at first he seemed to be upset about this supposedly being leaked he says guys can we refrain from sending the screenshot that was leaked about the Jake Paul vs Tate fight in February however I couldn't find these leaked posts and a few minutes later I realized this guy might be spreading his own rumor and this made a lot more sense when the same day he said I don't care spread the word of Jake and Andrew so wait you leak this supposed fight yourself and then say oops I guess it's out there let's spread the word guys I don't know it's it's so cringy man this whole thing we cannot we've got a screenshot it's not confirmed nor deny whether or not we are in talks to make it happen on our roster on our clock now if we do get to make the happen we make an amazing official announcement to come with it um if there is a screenshots you're telling everyone just like say it's true I don't know why you're saying our community but within our community share around within our community without all the members I don't know what spread the word word of Jake and Andrew let's get Paradox everywhere everywhere though now before we go further let's meet the other Founders too on their website they list Amy italio and facial to reek who both seem pretty obscure I think amio like sells a goofy University or something which just takes 10 seconds of research to realize is a waste of money this is the only way to get rich in 2022 without sliding up a business from scratch for every person that you refer to any Italian University you get 15 pounds now I confronted them about this claim and here's what they said it is an affiliate program where a person has commissioned for sales no I think saying that this is the only way you're going to get rich is wrong people don't get rich on affiliate programs people it's not the only you say I found the only way to get rich no knowledge the only way that works as well but that's the thing because you're selling a crypto now so you're buying your crypto isn't a way to get rich no our affiliate marketing program is designed it's a simple product Oh great another affiliate scheme like Tate let me guess it's not a get rich quick scheme it's not a get rich quick scheme all right so we have that in the background now the last guy we need to talk about is a YouTuber named money kicks Who's involved he has three million subscribers and it seems to me like he's mostly famous for being a billionaire son and doing billionaire Sun things apparently he has allegedly bought 50 of This Disaster for 11 million dollars now I couldn't confirm this myself but he does seem very affiliated with the project sitting next to speed basically during the entire ad and my favorite moment with money kicks is just when he tries to relate to somebody who's explaining how he grew up poor and eventually became Rich we grew up very humble in the sense where my dad was a taxi driver worked all his life in Honduras we started doing a bit of businesses life is step by step you know 100 100 wait how's money kicks talking about life is step by step what was your step one being the son of a billionaire what what was your step two like at that point are you is he just talking to people like hey have you tried step one yet now uh this is the whole crew basically behind Paradox and and I hope I've done a fair job of explaining it obviously the project itself is a bit of a paradox to me I mean it looks like they are kind of putting real money behind this they're investing in all these high profile streamers but it's just all done in such a scammy way why would anyone want a part of this I mean I know I wouldn't want seven ways to join a Ponzi scheme so that's just what it sounds like to me um and apparently to a lot of children and teenagers so I think it's probably gonna flop but now that you understand what Paradox is it's time to go back to I show speed trying to keep his chat from figuring out what's going on all right so look it's cool now relax roulette relax uh why wasn't the chat the microphone I know I don't know you know what I'm doing bro bro yeah I think it's a little too late for that the only way to make this more obvious is if he changed his name to I show scams now I do have an update here because speed has responded saying he's not a scammer and regrets his mistake stop spinning I'm not a scammer bro why did he say his I'm not a scammer dog I made a little mistake you know that I wish I never did but I'm not a scammer bro now what exactly you make of this is up to you I think he's pretty young like 17 years old I think hopefully he's going to learn from this and is going to learn that you don't have to sell out your audience for money um as for the Paradox Founders I think they're still baffled that anyone's mad at them at all because they think there's no reason to apologize at all according to them the claims of L scam in this chat were just Bots anyways that's weekly that's what you mean so y'all are saying humans can bot now so yeah this whole thing went on for hours and I'll link the full VOD below confronting them if you're bored you can give it a watch it's pretty funny anyways that's basically it
