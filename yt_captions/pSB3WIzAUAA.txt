ladies and gentlemen this may be the last video I record about chess games ever again in my life I saw something today that was so sickening and so vile that it made me want to uproot everything it made me want to walk away it made me want to reinvent myself as an individual and I'm going to share this with all of you and I would like for you to try to pick me up you know when you have a friend who's down you talk to them you try to make them feel better we don't know each other on that level but I do read the comments and I want you to tell me your journey in chess over the last few years I want you to share with me some positive words of encouragement because what I'm about to show you is going to absolutely ruin your day make no mistake you are going to life hysterically while this is happening but this is evil what I'm going to show you is vile it is sickening it is disgusting and I have been sitting here thinking of what to name today's video I don't know if I have it within me to keep going but I am going to do my best our protagonists are should I retire playing from the United States of America a nameless player with the white pieces and Matthias Matthias submitted this game on a subreddit that I saw and this is the one of the most this this is the most disgusting conclusion to a chess game I have ever witnessed and I have witnessed some million chess games probably or played sit back relax my friends please do me a favor watch this video in its entirety you will not be able to anticipate what is going to happen get the hands off the controls take your hands off the keyboard put the smart TV remote down have a little bit of patience you must witness this first hand and experience the emotions and pain that I felt when I was watching this game Matthias starts the game E4 E5 his opponent plays Pawn to D4 this is a five minute game with five second bonus time which in many cases can go even slower than a 10 minute rapid game this is the Danish Gambit black responds with Pawn takes D4 and the idea of white is to give upon as follows to open up very quick development possibilities many people when facing this opening will simply capture the pawn on C3 and that is exactly what our protagonist does here with the black pieces there are other moves like D5 like Knight F6 like Queen E7 actually is a critical move but when you're just first starting out and your opponent offers you two Central pawns it's generally a good idea to capture on C3 and now white plays Knight F3 which is clearly some form of preparation because white is not stupid Knight C3 and bc3 are both very easily available white does this so that after C takes B2 Bishop takes B2 there are some very meaningful pressure on the black position well Matthias captures the pawn on B2 there is nothing wrong with this move you are allowed to capture free Pawns in the opening against gambits so long as you then wear the seat belt on the roller coaster that follows so it's the fifth move of the game black is down two pawns but white has very powerful development already very powerful opportunities to open up attacks on the black position the onus is now on black to play defense in a sufficient way to deal with the situation that you have developed for yourself and black does the most important thing which is Knight to F6 now if I'm playing with white here I'd like to go attack as fast as possible I'd like to go attack as fast as possible black can go wrong very quickly your knight can get kicked around multiple times white can activate the Bishops and this is just kind of a migraine of a position for black to play through but white doesn't play E5 and white does not play in any sort of Gambit style white plays Queen C2 which is a nothing move I mean queen C2 is just it's just not a good move and if you're playing now with black you should very quickly speed up your own development and Castle your king because then not only did you get to rob the bank you also got a uber black to go to the airport and fly away Uber black is a luxury car service I don't know how big it is in other parts of the world some of y'all have banned Uber which you know I I appreciate we'll never do that here in America because capitalism uh but uh Knight C6 Knight C6 is a very reasonable move again white should consider attacking with E5 white plays Bishop C4 which I don't hate at all because you are developing pieces and now black responds D6 D6 is not a good move it is not a good move but I told you the the conclusion to this game is what's going to make you sick before the conclusion you're actually going to learn a few things all right so that's why I wanted you to to watch for a little bit also do tell me some positive words of encouragement in the comments because if you don't I this really might be it folks I I I I okay I'm not gonna spoil anything um black should play check and castle like black needs to speed up the development or attack in the center D5 is not the D6 is not terrible but now this comes in and Matthias is under some very very very serious pressure uh he is now nearly losing he needs to play D5 to block out the bishop he plays Knight E5 which is a which is a losing move it's a losing move because white can simply take and then take again and and and not even with the Knight white can actually Force the king out and then get in there with the queen a little bit later and and it's game over uh Knight E5 is played and white plays defensively white plays Bishop B3 which I just don't I just don't understand this because if you're gonna play a turbocharged opening like if you're you know if you're gonna buy a car with 400 horsepower and you're gonna drive it at like five kilometers an hour to the local park or Supermarket I don't understand why you bought that car and didn't just keep to the bicycle but again if you're gonna play an opening with it with a ridiculous engine like this like you you know you gotta cash in when the opportunity presents itself because right now you're just going backwards and now Matthias plays Queen E7 and he's kind of more or less defended himself and now he kicks out the night Matthias is in great shape now if white plays Knight to F3 black has a very simple job take Play Bishop H3 maybe go for an attack of your own so life is good in fact it's so good that white panics and plays this light is just losing just Knight takes F7 black is just up a full piece the opening is a complete disaster for the white side now all Matthias has to do is develop a couple of pieces and Castle he's up a piece and a couple of Pawns or one Pawn bike plays the move rookie one that that move does nothing you're up material right trade the pieces trade the pieces your position is so good you don't even care if you lose a pawn bishop B7 in Castle castling the king should be the objective two most important ways to decide who has a better position chess material and King safety your opponent's gonna meme around too hard and accidentally lose their Bishop too Bishop E6 you should be looking to exchange what blacks should not be doing in this position is trying to open up the center of the board because their king and queen are still there and that is exactly what he does he plays the move D5 D5 doesn't blunder e takes D5 because that's made that was matthias's idea it's actually a decent idea but it's a very one-dimensional idea he played D5 hoping for E takes D5 and simply taking on E1 but his opponent now can just play like a night move and it's only trouble you don't want to open up the center when your queen and king are there now some of you watching this right now might have been very annoyed that I'm going to show you this entire game after showing you such a very dramatic introduction but my friends I I told you in the beginning please just trust me it's so easy to click ahead and Skip and this and that you don't want to miss this you don't want to miss the story when you go to a movie theater when you watch a movie on on a streaming service you don't try to jump ahead you want to watch the whole movie right I just saw bullet train on Netflix highly recommended by the way my wife uh picked out that movie hilarious movie E5 Knight E4 and now Bishop takes D5 and now Matthias is gonna suffer my friends because matthias's King is stuck in the center of the board and he puts his night out here and he just forgets about it like he should go here he should go here he should go here instead Matthias just the the bishop just took the pawn Matthias attacks the bishop and it could just go here I don't know what he was thinking I don't know what he was thinking but Bishop F7 is played and then Queen E4 now we got ourselves a game my friends the bishop develops great move from Matthias and he decides he's not going to develop in Castle short he's just gonna cast along that's a very bold decision personally I think it's better to Castle this way and the reason is the king is much safer when you Castle on opposite sides you really really like to go on the roller coaster like you want to go right back and in this position castling Queen side is the equivalent of going on the roller coaster vomiting a lot and then just going right back on the roller coaster like this is very aggressive stuff but I don't hate it all right buckle up because uh it's about to get crazy so white now should move the Rook over here should move the Knight over you know over in this area and should play a4a5a6 or queen A4 targeting the pawn white plays Rook D1 it's not a terrible move not a terrible move now what I if I'm playing with black here I want to put my Bishop to line up this so I want to put my Bishop to line up with the pawn I want to put my Rook on the f file that's the way I'm thinking of attacking here what I don't want to do is just wander off to the side of the board to take a pawn just because it's capturable and that's exactly what black does that's not a good move it's not a good move because the quality of the pawn is terrible okay it like it's very unpredictable whether or not this is going to kill you the best example that I can give is imagine you get up from your seat after watching this video and writing your positive comment and then you go to the forest and there's a mushroom on the ground you don't know anything about mushrooms but you look at it and you go well I've eaten mushrooms before so I'm gonna eat this mushroom there's a chance the mushroom kills you okay that's what this is there's a chance it doesn't but there's a chance it does so I would not eat that random Mushroom on the ground I would try to get a little bit more information about it and make an educated decision and I'm not really sure that opening up the a file there for the opponent is the is the best decision but okay Matthias does it because Matthias does what he wants all right Queen G4 check Bishop E6 and now white trades the Rooks now my friends if we do a little bit of simple mathematics here black has more pawns not only does black have more pawns than white black has three on zero so in every single end game black is completely winning and I am saying that without any sort of exaggeration black is completely winning in every single end game except maybe a queen end game because in a queen end game your king safety is actually quite valuable you can't just go pushing your pawns by the way in about five days from recording this video on June 11 2023 I am putting out my middle games master class course so if you ever wanted to Skyrocket your ability and end games and you know you you should check it out and and speaking of which right right now yeah black is completely winning uh this is over uh it's over because you just gotta activate your bishop and bring your Rook trade the rugs trade a bit and just go just go don't hate this move you kind of walked into a fork but nicely done rookie one gets the bishop out of the way and just push the pawns it's over the advantage is the biggest it's been you play A5 that's a massive warning shot you got this four coming if the if they're not careful that's it Play Bishop C6 put the Rook back and just go they can't stop you they just can't stop you there is absolutely nothing that white can do white can stop one Pawn white could even buy a miracle of God stop too you can't stop three connected past pawns on an even board it's just not possible I don't like G5 because you're playing on the wrong side of the board you're not stronger there there's nothing there for you you have to know how to play on the right side of the board and after King C6 you actually lose one of your pawns you are still winning it's less of an advantage but you're still winning because you have A5 B5 and and the like and this is still a winning end game because of the nature of the connected past pawns the longer that this end game goes the higher your advantage will balloon you will play Bishop E6 and then you'll play A4 and this is a completely winning end game but that doesn't happen here white plays Rook A4 black can play King C5 King B is me King B5 Pawn to B6 then King C5 you obviously shouldn't give away a rook but black is running a little bit low on time I mean King B5 is the top computer move so I don't hate it at all this is excellent Bishop C6 there's also one little trap here which is rookie five the bishop now no longer hits the rook and if Rook takes Bishop there is rookie one that's a nice little spotting of a tactic but okay we don't see it uh again you gotta move the pawns I don't care about this you gotta go A4 you gotta go B5 later Rook d8 Rook D2 H5 is played fine E6 A4 beautiful stuff there we go nice and focused okay I don't really know what Rook C8 does but maybe you got ideas of background check made the bishop slides out of the way there's no back rank Checkmate and now my friends Rook D5 check is played and because black has 13 seconds on the clock black panics and plays Rook C5 and as you can see that just simply loses a rook it not only does it lose a rook it it really loses the game black has 17 seconds on the clock if you were listening I told you that in the beginning of this game uh five seconds side get a bonus per side because it's five minute with five second bonus uh White pushes the pawn now one score away from promotion and now white is going to demonstrate some form of a winning technique now you've watched enough of my videos that you know that there is a plot twist coming you are not wrong there is absolutely a plot twist coming what kind of a movie would it be what kind of an intro would I have given if there is no plot twist coming but when I tell you that you have absolutely no idea what is about to happen you really don't you have absolutely unless you've seen the game you really really do not know Rook C8 Queen it's over you have seen it all on this YouTube channel you have seen all types of games you have never seen what is about to unfold in front of you I hated this when I saw it I never want to do this again black plays B5 don't resign by the way if you resign in this position I don't know what you're doing do not resign Rook E6 check you have to earn the right to resign in chess you got to get to a certain ELO for that button to even illuminate King A5 the way you win this position with white is you take enough pawns that you can just sneak upon through and make a queen you do this in a way where black constantly has legal moves you want to avoid stalemates so if you need to sacrifice some material to bring the king out into the open you do that b for right now Bishop B4 I don't mind this move at all this is a fantastic move deflecting the king from the defense of the pawn beautiful Rook is cutting everything off there is no stalemate here in a million years you have a dark squared Bishop so make sure the light squares are available and make sure you don't accidentally cover away all the squares Rook G5 Rook H5 and the way you win this is you can put a rook on a square on the same color as your Bishop so you anchor it and it can never be taken you make a queen and you deliver a ladder Checkmate and that is exactly what white did white played rookie five F5 King D7 there is no way to get to the king and that's it beautiful technique by white spectacular could not have done anything better myself but suddenly white got greedy in this position white thought look I have a ladder mate in like eight different ways right ladder Made Simple zig zag boom but my opponent's not resigning and I'm not gonna win on time anytime soon because they get five seconds every time they make a move so I'm gonna BM Bad Manners the players are well within their right to do this when you play a game in chess on chess.com you sign up with an undisclosed social contract to your opponent you are allowed to not resign you are allowed to use the duration of the clock you are allowed to make your opponent Checkmate you and your opponent is allowed to do this now where it gets unethical or you know egregious or disrespectful is this disrespectful by white yes white is not playing in the most optimal way to finish the game but not resigning is not considered unethical it's not considered egregious you absolutely should not resign because your opponent is 800 and your opponent is now going to make three queens this is the position three queens a rook a bishop and a pawn and there are 90 000 different mates into in this position probably all right literally if if you could calculate a program to determine how many mates and two there are from this position with white but it's thousands I would imagine different iterations okay Queen F6 now this is made the the mate mate mate mates there's so many mates right called mate mate so many mates um but Queen G6 again what is happening here is white is playing in the style of Bad Manners right the players are shuffling it's all fun and games this is very funny you haven't earned the right to disrespect people like this you are 800 do not disrespect people like this you got 9 000 mates in One in this position Queen D2 Queen D2 is a pretty crazy move and this is actually the beginning of the memes black now has no legal King moves so black plays A3 and if white takes this it's a draw it's actually a stalemate look at the eval it's a stalemate I think white knows that though and white can still give a mate white still can give mates all over the place but white plays Bishop C3 white allows A2 White's really playing with fire here that's mate that's mate all of these different moves are made that's mate that's mate white doesn't want it in this position white plays Queen to D4 and allows a queen White's really playing a little bit with fire here because you know what's gonna happen in this position white is going to screw this up what white failed to realize in their bad mannering is that this is stalemate and now you have a situation known as crazy Queen the queen can now sacrifice herself with check and this is the way that white was punished for this game I told you in the very beginning of this video this is making me sick this is vile this is disgusting this is evil this is terrible sportsmanship horrible now black just has to sack the queen in a way that white cannot capture it if white is able to take the queen with one of the Queens it's no longer a stalemate so that's what white does white plays Queen D2 check and it I mean it yeah it's looking like it's supposed to be but white just hasn't there's just checks now black black just gives checks getting back to D3 it's a draw again I can't believe this this is absolutely ridiculous Behavior by white and white fully deserves the karma that they received for this game Queen to D2 check Queen to F4 check white is panicking they've dug this hole for them and now they're losing a queen they can't even take it back they can't even take it back white runs black gives another check white runs black gives another check white blocks oh now white is getting somewhere all right white white finally figured it out because now any check you can just run your king and it's no longer going to be a stalemate and that's exactly what white does in this position White NOW realizes they can run the king so they do and they get checkmated in one move on B7 white lost up three queens a rook and a bishop you thought there was gonna be a stalemate you thought there was going to be something like that that is not what you saw coming this is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen occur on a chessboard from this position from this position black one I'm done I am done with games I am done with chess I am finished tell me some nice things in the comments for why I should stick around because this this ain't it this ain't it now get out of here
