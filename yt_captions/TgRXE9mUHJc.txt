the building permit for my new house is finally in which means they're plumbing the in-floor heating they're ripping down the walls they're wiring up the networking and it's time to show you guys our genius plan for stashing the gaming computers here in the rack in the basement while being able to use them one floor above with zero additional latency zero performance hit and zero compromises and sponsored by sea sonic i get to finally one long year after the release of the rtx 30 series go from an rtx 20 series to a 30 90 graphics and it was going to run so well hey shut up it's a cool game for cool people and of course it's going to be running on this prime tx 1080 plus titanium power supply from seasonic with a fully modular interface 12 year warranty and of course that legendary seasonic quiet and quality [Music] the rumor in right now is the office and the idea is that evonne's desk is going to go over here with her own hole down to the mechanical room and then i'm probably going to be either here or here depending on whatever looks nicer as a backdrop for streaming realistically and because we're directly above the mechanical room theoretically all we have to do is grab a drill go down through the floor then we run optical thunderbolt hdmi displayport usb whatever we want so right there is fine perfect and just go for it you go for it oh my god i have a brand new set of bibs did i get all the way through yeah but you're on the wrong side of a truss oh no you have to move like to the right a few feet if you can a few feet ah you're through hello how you doing buddy hey here's some sawdust ah okay why don't we upgrade the computer now yeah turning our attention to the gaming rig amd still hasn't released their 5000 series thread rippers so i'm going to be sticking with my 3960x24 core if i wanted the absolute best in terms of gaming performance i could go alder lake but i'd be giving up a lot of cpu cores and actually a lot of pci express connectivity which as you can see i am using i've got this crazy quadruple m.2 8 terabyte ssd down here i've also got 10 gig networking as well as this right here is really important this is my thunderbolt card and that's what i'm able to use to carry displayport signals as well as usb for all of my peripherals and all that good stuff up through the floor with an optical cable from corning which hopefully ah yes there we go oh wow we brought one of the big kahuna 50 meters i brought two just to make sure it'll reach right yeah nice first we got to get this water out of the way so we're going to go ahead and crack open the reservoir and hope that it all squirts out in approximately the right direction is that how you usually drain it um no into a tim horton's cup no no not at all i just i found it here oh this is the canadian way to drain him and drain a water cooling loop we're not not sponsored ah there it goes see that's better right how to drain your water cooling lube tips with line of sebastian okay we're just gonna put both of those in there hey how about that yeah you want to support it with your head oh yeah i got it okay so i can just let go now now that's using the old noggin you know what i'm saying you got to get as much microbes in there as possible right oh it's overflowing it's overflowing oh no the socks and sandals they failed him do you want to see your new graphics card you'll never guess where i got this from i'm guessing asus no no really no i stole it from somebody stole it from somebody i mean i replaced it with the 3090 but i got this specific one from something you got a baller you got the one with the back plate and everything yeah it's from the lounge pc so we have a strix one that's water blocked but it's like this tall and i wasn't sure how that would work with this yeah probably so i got the standard height this is an evga xc3 card with the ek water block and the active backplate so pretty sick setup actually dang this is about as good as it gets so what do you want to do i brought the optical thunderbolt cable we could just do that okay and i also have the icron docks with like some regular fiber these are super cool they're from icron they're usb 3 fiber optic converters you could kind of think of them as their big claim to fame is that they can do usb 1 usb 2 and usb 3 over a single fiber optic cable over pretty much any practical distance you would ever want within a home and the reason that i added these to our setups was that thunderbolt was being kind of flaky for me before but long story short thunderbolt's actually been flawless for me for quite an extended period of time now so i'm not sure if it matters the one problem we had recently was my son accidentally unplugging yvonne's thunderbolt oh no and me spending like four hours diagnosing it you know reinstalling drivers and swapping out cables and doing all this stuff because i thought it was unfathomable that it was just on plus it's always interesting looking at the kind of condition your water blocks are in when they come out you can really see some of the erosion of the nickel plating here that's pretty normal this is where the water is going to be highest velocity going through the block through these little micro channels here and you can see a little bit more of it kind of around the edges of the main channels the big thing with these blocks these are corsair's first generation xc what are they seven or something like that xg something anyway the point is there was a bit of a controversy around the way that this top piece was attached with these two screws and it causing leaks i didn't have any i definitely noticed you know when you're installing it there's a little more wiggle wobble than i would have liked but i clearly didn't have any leakage issues with it whatsoever so take that for what it is oh we really need to get that power supply out of there sponsored by season right uh jake the cable's the same i think these cables might be identical they're not are you sure yep oh all right i guess you're going back to black cables right black kids all right what i said black cables are all right no but they're not oh they're not there's line wow i found a cable mod makes a oh geez this is really kind of anticlimactic oh oh my god how many layers are there look at that blue and black oh okay that's like basically exactly what i had yeah oh nice all right only three of these screw holes fit long story we had a small oversight in the design of this custom chassis i've been asked a lot of times to release the cad files for this and the reason we haven't done it is not because we're trying to hoard it or anything like that it's just not acceptable like i couldn't release something in good conscience knowing that you are gonna have to figure out how to attach these tubes like i did i would never even consider re-plumbing those rads again jake what we've got a bit of a problem here but remember how i said i'm never taking these rads out where does that cable go it's for the fans they need to run oh jeez wait where's it what i think oh oh we can totally get at that maybe we can totally get at it maybe can we check if these ones are the same how are we going to do that well we just have to look up the pin out so far left to that one yes next one they're not the same okay seda confirmed not the same oh i really hope these molexes are the same and they are not the same jake can we re-pin it different maybe oh we totally can't to be clear ladies and gentlemen i would never recommend doing this unless you absolutely know what you're doing because if you hook the wrong modular cable up to your power supply you can destroy the hardware on the other end of that cable here's how this little guy works you want to pop the cable as far this way as you possibly can okay then this guy goes in on either side of the internal like uh pin thing there now it's in the right spot oh no this is a custom length cable it's not even going to reach the power supply which is much shorter i don't think there's any getting around this it's got to come out shoot come on i just need to apply a bit more pressure done yet re-pinning didn't work what because the stock cables aren't long enough because the new power supply is way shorter oh no no we're good but you got the front one in yeah i got the front one in whew can we do a high five i feel like that's a high five worthy thank you yeah there you go uh i need and we do i need the other molex uh oh from the other the other cable i don't know if there's one in this kit now it's time to figure out what's going to happen when we plug in this gpu here so we're going to try and do one bend here and get straight to here oh my goodness this is going to be hard this is not gonna be easy that's for sure maybe uh i think you need more angle than that this is definitely the dirty way to do this this is not recommended right now bob and rod are rolling over and they're not graves right i know right just don't cut it too short whatever you do holy crap this might work did you account for how much it goes into the fitting yeah yeah wow that's actually like freaking bang on jake like it's parallel coming out of the cpu block which is way more than i expected dang in summary here's what's going on we got this perfect bend and unfortunately the way that this terminal is configured out of the box it assumes that your inlet is going to be at the top but our inlet is not at the top we need to go out of the graphics card into the inlet of the cpu so that means we need to flip the terminal around at least that's what we think looking at pictures of the plexi version of this block online we can't see inside this one because it's the delrin version i'm pretty sure it's right okay everything is awesome if you drop this i quit oh it's gross oh it's the worst oh my god it's the worst that might not actually work it'll work it'll be ugly oh it's the worst oh no no this is why i wanted to bend at the other end because at least then we can take another crack at it no we've got another crack we've got another crack at this okay okay we're trying again can i turn up this heat gun or something don't worry it's not going to happen again except when it happens again no it's not going to use the jig this time please i don't need the jig it's not going to be worse than what you just did the angle is not the problem it's the radius that's the problem okay i'll use the jig bring me the jig oh did you get scared all of a sudden yeah i'm scared okay what was that yeah is that beautiful did it work did the jig do its job ish the jig might have done that's just hot the heat gun is hot did you know that's not bad not bad actually that's way better yeah anything's better than what we just did before this and we're sharing we we're sharing the credit 100 of everything no no no what's the credit share do not accept that 70 30. i'll take 80. okay well i want 20 of a 30 90 then 20 hey that's actually a thing so we got a video coming up showing you guys how you can actually share a gpu with your friends online that's right you can pull together by one gpu and split it and it works for 30 series now it does yeah oh wow not bad i think it's actually bang on bang on for mediocre i didn't say well perfect okay i kind of implies that it's perfect but it's good enough well i'm getting close up oh don't get close up sandy look it doesn't look worse yeah and i mean that's not saying a lot but hey it doesn't look this build was that power supply looks way better though yeah check out season yeah see sonic thanks for sponsoring the video guys here we go rtx 3090 boys this is gonna be awesome you can get so much ammo in there beautiful oh yeah oh that looks sexy in there hold on you got the technique i got the technique hold on look at how good this technique is guys so close there we go sorry let me try this technique here you ready look you better not move it stop don't ruin it this cable is so tangled so i'm just gonna have to pull the reel like over here it's gonna have to sit on the desk ah it works [Music] linus what it works oh geez it sounded like you were gonna say it didn't it works now the way this setup is supposed to work basically there's a 40 gigabit thunderbolt connection between our computer and that dock now that's going to provide our display connection it's going to provide usb i think you can get like sd audio ethernet lots of stuff all through that one connection and then it gets broken out at the dock and we can plug all our devices in in the long run like we mentioned before we're probably gonna switch this out to an optical displayport and optical usb but for some people this can be a pretty sleek and easy solution especially if you have like a laptop or something all right play settings it looks like 4k and it looks like 60. yeah it definitely does man this is gonna be awesome gonna have my stream camera here gonna have my lights might like wall mount the lights yeah you totally should be pretty sick you can even get some better lights well you should keep the settings where they're at right now just so you have your own reference yeah i'm gonna be honest with you this game is just not that well optimized like it runs great on like integrated graphics but then there's no matter how high you go there's a hard peak there's a ceiling there's a ceiling there's only so much you can get out of it so you got your your green farming over here and you got your industrial zone over here with your window makers and your sewing machine factory and you gotta you gotta import engineer you gotta import your coffee from the new world here okay so you make a coffee island it's super detailed especially when you have high-end hardware does it feel like it's running better oh it's definitely running better absolutely yeah because like especially when you're on high-end hardware and you set it so there's like the streets are all populated all these people are actually going somewhere like if you follow them they will actually legitimately go somewhere and i played a lot of tropico right yeah okay this seems like it's a pretty similar game yep and like your industrial stuff like little carts will actually carry cotton from your cotton fields too wow that's that's cotton stuff yeah wow they'll go do their little things so this guy's holy crap unloading stuff that's like crazy detailed oh maybe i'll have to get a 30 90. yeah can we just talk about the fact that this computer is downstairs i know right so there it'll be completely silent it'll kick no heat into this room so it'll be super easy for the ac to control the climate in this room freaking awesome this is gonna be so sick this is way sicker than what you have right now oh yeah 100 like being on a completely separate floor just totally isolated i love it what we're going to do now say thanks seasonic for sponsoring this video their prime titanium power supplies are obviously 80 plus titanium efficient and have tons of other great features like modular interfaces super quiet fans the ability to turn off the fan when it's not under heavy load in fact that fan is not even running in spite of the fact that did we leave the game on upstairs i think so that's pretty freaking impressive so you guys can check them out at the link in the video description if you guys are looking for another video to watch maybe check out the one where we installed the rack installed the rack yeah the pink rack there were shenanigans for sure
