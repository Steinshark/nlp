hey what's up mkbhd here and these are samsung's new 2022 flagship smartphones and i'm saying it's these and not the ultra just because these will probably sell more volume and these are the phones more people will experience and i do have some thoughts for my first hands-on with them so the running theme i think you'll notice here is uh if it ain't broke don't fix it so they didn't they really did not change a whole lot about these there's a lot that's similar they played it safe but one of the biggest differences one of the most noticeable differences to me when i actually got to hold it and feel it in the hand is something that most people who buy it probably won't care about that much because everyone puts a case on their phone and that's the build quality so i have a video on the s22 ultra dropping at the exact same time as this one it'll be linked below if you want to watch that it's basically a galaxy note but these phones are a small update in every department from the s21 series across the board and like i said holding it in the hand for the first time the first thing i noticed is it's a bit more boxy a little more square on the sides a little more flat on the top and the bottom and just slightly tighter corner radii all the way around and the display is already flat on the front so it just feels a bit sharper overall and then on top of that the back is real glass this year instead of plastic like the s21 again not a huge deal for most people just putting a case on their phone but that is a step up in my opinion from the s21 and the s21 fv and it adds a little bit of weight too it's some density some heft to the feel of the phone everything else on the outside though mostly the same design same center camera cut out that i like so much same speaker and button placement same fingerprint reader placement still ip68 rated and at the front you're looking at essentially the same display as last year but slightly better and slightly smaller so still two different sizes of course the s22 plus is 6.6 inches and this might sound weird to say but because of how small the bezels are the s22 at 6.1 inches feels kind of compact now i'm doing air quotes like this isn't this clearly isn't a small phone but the new boxer shape and just the way it feels with the smaller bezels and the tighter corners it's it has a nice density to it just feels like a good compact sort of phone the update with this display though is it is now a much more variable refresh rate than last year so instead of just being 60 or 120 hertz this goes from 10 all the way up to 120 hertz now interestingly i'm told from samsung it is still not ltpo that's for the s22 ultra only so we'll see if this new display is a more efficient or not this is of course just the first look though it's not the full review so we'll have to see if that pans out as i actually get to use the phone by the way if you enjoy these quick first looks these short first impressions videos then

factors with a spec bump so the new specs are a snapdragon 8 gen 1 or a new 4 nanometer exynos chip in some regions and all specs have eight gigs of ram with either 128 or 256 gigs of storage again that's it and then the new cameras are also a spec bump there's a new triple camera layout 50 megapixel main camera that's probably binning to 12 and a half megapixels then an ultra wide and a 3x telephoto camera the big change is that the high resolution camera is the main camera not the telephoto so you might remember last year when shooting 8k video you had to crop into the telephoto this time for shooting 8k video it can use the main camera which is going to have that wider normal field of view smaller detail for some but that's a big improvement for me then the other one thing to note is since the phones did get a bit smaller the batteries also did get smaller from last year the plus goes from 4 800 to 4 500 milliamp hours and the s22 goes from 4 000 to 3 700 milliamp hours that's really interesting i mean the camera bumps aren't noticeably bigger i don't know if the glass is much thicker than the plastic used to be so i'm not really sure of the reason but whatever it is you know an eight percent smaller battery something like that is something to keep an eye on for sure even if the display is a bit more efficient we'll have to test that but that's it as far as spec upgrades from last year like i said not a super long list but if you're interested in these phones which you really want to know is the difference between the s22 and s22 plus so here is the entire official list first of all they're different size phones so the same resolution display 1080p but of course a 6.6 inch larger one on the s22 plus and then the plus supports a faster 45 watt charging while the s22 only supports 25 watts no charger in the box for either of them but that's good to know and the plus has ultra wide band and wi-fi 6e support while the s22 doesn't just has normal wi-fi 6 and then larger battery in the bigger phone 4 500 milliamp hours over 3700 s22 plus 999 s22 7.99 so yeah let me know what you want to see in a full review of these phones once i actually get more than an hour to play with them i think one ui 4.1 is one of the interesting things about this phone obviously i saw there's a new messages app a default that appears to look just like the google messages app i want to look more into that but if you have questions about the battery life that could be concerned the displays let me know in the comments section i'll hang out there that'll inform the full review get subscribed to see it make sure you hit that red button if you haven't already alright that's it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music]
