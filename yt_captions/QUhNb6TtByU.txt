how do you define hate well you just said you allow the purported target of the hate to Define it and what they do is they say that they feel hated so it's a second order form of evidence the primary evidence in principle is their subjective emotion but you don't have access to that so you have to accept their record of their subjective emotion and you accept that in a manner that isn't questionable there's no higher authority than than their say so and the problem with that it's this it's a variant of the problem with the informants is that that only works well it would never work let's get that clear yeah but that only works in the ideal situation where people have perfect understanding of the motivation of others which they don't and also they're not lying the problem with that definition of subjective harm is it lays the gates wide open to the melians and the Psychopaths yes yes and and and you're also touching on two other important things right so number one unlike most criminal offenses which require intent of some kind the intent is not on whether the speaker meant to be hateful yeah it's not intent is not relevant right that's terrifying and also the other thing that's not relevant is truth if you speak a true fact that is interpreted as a hateful fact and has its effect on somebody well that's not going to be a defense either right right so you aren't essentially one of the effects of this kind of legislation is to say you are not allowed to speak the truth right because that truth regardless of intent regardless of intent regardless of intent and regardless of historical fact yeah we we are we are outlawing an effect yeah right right right absolutely okay and to expand that even even further uh with comedy it's interesting because of course Scotland where some of the most ridiculous legislation is being passed is the place which hosts the biggest arts and Comedy Festival in the world The edra Fringe right um and uh to your point about truth well you don't even have to be saying something true at this point now they've passed the bill which means that comedians could be investigated for jokes they make now that is a level of Detachment from Context and reality that is even a level above simply or someone made a true comment what if I said something sarcastically on stage as a comedian and what's interesting is comedy seems to be being very particularly targeted but nobody goes to McBeth at the theater and says oh I went to the theater and then this guy went crazy and stabbed his friend no no one says that but with comedy for some reason the character on stage is increasingly being perceived as having the opinions that he's jokingly saying um and so that that's another level so what right there's no distinction between the role and the actor quite and and what what's interesting if you abstract even further from that if you've watched Game of Thrones the the scene where you really truly discover that King Joffrey's gone mad is when he cuts off the tongue of the jester in his court and this is this symbolism is it's perfect it's been used throughout history to portray uh the final conversion into tyranny of of a of a ruler that's how that's why there was gestures is like that was one of the ways everybody could tell he was that the the king wasn't a tyrant right is that he could tolerate his own gesture is fool or welcome him or find him amusing that would be best and this is something that happened when Vladimir Putin first came to power in Russia under Boris yelson there was a kind of liberalization there was an opening up of because in the Soviet Union you didn't make fun of the political leaders nothing was funny in this that was true the jokes that people told at the kitchen table were funny but not in public of course um but under Boris hson there was an opening up and we had this amazing TV show which was the equivalent of the British spitting image I don't know if you had similar thing did you have spit no no I know of it though yeah and it was basically puppets portraying the different political characters and and the first thing Vladimir Putin did when he came to power was to shut that down so historically throughout literature and other things if you if you're looking for symptoms of tyranny the shutting down of jokes and humor is isans are canaries in The coine Comedians and Automobiles as far as I'm concerned yeah yeah well they're they're so emblematic of personal autonomy every Tyrant hates the automobile so even though they all want to have one okay so let's delve into the hate issue a bit more too because in Canada we have protected categories of hate right so you it's a hate crime if it's I want to make sure I've got this definition right it's a hate crime if it can be shown if your utterance can be shown to be discriminate discriminate against a protected class well yes so so so it's not merely that you hurt people's feelings right it's it's that corre they have to hurt them for a particular reason well it's a discriminatory ter so so we have these two Realms we have the the human rights realm and we have the criminal realm and we we've had hate speech restrictions in our criminal law for a good while and they're rarely used um the the the human rights Provisions are much more frequently used because because they're much less serious and much easier to trigger much easier to complain about and and they don't go to a court they go to one of these tribunals right but we one of the problems is the dovetailing of this hate speech discriminatory practice idea along with the the equality problem that I was just describing before right so as with any rule this rule is going to be applied and interpreted in One Direction and not the other what I mean by that is if you go around saying that um white people are are are hateful or privileged or colonists or whatever the case may be that that's pretty hateful if you say that're all that you know if you're white you are X you're being stereotypical and you're making a blanket statement about all these people who are white that's not going to be entertained as hate speech because of the way that our equality law has been interpreted which is and this is one thing that the Ontario Human Rights tribunal said fairly recently they said people who are white cannot be discriminated against yeah yeah I really but you're not a protected group they are not a protected group some some animals are more equal than others exactly so so so this this kind of law the hate speech law is likely to be interpreted in that way which is oh you can only utter hate speech against protected groups if you if you utter hate speech against those other people who are not in one of those there's no hate speech against the oppressor classes it doesn't qualify and by the way this isn't Theory no this is so in in Scotland for example they passed this bill on the 1st of April of course they did recently uh and uh in the first week of it being passed there were more reports of hate speech than there had been in the previous several years and the reason was that many many people reported a speech given by ham yusf the first minister of Scotland in which he was being openly racist against white people right um and of course this is this isn't considered a hate crime and you know it was the BBC interviewed Hamza YF where they the interviewer and the he himself laughed sort of you know almost gratuitously oh how how silly uh you know people would s of course this is complete nonsense and frankly he said I'm not aware of anyone who's not on the far right who would report this as hate speech right it's an absolute case of some animals more equal than others and the law is I'm sure you would agree written specifically to create that situation absolutely
