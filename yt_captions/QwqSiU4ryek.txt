luna crashed and burned 32 billion dollars but the question is now what what is the fallout from all that today we're going to find out we're gonna talk about what happened to dokuan where all that bitcoin they owned went and i'm gonna finally answer the question is luna coming back no sorry that's the answer no no no stop dumping money into this piece of trash panties uh sorry about that guys uh still a little salty about this one anyways let's jump into luna armageddon uh we have uh sort of a something called a protocol armageddon at the company so what protocol armageddon is that's a kill switch so whenever we feel like we're no longer in a position to be able to best serve the community we pulled the trigger and 24 hours were gone we burn all of our assets we we caught all of our ties and it's nothing hey you probably thought i was clickbaiting you with this title didn't you be honest all right no actually the founder of luna literally said he had an armageddon protocol this guy knew this ship was going down he planned for it he bragged about those plans and as more and more clips are just coming out it turns out the warning signs have sort of always been there people just ignored it because they were making money and that in of itself should scare you because it might remind you of something if you're paying attention u-s-t-u-s-t [Music] u-s-t u-s-t all right guys now i feel like the big connect guys so big connect 2.0 that's the luna story and obviously with hindsight bit connect was so clear but watching the luna disaster it's much easier to see why people were fooled and you can see luna influencers still trying to spin it one way or the other oh it crashed because the big banks wanted us to fail or it crashed because of the haters no the founder of luna knew this thing was going to collapse and he said publicly it was destined to go to zero it's a cycle of life you begin from nothing and go back to nothing that's exactly where i want to be so i think pera is going to be the decentralized money standard across the entire blockchain across all the blockchains and i'm excited for care for that so contributes a significant portion of that early vision but eventually to go back to nothing right yeah excited so yeah dokuan is trash and the people defending him are either bag holders or also trash and if you're not convinced at this point that this guy is a grade a scammer i just want to show you his other failed algo stable coin basis cash which he helped create according to coindesk now this is how he talked about his own project back when no one knew he was a part of it quote while defy djinns are busy trapping retail in zero-sum games in basis cash and then another coin called empty set squad now right there take the screenshot upscale it to 4k that's all the proof you need this guy literally called his own project a trap for retail investors and a zero sum game and this is why when do kwan is later going to apologize i have no time for it i'm not interested he wants to save his own skin and it's just it's too little too late now we've already learned a lot about dokuan so now we're going to pivot to talk about luna because since we last reported the lunacoin has kept falling in value it is now worth less than a penny which probably has upset the degenerate gamblers who have predictably been throwing money at it hoping for a thousand x gains by buying at the bottom and like many degenerate gamblers most of these traders don't understand that things can always get worse they also don't understand math many of them because this person says easy 4 million if luna reaches a dollar but because luna has hyper inflated to 6.5 trillion luna compared to only 300 million 10 days ago if luna were to hit one dollar it would be worth five times more than the entire global crypto markets it's not going to happen now on the other hand many luna investors aren't delusional they're just angry so angry in fact that one of them decided to allegedly break into dokwan's house in south korea which obviously is disgusting and i don't endorse a vigilante justice in any of this but what i can endorse and do endorse is a different group of investors who unfriended their buddy after he got them to put their life savings into luna he says quote my friends who i recommended luna to all hate me now which i think is a fair exchange for life savings now in response to this guy losing friends the uk government decided that they were going to finally step in and regulate stable coins actually that's probably not right but uh let's pretend it is for the sake of this segue a treasury spokesman for the queen said in a statement the government has been clear that certain stable coins are not suitable for payment purposes as they share characteristics with unbacked crypto assets clearly targeting the lunacoin here but i think the broader lesson is just that algorithmic stable coins don't work they're like a perpetual energy machine or snl being funny in 2022 it's a nice idea but it just doesn't work in practice but of course that won't stop them from trying and luna and do kwan are busy trying to save themselves in a last-ditch effort this started with dokuan apologizing for quote the pain his invention has brought upon all of you now as i said earlier i think this apology is basically worth as much as luna is right now which is worthless but the real news is what do kwan said next he proposed a recovery plan for the terra ecosystem he calls it the terra ecosystem revival plan 2. now like the rest of dokwan's ideas it's kind of terrible in fact i don't think you could think of a worse proposal basically i'll explain it the idea is to fork the terra block chain into a new chain called terra and they're going to rename the old chain to terra classic what's new well not much it's the same old tara except this time without stable coins which is weird because the whole purpose of terra was stable coins and that's their business model i mean look you don't even have to take my word for it just listen to their first youtube video uh tera is a price stable cryptocurrency that is pegged to uh several of the world's major fiat currencies such as the usd the korean wan the cny the gbp and most notably the imf sdr so the goal is uh to connect all of these stable currencies with the e-commerce and retail payment network such that you can break down the barriers in international commerce i mean that's their whole shtick stable coins tara and their coin luna without stable coins is nonsensical it doesn't even make sense and they say that the reason they're trying to save it is this quote the terra ecosystem and its community are worth preserving terra's app ecosystem contains hundreds of developers terra station has a large install base and although distressed strong brand recognition and a name that almost everyone in the world will have heard about now while it's great and all that everyone's heard of you the reason everyone's heard of you is because you fell apart luna has become the poster child for crypto ponzi's going bust and that's not exactly going to inspire confidence no matter how much you tell yourself all publicity is good publicity as for the developer front the reason so many people wanted to work on terra is because there was so much money coming in billions of dollars in fact developers aren't charity workers they're not going to just stay on a project that's hopelessly lost its way and deviated from its core promise stable coins so forgive me if i'm a little skeptical it's like if theranos said they're ditching the whole blood testing thing to become a steve jobs look-alike merch company it's just not going to work and if i sound like i'm being critical i want to say a lot of other people think this plan is also equally a disaster in fact the ceo of binance tweeted smh and said this won't work forking doesn't give the new fork any value that's wishful thinking and finally he brings up a super important question he says where is all the bitcoin that was supposed to be used as reserves and this is a really important question i mean the whole reason luna was supposed to be unbreakable and you could have confidence in it was this 80 000 bitcoin they bought that they were going to defend the peg with and so later luna foundation guard actually posted that update and they said well they spent it it's gone 80 000 bitcoin down the drain trying to buy ust all in vain now i should say tara was accused of bailing out crypto whales with this money and opposed by the new money review but lfg denies insiders were bought out and since no real proof has come out either way i'm gonna withhold judgment until i get more evidence that's what i said when blackrock and citadel were accused with no evidence and that's what i'm going to say now when luna is accused of market manipulation with frankly not enough evidence we just don't know yet and at the same time it also kind of doesn't matter either way luna doesn't really have any money left and that's why it puts them in a weird position when they claim they want to help small investors and compensate them they say this in a tweet but given that they've spent the vast majority of their money it's a bit like offering someone a ride when you're out of gas still the crypto community is very enthusiastic about a bailout and i have to say i find it kind of ironic people rediscovering why basic financial regulation exists in the first place i mean vitalik the founder of ethereum called for quote coordinated sympathy for the average ust smallholder in the form of a bailout and then he cited american federal fdic insurance as president which is just like this is federally backed programs created by congress like you can't have it both ways you can't be anti-centralization when it suits you and then the moment everything goes south be like yo but that bailout though i mean don't get me wrong i'm very pro crypto regulation but it's just kind of amusing watching people rediscover things that already have existed anyways that's basically what i wanted to talk about pump the stock and thanks for watching
