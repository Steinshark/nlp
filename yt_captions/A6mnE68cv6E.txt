have you guys ever wondered what it takes to be the cinematographer for some of the best documentaries in the world like how does someone go from working in a gear rental house to winning Emmy Awards and dping the oscar-nominated doc cartel land well you're in luck because in this video I'm going to be picking the brain of Matt porwall one of the most talented documentary cinematographers I know and just a super nice guy all around these are just a few of the highlights from a much longer conversation but we get into a whole bunch of stuff here like how Matt got his start and what you can learn from that how he deals with the ups and downs of the freelance film life and some great advice for just how to be an all-round better DP I mean if you asked me to make a list of my top 10 favorite docs cartel land would definitely have a place on there and I got so much out of this as I think you will if you want to see the full unedited conversation that's over an hour long and you weren't able to get in to snag one of the hundred spots in my documentary cinematography course you can put your name on the wait list Link in the description for the next intake and I'll let you know when it opens backup there's interviews with multiple award-winning DPS and directors there and I'll be adding more and more over time but the first session sold out before the pre-order phase was even over so for now your best bet is to get on that wait list but in the meantime let's enjoy these amazing insights from one of the best DPS in the business I know I did foreign and welcome back uh we have a really exciting interview with a really great DP who I've had the pleasure of working with Matt himself is an Emmy Award winner and a Sundance award-winning cinematographer he's based in New York he shot for pretty much all the big people you can imagine he's done uh cartel land which is you know extremely well known um and a ton of other really great projects so Matt thank you so much absolutely thanks for having me I thought we'd just sort of start at the beginning and go a little chronologically how did you get into this sort of Niche position it's funny because I I have always wanted to be a cinematographer um since probably early High School I knew that's what I wanted to do and after I graduated college I moved to New York um and from a some great advice from a cinematographer I had met in college was go work at a rental house not only will that be a great way to learn the equipment that you're gonna have to work with but it's also going to be a great way to meet everybody who's working in that field you're going to meet all the camera assistants that are coming through for prep you're going to meet the cinematographers The Producers the production companies so when I moved to New York I was working at able City you know Abel's one of those shops that especially at that time that was you know 2005 there was a lot of TV and then there was the documentary Productions and when I started looking at the types of people in each one of those Industries and the types of jobs that were being done and honestly the places that people were going I just kept looking at it saying man this documentary thing is pretty fascinating like it was it was a job but it was it seemed more like a part of their everyday life you know they're traveling the world they're coming back with the most incredible stories and so I I very quickly kind of fell into that and it was through that experience that um you know when I left Abel I was able to to kind of call on those producers and and Camera assistants and DPS and say Hey you know keep me in mind you know if you guys have a job and so uh it was through that that I was I started working as a camera assistant I was a camera assistant for about 10 years working um under the the best you know kind of documentary verite cinematographers which to me is kind of the the absolute best way to get into this business because being a cinematographer especially a documentary one is a very difficult thing and a lot of it has absolutely nothing to do with the camera the technology any of that yeah it's how do you come into a scene how do you establish relationships how do you build a story and so you know I do like to tell people that I I know how much you want it but it's okay to it's okay to take your time in developing that career yeah it's true I mean I think every origin story I've heard of involves some level of Lucky break but it's not a repeatable science it's just sort of being prepared for a long enough time and putting yourself in the situation so that when that guy does break his leg you're you're sort of you're sort of there well and I would say that the common denominator of all of those stories is perseverance and patience because without either one of those things the break is never going to happen to you it's going to happen to someone that is looking for it harder or waiting for it longer for me I mean I think I didn't even it didn't feel like a break at the time but um you know the first time that I worked with with Matt heinemann um who I had worked on a lot of films with since then um you know I was a camera assistant Wolfgang held was the cinematographer of a film called escape fire that Matt was directing it was his first his first film and it was through that process that you know I was able to kind of figure out more of what Matt wanted from a visual standpoint as opposed to from kind of a assistant Logistics standpoint and so I was learning that it was after that film that you know he got the article that cartel and was based off and said hey you know read this article what do you think about it you want to go to Arizona with me and so we started kind of the process of of shooting development and making that happen and the next thing I know that now it's you know the two of us are Off to the Races and we're making cartel and it was kind of you know it never looked back from that point forward you know a break came from that that the first feature doc that I ever shot was cartel land that ended up being nominated for an Oscar I mean it was wild that was your that was your first that was my first kind of legitimate feature doc yeah wow so were you were you surprised that must have had a big that must have changed things pretty dramatically no it definitely changed things by the time cartel land started I was already starting to feel the end of what I feel like I could get out of being a camera assistant but then this opportunity came and it was like okay great like now I'm actually without thinking about it was hired for this job and I'm doing it so that became my okay that's it like I'm I'm done I'm not assisting anymore I'm I'm now shooting and it was wild because that film had you know such an incredible ride and after all the dust settled I probably didn't work for eight months or a year after that movie just because it was a combination of making the shift from being an assistant to being a cinematographer from constantly telling people I'm not available because I'm making this film to then it having so much success that everybody assuming that I'm booked and busy you know it so it was one of those things that was interesting but I see you know it's that's that's part of the game that's wild I imagine a lot of people would think that you know with the success that a film like that had that immediately you would just be booked solid on all the most prestigious things right away I know a lot of people watching probably are coming from almost more of a one-man band maybe smaller markets where this whole you know industry with a capital I of the documentary business might might not really exist in the same way how do you think you could position yourself or or start making those kind of contacts or get yourself into that the more professional side of the industry if you were in a a b Market I can tell you that most documentaries that I've worked on have not been shot in big markets they've been shot in very very small towns Across America in the world and so what that means is that the production companies and ourselves have to find who are we going to hire to come in to do sound who's going to shoot second camera who's going to be our camera assistant who are the Pas and we're getting all of that locally so start subbing in for people and and kind of getting into that world and you know I mean there's there are doc filmmakers directors producers everywhere and so get in with them and start doing the same kinds of films locally and not kind of relying on outside projects to to keep you employed and remember too that most of the films that we all think of as being kind of the the biggest memorable films most of those were all made the exact same way of having no distribution trying to raise money going from Grant to Grant to Grant filling in the shoots when you can but all focused on the fact that this is a story that we think is worth telling so yeah I mean I think that's probably really encouraging you're basically saying like you can you can do it anywhere you don't have to move to New York City to have a successful career I I started calling I mean it was a few years in before I started using the word cinematographer and I think a lot of people think of documentaries as you know cinematographers are for Hollywood and videographers shoot documentary right like what what is the is what's the difference to you like when how do you apply that cinematography mindset to documentaries where you don't have big Crews and you can't set up I think it all boils down to nothing technical at the end of the day I think to me the way that I kind of see them is videography is more of you're kind of coming in it's a job you're capturing a frame that tells that story but it's it's not as it doesn't have the depth to it and I think even the films that really had big recognition or were kind of just always part of the conversation also didn't necessarily look good per se because you're shooting with available light you're chasing everything it's always chaos you know nothing's going to be perfect but they were perfect in the storytelling they were perfect in how it was captured in the mood that was conveyed in how it was shot you know it doesn't have to be the lighting that makes good cinematography it's where was the camera placed do you feel like there's a perspective a point of view and so to me that is kind of the major distinction of how much are you thinking and listening and processing the story as the person who has to visually convey it to an audience and you said something uh you said something earlier that you know it's not necessarily all about technical ability and I've I've been sort of preaching this for a long time that it's your social skills and the soft skills behind how you approach this job are almost as much of its determiner of your success as your pure technical ability because there are so many talented technical Shooters how do you see do you think there's an optimistic Future For documentary cinematographers or how do you see things progressing like where where are the opportunities going to come if if you were asking me You Know How likely is it that you can have a very sustainable job as a documentary cinematographer when I started I would say probably not very at all well now it's it's the only thing that people watch on television you know in one way or another and so you've got so many opportunities to to make and work in docs all the time so yeah the little bump in the road now I'm not super worried about I think that that the the consumer wants doc material so it's not going anywhere okay guys hope you like that as much as I did you can just tell I think from listening to Matt that he is like at the top level of DPS and just watch some of the work he's done watch cartel Land Watch Once Upon a Time in Uganda and you'll see just how good he is and he's such a nice guy he's actually got his own YouTube channel so I'll put the link to that in the description you should definitely check it out as well he's an amazing teacher as well as a really good DP so obviously that wasn't the full conversation we talked for way over an hour that was just some highlights that we picked out but I don't want these videos to get out of control uh if you like that conversation and want to see the long extended version the course is full like I said but if you put your name on the wait list you can get in on the next intake and there's the full version of that plus conversations with other professionals we've got an oscar-winning director in there a really great Natural History shooter and I'm going to be adding more and more over time so check out the link in the description and big thanks to Matt that was a ton of information from one of the very best in the business so yeah [Music]
