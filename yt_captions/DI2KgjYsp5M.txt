my name is jason goodison i'm an engineer at microsoft i attended waterloo for five years where i did six internships across three countries blah blah blah blah you don't care you wanna know how to get into waterloo welcome back to the show everyone today that we're talking today we're talking about something i get qui asked oh my god welcome back to the show guys today we are talking about something i get asked about a lot which is how to get into waterloo computer science now i wasn't gonna do a video like this and then i did some research on what's out there i watched a few videos and i found i found most of the videos that are out there there are some good ones but a lot of them are just the people bragging about how good they are like hey i got into waterloo computer science my cumulative top six was a hundred and thirty percent i founded six companies and sold ten of them for half a billion and it's hold on hold on what you when you watch something like that you start to think is that what i need to get into the university of waterloo no no it's not why no that's not what you need so today i want to be a little bit more real i didn't have one of the best applications in the world i'm going to tell you what i had and i'm going to relieve some of your stress and tell you but some of the myths now yeah waterloo can be a difficult school to get into it's no surprise it's one of the best in the country so i'm not going to try and sugarcoat it and tell you everyone's going to get in but it's not as crazy as some of these people are making it out to seem so let's go through some of the myths one of the myths i've seen somebody talking about how many hackathons they've done like 12 hackathons or something i went through five years at waterloo and did three hackathons and zero before university i didn't know how to code before university at all so you don't need to know how to code to get into the university of waterloo uh yeah i'm sure it helps so if you are someone that knows about these competitions like the the ccc or you know about hackathons you can go to that's great i just didn't know i i just came from a small town i just didn't know about any of that kind of stuff i did do the euclid and i would recommend doing any math competitions or coding competitions that you do know about because they never hurt you if you want to do the euclid i got like a 32 on the euclid or something and it didn't hurt my chances of getting in they're just excited to know that you're excited about math if you can do it always do it okay what do your grades really need to be like i've seen a lot of people say you have to have high 90s that's just not true i got into the university of waterloo with a 93 average now it was a few years ago so it might have been a little easier to get in i'm not sure however i'll say waterloo has a grading system that they actually use to grade the schools not the people that apply but the schools themselves before i go any further let me say if you're getting any value out of this video please like and subscribe if you're going to waterloo this channel is completely dedicated to helping you get your next internship so you'll want to be subscribed but back into it so waterloo has a system now um some people go to really easy schools that are great inflated canada doesn't have like an sat or something that you have to take like america has so we have to have some idea of determining which high schools give inflated grades and which ones don't so what waterloo does is it takes grade 12s that have already been to waterloo it checks what they applied with so let's say a person from high school a applied with a 95 average then it looks at their first year grade final grade so person that you know went to high school a with a 95 average ended up getting a 75 so therefore they on average lost 20 uh after they came to waterloo and they'll they found that the average was 16 so if you go to waterloo your average will drop by probably 16 for the average school but some schools drop up to 30 percent so some schools are really really inflating grades now i went to this really small school in canada in ontario called kdhs i i applied to waterloo with a 93 average and i finished my first year with a 75 average so i was i was around there i was around their average so my school probably didn't get inflated or deflated too much your school might so when you're watching these people on youtube tell you that they literally have a 98 average and that you need that well they don't know you might be struggling to keep a 91 average but your 91 average is way more impressive than their 98 average so keep that in mind do a little bit investigation if you can to determine what your school is like here another thing you should try waterloo looks at your grades or applications before your final mark is out right so if you get a really bad mark when you're doing your application process what you should do is ask your teacher to postpone putting that grade on your mark until you're finished the application process and then put it on your mark so you want to inflate your grades a little bit right when you're applying and you don't want to just blatantly ask for marks and tell your teacher please give me an extra two percent like that's sketchy they're not going to want to do that you shouldn't ask for it but if you did just happen to have an inopportune bad grade then i don't think you're abusing any integrity issues by asking them to postpone putting it on your final mark for like a week and then last but not least the thing that most videos go over more in depthly is the aif so the aif yeah it's important before i tell you how to answer aif questions think about waterloo as an institution waterloo is a business so what do businesses want they want to be relevant and make money and they want to stay relevant that's what waterloo's goals are when you're writing your aif think those are their motivations so how that translates to you is they want to know you're smart and that you will feel you'll go through your entire four-year degree meaning that they'll make money from you for four years in a row and they want to know you're ambitious because they want you to go on to do great things and then that reflects really well on the school think kevin o'leary from canada he went to the university of waterloo they want someone like kevin o'leary having gone to waterloo and not u of t that looks really good on them if you're a fan of kevin o'leary and the aif it's very quantitative what you'll want to use a lot of numbers and what they're looking for is some way of determining how good you are at managing stress so i worked like 20 to 26 hours a week on a side job i was uh the captain of the high school soccer team these were things that took up a lot of time out of my week that i was able to put on there i also tried to do some extra volunteering i didn't go like crazy but i think i did like an extra 80 hours so yeah volunteering is great sports are great or banned or something like that if you do have a side job definitely put it on there they're just looking to see that you can handle the stress that's really what it is at the end of the day and if they want to stay relevant they're gonna want to see things like leadership skills things that show them that you might want to do something great i'm just trying to get you guys to think about the motivations they have when they're looking at applicants so anyway i hope i debunked a few of these myths that i've heard it's really situational based right i really hope you get in when you do get in you should definitely make sure you're subscribed to this channel for tips on how
