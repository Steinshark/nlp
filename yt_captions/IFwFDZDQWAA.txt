we see a lot of Wild Tech around here but this this is the wildest we've seen in a long time like here's a question you need to ask yourself how many ssds do you need in your computer one two three how about 21 of them that's right we got it the Apex storage x21 it's absolutely cram packed full of m.2 slots Each of which contains a sabric rocket four plus eight terabyte SSD that's right friends I'm holding a casual 168 terabytes of storage and this thing is so fast it shocked even the CEO of Apex storage just like I'm gonna shock you with this message from our sponsor Tello get super affordable phone plans with awesome freebies and excellent customer service from Telo they were rated excellent by over 9 000 unbiased customer reviews on trustpilot so switch to Tello today by clicking the link in the video description be careful have you ever held a 150 terabytes in the palm of your hand these things are worth more than my car and my car is new it's a 21. it is a pretty good car kind of a car guy all right really the star of the show is this though there are only three of these cards in existence but if the buzz around it is anything to go by there's soon to be a lot more of them unlike some pcie slot based ssds the Apex storage x21 allows you to mix and match any commodity m.2 drives that you want and even upgrade them down the line because all you're doing is taking this pcie by 16 Gen 4 slot and splitting it up while the attached drives had to hold the boy can you attach a lot of drives this controller at its heart can apparently handle up to a hundred pcie lanes and the best part is you can install this in any motherboard you don't need a server board that supports pcie slot bifurcation all of that's handled on board and another feature I'm really excited about is that apparently you can hot swap the ssds on the board I don't want to do that we're going to have to try it I don't want to do that we're gonna have to try that I mean cyberant would want us to shout out Severn by the way they asked us hey if we send you those drives can you guys mention Us in the video I was like I will suck on your toes for this many drives so uh you'll find them Linked In the video description it's an SSD but it actually takes up as much space in your computer as a GPU and has the same number of power connectors okay there's six pin pcie instead of eight pin pcie but still how much power this thing draw I don't think it's that much oh my God right I knew that I knew that these are over a thousand dollars but still it just didn't register yep holy crap so what are they hold on a second what are they doing here this looks like it's going to be at least a pcie by 8 link this has got to be another pcie by 16. actually looking closer at the layout of the daughter board that makes sense this top slot here is routed to these four and these four on the back so a total of eight drives to this 16x slot and these four here are routed to the other one that gives us a probable total of two lanes per Drive which might seem like oh that's a bottleneck because this rocket terabyte can do seven gigabytes a second and that's only three and a half but when we consider that the system is accessing all these drives through a single pcie by 16 slot I don't think it's going to be a major factor for performance that is something we could test though by running a speed test on just one drive installed on the card we should do that hey oh sure I kind of want to try it there's other stuff to look at here six pin pcie power connector I mean should we pop the heatsink go for it I kind of want to look at it right I'm assuming we have to send this back okay I don't know oh well who the heck are these guys like it's so wild they come out of basically nowhere and they're like yep we've got more ssds than anyone else that's what you get for being asleep on the job switch Tech pfx I don't know why but I was like expecting an fpga or something I guess that makes sense that it wouldn't be since you're not really doing any logic on the board if it was some kind of raid card or something like that then maybe but if all this is doing is just pcie switching then it doesn't have to be that maybe there's an fpga somewhere else no it looks like the whole thing is just this chip just this chip it's bigger than most CPUs I mean well yeah yeah yeah I mean not not it's not undermining the coolness of the Chip and where would we normally find something like this I'm imagining like a pcie fabric like rack mount switch or something or I don't even know I don't rightly know sir it can be used in Metro networks and core networking okay cellular infrastructure broadcast equipment I would imagine anyone building out composable pcie over fiber infrastructure might use something like this man those things are wild you can have a whole bunch of pcie devices just connected over fiber optic cables to a switch and then you can have your systems and then on the Fly you can assign put six gpus in that one and it just connects to anyway okay and I do want to say the hot plug support that I said is on the data sheet for this chip not the data sheet for this whole solution well start with one which one's going to be the lucky slot here why would you start with this one because I want to see if they each get two lanes oh yes well but you can just do that with all them on there yeah okay okay this is awkward we need to move our GPU 40 70 by the way 40 70. ah all right let's turn it back on you were here the whole time I did nothing you did touch it though I did well I touched it so you want the GPU in now yep the thing is uh well you can't put it in this slot because then we get by eight and by eight we need all 16 pcie Gen 4 lanes for our SSD so I guess we're putting it in this 1X slot yes one sec that's the stupidest thing ever really does it does it touch something is it going to short out yes yeah I'm giving us oh oh I don't think it got green before hold on hey hey patience all right this GPU is in at a very uncomfortable angle sir yeah I I don't love it and our one disc shows up oh I see you've did you configure this in a Windows software Raid 0 yes that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard and I love it all right let's uh we can also do the BIOS read if you want that would be smarter although I've had some issues with AMD pcie raid and you know reformatting windows and getting confused and stuff so I don't know I mean if we're doing something we'd never recommend anyway it doesn't really matter how we do it so my theory my theory then is that this is only going to get us a buy two connection no wait how does that work it's claiming to be pcie gen 4x4 right but wait the connection through the pcie switch chip would be at least five for but then the drive wouldn't report that okay let's just I don't know yeah let's see what it does man if they wired every slot up for four lanes they did they did they wired every slot for four lanes that dramatically increases the cost but also dramatically increases the utility of this product because under normal circumstances you wouldn't do something dumb like configure 21 drives in a raid 0. you would have this in a system that's got a lot of CPU resources as well and then you would be dividing up that Solid State Storage sometimes leasing it to separate clients so some of them might be using it when others aren't which means being able to get the full throughput to one drive could matter depending on your use case it's pretty cool that's awesome let's add another Drive oh please turn it off I don't uh seems like a really bad idea I'm a little nervous too please do remember each of these drives is fifteen hundred dollars fifteen hundred bucks hey oh let's get a cheaper one I think I have one in my backpack of course I mean why wouldn't I right don't you keep putting an SSD in your backpack hey Good Old Reliable crucial only 500 gigs okay you're doing a great service for your country oh light turned on oh yeah that's something it's not there but also this is still working so I kind of consider that a win holy crap even though it wasn't doing anything it's like flipping hot oh wow I just installed 32 terabytes of SSD on here oh looks so good one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 15 16 17 19 21. hey they're all here sick and you can maybe changing that to raid changes that I don't actually know it's somewhere oh but just just let it go past the BIOS oh oh wait what now do you see why I had a Windows raid well you have to physically remove the drives from the system we don't even have them configured in a raid you just can't in the Bios it's too many for am5 this must be a consumer platform lockdown thing because otherwise you could totally just run it does Intel let you do it I'm not entirely sure oh maybe what I said earlier about just being able to throw this in a nutkin boom SSD server isn't true then AMD locks it down butt heads man I'm disappointed you got to put this in a Server Motherboard what the average consumer doesn't have 2 800 to spend on an m.2 carrier card so AMD didn't think of that well I guess what I need to do then is go back into Disk Management and fix your raid that I broke yes oh boy this will be tedious oh can you not just click like add to volume and it figures it out it's raid zero the volume is dead oh oh what haha okay it worked I have no idea what just happened there but I'm into it oh yeah oh yeah I'm gonna call you Big D yes thank you for hitting quick format oh I did not hit that once it took like five hours it was 5 30 I was just like all right see you tomorrow and that's on ssds I've done that with hard drives before wait have you like actually run Windows raid zero in a system sort of I was running multiple raid cards running raid five Hardware raid five and then I raid zeroed them in Windows that's one of the early iterations of One X server actually oh this blows my mind whoa you okay okay this is the maximum speed of some things okay 600 megabytes a second okay pcie 3.0 3.4 single one of these drives seven gigabytes a second ddr4 25.6 gigabytes per second all right these drives are already getting pretty toasty here I haven't even oh yeah we should get us yeah we should get some cooling on this or wait well yeah let's check the camera first okay oh Alex that heat sinks at 90 degrees all right let's uh that means the Chip's probably hotter uh yeah the fact that these 55 degree ssds didn't look hot in the frame is a bad thing but wait how are you even supposed to access any of the fan ports they're all down here they're the bunch of fan ports ah uh so do you want to zip tie that on the back here really yeah so our method oh oh I see we're making like a tunnel yes with cardboard yes of course we are oh my God Alex what the hell what it's highly effective uh Isaac okay so what the hell is going on here fun it's fine you know this is barely in the slot right yeah what fan is that not as good as it was before what I found worked really well I took one zip tie really well you say yes really well all right up through there oh my God and I was The Reckless idiot for trying hot swap so that can go on there and then I found it worked really well if the other one went through the GPU um hold on I need another zip tie now I'm participating I'm officially party to this okay it's at 74 degrees okay they're all like 36 35 degrees now down from 50 60. heck yeah nice it works okay gigabytes now I want to make something clear just because that's as fast as a stick of memory and I don't even just mean you know theoretically when you're addressing it raw this is with file system overhead doesn't mean that you could use it as RAM the latency is going to be much much higher even if the bandwidth is off the charts unbelievable let's just have a look here oh yeah how many threads are we giving it it looks like four four is kind of where it seemed the happiest in Windows okay so for for all uh sure we are right at the theoretical limit of this slot yeah I mean that's the thing right is we're putting so many drives behind it that the SSD controllers The nand Flash none of these bottlenecks exist anymore you're actually limited by the pcie slot at least in sequential workloads as these random ones come up you're going to see oh wow two gigabytes a second is a lot that's wow uh it's obviously nowhere near the capabilities of the slot we'd have to put another what would that work out to not about 200 drives on one of these carriers you know at a queue depth of 32 in a random workload to really like saturate the pcie slot but still now that I've said it I'm sure those wild people over at Apex storage are going to try and build one now it's worth noting you've seen speeds like this before in the past in fact with an inexpensive carrier board that relies on the motherboard to do the bifurcation and just four ssds you can put up Benchmark numbers like this no problem that's actually what I was running in my old personal rig the issue though is you can only see these kinds of numbers under ideal conditions when those ssds are acting in their SLC cash mode as soon as you hit them with any kind of sustained load especially along right they are going to absolutely plummet with the x21 though having so many drives running in parallel we weren't able to change these numbers no matter how hard we hit the array oh wow it is actually using a hundred percent of these discs at least if task managers to be believed that is a lot of data to be moving around in like five six seconds yep I don't even know what to do to like show how fast it is because like what do we do just like an SSD in here or like an SD card fast enough to keep up with it it's not fast enough that is way too slow there's no way we're going to be able to wait that long okay so we'll just fire up Linux sure all right the reason we're firing up Linux and doing this is not because we're expecting to see faster sequential speeds I mean we were already at the theoretical limits of what that slot can do in Windows but in Linux we have a lot more control over our hardware and we are expecting to overcome some of windows's limitations in terms of iops and iops are far more important for the kinds of applications that folks buying a carrier card like this might care about so things like databases or many many users accessing this storage all at the same time it's a measure of how many operations per second our storage array can perform assuming that every one of those transactions is very very small which is much more realistic force in context normal SSD is what like somewhere around a million like a really really good SSD honey badger was somewhere around four to six million that was obscene really really fast especially at the time okay and go what the hell so this is very small files to get around the pcie limitations but it shows you kind of the upper limits of what we can expect like I alluded to when we were running tests in Windows this is without the burden of a file system it's going down yeah it's still stupid just wanted to check something can you think of any reason why our iops would gradually fall on this array as we run the test in Linux if it's doing any rights then it could be because of that oh is it doing rights rights I don't know oh I'm not [Music] I'm not could also be that it's heating up okay I suspect it's the right thing I just wasn't sure if this test was actually writing to the drives yeah I'm not sure if it is either it seems to be kind of settling in now anyway and it's still at 40 million iops because of like the the dram cache and all that kind of stuff but uh now it's settled into the natural iops all right see you later so I lied earlier then we did manage to overcome the SLC cash just it's still really fast I do kind of want to know where it ends up it seems like it's ending up here because it went slower and now it's going faster oh yeah wow I thought it would just fall a lot I mean the speed of an individual Drive will fall by as much as like a tenth sometimes when it goes from cash mode to just like steady state where it has to do garbage collection in the background that's really fast there's just so much nand that it can do things in the background and still pump out these crazy numbers yep now as much fun as that was this is a serious tool for serious work and you're probably wondering well just what kind of serious applications are people using cards like this for we asked Apex storage and while they couldn't give us exact names they said that their pre-orders are from people who intend to use them for Enterprise data center-like applications and this is to take advantage of the falling prices of flash right now think of something like a high performance version of backblaze where they could use consumer hardware and then pass those cost savings along to the customers they also have pre-orders from folks in the digital forensic space who are excited by the size and speed with the ability to add cards into existing workstations and they've had interest from high-end performance users and video editors who are excited to use it with 4K and 8K footage other than the capacity I don't really see any reason why you would need this for video editing but sure there's apparently also people in the AI space since well you've worked with these giant data sets and if you've got spicy gpus we should Chia mine on it chew through a lot of data in general Apex summarize their customers as being really anyone who spends a lot of time writing to and reading from disks the more iops and bandwidth that you need at this kind of capacity the more it's going to improve your Computing case some of which they probably haven't even thought of yet and I share your sentiment I'm also excited
