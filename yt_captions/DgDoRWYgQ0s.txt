ladies and gentlemen I found it I have found one of the most exciting chess games that has ever been played and in this video I will be sharing that chess game with you both sides in chess begin with eight pawns theoretically speaking a player can end up with nine Queens counting the one they start the game with in total you could have 18 Queens on the board but that's all in theory in reality it almost never happens there are games where one person promotes there are games where even both individuals promote there are even some games where promotions happen multiple times but in those games the Queens very rarely survive and they ultimately perish like it's Game of Thrones but in this video I'm going to show you a game where six Queens existed on the board at the same time it was not a fake game it was a game played between two Chess Masters and it was very much legitimate and it was incredible and it was beautiful and it was a sight to behold let's jump into the game I've got nothing else to say we are in Budapest the year is 2009 and our protagonists are Emil salonsi and when to my home from Vietnam at the time the person playing with the black pieces uh was a women's feta master wfm but uh now she's a women's Grandmaster so she's moved up in title but remember this game is 14 years ago and I got I got I got no other introduction uh sit back relax and uh and enjoy this absolutely spectacular trip to to Queensland uh beginning with the with the move E4 black responds with C5 the Sicilian Defense one of the most imbalanced openings in chess uh White now has multiple options but plays Knight to F3 black plays D6 again already black uh after white has multiple options black also has multiple options of how to play the Sicilian black chooses to play D6 we have the open Sicilian on the board which is a sicilian where there's a pawn capture in the center like this and the Knight recaptures and now black has one final choice of which type of Sicilian to go for are we going for the classical are we going for the dragon uh black plays A6 and we have a knight or Sicilian Defense the most popular the most combative the Rolls-Royce of chess openings if you will and in this position in 2009 this was not the case but in 2023 white in this position can play no less than like 20 moves white can play A3 A4 Bishop D2 Bishop E3 Bishop G5 Bishop E2 Bishop D3 Bishop C4 Queen D2 Queen 83 Queen F3 Queen E2 G4 H4 F3 F4 G3 but like I I like I if there's a move on the board I'm not even joking uh white white can play it like white has played literally everything against the night Earth but in this game white played Bishop E3 which is the main line actually it's very much the main line and the idea is to put a Pawn on F3 in many cases and Castle long and trampoline your king side pawns forward anticipating that black will be castling short side uh also just the I'm just going to mention this right now folks um viewer retention almost always Trails off in one game videos because you don't have the attention span right you just see something nice in your sidebar can you do me a favor for today can you actually just watch this game until its conclusion you know what even as a trade for you I I might not even throw in an ad in the last like six or seven minutes of the video just out of respect for one another because you gotta you gotta witness this you can't just watch the opening and leave you really can't like you're just not you're not doing you're doing yourself a disservice so that's gonna be our little trade all right I'll do my best uh unless YouTube decides to just throw one in there anyway that would be kind of hilarious but black plays the movie five Knight B3 it's gonna take a while for six Queens to appear on the board right these aren't four hundreds so Knight B3 Bishop E6 and now white plays Queen D2 and I told you why it was going to play F3 uh and as you can see black has kind of this Central Armada right everything is center-based the most important Square in the night or Sicilian is the D5 Square white often times tries to use it as a transport Square black uh fights back with the Knight on the bishop if white dominates the D5 square a lot of the black position just gets smushed because none of these pieces really come alive and if white gets the Knight to D5 and then apply significant pressure white will win D6 and white will just frankly win the game black will not get a typical counter play uh now we have the move G4 which is basically a warning shot of course you can also Castle here and then play G4 it's kind of insignificant uh so G4 black plays short castle and now white can Castle long white can also play H4 there is this this and long Castle all right let the fun begin so because this is a game where players are castled on opposite sides already crazy stuff is going on white has launched some very very nasty intentions over here black is gonna try to Zig and zag into the center uh black is also going to try to Zig and zag into the center with that Knight the bishop is going to apply pressure the pawns are gonna try to kick the knights out of the way to get to the King by it via Rook or queen and white meanwhile is gonna try to bulldoze over here but also keeping in mind that D5 scores it's a very very fluid position so we have Knight to B6 uh White plays a very useful move here King B1 this is called a prophylactic move you are getting the king off the C file and uh not engaging in any Shenanigans black plays Rook C8 and as you can see from the quality of The Rook it looks very different if it's on A8 or if it's on C8 when you play the move Rook C8 you are effectively saying that A5 A4 is not really in your plans but now you are trying to get to the C4 square and potentially trade off uh White just continues to stick to the plan Rook to G1 I mean it's very much a case of this is like Dynamic Beauty in chess it looks like the players are completely not acknowledging one another Rook C8 Rook G1 and yet in the way that they are playing every move is tied together despite these two moves being on basically total opposite sides of the board the dynamic chaos and the beauty of it all all ties together because this Rook is going to partake in the game faster and soar all these pieces because of the incoming threat because of the incoming attack right so black plays G6 to solidify uh salonsi rotates his Queen over to F2 which targets the Knight and you see immediately how the board starts interacting together right he's he's headed that way black arrives with Knight C4 and white just chops the Knight why does white trade the bishop for the Knight because it's a dynamic position and that Knight cannot really exist uh it would actually be significantly worse uh for me to get this bishop because this bishop does not partake in the attack like that Bishop does so Bishop C4 Rook C4 and now the Knight jumps to D5 black takes and white takes so we have a trade of Knight for Bishop and Knight for Bishop leaving us with dark scored Bishops and knights white now has very good control over the D5 Square black is left with a bishop on E7 that is not wonderful but is still playing a good role in the game and black can get this Knight in the game via Knight F4 or Knight g796 and black celest pawns and black and play Queen C7 and Rook C8 so black plays B5 I mean that's also completely fine I just talked about the fact that black would like to activate the queen side pawns because this is what happens in opposite side castling positions the players like to throw Haymakers at one another not actually in this case I I think black was like a teenager when this game was played so that would have been good I think white was like 50. or 40. that wouldn't have been very good uh now white plays the move Queen D2 this move over secures the G5 Pawn so The Rook can move otherwise had you move the Rook you would have just lost that pawn white can also consider H4 in the future and white is going to try and mix up a few things since white has sort of been thwarted on this side you can now go to D1 you can pressure that you can try to poke holes at the queen side as well and you're trying to play kind of multi-layered chest right so now we see a triple stack on the C file and a triple stack on the D file uh black plays excuse me white plays C3 making sure the pawn cannot be captured black plays Rook B8 because black is still trying to fire away Rook B8 uh is actually a big mistake because of a ridiculous move a completely ridiculous tactic that white spots white in this position plays the Incredible move Bishop to C5 when an impossible move looks possible it frequently spells bad news the point here is that you cannot take this because I get here and the danger is not that I'm gonna win your queen the danger is that after this you can't stop like my mating attack you have all your pieces on good squares but your position is not equipped to deal with my my mate threats and now we sort of see why it's attack crashing through whereas black never got going Black's pawns just stood there nicely but nothing really happened so Bishop C5 is an incredible move and it's also a problem because it's not just one of these Hope Chest situations be honest with yourself how many times have you played a move going oh if they take me I have this incredible trick and then they don't have to take you right but in this case if they don't take you you were threatening to take the pawn anyway and it doesn't matter that your Rook was hanging because the queen is hanging so all this happens and now white is a pawn up white has broken through right white won the battle for the D5 Square white won the battle for the d-pawn a6s hanging Rook d8 is a problem uh and uh and and white is winning right Levy where are the six Queens I don't have the attention span here we go seeing that that they are going to probably lose this game in the long run black starts firing back the wounded opponent the wounded animal is the most dangerous right B4 before launching aggressive countermeasures uh White plays Pawn takes before black recaptures with the sea rook and now what white probably should have done is just continue to apply pressure with pawns and play Rook D7 basically not get scared of all this uh play Rook D7 after Queen B6 maybe maybe trade a little bit later but white decides I'm gonna play Rook d8 right now I'm gonna play Rook d8 right now and then I'm gonna trade the Rooks and we're gonna have a queen and rook and Knight type of end game now I have Knight C5 but that blunder is Rook D4 and suddenly suddenly this end game despite still being a pawn up for white is barely winning in fact it's probably not winning why is it not winning because of the opposite side King situation so despite being a pawn up Black's Queen and night are gonna coordinate super well and actually pose some serious problems like if you look around the board where is the extra Pawn it's here which means it's in front of the king which means to push it means weakening your own King if this was a night end game uh I don't know how I'm gonna do this but let's just say uh you know if if this was a night end game like this uh this might be winning for white and even still is kind of very is very tricky because black is in time to win the pawns but if white is able to take this pawn and push there's good chances however not not this end game so white missed the big opportunity there uh and white probably should not have rushed with the trades white should have played something like Queen C3 and kept attention however that did not happen and now we have the following position in blackplay's Queen B5 we have Knight A4 and uh black might even be better all of a sudden black is taking over the game just out of nowhere out of nowhere black is taking over the game because when you pushed all these pawns you had a commitment to attack but you have to understand that when you push upon to G5 look what's gonna happen it's a carousel of Pawns being taken so Knight C3 Queen C4 we have Queen D6 check and now black has recaptured the pawn on F3 but they are going to lose the pawn on E5 with check King back to G8 and white plays B4 I think you see where this is headed but surely there is no way that we are going to get six Queens on the board did you get click baited by Gotham like straight up lied to by the way like imagine I made a video six Queens on the board and they're just like that never happened it was just like a boring game um right well King B3 and the king is gonna go join the pawns all right King is gonna go join the pawns he's not lazy uh black now understands that trading into this end game is lost so I just talked about how a night end game in all likelihood is lost because uh you you you're not gonna be able to stop the pawns you just won't uh however a queen end game with the Queens on the board is probably not lost because the queen is faster white plays King A4 oh my God where is the king going Knight jumps to F3 attacking the queen queen slides over now black for foreseeing the future goes I don't think I can stop this and I can and it doesn't make sense for me to give checks because I can't stop my Pawn getting taken and then if I can't stop my Pawn getting taken because everything is defending everything black White's gonna push I don't know what to do I'm just gonna play H5 I mean I gotta I gotta get two squares closer what does white do king goes up the board to take the pawn oh my God black takes on H2 Here Comes A4 no way surely not right the Knight jumps back to G4 attacking the Queen the queen needs to win time so it plays D6 and the King has taken no chance right I mean just no chance King A6 no way black can't even push on G3 I mean on on H4 black has to play Queen G3 but now you're attacking the Knight why can't just push the white plays Knight D5 now this move doesn't make sense because you're just helping white and if you play Queen E4 you're just helping white every Tempo matters every Tempo matters as white as pushing the pawns forward once the Bones start going there's going to be no way as the pawns walk and shield the king so instead of that black plays H4 now black is three squares away from queening all right white plays Queen f8 threatening check black plays Queen F2 simultaneously cutting the diagonal and defending F7 and suddenly both players realize this might be the moment you know that movie scene where both both a villain and protagonists get knocked down and the weapon Falls away like the sword or the gun and they both look at it and they're both crawling toward it this is that moment in the movie B5 three squares from queening H3 2 B6 H2 one B7 queen queen Four Queens on the board 18 points of ammunition for both parties oh my goodness what is going on and if you're gonna compare the quality of the Kings that's mates that is made in one and this king is also wide open black plays the one of the best moves Queen A1 to defend the mate from the corner the computer here wanted black to start giving a check and and going for some sort of draw maybe repetition of moves but we have Queen A1 black plays Queen bee8 defending the pawn and hitting F7 we have Queen G7 and normally these games just end with a bunch of Trades white says no no both sides will have their two queens and now seeing that there is a moment of Peace in the position and a moment of mutual respect of assured destruction if you will neither side can really check one another both sides suddenly realize it's time to stock up on more arms this is like a microcosm for the global powers of the world black plays G5 and folks if you thought G5 was a pipe dream if you just thought Black's playing G5 but that's never going to lead anywhere nope A5 oh my God it's happening it's happening folks I told you might want to stick around the Knight jumps back to H6 now apparently this is winning but only if black plays the move Queen eight d8 have you ever even seen that q8d8 it looks like an Audi Model all right you know all those cars are like get the Audi Q7 Quattro 8 with 10 000 horsepower today at least it only at 945 a month with 36 months financing or whatever uh Audi sponsor your boy Queen d8 is apparently the best move and uh yeah I can't explain why Queen C6 though which uh hits this file various ideas of coming back if necessary uh the Knight now undevelops completely to cover all of these squares and folks the queen slides over to C7 to Shield the king as it walks out of the way start the countdown once again [Music] there are now 54 points worth of Queens on the board what the hell are we watching I mean can you imagine promoting like these queens in a real game what do you even do where do you grab the Queens from this doesn't make any sense a chessboard comes with two queens white and black Sometimes they come with an extra Queen where did they get all the other queens they I mean they literally needed to pause the clock get up and come back and get another queen this is ridiculous there are 54 points worth of P of Queens on the board now if I have to compare the quality of the Kings there's still going to be a bit of a tense moment here and folks the night now Shields the king the white king is completely safe the Y King is completely safe and Mormon I might add uh just absolutely ridiculous situation here Knight to B6 Knight to F6 E5 Knight to G4 dancing away and how how do you break through this how do you break through this position while at the same time making sure that you don't get butchered if you if you think this is a fake game by the way this is not a fake game Queen E8 Queen ff5 covering the checks defending the pawn potentially looking this way the only place that white can get in is right there black can get in we have Queen Sita E7 threatening Queen H4 so black plays Knight H6 covering up the king king to C7 were they laughing when they were playing these moves I would not be able to keep a straight face Queen beta E4 offering our first queen trade white says no not only does white say no why does now one move away from winning this game Knight to F6 for instance I don't know if black went here Knight F6 check wins because first of all it's first and foremost it's a fork but second of all there's mate because you can play Q8 f8 mate and Q7 f8 mate if you will uh so with this moment here at Knight F6 on the way black can play Knight G4 to stop that but then you would have Queen H4 Knight H6 and I would play qcxh6 qh6 Knight F6 King G6 and I would play Queen G8 Queen G7 Queen H7 King G5 and I would take you and when you ran away I would win your other Queen I mean what the what is this this oh my God so seeing that that was coming black played the wolf Queen takes E5 uh and as you can see here we have a very uncomfortable family moment as the truth has come out to everybody involved in the family that there were in fact multiple Queens uh takes takes takes takes and uh black is upon out but unfortunately you're not going to be able to make much use of it let's not forget that in any end game of Knight versus knight and pawn it's just a draw because then I will sacrifice itself so as long as black doesn't do anything catastrophic our white doesn't do anything catastrophic uh well actually black had an opportunity here maybe to play Knight G4 and Knight F6 but it's still a draw King E8 Queen H3 and the players uh the players agreed to a draw after 75 moves have you ever seen a game like this have you ever seen a game where one of the Kings mind you the black king was lazy all of these all of these pawns promoted while this game just sort of hid the look at this guy this guy went for a couple for uh for I took some uh you know ingested something and went for a walk in the woods and thought about life okay I don't know what he ingested kids aren't he ate Jolly Ranchers uh and and we got here but like all good things ultimately it ended peacefully because of mutually assured destruction what a game that was incredible uh I hope you enjoyed uh there ain't much you can learn from this game other than you know the art of promoting a queen uh but it was it was it was a fun one I mean I I showed you some intricacies of the night off as well but I had to share this one with you it was super fun I'll see in the next video get out of here
