today we have gary tam the co-founder of initialize capital just had a gigantic win with coinbase's ipo how much did money did you make on that deal roughly for my investors we made you know about two billion dollars or so how does that feel i mean it's awesome and if anything i'm like i want to do that over and over again and the cool thing is that's what venture capital actually is like the whole point of it is this kind of stuff like find the next google find the next coinbase i want the stuff i put together to actually help people go and start businesses people look at technology it's like you have to have a stanford degree in cs to like start a company and i'm like no that's not actually how it should work it might work like that 20 years ago but it's not how it works today i don't want it to work that way the good news is that there is an organic way to understand everything that you need to know to start a business and to get ahead in life we're on that side of the equation right and then there's another darker side that requires the people to enter that side to charge money and charge a lot of money and then the tricky thing that's funny is that like i actually don't think that they're good businesses don't do it for the money do it because like you get to create something that's awesome and then it might be something that a billion people end up using which is insane but first gary thank you so much for coming on the show thank you for having me this is super fun big fan long time long time watcher viewer thank you thank you so much so i think obviously the huge news is uh coinbase ipo'd and how much did money did you make on that deal roughly oh uh for my investors we made you know about two billion dollars or so and uh off of less than three hundred thousand dollars in so how does that feel i mean it's awesome and yeah if anything i'm like i want to do that over and over again and the cool thing is that's what venture capital actually is like the whole point of it is this kind of stuff like find the next google find the next coin base and when you hit you hit like outrageously big and it's awesome so obviously hindsight's 20 20. but did you feel like when you found coinbase can you tell us a little bit about finding did you first meet brian or who who did you first meet and did you feel like you know i mean obviously there's always going to be a hindsight bias but did you what made coinbase attractive to you starting out yeah so i i got introduced to brian through another founder who had backed he now actually founded a billion dollar company called sift science so it just recently reached a billion wow uh you know and coinbase uh you know top ticked at 100 billion so that's the crazy thing about tech right like when business works you know you can literally have these giant swings of a thou you know a hundred x a thousand x like ten thousand x um but you know at that point it was you know i'm a software engineer that other founder was a software engineer and brian was a software engineer and that's actually sort of what brought us together it was like i knew that brian with jason tan from sift science were working together brian was at airbnb at the time as a you know actually as an engineer just implementing anti-fraud technology and jason said hey my best customer he's starting a company but you know he's so amazing he would stay up until 2am with us when he didn't have to like this was you know above and beyond like a normal software engineering job even at like a high high powered startup like airbnb it's like who stays up until 2am for your employer but i think that was what really jumped out at me was like this is someone who is doing it for the love of actually making stuff and you know it sounds like that shouldn't happen but that was actually how we found and funded someone like brian armstrong it was that he was true engineer hacker wanted to create stuff uh you know for real like not doing it for the money which is crazy because you go to a you hear these speeches about like follow your passion and all of that but that's that's what i think is really really true for people who are you know are starting out in their careers in particular it's like don't do it for the money do it because like you get to create something that's awesome and then it might be something that a billion people end up using which is insane i find that so interesting that you kind of invested in him for who he was or at least you got interested in at first with who he was that's something that i've heard jason calcanis says he goes i invest in the person almost as much or more than i invest in the company itself um because there is no company right yeah right especially yeah yeah it's an idea it's an idea and really it's all most of its execution at that point when did you sort of get a picture of what he wanted to do with crypto well so i had tried to buy bitcoin on mount gox you know i was curious like anyone else um i thought you know this is a crazy idea it might just work and let me try to buy it and it was like literally going to a magic the gathering trading card forum and trying to buy something that felt completely illicit it wasn't clear that the credits would ever show up and what felt like basically a php pv website and it did and i ended up getting the bitcoin and then the lucky thing is i funded coinbase so i was able to transfer the bitcoin off of the exchange onto coinbase and that's how i kept my bitcoin before it blew up because yeah people yeah totally mount gox for those who don't know completely blew up a lot of people lost all their money everything yeah all of their bitcoin that's kind of funny because that is to some extent like that's coinbase's niche is that we're the you might think the most legitimate um crypto exchange like and they also will let place for your bitcoin yeah right exactly um i i when i first got into crypto my first account was with coinbase because i looked i looked around i said this is sort of a intimidating new technology i don't know where to go who's got sort of the easiest interface to go to i think brian has done a great job of positioning himself within that market do you know i don't know of how much you talked to them early on um do you know if they've intended to do that from the get-go of like yeah this is our positioning and they had to i mean i think brian the cool thing about him is that he's so first principles he's like well let me work backwards from the world i want to live in which is i want to be able to use bitcoin to pay my rent to buy a pizza to do you know all these things ended up happening over coinbase but um you know you couldn't really do it in order to transfer bitcoin from one person to another you would have to download a client download a full node learn how to use a command line tool and then even then like who on the other end is actually going to be able to do that and receive that bitcoin and so he sort of worked backwards from i want i know that i want to use bitcoin for everything and then what do what do i need to do to get there and then he built it that's amazing just as an aside before we move on um are you a bitcoin maximalist do you believe in other coins what sort of your uh do you got any hot takes about crypto oh yeah i mean i love bitcoin i hold bitcoin if anything that's the main thing that's sort of driving the revolution right now is people uh look at the amount of u.s dollars in the world and 25 percent of all us dollars were printed in the last year so that's made up right you know money printers are going burr and you want a safe place to store money so that makes sense to me but the next generation i think is really about defy and maybe marketplaces and decentralized autonomous organizations and that requires programmable money and that's what ethereum actually is and it might be ethereum i actually think solana might be really good um but there's something like that you know there are a bunch of different chains that um you know we could mention it you know polka dot i think is interesting um but you know i'm mainly only holding ethereum and bitcoin because those i think are sort of the home base like all roads sort of like lead back to those yeah and i do i i agree i agree i'm kind of similar um and if you're i think right now unfortunately sorry everyone it's a scam don't do it people are gonna cancel me for this but i would not tell my closest friends to buy doge right now well the whole reason i mean you just look at why most people are buying it most people are buying it because other people are buying it if we can just get everyone to buy it the price go up yeah i mean it's nihilism it's we have i'm not a nihilist i can't deal with that i didn't buy gamestop i bought coinbase well you did very well for yourself uh and for your investors two billion dollars that has to be one of the biggest wins in venture capital i mean i imagine like in terms of your your ex that is that is like an all-time great investment not yet i mean we're lucky we're lucky yeah it's amazing let's do more so one of the things you talk you talk about in terms of if we could get into the mind of how you invest because you know coinbase came came and went you can't invest in coinbase at the start anymore when if people are thinking about um investing in new companies and we should say that it's very risky and that you should make sure that you can lose that money because venture capital as you said is just trying to find that one home run you talk about something called pre-fit you invest in products pre-fit what is that yeah so uh product market fit is sort of what everyone's looking for um it's literally you've made something that people really want and they want it so much that you suddenly look down and all of your graphs are up into the left you know there are up and to the right they are just completely you know going up all the time you're running out of inventory you're running out of people to do customer support like you're just trying to hold it together really and um that was the moment it wasn't when i first invested in coinbase coinbase spent at least nine to 12 months sort of in the wilderness you know bitcoin was up it was down uh people weren't really paying attention to this they were still using mount gox uh but then at some point everything shifted i think it was a mix of you know google decided to bless coinbase as the number one hit in when you search for bitcoin um i think it was bitcoin itself went from five bucks to 20 bucks on the way to two thousand dollars and so it was a confluence of forces and you know brian armstrong was right software right place right time to capitalize and build the brand and so it's basically part luck and part preparation and the only thing you can do is preparation so you're in if i understand you're trying to find founders before they've kind of found their way necessarily yeah yeah or even that there's a market yet how do you even do that though i mean that seems like like like venture capital already feels like throwing a dart at a dartboard blind this feels like throwing a dart and you don't even know if there's a dartboard there yeah well i was sort of primed for bitcoin as an idea because i worked for peter thiel uh making hedge fund software for him and they made me read this book called the dollar crisis so all the things we talk about today where the u.s dollar is a fiat currency and anyone can you know the fed just prints it all the time that wasn't something that people generally knew um you know you can trace everything back to that moment when nixon took us off the dollar the gold standard and you know uh your wtf happened in 1971.com right just go to that website and you'll see there's no commentary it's just graphs of everything about modern society changed at that moment and so i had that loaded in my head and then i had actually tried mount gox so if i connected those things together i said well this is a fringe weird thing but smart people who can build stuff have already invested their time and energy in this thing and so if i say that what they believe actually comes true what will this be and you know at that moment i said this is it like this has to be it um but the thing is and you're right to point out like this is uh you know we had to fund 98 other companies that all didn't do that well i'll take it back probably 20 of them did well enough to make their founders millionaires but you know probably 80 of them basically went out of business and um you know that that isn't to say we didn't make money we sometimes got our money back and that isn't to say the founders didn't end up better like not all of them uh ended up better off but many of them went on and got better jobs like became head of you know tech or you know pm at all these other top companies so you know the cool thing about it is like even in failure if you're good and you're a good builder you can actually still succeed but then it still definitely took a portfolio of a hundred companies you know about fifty thousand dollars in a hundred companies in order for us to find two companies worth ten billion dollars or more the other one in that portfolio of a seven million dollar fund was instacart actually wow that that's really exciting and to be to do the math for everybody that's five million dollars most of which you i mean presumably would it would have taken and taken a loss on to find those two wins but part of i guess uh finding finding a company before the product market fit is that you have less competition i would assume from other venture capitalists who are looking for that right i mean i don't think people were looking for something like coinbase at the moment that we funded it when brian armstrong was one person um because oh you know actually after series a after that moment when bitcoin went off five to twenty dollars after they raised their first series a from union square ventures that was when suddenly there were crypto funds and there were people looking for that thesis and what's funny is there were probably two dozen different competitors to coinbase that were funded after coinbase but coinbase already was number one in google like you couldn't unseat them at that point like it already it was already doing 15 of the global volume of bitcoin um transactions on mount gox so it was already it had already won and uh all of those other uh bitcoin sort of like fast follower coinbase competitors i think 90 of them died that's incredible how how much sometimes tech can can can be that way about having being at the right place at the right time having the right foundation sort of getting there early but i think you also have to have a vision right like over and over it just seems like the people who understand the thesis first are best positioned to move what thesis do you see do you understand now or do you believe in now that you don't think most other people have caught on to yet oh man that's a great question i think people well the hard part is asking a vc this is uh is not on the cutting edge enough because the the true answer to that is sitting in the mind of a founder who's watching this right now and they won't know whether or not it's the thing that will be the future yet until they try to convince someone else of it and then if they can convince that other person then uh you know that's two people who will go out and come you know infect like four people and then these things like sort of spread like viruses after that you know crypto itself is like the perfect manifestation of a mind virus and the cool thing is you know any it can come from any of us so i don't know i have like a bunch of different weird themes though that i think are you know continuing to grow really quickly i mean i think the idea that computers can see right now that's insane you know that's why we were the first investors in cruise automation which was the first commercialized oh yeah uh attempted an uh autonomous vehicle company you know before it was google x and it was a research project and they probably never were going to ship anything but crews came along and said oh no we're actually going to retrofit some audi s4s on this one and try to get some stuff on the road yeah let's get stuff on the road and i think that taught us that you know the ability for computers to be able to see and recognize things uh i mean it's wild like we're just at the very early part of that and so if you're a software engineer you learn machine learning and computer vision like you could just i mean that's that's the future of all robotics i mean god help us maybe we'll all be out of jobs but but that's where it's gonna go it's almost too obvious now maybe but i i but i agree i i do think that has like a really promising future i think um biotech's exciting but moving on from venture capital this is sort of part of part of gary tan another part of you is near and dear to my heart you're a youtuber like like a real deal you put a ton of time into youtube you have a youtube channel we'll link it right here guys go subscribe where you do what i've been you found the product market fit that i've been looking for which is qualified people talking about business and giving advice to young entrepreneurs young business people but you've actually done it yourself what got you inspired to do that i mean honestly i started uh in the same way that a lot of other people start which is uh casey neistat strangely i met casey you know incredible person uh but what really got me was um he uh walked into our office and initialized and uh how our 20 year old interns interacted with him got me thinking because they walked up to him and they were like it was like seeing an old friend and then casey actually just went into it and he was like oh you know this like happens to him like 10 000 times a day i'm sure he's like oh hey it's like he just goes with it he's like i'm just talking with my old friend who i have spent you know 50 hours with over the past couple years after i saw that then i watched all 50 hours or whatever it is like you know hundreds of hours of casey's stuff and then now casey is a character in my head because i feel like i know him even though i don't really you know and um then i realized oh all of human consciousness is actually switching up right now and this parasocial dynamic of people being able to talk to each other that is so powerful and you can use it for good well you can and this i think is what is relevant to you because you can use it for good or you can use it for evil and so i desperately want to use this power for good because i want to spread the good news like i want to spread the gospel you know like we meet people who are software engineers who are not different than like the people who are watching this channel right now and you know but they do sit down in front of a computer and they ship code that like touches 10 people and 100 people and 1 000 people and then like a billion people and that's like the world that we live in that's the good news right and i want people to do that but there are other people who are like check out my crazy paddock felipe watch and like i'm driving a lambo knowledge yeah exactly well i think i i think you said it best there's a powerful shift going on which is that the new kind of influencer or whatever does build it builds altitude for one thing i mean like when you go when casey neistat walked into your office he had immediate rapport in a way that almost no one else has ever had before even celebrities i mean even you know more and more we're seeing in the lives of celebrities but for a while is like oh they're just on the movie you wouldn't see you know dwayne the rock johnson and think i know that guy you would think oh there's a star but you wouldn't think i know him whereas now all these influencers you do think you know something about them depending on how intimate they let you in their life and i do think it is a really powerful tool for connecting with people um and sort of taking whatever you want to take to the next level as you said it can take fraud fake gurus whatever to the next level it can also take you know uh venture capital people to the next level and introduce them to all sorts of new founders that may have found you unapproachable before right like they think oh that's the guy who invested in coinbase he's never gonna invest in me right but um but like if they see oh it's gary it's gary from the youtube show i'll i'll go hit him up or whatever um i agree it's really powerful what are some lessons you've learned as a new youtuber like going from like you know mostly focusing on a business now you're on like a social side have you noticed anything different oh man i mean i find that i want everyone i know who's smart who could influence people to do this now do you ever do that do you ever convince your friends to try to become youtubers now that you have done it yeah well because like here's some power that is like maybe really useful for you but like and then generally i try and do it with people who i genuinely think like could help other people that's what i try to do so so i've stopped doing it when you when i first kind of got a little bit um figured out youtube a little bit i was like i wanted to help everyone do it but then i realized there's so much survivorship bias in this thing that it's a bit like have you ever heard that do you know that what the joe rogan podcast is i mean i yeah of yeah so he's always telling everyone they need to start a podcast and at a certain point it becomes a little bit grading you're like joe not everybody's gonna start like this gigantic podcast some people get like five viewers whatever so i try to not be that like i'm like i wanna encourage the people that i think this person not in other words not fit a circle into the square peg hole right like but instead fit somebody who like it seems like no they've got they have something they want to say a and b they look like they have the stomach for the long grind because it is a long grind to really crazy reap the results how long have you been doing it a year right uh yeah just on coming up on two years now but yeah it's wild how many subscribers are you at uh i think i'm at 125. something you're killing yeah gary yeah i'm blessed man like i'm very lucky so i have no complaints you know i but i'm excited because i'm like i want this i want the stuff i put together to actually help people go and start businesses and i think that that's kind of already happening and so i think the next step for me is like i want to create a community that's built on the people who sort of watch my stuff actually and who are like building things hopefully yeah exactly and then if we can go and i feel like you know i i tend to think about this in terms of like how do i how do we build uh the catholic church it's like how do we build something i've noticed this religious theme with uh computer science you're like you're like the good news catholic church it's weird right but like that that's what i'm trying that's the that's the wavelength i'm on right now because i want people to know that they have a hand in this actually because you know it's scary these days like people look at technology and they say i can't you know it's like you have to have a stanford degree in cs to like start a company and i'm like no that's not actually how it should work it might work like that 20 years ago but it's not how it works today i don't want it to work that way right like what matters is can you make something that's awesome and then can we evaluate it on the terms of that instead of like someone's stupid resume right like the world is so unjust when it comes to credentials and like how you get ahead and the crazy thing about money printing is that like you know people look at that and they say oh this is terrible like it's you know my my wealth is going to be it's going to be inflated away it's going to be stolen from me and it's like i think about it in like sort of redistributive sense maybe which is like actually this is awesome because it means that everything that can be funded that is profitable that should make money that helps people should get funded now and that definitely wasn't happening like five years ago 20 years ago or 50 years ago definitely you go back like hundreds of years and it's like basically nothing good was getting funded right it's all about just like keeping the social order like basically completely stagnant and keeping people where they are i'm like shoot like what this means is like amazing stuff but we can't do it just by like sort of holding them in one place like let's actually teach people that they can create stuff for each other like there's so many problems out there to solve let's solve all of them now like there's the money for it let's empower people i find it very interesting and i thought of two things number one your point about you don't need a like college degree from stanford that's definitely true it's also more and more true this is what kills me the ethos of online education is something i believe super strongly in i think it's been kind of been corrupted by like these predatory courses who ironically make fun of how much college costs and then gouge prices for their like garbage 16 you know hour course and they charge you know three thousand dollars for it but there are people who are doing it the right way i interviewed quincy larson creator of free code camp and it's like amazing he's teaching everybody constantly and he'll give a free coding education to anyone absolutely for free no strings attached and then i thought of something else because you said you want to create a community it almost reminds me of like an online y combinator type thing yeah of like where y combinator almost in a way feels a bit exclusive i was talking to justin khan and i was like talking to him about his awesome yeah he's he's great but but there's only so many people y combinator can take and one of the beautiful things about um online communities is that they scale super easily but they're but i'm actually interested in this how do you think online communities fail compared to real life communities and how do you how do you want to address that yeah that's a great question you brought up y combinator and i just i mean i have to sort of point out like actually that's what paul graham did like i was a software engineer with credit card debt and i was like running the rat race working for microsoft and then i found paul graham's essays and he taught me oh shoot like you don't actually have to have a job like you weren't meant to have a job maybe you should start a company well we are getting into some some california paul graham ideology i love it go go go go go go go but yeah and then basically he made hacker news which is that is like you know you look at circle.so or you look at like a lot of these like online communities for creators the hacker news was like the first one i mean i guess reddit was the first and then hacker news he started because the founders of reddit wouldn't give him uh super moderator access for our startups on reddit so but you know the subreddit is an incredibly powerful idea for like how these communities should probably work um but yeah i mean i think we're just recycling that because that's actually how yc started like i didn't i found out about yc through essays and then being a part of that community and then the top thing on hacker news was like apply to y combinator and then you're like oh well what is this thing i was like oh i could do that um and now that you know they've created four or five hundred billion dollars worth of startups since they've existed they've put out so many incredible companies and and i do think it's amazing how much it's like let's take a great idea and let's just iterate on it um and it feels to me like you're trying to iterate on the same inspiration that you got from paul graham and iterate it for a new generation yeah i mean go with what i i think that's the thing there's nothing new under the sun there's just what you uniquely can add and then beyond that a synthesis right like take stand on the shoulders of giants look at what people want and then try to give it to them really so one thing i have to ask is that there is this um problem that i talk about a lot on my channel that i want to ask you about because you're in this sort of business education space and i'm super passionate about sort of uh this weird phenomenon of fake gurus fake business coaches who they've there's this almost um meta of promising the world to people and kind of not giving them the goods yeah and my question to you is have you seen this play out and how do you think we can make how do you think we can change this for the better yeah that's a great question you know there's a reason why this happens and um my theory is that um you know even as youtubers we have an incredible voice but you know unfortunately like it or not you and i um even with the big following we are under the api so all of the world is being rewritten with software people who write the software get to sort of control things and then you know the rest of us are sort of like we're basically like uber drivers you know and that's there's it kind of sucks on the one hand on the other hand like you know we can put you know we can figure out how to get ahead on that stuff right and it's still valuable and powerful and so part of how the um work you know some of it is organic you and i spend a lot of time on pure organic right but there are people out there who are these fake gurus who spend a lot of time on paid and um that's an interesting quirk of the system the more money you charge you know you're and then startup parlance we talk about it as lifetime value so the more a customer who comes in is worth to you the more you can then you can take that money and you put it back in customer acquisition costs you blitz scale ads exactly and so that's what you're seeing um the really great content does still rise up it's purely organic yeah the good and that's the good news right the good news is that there is an organic way to understand everything that you need to know to start a business and to get ahead in life yeah right and it's really organic and we're on that side of you know we're on that side of the equation right and then there's another darker side that requires the people to enter that side to charge money and charge a lot of money and then the tricky thing that's funny is that like i actually don't think that they're good businesses like if you look at some of the lawsuits between some of the people we're talking about i mean we don't have to name names it's like all of them have been in lawsuits all of them like double cross backstab like hurt each other and it's like you know what like we fun i work with a lot of founders i work with a lot of businesses and the good founders lawsuits generally like you can run into one lawsuit like your entire like 10 years because like something happened right but like some of these people it like seems like there's a lawsuit that like follows them every single year or like every six months and it's like shoot you know these are not good businesses and like you're not making enough money and so you know that's why that stuff happens right like it's just like so on the one hand don't hate the player hate the game like the game is that people are taking profits but they're not profits they're actually they drop it back into costs and they're running a treadmill actually and but what that means is they get way more distribution a lot more people see it and that's what you're sort of pointing to it's like why are all of these fake gurus doing this and it's like i feel empathy and sympathy for them because they are also under the api and they have to do it they don't have another choice yeah part of me feels like part of me agrees that it's like not as good of a business model as people think because you realize they're spending they're making 3 million but they're spending 2.5 on you know ad adsense you know um but another part of my issue is that part of the claims you have to make to convert on traffic and because your whole thing is like bringing costs down part of it is like the easiest way is hey man make some more claims like tell people you know give them some wild story and tell them you're gonna change their life and make it better and the way i think about it is we don't allow people to say hey i've got a cancer curing drug right because yeah because it's predatory advertising because fundamentally anyone sick would buy that why do we allow people to sell get rich quick schemes it's the same thing but it's for you know poor people are in desperate yeah i'm with you they'll do anything they'll do anything to get out of their situation and they're told oh don't worry about it you just need to know like these like three little tricks to get out of it um which is why like i've railed against it forever but i've decided that the one new shift that i've gone towards is now trying to platform good voices and show people there's a better way to do this and there's also better people to listen to i'm not telling people to listen to my business advice but i will send it to people like your channel people like justin khan people like jason calcanis who put out y'all put out tons of free content talking about how to be a real entrepreneur how to you know each of you guys have done incredible whether it be through businesses you've built or investments you've made um i guess that's the good news for me is that i do see more of you guys coming out there and i'm like yes tell your other vc friends that they need to get so i guess i am glad that you're telling everyone to get into youtube because i'm like yes tell tell them to get involved i'd love to support their channel if i can and then the algorithm is going to support you and support me and like we'll all get there together actually which is really cool so this is interesting the idea of um algorithms now controlling things there are obviously really good things that it's done it algorithms are kind of incredible content discovery mechanisms for new content that like doesn't have distribution and they can just find it what do you think are some problems we are seeing with let's say the if if you have anything on the youtube algorithm or social media do you have any thoughts on that you know i when i first started and when you are starting out on youtube it is hell right it's like you work really really hard this stuff is you know really hard to make and and then you put it out there and nobody watches and nobody cares or you get like a bunch of thumbs down and it's like you suck and you're like what this is free this stuff is free i just you know why are you doing that man i still don't understand that why people do that but um i went to actually i went to casey and i was like hey casey like what's the deal with the algorithm this is so not fair and then he was like he basically i think if i was in person he would probably punch me in the arm or something and he'd be like you know what he did say was you have the wrong attitude right you know it's the content right the content is good i told you get good yeah i mean don't you're just he's like you're just wait looking for ways to blame other people right and i thought about it and it's like oh shoot that's right that's actually like a self-defeating thing that i see everywhere that i try i try to actively encourage you know out of people especially people who are trying to start companies is like you're always sort of the easy way out is to like fail with style right the harder thing to do is like i can crack this there's nothing special about you know this other person did it this other person did it if they can do it i can do it i'm gonna figure it out and um i think that that's actually that was useful for me he was like don't blame the algorithm everyone does that um you know you just need to make your thing awesome just focus on that and that was like the best advice i could get at that moment there's always going to be an algorithm whether or not it's fair no of course it's never fair right but you still gotta play um and when you play like you know you still get the the outcome that you want right that is an amazing answer i actually think that might be a great way to end it today uh gary is on that note i think that's an incredible lesson for people to take away i know these people one of the things
