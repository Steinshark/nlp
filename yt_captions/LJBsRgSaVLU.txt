is this is is this white thinking that this is a Danish Gambit because because this is a Danish Gambit and there's no E Pawn so you can't play E6 it makes a lot less sense to do this now because I can just play E6 you understand and say that's the difference like this is not as good because the bishop doesn't okay but black is chicken what is this I mean what would it what that's that's not a move now now Knight E5 is probably just really good I mean you you can even take but that's that's a really dangerous move to play okay just fine developing and damn F4 oh my God they messed around for too long what how are you gonna play a Gambit bro in a Gambit you're not supposed to you're supposed to lose a pawn or two this is the gigauga Gambit where in the first 10 moves you've lost two pawns a night on a rook this is not how chess works this is the gigauga Gambit okay I don't know what you did here but you don't have a lot of pieces oh my goodness the what is white oh God and black doesn't take why is this Pawn still here why what is good thank you okay now we need we need to do something and I and I understand there is on poisson but night before and then you get the pawn back and why does ILL Equip to defend this position you can play Queen A5 and queen B6 and stop castling but okay oh come on dude dude you know I have a feeling okay this is obviously three digit chess now now you could tell because black is like me take Pawn oh me move Queen to attack Pawn oh white defend Pawn me move Knight to attack Queen oh now now black doesn't know what to do so black goes here which doesn't do anything and now black goes here and now is the queen trapped oh oh they hung the Knight oh they hung the night yes big comeback time nice night back to C6 for reasons I can't fully explain you think black is ever gonna get the bishop out do you think black is ever going to get this bishop out with like B6 [Music] oh oh yes the bishop is coming out but here comes white with the mega Giga Omega attack oh no the queen is running back but now look at white opening up the position Queen slides up to E3 Rook to f8 beautiful move losing The Rook white got scared though unpinning okay now you how are you just how was The Rook just why are you pushing pawns where white has a rook a knight a bishop a queen and another Bishop white has 23 points of material staring this way and you're just like I don't care idiot you're not gonna oh that happened so black found a way to lose a rook in a different fashion okay Rook F5 is the top engine move do you think black knew that or or or or or what you think do you think they knew that or or you think that's just lucky there's a top engine move because this bishop is such an important member of this attack all right oh and that happened oh he's six huge move horrible move by the way but to take the Knight no take the Knight quit oh The Rook is coming oh here comes the Rook now how are you gonna make a little thing for the rook and then just not bring the Rook bro Knight E5 what that just hangs a night okay oh not none of these move none of these moves are good what is going Rook C7 but oh the Haymaker oh Bishop B4 was made in one oh okay that was nuts that was that was nuts what a game none of those moves were good I mean literally none like look at this horrible move horrible move for white incredible top engine move by Black by the way E6 black is winning [Music] I think Knight G7 it's still kind of equalish oh my goodness yeah my friends this is just a good lesson in the fact that like you should probably go backwards but King King F1 there is there is this so yeah I mean I don't blame you it's gotta be a three-digit game right it was okay but white tried to play a real opening or maybe they didn't maybe they didn't try to play a real opening okay this is either like 1500 bullet or 700 anything else I think this is 1500 bullet or 700 anything else that that's that that's that's what I think I that I'm I'm prepared to be sorely mistaken but we about to find out all right uh this is not who it was this is me survey says 1971 versus 1928 got to be bullet right what this was a Blitz game nah bro nah no chance bro that was so bad wow there is hope for all of you that's insane how did a two 1900s Miss C takes B2 also what is this what is this what is this oh Lord okay the good news is I didn't think they were 700 because of the Gotham sub but I don't even I mean that's wow wow that's oh sorry sorry sorry yeah the layout the layout my bad my bad my bad sorry I I haven't recorded in a while I was just showing the queen moves in the opening oh my goodness that was horrendous one of the worst things I've i d Moon thank you for submitting that that was sensational and congratulations on hitting 1900 you're a beast uh that was that was that was not the best day at the office that was um y'all gotta get the 1900 now man wow that was intense what a game oh big respect big respect and if I ever guess that you're 700 uh I mean and you're 19 I just you know just just take it just one one day at a time just one day at a time so one a long time ago a 2 000 rated player got into guess the ELO and I guess that they were like 1200 and they quit chess that day and sometimes to this day I think about them and I was like I didn't even say anything insulting you know I didn't even say anything inside I just was like this was not a good and they got so upset crazy showchess.com's opinion oh yeah let me let me do that real quick chez.com's opinion shaz.com's opinion chess.com thinks things 11 50. wow sensational eleven fifty all right that was good it could it could have been worse it yeah it really could have all right a Gotham sub this game with the blank pieces White's playing a three-point yeah this is not any good because you can play like C5 and you'll just get rid of the blockade very very quickly um but yeah this is not a good move because you're justifying this if you play D5 here you don't quite understand why you're playing the modern it's the undermine the center Knight C6 and so on this is just not an accurate move you can use stockfish here not during the game but you know it'll very quickly show you like how to get a good position but okay D5 yeah you blocked your own Bishop from the opening I'm you know it's giving oh it's giving three-digit ELO Vibes but honestly from the last game I would say this is 2100. maybe maybe that's is this going on YouTube that joke is old bro they asked me that in the last guess the ELO and then I said it's not and then everyone in the YouTube comments was like he said he's not you I can't do the same joke twice like come on come on bro all right this is this is bad you gotta first of all Bishop checks like this you really should block with pawns if you can and then get your development but uh why'd you lose the maybe this was a mouse lip maybe they meant B5 they might have meant B5 okay E6 oh okay well now Black's just okay H6 black religious what was huh bro needs a new mouse bro what what's going on white is playing really well black is playing well too kind of Knight G4 is a losing move apparently that's the top engine move because you go C4 next and you trap the bishop and there's no attack if Knight F6 you can just take play Knight F5 take the bishop wow okay uh that doesn't happen instead white black takes and doesn't trap the bishop white is still trying to attack kick out the queen hit the bishop that's the top engine move that's also the top engine move what what is this game dude that's also the top engine move that's also that well it was a fork that was simple oh my God white is just okay Rook C7 and black is just marching white down oh my God wait why did he play Rook C7 what even is this move just the waiting move oh Rook B7 is the idea but but then this is what is oh my God he killed him whoa you can't take that it's pinned whoa what are we even what even is this what what well brilliant move Rook Z3 wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait why was this brilliant why was this a brilliant move then this is the dumbest brilliant move I've ever seen in my life this is the follow-up to get the bishop off King off today shut up shut up oh my God now now White's oh my gosh White's not white oh white is back in the game what is going on oh he lost everything damn it it looked good it did for a second I it actually was equal and then white lost everything and probably lost the game okay that was one of the strangest games I've ever seen the opening was not good Bishop B5 is a bad move then they lost the pawn might have been a mouse slip though so I I'm gonna ER on the side of mouse lib um and then the middle game was fine the middle game was was honestly pretty good Queen I mean this move alone got me thinking like 1800 man like really I'm I'm gonna say 1800 I'm gonna say 1800 Speed game I I I actually don't know I I but but that's what I think I mean it's just it the quality was just way too high a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand one thousand one zero zero zero that's crazy that is ridic a 1 000 rated player played Queen to D4 that is utterly ridiculous I thought it was an 1800 game with low time later I mean that is oh my God that's nuts you have a coach you're a thousand I don't care if you have a coach you're a one thousand that's that's a ridiculous move for a one thousand to play oh my goodness what a come on guys I just guessed a thousand for that other game or whatever 1500 it was it was a 2000 game I guess 1800 year one thousand I mean this is gonna be the most stupid Guess the ELO yet oh God I mean Magnus Carlson wouldn't have found that no he he I think he would have but I mean good Lord chess.com's opinion I think chess.com is gonna agree with me let's see chess.com I said 1800. oh shut up oh shut up chess.com shut up you know nothing it idiot I'm I I'm the real guess the ELO King stupid 900. I shut up man whatever I don't even care all right normal E4 E5 finally okay D4 good stuff now white is just much better in the opening oh fantastic this is great develop the night why y'all do this man develop the night before the bishop you don't know that the bishop wants to go here you don't know you the bishop could go there or there or there develop the Knight first thank you okay that's not a bad move all right trading a lot oh you gotta have something here like Knight E5 and queen H5 that's looking mighty juicy thank you for the gifted Subs I don't really know for what but I appreciate it okay Queenie two is not a not a terrible move but Knight E5 is way more forcing um white could have capitalized on the advantage uh a little bit a little bit more um white could have for example in this position white could have already gone D5 and anytime your opponents play like this um it's uh it's an opportunity for you to rip open the center so um you have opportunities to do something like Queen D4 which is just fatal right so but uh okay which makes me think you know like a standard 1100 game take take good move yeah why does gonna win because of this Pawn like that's it uh White is going to win because of because of the pawn Knights okay that was free I don't know why we didn't take that probably didn't see it oh there it is okay nice good heavy peace end game okay oh discovered oh you know what you know there's a really nice move here there's a really nice move white to play and win White's plan when D7 check exactly D7 take the empty Square Rook F7 brutal move Rook F7 check damn I didn't realize the Rook becomes a bishop yeah you're checking the queen and the point is this is made that's the very important detail to see there because uh because of the PIN so Rook F7 is a very nice move and uh if the Queen's got a skedaddle and then you can play Rook f8 and E7 probably or maybe just E7 yeah because this is not made why not because it's illegal however if you promote to a knight this is mate and you lose stupid so white played F3 white didn't do that of course uh and now white is just yeah super simple just Advance the just Advance the pawn yeah wow that's it that's the whole game okay well I predict white is like 700. I feel like 700 submit games like this that they play where they destroy people and then they they want me to say like 2 000. I I I've been here before we're a low rated player plays a it was a good game it was it was it was a very well played game um the only mistakes that white made were just not taking advantage of um certain mistakes 1300 you think no definitely not 1300. I think like 800 7 800. um because like the opening understanding was very limited I mean white sort of just knew they have to go here this is a bad move um because you're just not supposed to double your pawns you should be developing your Knights before your Bishops um white chasing the bishop is pretty indicative of of you know and then but yeah maybe eight nine hundred I I think I think I think closer to 900 I think a lot of control was it was demonstrated oh oh well okay well in my defense and this is what I'm gonna say in my defense I did not think I did okay in my defense it was a very good game I just didn't think a 1700 would submit a game like that in my in my in my defense I just really didn't think you know I I just thought of 1700 just would be like yeah whatever I I so you played really well I just thought you were a low rated player that was proud of their game I the the quality of the game was very high it was very high game it was the the honest truth okay like if we Analyze This objectively um somebody just donated five dollars and you want me to rate your game and you called me Levi and you donated and you put the game link my friend do you have any idea what we are in the middle of we are in the middle of a YouTube recording that we are doing guests that we've been doing it for about 20 how many minutes about 25 minutes now YouTube this is the stuff we got to deal with I understand you're excited and you bought a Carl Concourse and you want to share it it's not the time right now it's you can't just rush the stage during the you know we'll do it after this is a wrong time wrong place now it's gonna get on YouTube now you're gonna show your friends you're gonna show them uh you know Gotham make fun of my donation and you called me Levi I mean the you literally committed the worst sin my my name is four letters you got 75 of the name you know what happens if you get 75 of your things right in school nothing you just get to see I would know gotta see in biology honors I hated that class oh okay so um first of all let's game review this game um is your profile photo somebody getting banned wait a minute 1550. I was gonna say the actual quality of this game was around 13 1400 uh and allow me to explain my reasoning okay uh yes I'm backpedaling 100 um this is a bad move this is a complete misunderstanding of this opening okay the No No 16 1700 should be playing this move um no 16 1700 should be giving you also can I just say no 16 1700 is playing Bishop to B4 this is a terrible move like this is a terrible move I mean it's just a target for like of course you just go here I you know and then what I mean you played well you did a couple of things I didn't like for example I thought you know 15 1600 would find this in Queen H5 like I thought it was just a very natural tactic but okay it's life and I just you know in poker you do a read and my read was you were a low rated player who was very proud of this game and it turns out you were 1700. so I apologize and um these things happen in the words of philosopher G-Eazy all right next game oh my goodness okay wow Vienna yes good to be back good to be back there it is this is completely inexcusable I'd like to mention something right now I know I talk about my courses a lot because I'm very proud of them and I think that if you wanted to spend any money on chess Improvement my courses are the best way to go especially if you're below like 17 1800 this is not even paid content this is free I offer this part of the E4 course 100 free you go to my website you go to the E4 course the entire free sample covers this and you don't even take the night I have a question for you is it worse to not even take the night or is it worse to take the night and then lose the queen I think it's worse than not even take the Knight because you never even gave it a shot you could literally do it 100 free you could do it a hundred percent for free and y'all still don't take the night man oh my goodness how much is the course go look it up why are you asking go look go look it takes you 10 seconds you lazy koala you're you guys some of you are koalas man you know what koalas do koalas starve to death while sitting next to the thing they eat stop having a smooth brain okay take it take the pawn what okay if this is not a triple ELO game if this is a quadruple ELO if there are four numbers in either of these players ELO I'm hitting delete twitch Channel bro I thank you thank you Castle beautiful now we're back to business Rook B1 okay what is this why are we playing top engine moves now Knight D5 there was even better because but fine Knight D5 okay makes sense take on H6 what how did how do you oh amazing no take with the bishop yes yes no why'd you lose the night for no reason don't take the night okay okay okay oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God okay obviously it's check it's check okay oh oh [Music] oh he finds it it's found oh but now black is still doing pretty well uh what you lost the Rook oh The Rook oh The Rook is hanging that you could take that with you could what why uh pun bush oh King DC no King D6 oh God oh this is insane oh discover check yo bro he didn't take the Rook he didn't take the Rook I thought it was a discovery check that wouldn't have Rook but he thought it was a discomfort check that you ever made on the back Rank and even if this Rook wasn't there to take the Rook it wouldn't be a mate because of King E7 and then you don't over checkmate no no oh he found it finally oh Jesus oh that's it the game ended the game is over the game is over I guys there's another game after this this is not the last game of guess the ELO there's there's a we have another game [Laughter] it's a 500 gotta be like yeah I the good news is this is a curable condition if you show up to the chess hospital and these are your symptoms very easily treatable this is called early onset ugaism okay and you uh you know you go caveman brain for a little bit uh but the or cave woman we don't want to discriminate uh and uh and you know you you that oh okay I'm I don't even you can cure a lot of this by just solving puzzles and doing a little bit um a little just a little bit of study so I'm gonna say a solid High 400 and if you're anything higher than that I if you're in the fourth digits I might I might I might I might I might okay okay the good news is you are 676 you are not four digits the bad news is you are 677 and 7 17. and was this game recently played and well and what what does chess.com think it thinks you're oh  oh damn oh my god oh damn okay well look here's the good news here's the good news you can't go any lower than that right like so even at your bottom you won I think did you win you lost oh god oh I'm trying to find the positives the good news is you're from a great country that is very beautiful and has a lot of islands and a fantastic diet and the good news is you're probably going to live to about a hundred because the Mediterranean diet is a good thing that that you know Saving Grace look at your messages yes I I saw them my subscribers uh I sometimes check my profile please I've gained 400 points oh oh wow oh there's a happy ending after all not that kind oh wow your name is achilia wow what a cool name 1023 okay to that I say well done if you can go from that to plus 300 that is character Improvement we like that you know what I'm just gonna say this right now this next game of guess the ELO will never be what this game was I'm very sorry that you have a you have a very tough act to follow after that but that was a that was a ridiculous game I'm I'm wow wow it just wow games okay D4 C6 this is what we call a Karo Khan fiend so you know some people are addicted to their phones some people are addicted the to uh to alcohol you know that's not good the drugs God forbid some people are addicted to the Karo Khan I was actually one of these people a long time I um uh I I I used to play this and I would play the slav like this um um I wanna what did you say you had a tournament recently and you won a trophy can I thank you what am I thanking you for you should be thanking me I I mean should I be congratulating you what am I thanking you for thank you for winning the tournament I thank you I guess congratulations it's huge congrats I mean did you win it like an impressive tournament or did you show up like you know I walked by the soccer field sometimes football field and I see five-year-olds and I and I tell my my wife like I'd go smoke them right now I'd go right I'd score on all of them they're trash but they're five you know what I mean I like I destroy a field of five-year-olds in football I mean I'm much better than them but if you go to a tournament and you beat a bunch of five-year-olds it's you know beating kids is fun okay night of F's in chess um this is not the right move you're supposed to play E6 um okay you play 86 a little later okay this is this is the Gotham sub Caro you're just losing now E6 is just yeah you're yep oh oh that's insane I can't believe you saw that wow what okay that's not a good move there was no need to play that and you gotta make progress in the position I like to tell you all eight times out of ten the best move is not going backwards what take with the pawn is it what did they do they thought Knight before Oh God King B8 get out of the pin get out of the pin get out of the pin king B8 oh my God play the move King to B8 play fun you don't have to do anything don't don't listen to me uh you have a mate somehow where's the where's him where's the mate Rook H1 Rook H1 Rook C1 nice take take only six okay so this was just a murder you just committed a murder in this game that's what you did I mean it was a fun game kind of for you I don't know what you're doing with the bishop but okay okay and I'm assuming you won on time here I'm assuming that's what happened is that is that well the good news is game four delivered the bad news is game five was a bit boring but um this was again another very well played game I would not rush with the move F6 in the Karo Khan but you made it work you almost played a perfect opening by the way I mean night before is a ridiculous move uh night before is uh to play night eye sixth night before really clever um really really clever um oh you're game three oh Chad boss man well I uh I'm sorry I called you 700. um yeah I must say like 1300. I'm gonna say like 12 1300. I'm gonna say 12 1300. that's that's what I'm saying and I'm saying it and I'm saying it and I'm saying 12 1300 a grand master oh my God oh my God I'm done bro dad is the Stu this was the stupidest episode of guess the ELO I have ever seen ah you guys can entertain yourselves I'm good I'm foreign
