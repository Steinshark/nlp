let me get this straight this is a computer and this is its monitor this raises a lot more questions than it answers like what's a J series Intel CPU and how on Earth did this raise over a million Canadian dollars on Indiegogo people really really small and a mouse this small look s like this tiny Segway PDQ automate patch management and software updates with PDQ search their library of over 200 ready to deploy applications and install software zero touch from your desk start your free trial at pdq.com LTT holy crap incredibly a fully fully cheered Windows 10 compatible PC complete with USBC power in three USB 3 ports a Micro SD reader HDMI out and even a headphone jack I know you can't take that kind of thing for granted these days but it's not even the computer that impressed me the most it's the accessory package it comes to us from a company called xdo.ai who completed their Indiegogo campaign way back in 2021 but only now appears to be actually shipping units out to their backers this thing in my hand is an accompanying Pico projector that seems to have well everything you'd expect HDMI input power button 5 volt power in ah little cover for the lens and even a built-in speaker if the audio controls anything to go by and it's not just that it's one of those adorable retractable cord mobile Mouse's Mouse it's not going to be a contender for world's smallest gaming PC shout out basically homeless HDMI to Mini HDMI cable we'll be using that for our setup little tiny tripod wow it comes with a remote okay what else am I looking at here oh stuff they seem to be engineering themselves other stuff they seem to be pretty much putting a sticker on and if you're wondering what leads me to the conclusion this is simply a re-badged product well for one thing it's USBC which isn't even compatible with the Pico PC so it comes with a c to a adapter and for another why would you add a Micro SD card reader to a product that has a trans flash card reader I mean hey look I'm not saying no to more expansion this is a really nice little carrying case though if the whole point is to have a little tiny computer why am I carrying it around on this there's a smaller version of the case whoa okay this is more like it I can have my whole computer my mouse my projector holy crap they're gonna have a lot of fun with this thing oh it's a battery Bank oh no way I didn't even notice that is awesome oh I'm loving this can I get my keyboard in here I don't know if I would describe this as the most cohesive ecosystem this cable apparently allows you to power both the projector and the computer off of the battery pack we'll take a closer look at that later first I want to crack this baby open whoa what a disappointment I brought my lethal tiny prototype LTT storage screwdriver and it's still not really a Precision driver it's more intended for hard to reach spaces bummer instead of directing you can't buy though I should direct you to the short circuit hoodie oh actually that would be way better oh oh oh amazing you guys ready for this what this is bizarre they recommend configuring your Pantera PC not that one different Pantera with a larger SSD than you think you need which seems to suggest that it's going to be really hard to change after the fact if you end up needing more capacity but in fact that couldn't be farther from the truth this is just about the easiest Mini PC SSD swap that I've ever seen three plastic screws one fairly easily removable rubber gasket and then a single screw it's right there this is awesome yup that is about as generic as it gets it's called solid state drive lowercase state capital solid Capital Drive you might say it's a solid Drive no company that I recognize on either the controller or on the nand flash and it does not have a dram cache though that doesn't really surprise me at the price point for this system aside from being extremely small in size it's extremely small in price it should be noted though that that's early bird pricing if you gave them your money a year and a half ago the actual MSRP for these things is going to be 219 for the base model and go up to 399 for the 8 gig ram one terabyte storage model oh there's little plastic pins no this isn't so bad I won't break it don't worry I'm not gonna break it Jake oh hey there we go oh my God this thing is so cool there's our CMOS battery it's got a mid frame to separate the two boards from each other this appears to be the i o board if the label is anything to go by this appears to be a Micro SD card reader controller right here we're looking at a real Tech chip of some sort if I had to guess I'd say that's to do with the onboard audio USB 3 no idea though I suspect at least one of these ribbon cables is carrying a pcie by four signal for this m.2 slot it's SATA oh what the heck is an Intel J series CPU what we're looking at in here is a quad core CPU that runs it up to 2.7 gigahertz Burst 2 gigahertz base meaning that this thing could actually be reasonably capable if only I could get at it ah I see the screws the specific model is the Celeron j4125 and it is obviously designed for extremely low power applications it only supports a maximum of six pcie Lanes at Gen 2 speeds in spite of being actually relatively current product and it sips power at a 10 watt TDP in spite of its 14 nanometer manufacturing process there are a couple of smart things I see in here first of all the wireless and Bluetooth chipset here has the antennas glued onto it not in a like malicious anti-rite to repair way but in a hey we really don't want these to come loose in shipping because this is going to be a real nightmare this is super cool and then the air intake is basically handled through a grill right here that has a little stopper to make sure that it never gets compressed and blocks the fan from spinning and then there's a tiny Gap just enough I guess to get air to that 10 watt CPU that can then be exhausted out the side of the unit through uh yes this vent hole I can't believe how much computer is in here my gaming desktop when I met Yvonne was in a Silverstone tj07 and had a quad core CPU and 8 gigs of RAM what is this for lighting it has lighting nice this is awesome it's shockingly serviceable you know what Jake this m.2 slot is not keyed for SATA only there's no way that they would they would just use a SATA key to m.2 slot wow it's so little oh no this is too small you know what if I just put it in here I put a little one terabyte Sovereign Gen 4 Drive it'll probably work oh I can't use the keyboard in the Bios because it's Bluetooth holy no way running into my windows installer which is good whether or not it's going to detect the nvme drive is a whole other story come on ah drive not detected portable look at that it's got the blue lights that little cooling fan in there and watch this boom taller tripod oh yeah oh yeah it's got Auto Keystone uh it's not the brightest thing ever oh no way the projector is also running what Android I guess oh there's no batteries in the remote for the projector thankfully I have these handy dandy buttons on the top shut up is this a mouse it's a mouse it's a mouse Andy it's a track pad on the top are you kidding me yes I have a focus wheel oh that's sharp oh no way I could rear project and then I could put this in front of me and point it and sit behind the curtain oh there it goes given that it took a full minute to get to the sign in screen I think I'm done with the Android aspect of the projector let's switch to our HDMI input and try our Pico PC okay I'm triggered by the fact that their USB ports are upside down of what is normal we're having a very hard time getting clear text out of this projector the issue is that the native resolution is 854 by 480. wide VGA I'm imagining a d sub connector walking through the Halls just getting wider and wider uh this mouse wheel does not have a oh it does have a middle click that is the heaviest middle click it's usable that's usable I mean the enter key is not really where it's supposed to be but it's usable would I take this to a coffee shop not unless I was trying to start a conversation with all the dudes with facial hair there and the projector is way louder than the computer their Indiegogo is amazing a new era of personal computer New Era Jake why would you build a computer when you can have this perfect for work from home use their expandable storage 4K UHD video output works as a game center note they don't say gaming PC yeah I don't think we have enough CPU to even like download us oh wow okay okay we're looking at about 60 CPU usage downloading at 150 megabit and more impressively our poor SSD is at 50 usage just downloading Counter-Strike to be clear if you wanted to use this as a thin client for streaming say for example with steam link I don't see any reason why that wouldn't work with reasonably current HD graphics HD graphics though it's only downloading at 10 megabytes a second look it's not about being privileged or whatever it's about the capabilities of the product it is only 10 megabytes a second not 16. when the cable is plugged into can carry 115. okay 122 then if you want to be super pedantic about it this SSD may be slower than a hard drive okay here we go CS source what kind of FPS let's go how did he know I was using this computer oh come on Hacks oh my God I just got headshots I can't even see anything and the latency is actually not bad very usable oh my God you can't be moving the display around while I'm trying to game here I could get one kill okay I'm gonna get one kill no now come on they're everywhere I can't even tell what team people are on though everything is just a moving black blob KTV like like that BBK like one plus BBK this is pretty slow for a wired connection can we watch a 4K video though the answer is yes while I can't say that I would necessarily recommend the projector as anything more than a toy for the kids or I mean I guess their pitch for it is it's for in an emergency doing a presentation or something like that the computer itself actually kind of an interesting value proposition obviously it's underpowered compared to other small computers but it's also underpriced compared to other small computers there are performance deficiencies the SSD isn't great the CPU leaves a lot to be desired and frankly the fan on it isn't exactly silent but at the cost and size its competition is probably closer to an Intel compute stick than it would be to a full-size desktop PC or even a laptop and if all you're gonna do is watch YouTube videos and do basic word processing there is no reason that especially the windows 11 compatible version couldn't last you for years it's kind of compelling like this compelling message from our sponsor flow slope that's right we're talking about flowplane.com our own streaming service that delivers you content from creators
