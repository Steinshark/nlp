hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be looking into five unique aspects of the gordon marae t50 that differentiate it from every other supercar on the market jumping right into it number one and perhaps the most important is the design philosophy gordon marie wanted to build the best driver's car period the formula is pretty simple lightweight central driving position naturally aspirated v12 manual transmission and rear-wheel drive the formula sounds great but it's actually a rather difficult thing to market what are you going to brag about the v12 is small and not all that powerful the manual transmission seems pathetically slow in comparison to today's stupid fast dual clutch transmissions people don't care nearly enough about weight but they do care about horsepower and 654 horsepower can be found in family sedans these days when other companies are making new supercars they're picking what they want it to be good at the best track car the quickest acceleration the highest top speed but these accolades only last for so long and they don't even mean that the car is fun to drive but they're bragging rights when it comes to buying super supercars there's a lot of ego involved marketing teams obviously know this so cars are flashy exotic and break records to make talking points and while i certainly admire the engineering that goes into it many of these exotics aren't all that special to drive so why is this t-50 good simply put because it's fun i've had the privilege to be able to drive hundreds of different cars and from my experience the amount of money you spend on a car doesn't determine how much fun you'll have driving it and while the t50 is silly expensive it says forget the records we're building something rewarding to drive it's not about ego it's about having fun and that's the edge it has over all the other super cars today number two is aerodynamics something super special about this car which you've probably heard countless times is that it can actually flap its wings very quickly and fly fly away okay that's a lie but what is true is that like the mclaren f1 before it this is a fan car but this time the fan is much much more prominent and here's the thing it's fully functional and it's fully cool but it's arguably a very insignificant portion of what makes this car great to me the big fan is the marketing stunt of this car it brings in the eyeballs and again it's functional but you'll notice the actual downforce figures aren't really talked about i did a little bit of math and the results are underwhelming so it's underwhelming but it's also very cool so of course gordon murray is famous for designing the fan car used in f1 and the design for that is pretty rudimentary basically you have an engine powered fan at the back of the car you have really low side skirts and so it turns the car essentially into a vacuum cleaner it's sucking itself down to the ground creating a really low pressure underneath high pressure on top and so you have lots of downforce you can go around the track very quickly this is a bit more different of an idea it's not looking to suck the car to the ground rather it is altering how the boundary layer attaches to this diffuser so there's a diffuser at the rear of the car and there are some slots and valves in that diffuser and it uses the fan to control the boundary layer so what this diffuser does is it rakes up and so it forces that air to move up with it expanding back to atmospheric pressure and by doing so accelerating the flow under the car decreasing pressure and creating down force now the problem with the rake on the diffuser used in the t50 is that it's extremely steep and so the boundary layer doesn't stay attached instead it just creates turbulence within that diffuser so what the fan does is there's these valves and the fan sucks that turbulent air out of that diffuser so that that boundary layer is controlled and you have the air move along that very steep rake of the diffuser and thus increase the actual useful downforce now there are six different modes for this electric fan and the one that creates the most downforce is braking mode so in braking mode it tilts the spoiler up to 45 degree angle really punching into that air it accelerates the fan to a high speed and it opens up the diffuser valves to pull out that turbulent air and have that boundary layer connect with that highly raked differential and so what this does is it doubles the downforce which sounds extraordinary right double the downforce but we don't know how much downforce that is and so we're gonna do a little bit of math to kind of figure out an idea a ballpark yes of what it could be because they do provide that from 150 miles per hour using this braking mode this high downforce braking mode they're able to decrease the stopping distance from 150 miles per hour down to zero by 10 meters and 10 meters is certainly a lot but 150 miles per hour is also a very high speed so for example let's say you have a car that can decelerate on average from 150 miles per hour down to zero at a rate of 1.35 gs and this is very good so if you're able to decelerate at that rate you'll be able to come to a stop from 150 miles per hour down to zero in 557 feet now using this brake mode they're able to shave 10 meters off of that distance so we subtract 33 feet we're at 524 feet so as you can see the braking distance overall isn't that dramatic of a difference because we're stopping from such a high speed so our deceleration rate here to get back into units that we can all agree on will be 1.43 g's so we're only increasing the maximum deceleration by .08 g's in other words we're maybe adding i mean the car weighs about 2 200 pounds maybe we're adding 200 pounds of downforce by turning on uh you know this breaking mode so it is meaningful yes but it's probably not nearly as significant as the marketing statement that this fan has had uh you know that it's a fan card and that's so prominent of a feature there on the back of the vehicle now one of the really cool things about it is a mode that it has called streamline and so it will tilt this spoiler down negative 10 degrees it will increase the fan speed and it will close off partially these diffuser valves right here so you're mostly stalling that diffuser and by doing so it basically extends the length of this vehicle using like an air pocket behind it and accelerating that air from above the car to behind it so in doing so they're able to decrease drag by 12.5 percent which of course is great for reaching high top speeds or getting excellent fuel economy probably the fuel economy they're going for they're not the top speeds right so a little bit of a marketing stunt but at the same time there actually is some usefulness to this and also high downforce cars tend to have terrible ride quality because down force increases with the square of speed and so what that means is if you have a car with really high down force at high speeds its downforce is going to be so high so it has to have a really high spring rate in order to support the vehicle and in doing so you still have to use that really high spring rate at low speeds that's why you know there's some clever inventions like the ford gt that has two separate springs that it can switch between essentially so that you know when you want that track mode it's stiffly sprung with high down force and when you want to drive on the street it's softly sprung so this car what it's doing is increasing down force at low speeds decreasing downforce at high speeds giving you a more linear response not all that much of an increase in downforce and as a result you can use softer springs and the ride is better number three is weight and this is really where the t50 just blows everything else out of the water so you know looking at some popular cars here porsche 918 3 602 pounds mclaren p1 3 400 pounds laferrari uh you know 3 500 pounds the t50 is under a thousand kilograms less than 2200 pounds i mean it's absurd how lightweight this thing is and the thing is uh there's a quote gordon murray said which i really enjoyed he said if the car is light you don't need a big engine so you're probably looking at these cars and saying but yeah jason all of these cars have like 900 horsepower uh so you know that's that's why they're heavy they've got so much power and it's like yeah part of it is but they don't need to have that much power if they were lighter and you can prove that point by looking at the weight to power ratio so for the porsche 918 there's 4.1 pounds per horsepower for the mclaren p1 3.8 for the laferrari 3.7 and for gordon morris t-50 3.3 so although it only has 650 horsepower it has a significantly better power to weight ratio than the holy trinity there so pretty pretty amazing from a weight standpoint the engine only weighing 178 kilograms the carbon tub and all of the body panels combined just 150 kilograms less than the engine pretty absurd the transmission 80.5 kilograms so they've done an insanely good job on keeping the weight of this vehicle down now here's the tough question do cars need to be light and from an engineering standpoint and from a marketing standpoint i think the real answer is no and that's the unfortunate answer uh but it's kind of the reality today's tires are so good uh and cars like the shelby gt500 prove that you can have an insane amount of weight and still have insane cornering insane acceleration insane braking so today's tires are very good and heavy cars uh don't really you know show how how bulky they are because of such incredible you know suspension and tire tuning that goes into these vehicles the the thing that you can't really show about weight is that it's more fun and if you go ride a go-cart you know you realize that not having any weight you're like wait a minute this is super fun everything is super responsive it's very quick to act and you can feel that but it's it's a bit more challenging to quantify uh and so there's there's a playfulness that comes with lightweight cars that makes them really fun to drive but that's a tough thing to market moving on to number four is the very special engine used in this car so it's a 65 degree 4 liter naturally aspirated v12 now you may hear it referred to as a 3.9 liter if you look at the actual displacement it's 3.994 so this is absolutely a four liter engine um you know i'm not i'm not great at many engineering things and i would say gord murray is better than me probably all of them except for rounding i definitely beat him here on rounding because 3.994 that goes to four liter that's a four liter engine regardless 654 horsepower at 11 500 rpm the most horsepower per liter in a naturally aspirated road going car today 344 pound-feet of torque at 9000 rpm and 71 of that torque is available at just 2 500 rpm so even though it revs to 12 100 rpm it still has torque at 2500 rpm which is pretty impressive about 244 pound-feet the velocity of the piston 25.7 meters per second very fast not the fastest out there but very fast so why is naturally aspirated why is naturally aspirated the best well i think there's three reasons first of all response you don't have lag things like turbos which cause delay and when you put the pedal down and when you actually get power so naturally aspirated has insanely good response it has insanely good control so where your foot is on that throttle pedal determines how much power you're making how much torque you're making and it's not this weird sponginess like turbocharged cars get and even superchargers where you have bypass valves and you have to wait a little bit for that torque to come on and then finally sound and this one's subjective but are you really going to argue that naturally aspirated v12 doesn't sound good i don't think you are i mean they just sound great and you don't have turbo chargers blocking that beautiful sound finally number five we get to the manual transmission yes a three million dollar car that's coming with a manual transmission that is a beautiful thing so i looked up because i was curious uh what semi-exotic cars in the u.s could you still get with a manual transmission only three popped up aston martin vantage a lotus aboard gt and a porsche 911 that's about as exotic as you can get and still have a manual transmission so that's sad everything's gone on to do a clutch and actually this wasn't going to have a manual transmission but the customers told gordon murray hey we want a manual transmission and so he did it and i think that's a beautiful thing so i'm not sure what the inside of the transmission looks like i've kind of just made it up here but essentially you have your engine i'm saying the input bevel comes first then you go through the gears one through six that's number two right here and then you have a final drive to go through before it goes to those rear wheels so the gearing on this if you do the math based on the tire size and look at that first gear is accelerating up to about 64 miles per hour that's assuming that my layout's right and you actually pass through the gearing the way i believe that you do but 64 miles per hour in first gear which normally i'd be like hey that's dumb why do we have such tall gearing and i'll get into why i'm mildly okay with it on this also that's going to help them with their 0-60 and their 0-100 kilometer per hour so i don't think they're oblivious to the fact that people care about 0-60 uh hence first gear will accommodate that second gear up to 86 third to 115 and so on the final top speed he says is probably going to be somewhere around 227 miles per hour now why is it okay that first gear accelerates all the way to 64 miles per hour well because i believe first second and third gear are all traction limited so what do i mean by that well if you have 344 pound-feet of torque at 9000 rpm and you multiply that by 1.688 and then you multiply that by second gear which is 2.095 and then you multiply that by the final drive ratio and then you divide by the radius of your tire which is about 1.125 feet you get 3434 pounds of force that you are pushing this vehicle forward with now the maximum force that this thing can actually accelerate with assuming you could put all of the weight on those rear tires uh a load transfer under acceleration will be some multiplier of its weight so you know maybe 2 400 pounds or something like that versus this has 3 400 pound force available in second gear so it's able to do wild burnouts uh in second gear starting in second gear from a stop and i believe it could even do that in third it kind of will depend where you are in the rpm band but essentially if you're traction limited in first second and third uh it's just kind of they're just kind of fun gears at that point doesn't really matter which one you're in but you can start off in first and it won't be so ridiculous as far as like the tall engagement so first second and third probably can all spin the tires super easy that's awesome and as a result i'm okay with the tall gearing there how wild is this car so it's just extremely cool and the design philosophy behind it is awesome i love how clean it looks i love the simplicity of it low weight rear wheel drive naturally aspirated v12 manual transmission i do think the fan is mildly gimmicky only because the effect that it has isn't all that extreme and you can see the overall clean appearance of the car and then you know they throw this massive fan on the end which i think looks cool i do think it looks cool but you know from the design philosophy of let's keep everything simple and then all of a sudden there's this giant fan on the back it's like well that's not exactly simple that's a talking point that you're going to show to your friends and they kind of admit you know it has a test mode where you can have it flaunting its stuff and showing off to your friends so so it kind of is a marketing piece as much as it is an engineering piece the cool news is that it's genuinely functional the fan does work to help decrease drag or increase downforce depending on what you're going for thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or
