LTT is in big trouble I mean I've done my best to hide it but if you've been paying attention the writing's been on the wall for a long time there's the out of control spending on the lab when our overpriced Workshop already sits practically unused we've seen long time employee turnover like never before and the community's been watching my mental health decline in real time trust me bro I mean

make our methane emissions the lowest in the world the best part is that unlike our Labs team who needs specialized knowledge to operate our overpriced equipment any passionate LTT enthusiasts can apply to join our happy team here at Uncle Linus's potato farm okay uh farming potatoes might not tax your brain but it can tax your body which is why we have a dedicated medical team right here on site that way any pioneers who get injured or just get plain plump tuckered out can continue to contribute to our great cause in the best way that they can everyone's just so happy working here that leaving the farm for food or family visits it's entirely unnecessary which is why we keep a well stocked Larder full of fresh produce and feed bags now some potatoes just don't live up to our high quality standards but throw no potatoes that's like throwing away money which is when it hit me we can take our sub-optimal potatoes and combine them with other things to make raw organic dog and cat food after all why should only humans participate in the farm to table experience maximize production we need to keep our Workforce energized according to importedjuicexchange.com alpaca secretions are jam-packed full of stimulating compounds add a few secret ingredients from an old family recipe and you've got yourself a refreshing tonic that is just chock full of electrolytes keeping our

delicious nutritious highly profitable produce including medicinal herbs and plants to help keep our medical staff well stocked with naturopathic remedies and of course to sell on specialty markets of course nothing's 100 efficient and sometimes things break but why spend money on replacement parts when we can simply make them that's where our 3D printing Farm comes in with these we can fabricate anything we need on site while also contributing additional Revenue thanks to the custom design orders we take from our community I've also extended offers to neighboring Farms to make whatever equipment they might need but well some of our neighbors don't want to be friends apparently they don't like that I bought this farm and they think they could do a better job of managing it themselves but their arrogance blinds them from seeing what the ambition of Uncle Linus will accomplish no matter in time we're going to show them exactly what we're capable of the best part of the farm is self-sufficiency our Pioneer uniforms are made of reused potato sacks that you can buy on lttstore.com we turn the potatoes into potato flour we get cheese and meat from the livestock and then all we
