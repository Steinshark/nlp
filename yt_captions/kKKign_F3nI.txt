there's a secret backdoor in big tech companies if you aren't getting that job it's probably not because you're not smart enough in fact coming from a kid that used to be in special ed and now works at microsoft you're definitely smart enough i spent thousands of dollars generating some resources to help you enter this back door stick around to the end seriously you're not going to want to click away stumbled upon this back door accidentally my friend was working at uber i referred him to microsoft but he didn't get the interview months later i discovered the back door when i tried it with him my manager ended up offering a salary 20 above market so why wasn't he giving the interview the first time around big companies use what's called an application tracking system or ats for short and ats basically compares your resume against the job posting and spits out a score of how well you match that job many people think the referral lets them skip this process that is not true referrals are a scam it doesn't actually put their resume in a separate pile it just barely bumps their score in fact that's putting it nicely since everyone wants to work at fang the referral means next to nothing for newgrads and it means literally nothing for interns i'm working on a video how to hack the ats but the back door is to completely bypass the ats so how did i do that with fred fred didn't get the interview the first time around because his resume didn't scan through the ats well my referral had almost no impact on his score i knew a manager that was hiring for a position so i directly emailed that manager my friend's resume and he replied this candidate is perfect why haven't i seen them before what we really need is somebody physically to look at our resume not a machine when getting a referral always tell them your resume doesn't scan through the ats well and ask them to directly email your resume to the hiring manager give them a pre-typed email and the hiring manager they should be sending it to so all they have to do is click the send button jason i've tried getting referrals nobody's responding to my messages or emails well yeah but that's because your emails and your linkedin messages absolutely suck as i was filming this two people reached out to me on linkedin asking for referrals now let me tell you why they did it wrong don't forget we've got ridiculous resources for you at the end of this video when you're reaching out to someone they don't know anything about you and you're asking for something and offering nothing in return nothing instead reach out to them and ask something specific about their life about their past about their career connect with them about what school they went to what city they're living in also offer to take them out for lunch or dinner if they live near you of course offer to pay too don't believe me well i a b tested this theory i collaborated with a few self-made millionaires i know to come up with this template hey hey my name is jason and i'm really interested in blah blah blah i think i'm a qualified candidate for the role would you be willing to help me with a referral i'd be happy to send you my resume i get messages exactly like this a few times a week option b hello name i noticed on your profile something from their profile i'm really curious how you went from there to current position i've noticed you're in seattle too if you're free this week i'd love to grab lunch and chat about it on me of course it's led to a 47 increase in message response rate many multi-millionaires i've met over the past few years tell me that everybody just wants to take take take take many of these connections i've made because i offered a meal or a drink of like 20 value just 20 imagine the power when you utilize it against regular devs and recruiters you'd be stupid not to do it but wait the average recruiter only looks at a resume for six seconds so how do you get them to look for any longer than that well how about custom made resume templates that match the company's biggest product a facebook resume that looks like a facebook feed a google resume that looks like google search we've drafted up resumes like this for all the big tech companies and these really stop recruiters in their tracks they really can't look away if you want these resumes all you have to do is go to hiredfortech.com and enter your email now there's two things you have to know if you're going to use these resumes the first is that these are more valuable the more scarce they are so we're going to be giving these out in waves and the earlier you sign up the earlier you're going to get it the second is that these resumes do not scan through the ats system so don't just blindly apply with them what you should do is include this as the second page of your resume or maybe your cover letter recruiters like to be able to quickly reference your resume to grab any information so make sure it's that second page don't forget to subscribe and sign up for the resume templates below i'll see in the next video you
