Michael Lewis your famous Finance author can you explain how the FTX Ponzi scheme happened this isn't a Ponzi scheme like when you think of a Ponzi scheme I don't know Bernie maid off the problem is it's there's no real business there the dollar coming in is being used to pay the dollar going out and in this case they actually had a great real business if no one had ever cast aspersions on the business if there hadn't been a run on customer deposits they still be sitting there making tons of money what the are you talking about ladies and gentlemen today is the first day of Sam bakman Freed's criminal trial and already we have books media tours going on about it most notably from the finance writer Michael Lewis who wrote The Big Short Moneyball and now going infinite which he says is a letter to the jury about the true story of what happened with FTX you had so much access to Sam bankman freed writing this book what ultimately is is the purpose here I realized I had an ambition for the book I saw it as a kind of letter to the jury I mean there's going to be this trial and the lawyers are going to tell two stories and so there's a story war going on in the courtroom and I think neither one of those stories is as good as the story I have now I decided to read that story so you don't have to because historically these letters to the jury haven't gone all that great and turns out this one is no different I had to sit through hundreds of pages of Sam worship a a fantic 60 Minutes interview talking about what a great business FTX was and I was only left with one question what is it about Sam bankman freed that makes Smart people go nuts well I decided to investigate I wondered is it the Bahamas sea salt air is it effective altruism or is it a $40 million Penthouse I think I've got a guess which is why I'm here in the $40 million Bahama Penthouse now I know many of you have questions how did you afford this the truth is I low balled him with ftt tokens and the seller was very motivated so this will be my new base of operations for finding the truth about SPF and we're going to start by looking at one of the last supporters of Sam Michael Lewis and yes the coconut came with the penthouse to understand this interview frankly the whole book you need to know that Michael Lewis started it as like a positive story about CM before FTX collaps right it was supposed to be a crypto like rag to Rich's story about how dreams really do come true but of course then they committed fraud and collapsed and so everyone kind of naturally thought oh yeah he'll just change the book actually kind of an interesting twist except the book didn't change 75% of the book just doesn't mention anything about fraud uh when Michael Lewis does get to the collapse he just believes Sam bankman freed about everything unquestioningly like it's so bad that Sam bankman freed wouldn't even trust himself that much literally Sam is quoted in Michael's book saying and I do think this is a red flag quote in a lot of ways I don't really have a soul in the end there's a pretty decent argument that my empathy is fake my feelings are fake and my facial reactions are fake now compare and contrast that to Michael Lewis describing Sam as the things he was telling me all of which I should say here turned out to be true was incredible so even s SPS believes in SBF less than Michael Lewis does this man is a oneman cheerleader team you've literally got the subject of your book saying I have no soul and my reactions are fake and then the writer just goes this may be the most honest man I've ever met believing this requires so much willful ignorance on the part of Michael Lewis that it borderlines on malpractice take for instance Dan fredberg spf's lawyer who we explained as a history of covering up fraud before for FTX does Michael Lewis mention this at all no let me share with you some of the ways Dan fredberg is talked about here's some quotes in Sam's World Dan Friedberg in his early 50s has been the only important grown-up he was ftxs General Counsel he was also the babysitter he'd sort of gotten swept up by the enthusiasm of the effective altruists I wanted to be a Sam as he put it and by the way being a Sam was a huge compliment to Michael a lot of people wanted there to be a Sam you know there is still a Sam bankman freed shaped hole in the world that now needs filling like that character would be very useful what he represented what he wanted to do with the resources the irony here is again you know who is more skeptical of Dan Friedberg than Michael Lewis Sam bakman freed how do I know this well I got an audio recording from Tiffany Fong a reporter we've talked to before who's been talking to Sam hey coffee so while talking to Sam in April I discovered he was aware Dan friberg's past although he stops short of explicitly accusing him of committing crimes well everyone thought that Dan fredberg was very clearly sketchy so it was very shocking that he was hired at FTX so he's an interesting guy um um because what was he in with ultimate vets or something like that yeah something like that it wasn't quite ultimate vets but it's something like that reputation was like that he was really shady or something like that yeah he did have a somewhat Shady reputation um he's uh uh he's a very good lawyer he's extremely productive um he had extremely good instincts and he would take care of problems that like other lawyers would not think to take care of or not know how to take care of so even Sam bankman free doesn't try to deny Dan's Shady reputation and said Dan would take care of things other lawyers wouldn't like even the guy on tribe is like all right I have to admit he's pretty sketchy so it's insane to watch Michael Lewis put zero skepticism into the characters of FTX is collapse but then watch this contrast that with how much skepticism Michael Lewis brings to the bankruptcy lawyer John Ray like the guy who's taken over the collapse now that FTX is bankrupt quote John Ray expected to see evidence of a crime instead of answering the question Ray launched a blitz Creek of lawsuits against various people to whom Sam had Ed Money the pleasure Ray took in whatever he Unearthed was so infectious that I often didn't have the heart to say I'm not quite sure that you found exactly what you think you found so every step of the way he's just like yeah this guy doesn't know what he's talking about but Sam bankman freed it's so unbelievably condescending the way this book interrogates everyone who had to clean up the FTX mess instead of the you know people responsible but worse Michael Lewis casts himself as like the only truth teller we've all been in the dark but thanks to this man's Mighty powers of the pin he's going to reveal the truth that nobody knew the story of Sam's life is people not understanding him misreading him he's so different he's so unusual I mean I think in a funny way that the reason I have such a compelling story is I have a character that I do come to know and then the reader comes to know that the world still doesn't know Hey guys you're being really mean to Sam don't you know he's really misunderstood did I mention what a good guy he is yet uh he really cares about pandemics and saving democracy sand bankman fre ends up with a portfolio heavily concentrated in two things pandemic prevention because there really are things the government should be doing he took the view that all the big existential problems are going to require the United States government to be involved to solve them and if the democracy is undermine it like we don't have our democracy anymore all these problems are less likely to be solved I have no idea why we're talking about Sam like he's on trial for the Nobel Peace Prize instead of fraud the part that annoys me the most is Michael Lewis doesn't admit the fact that for all the talk about giving the effective altruism really didn't happen you know what did happen paying celebrities stupid sums of money so he could hang out with them he paid Tom Brady $55 million for 20 hours a year for three years he paid Steph Curry $35 million for same thing for 3 years pretty good hourly W he spent hundred and something million dollars buying the naming rights for the Miami Heat arena I don't think so he spent $25 million making a Super Bowl ad with Larry David it's FTX I don't think so for which he then paid Larry David another $10 million you know it's breathtaking what's on that list I don't know what's so breathtaking about that how does this qualify as like this guy's such an altruist you paid a guy $50 million for 20 hours of work and let's not forget by the way part of that money came from customers deposits so just understand as we go into this court case you're going to hear some people try to say that Sam is an innocent well-meaning altruist who bumbled his way into losing 8 billion um of course we all know that isn't true and the people who are suggesting it it seems are allergic to basic research and do not extend the same levels of sympathy that they extend to Sam to the actual victims who they think are just gamblers anyways I can see people watching this saying like come on guys this is Elizabeth Holmes and cargo shorts and this is all a Roose don't fall for the stick this is a bad actor it is a little different supplying you know phony medical information to people that might kill them and in this case what you're doing is possibly losing some money that belonged to crypto speculators in the Bahamas on the other hand this is not to excuse he shouldn't have done that yeah you kind of are excusing it you know ah it was just a few specul in the Bahamas who lost money no it wasn't you know regular people are owed money that's kind of the whole point of this thing partially because of all of those influencers who were hired whether it be on YouTube Sports influencers they weren't just appealing to the Bahamas those Super Bowl ads didn't play in The Bahamas play in the United States baby this whole interview got me as you can tell a little bit steamed which then made me read the book cuz I was like you know probably the book's better but that actually made me more angry and it literally put me back to work on this case I'd been working on a different project thinking uh you know the S SPF stuff is kind of open shut the normal Finance writers can handle it but I was wrong so I'm back I'll be watching this case like a hawk and you know we'll be covering it for the $40 million Bahama pin housee but I may even fly up to New York just to make sure there's no funny business make sure Michael Lewis isn't in the courtroom petitioning the jury for a lighter sentence on his baby Sam anyways that's it for me Case Closed uh one [Music] star
