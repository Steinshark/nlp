ladies and gentlemen brilliant Sports performances happen every day if that's being generous then they might happen every week every couple of weeks or maybe once a month but generational Sports performances do not happen that frequently and that is why they should be highlighted you see in the year 2014 there was a chess tournament held in St Louis Missouri it had six players only they played each other twice it was a double round robin there were 10 games total and a grand master by the name of Fabiano caruana who was ranked third in the world at the time won his first seven games he won seven games in a row against a monster field that included among others hikara Kamura leavon aronian and Magnus Carlson and in particular one game that Fabiano Carana played in that event was so damn good he called it the best game he's ever played he also said his chess colleagues thought he was cheating before I show you this game and appreciate it let's watch the clip from the man himself this is from the c squared podcast uh which is hosted by Fabiano Karana and Christian Killa and this is what Fabiano had to say about this game cost him no I would say this is the probably the best game I've ever played this is like the this is a um like some players really thought cheated in this game this is the best game I've ever played yeah yeah uh but yeah it's it's not easy to uh are you hearing any of these uh talks during the tournament like only I I found out years later I was actually shocked I was like and also I kind of like I I felt kind of sad as well like I was yeah so Fabiano Carana played a chess game so good some of his colleagues thought he was cheating not necessarily the colleagues involved in the tournament itself some like he said players that he looked up to he only found out years later Fabiano Carana one of the most standup guys in the world of Chess uh frankly probably overall in general uh and this was uh this was absolutely Sensational and uh wow what what what more can you say by the way one small correction I might have to put is the fact that yes at the time that this game was played Fabiano caruano was not listed under the US Federation he was listed under the Italian Federation and leavon aronian was listed under the Armenian Federation now they're both playing for the United States look at that look at us buying nerds as Magnus Carlson once famously said um we're not going to get into all that it's just a joke but Fabiano Carana lean ronian how did Fabiano Carana manage to play a chess game so good and how did he managed to have a per tournament performance of 3100 ELO arguably the greatest Modern Performance of all time well he started with E4 and leavon played E5 leavon ronian is an E4 E5 specialist loves to play symmetrical King's Pawn Plus at the top level this is generally the opening that you're going to get if white plays E4 uh Fabiano played Knight to F3 targeting the pawn in the center looking like your games so far so good you're watching this as a beginner or you're watching this as a uh as a intermediate or Advanced player right Everybody Plays the same stuff but instead of an Italian which is ironic right cuz you know you would think the Italian thing there but uh he plays Bishop to B5 the Spanish targeting the Knight on C6 now we enter the main line This is called morphe defense I don't think anybody on the planet calls this morphe defense it's just called the main line you target the bishop the bishop slides back idea is to slide back to these two squares if necessary but continued pressure on the Knight until black extends with the move B5 Knight to F6 targets the pawn in the center this is all following Mainline Theory until this very moment at this point in the game Fabiano Carana played the move D3 so so he took us down a different path right anytime you travel somewhere there could be one path or there could be multiple paths and the move D3 is taking us down a different path defending the pawn in the center General traditional wisdom in Spanish positions like this one would be to move the Rook to E1 and then black would kick out the bishop play this to safeguard the center white would play H3 to prevent the pin and then try to build up a big center with two pawns cuz that's what you're supposed to do in chess when you play the move D3 you defend your Center but you take away from the other plan the other plan of putting two Pawns in the center so you make a big commitment uh Levon played B5 anyway and then he castled right and then here Fabiano made a very big decision since you've already committed your pawns like this um I mean even even now people do play rookie one and then and then do this but we're talking about 10 years in the past so instead of that Fabby played Knight C3 now Knight C3 is not a popular handling of this position in fact if you notice it's completely different from what I showed you earlier which is Pawn C3 and and pawn D4 and the night generally goes there so this is kind of like this is like a deviance like this is kind of like a naughty behavior in the Spanish you're really not supposed to put the night there the difference is microscopic and it's at a level that is not really understandable to most human chest players but these are not humans these are like Titan chess players white secures more control over over the D5 square that is absolutely true but white does get in the way of these queenside pawns and generally the reason why white likes to put a pawn there is exactly this reason you want to get the bishop out of the way of the Knight but this move is sort of indicating that that move is going to trap the bishop and and a bishop is slightly better than a knight so black plays D6 and now Fabiano plays A3 the idea of A3 is very simple when the Knight arrives I want to get the bishop out of the way so actually I'm very cognizant of Black's idea as well but but I do want to secure control of D5 now at the time this setup had not been played much at all it it in fact it had been played literally tens of thousands of times less than the mainline setup so it was a new idea it had been played earlier in 2013 this was 2014 it had been played in 2013 By A Man Named Magnus Carlson who played it against Peter Sidler in the last round of the candidates tournament the candidates tournament that Magnus won to then play for the world championship he almost lost though he actually lost that game although he had a he had a good position so clearly it was something that the top players were all sort of dabbling in they were dabbling in this right that's the fun thing about Chess like in chess uh new ideas get developed and get trendy among the top players for two to three years very um it's very interesting because I don't think something exists like this in Sp in other sports right like plays and and styles don't get trendy or popular do they I don't know but I always like to read your comments like sometimes I say stuff like that and then somebody in the comments like well actually in rugby this new type of formation is really trendy right now or in football or in tennis or something so I don't know but the point is that this was clearly not the main way to play but it was a way to play Knight comes out to attack the bishop Bishop comes here and black says you know what your Bishop is way too powerful I don't want your Bishop to be a sniper so I'm going to trade it off take take terrific now we see the justification of this idea as well the Knight goes to A5 so now we push the Knight back with this move Pawn to B4 very committed Pawn decision the Knight slides back to C6 and Fabiano develops the bishop to D2 very important by the way that he's developing the bishop to D2 because it could have gone to many other places uh a few moves ago the bishop would have loved to go there so what I mean by that is let's say just Rook B8 or something Bishop G5 and then taking this Knight is actually quite nice for white because white gets more control over the D5 square but in the game you're not going to get control of the D5 Square anymore so it's time to adjust some of you might be thinking what about Knight G G5 and takes that would work if your opponent has brain damage um but we're assuming our opponent has not been hit in the head with a baseball bat prior to the game so um they would just defend you you know one move threads don't really cut it at 2800 Elite level but they might cover you know they might at your level maybe maybe there's nothing wrong with the move Knight G5 so the bishop goes to D2 because there's no point going here because you can't secure control of that square the bishop doesn't go to E3 because it would just be a Target and the bishop doesn't go to B2 because you actually want to defend your Pawn you want to be able to defend your Pawn in the future from any problems plus black could go here and pretty soon you know you're not you're you're not going to get the bishop out like this is just not going to happen so Bishop D2 Fabiano plays Rook E1 Levon tries to break out of the center of the board here with a move Pawn to D5 in every chess position you should be looking at the pawn breaks the opportunities where you can trade a pawn to improve your position Rook E1 Queen D6 defending everything and at this point Fabiano played what's called a novelty all right we haven't seen anything genius yet players are still very much in their notes or their analysis Fabiano plays a move that had never been played before at the time which is Knight to A2 he had prepared this move okay now you're the players here are doing something called keeping the tension white does not want to take because that would UND double Black's Pawns in general unless there's a really good reason you don't want to UND double your opponent's pawns for for nothing right uh Levon is not taking on e4 because then his Master title should be revoked because then he keeps his double pawns and then they're isolated too like at least in this case they're supporting a Pawn Yeah in this case they are just a horrible weakness that will be slowly devoured so they're keeping the tension in the center of the board uh fabbi plays Knight A2 for a multitude of reasons number one he wants to reroute the Knight to the C5 square and the A5 Square which is a very deep idea number two he he wants to overprotect B4 and maybe play A4 in the future I'm just saying these are all these are all ideas number three D4 now no longer comes with a Tempo like D4 used to be able to attack his Knight all of these are ideas all of these are ideas for example if black tries to play A5 it's kind of like a waving a towel right waving a flag in front of a bll now you play Knight C3 right back and you target the pawn on B5 there's a lot of like tricky ideas with this move Knight A2 Levon plays Knight D7 he also reroutes his Knight he opens up his rook and now Fabby plays Queen E2 Queen E2 defends the center and we have a very big question of what's going to happen with these black pawns right the pawns are are jostling nobody wants to give up position nobody wants to capture levon's best option here to continue to maintain the tension is this very Sly Bishop to F6 defending uh uh replacing not defending replacing where the Knight used to stand keeping the tension right maybe white is going to play for the Center and then Knight C1 Knight B3 not sure there's a lot of different ideas here that could happen but Levon plays an extremely committal decision he kind of uh he kind of jumps the gun a little bit he plays this move Pawn to D4 Pawn to D4 is a massive massive decision why it's a massive decision because in chess anytime you you basically lock a position up you have to be certain the lock is better for you than your opponent or at least not worse right if we trade off pieces these pawns suck for black white can go here and here white can zip around this way get in on those squares it's going to be a lot easier for white to Target these pawns than for black to Target White's pawns because White's pawns are all on light squares and that Bishop is not whereas if I get my Bishop there I have a feast in the future so Levon is banking on the fact that he's not going to go that that quickly into an end game right well now he also wants to play A5 and Fabiano comes up with a great idea which is Rook e e to B1 so he shoves his pieces into this ugly little corner but the idea is to prevent A5 because now your Rook would open up with an attack on the B5 Pawn so Rook B1 leavon plays Knight B6 looking to just jump in over here now we see Knight C1 we see the reroute coming to life but Levon purches his Knight on A4 completely shutting down the white position so now we have Unstoppable Force meets immovable object but one more thing we know about closed positions or don't know and now I will share with you a closed position like this a locked Center like this benefits the side that is quicker to create an attack because a locked Center makes it much harder to transfer pieces left and right Rook F7 having said that Levon begins active operations over here now Fabiano plays Rook C1 what yeah Rook C1 one why Rook C1 I mean he just played Rook B1 well Rook B1 was designed to prevent A5 now that the move A5 has been shut down with the Knight The Rook did its job The Rook did its job and now can go here and the threat let's say black plays a move like H6 the threat is to to move the C Pawn in a closed position the side that can control the pawn breaks it's going to be happier he was ready to give up his Bishop he was ready to give up his Bishop because normally traditional wisdom says Bishop is better than the Knight but not in this case remember the more pieces we trade that endgame I told you already that end game is going to be terrible for black the C file is going to be terrible for black so Fabiano plays Rook C1 setting up this idea of playing C3 leavon plays Rook d8 anticipating the opening of the file look at that it's a very it's it's a silent battle you want to play C3 not so fast now Fabby jumps out with the Knight trying to Target the rook and the pawn and trying to get get a trade trying to secure the dark squared Bishop leavon says no now Fabby goes for an attack on H7 and the idea here was to get Levon to commit a move he's trying to either get him to do this and create weaknesses and block his own Rook or play this getting the rook in the line of sight of the bishop now then there's Rook G6 but then there's H4 there's this but then there's Queen H5 back then I come back and again it's all about creating weaknesses so Fabby gets Leon to do this you will remember leevon also made a committ pawn move earlier so he's getting Levon to make committ pawn moves at the 2800 level the smallest of pawn moves can cause problems now there are light squared weaknesses pawns don't go backwards so Fabiano now has something to work with but Levon continues to try to create an attack look at this he he went to B1 he went to C1 he went to F1 leavon is playing Fab's game leavon is constantly responding to what Fab's doing and out of nowhere this is balloon to an advantage couple of moves ago it was dead equal you don't even understand what Levon could have done inaccurately well apparently the move H6 was inaccurate apparently on Knight G5 taking and giving up the bishop was more accurate but you can't these are microscopic levels of inaccuracies Rook F7 now Fabby plays Rook ae1 the Rooks did their job fabbiano transfers the Rooks over this is such sophisticated chess it looks like he's wasting time he's literally do not insult the man he is not wasting time he shut down Leon's position he rendered levon's pieces here as just ceramic they're just standing around they look like they're doing something but now that there's no Pawn breaks and the center is locked it's card blanch and now look at this Pawn 2 H3 the idea of Pawn 2 H3 is brutal stuff Pawn 2 H3 is designed for the Knight to go back and then forward it's a very standard idea in King's Pawn positions in the ru Lopez it's very very common I've seen it before that's just one thing you have to remember chess is not a game of intelligence as much as you'd like to think that way when you dominate your seven-year-old relative in it or your best friend or whatever it's not a game of intelligence it's a game of pattern recognition and I have seen ideas like this you're not going to you're not going to infiltrate with the night it's just not going to happen but if you infiltrate on the G4 Square you cause really really bad damage to the black position so H3 is saying Levon I want to go here and here and at this point Levon realizes oh man I'm in really deep trouble I've been playing Fabiano's game the whole time I made a couple of overly committal Pawn decisions I haven't gotten rid of his pieces in time and I'm not the one attacking this move is so good black might need to sack The Rook black might need to sack The Rook to just prevent the attack but it's still a bad position Levon plays G6 but look at this Fabiano has now made his opponent make three committal pawn moves every pawn move he makes is a temporary fix but it's a bandid for a bigger problem now we have Queen to E7 now fabbi gets another move made by black trying to trade the Queens so he slides the queen back to G3 targeting the weakness the weakness that was just created when Levon moved this queen now Queen G3 attacks the pawn Leon plays Bishop G7 that guards the pawn because if Knight takes E5 Knight takes Queen takes there's a discovered attack Rook F2 it's a very big problem that is not something you want to allow so looks like leavon has done something right but now Fabiano plays what might be his best move of the game what might be I mean he played a couple of these moves the he what he does here is he doesn't prepare anymore doesn't make any Preparatory moves plays Knight A5 Knight A5 is so good the engine needs a moment to appreciate it the the reason Knight A5 looks completely if if Fano played Knight A5 at any point in this game like if you played Knight A5 here revoke the title why would you ever double your a pawns like this why would you do that it's horrible I thought the Knight was there to prevent stuff now black can play C5 and just right no it's not that easy as you can see it's not that easy Knight A5 serves the purpose while it does damage the position horribly like this right while it does damage the position horribly the Knight stops guarding the pawn Black's Pawn the weakness that was created 10 moves ago so Knight A5 is played and now you can just take and Fabiano takes back but he doesn't Fabiano takes the pawn instead that is high level stuff let me explain this to you let me explain this to you in a way that makes sense Fabiano could have taken here and this Pawn is dead but Fabiano didn't like that after this sacrifice he's up material but it's artificial he can't make progress with such a ruined Pawn structure and the Rooks stuck behind pawns so instead of that Fabiano deflected the Black Knight away took in the center and his idea was to take the Rook or the pawn but it's deeper than that the other idea is the Knight now cannot get out of Danger let's not forget the Knight is still hanging Fabiano is gonna take that Knight in a moment maintaining his one Pawn advantage that he just took with pressure on the black position on the rook in the pawn so he knew leevon has to go here he knew that right now levon's got to get his Knight out of the way and say you can take my Rook because normally two pieces which Levon got are better than a rook Levon got a knight and now he would be getting a second night night right and that's generally considered okay that was not Fabiano's intention Fabiano's intention was to make black take the KN lose the pawn in the center run to the corner so Fabiano could do this the idea was to grab two pawns threaten the queen and threaten an attack on the king if this happens now then I got two pawns I got one I got two rook and two seven Knight and Knight six so Fabiano's up material and an attack can commence but Fabiano went here took the pawn on G6 leevon said I'm not going to give up my Rook for the night fabbi said oh you're not well E5 E5 is a simple enough move it attacks The Rook right attacks The Rook takes some space away from the black pieces no it's so much deeper than that you know what it does it stops the knight from re-entering the game Fabiano calculated a sequence here that Pride apart the defense of the black position but it was so ruthless it's like it's like a combination of Magnus and stockfish type of play I hate to say Fab's playing like Magnus cuz Fabiano is clearly the second best chess player in the world definitely In classical chess and in Magnus Carlson's own words so I don't want to say stuff like that but the idea here is absurd this is like this is vintage Fabiano restricting the Knight with deep level calculation and playing F4 and the idea of all of this is the pieces are in a complete cage he has rendered the black position completely useless and these pawns aren't attacking yet but the queen is going to step out of the way in a moment and when the pawn goes to G4 it's time to resign leevon tries to create counterplay with his C Pawn Fabiano dances out of the position The Rook is basically trapped it tries to slide out of the way to Target the Knight The Rook is basically trapped the king slides out of the way of the queen on the G file The Rook is basically trapped I'm telling you it's literally trapped now and these pieces don't have a chance to reenter the game you play Knight C3 I'm just going to ignore you there's nothing there's nothing to do there the king now goes out of the way to h8 trying to prevent Queen G6 Fabiano takes the Rook he takes the Rook because black will either have to play Rook F5 or EF5 allowing an infiltration and a pass Pawn which is fatal so that can't possibly work Knight takes F5 Rook takes F5 H's only up a point of material but the black position cannot defend itself white has one 2 three four and these all count they're about to be five six seven what are these pieces doing nothing they look nice but black is Out of Time Queen G6 every move Fabiano makes creates a problem for black queen E7 there's the pawn there's the next Pawn you can't stop them Fabiano is an avalanche right now he's bulldozing the black position F5 F6 ready to come on the board Queen E8 a lot of players are scared of trading Queens because they think well if I trade you know I'm going to lose my attack I'm going to lose my initiative whatever no not at all not at all you trade the pieces Pawn to F6 we just go to an end game where black just cannot reenter any of his pieces into the game this Pawn is two squares away from queening it is a permanent thorn in the black position so he pushes it all the way to F7 which clears the space for his Rook he's ready to double he's ready to slide out of the way he's ready to put two Rooks on the sixth Rank and eat everybody and by the way he's got more pawns just on top of all of that he's got more pawns the Knight finally finally makes it back to B6 it's the 45th move of the game leavon planted that Knight there 27 moves ago to prevent White's Queens side from advancing and then the Knight did absolutely nothing it never had a time to reenter the game as Fabiano completely bullied the black position forced Levon to make a lot of committ Pawn decisions Queen G6 and now we're down here how do you even defend yourself you can it's not possible Knight B6 you may ask why did he not play King H7 it's hopeless I played this anyway if you take I take you go here Rook H7 you can't take cuz I queen if you go here Rook F1 Rook h8 it's game over completely game it's unbelievable Knight B6 Bishop H6 Knight slides back to D7 now how about this gangster move Rook F1 even though the Knight made it back into the game it was too little too late you can't take here because if you do I'll sneak in here first I'll win this end game Rook F6 takes takes the Knight is still trapped it could play Knight d8 I'll take this and I'll take that c takes B4 a takes B4 and Fabiano wins the game with Rook to H5 Levon could have played on he could have played Knight f8 and tried to keep the game going Rook G5 Rook G8 was game over reason leavon didn't play Rook takes F7 is because Rook H7 would have deflected the look at this look at this it's like a kebab of pieces the Knight never made it back into the game it never made it back the Knight got stuck on B7 completely dominated what a one-sided just a spectacular game from start to finish every pawn move that he made so many instructive things in this game like the fact that the the the side in a close position the side that is attacking right the side that is creating threats is always going to be slightly for choice and every pawn move in a closed position matters so much you got to think about what's going to happen in a position when Queens get traded Knights get traded Rooks get traded right Pawn advancements breaks how Bishop is better than the Knight but not always not always if the counterbalancing ACT is is an open file and damage pawns just a fast fascinating maneuvering game where Fabiano created samide attacking chances Pride apart the defenses against the weakness and rendered multiple pieces obsolete this game was so good in his own words like he said some colleagues behind closed doors were saying ain't no way this man cheated so chess has had cheating paranoia for decades um but this was an unbelievable game this was part of a 7-0 start to a 10 round tournament uh I do have a separate video on it called the best uh chess winning streak of time I only dedicated about 4 minutes in that video to highlighting this game so I wanted to make a proper one I hope you enjoyed now you know what to do get out of here
