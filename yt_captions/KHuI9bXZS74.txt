so we have a line passing through two points a and B and then we also have a Third Point C somewhere over here in this video we'll be driving an efficient way of calculating the shortest distance between Point C and the line and also be seeing how to figure out if two points are on the same side of the line we start with the crucial idea that the point on line a B that is closest to Point C let's call a point D from the line segment with point C that is perpendicular to line a B so our first step is to calculate a vector that is perpendicular to a B let's begin though by first calculating the vector a B itself which obviously is just a vector that points in the direction from A to B and which has a length equal to the distance between those two points so on the x-axis this is B X minus a X and on the y-axis its B Y minus a Y I'll now call the perpendicular vector P and we can calculate this easily since its X component is just the Y component of vector a B multiplied by negative 1 so that's negative B y plus a why while it's Y component is simply the X component of vector a B so B X minus a X now depending on which component we make negative will get either this perpendicular vector or this one as it turns out we really don't care which one it is it doesn't need to be the one that points towards point C or anything so I'll just take the first one I'm now going to calculate the vector AC which of course is just C X minus ax comma C Y minus ay Y I'll then label the angle between AC and CD as theta now in a right angle triangle such as the triangle ACD that we have over here we know from trigonometry that the cosine of theta is equal to the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse this enables us to write cosine theta is equal to CD over length AC we're trying to solve for the length of CD though so let's rearrange this to CD is equal to the length of vector AC multiplied by the cosine of theta now just to clarify when I write CD I'm referring to the length of the line segment CD but of course technically length is always a positive value while here depending on the value of theta CD could be negative I'll be coming back to this later so just keep that in mind for the moment I am now going to draw the vector AC up here so we can see that it also forms the angle theta with vector P we will now be taking the dot product of these two vectors hopefully you are familiar with the dot product it has two forms the first tells us that a CER dot P is equal to the length of AC multiplied by the length of P multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them the second form tells us that AC dot P is also equal to the X component of AC multiplied by the X component of P plus the Y component of AC multiplied by the Y component of P now if you're not familiar with the dot product you might want to look up a proof for this because certainly for me at least it's not at all obvious that these two equations are equivalent anyways if you're satisfied that they are then we can continue so notice that the right side of our equation for C D is very similar to the right side of the first equation for a C dot P in fact if we multiply both sides of our equation for C D by length P we get that C D times length P is equal to the dot product of AC and P so we can now just substitute in the other form of the dot product which is easier to calculate in this case let's now isolate CD by dividing both sides of the equation by length P we can then substitute in the calculations for the different components of the vectors so the X component of AC becomes CX minus ax the X component of P becomes negative B y plus a Y and so on all we have to do now is calculate the length of P which is just done using the Pythagorean theorem square root of x squared plus y squared now remember how I said that CD could be negative depending on the value for theta well if we want the actual positive length we of course simply take the absolute value of the result now this equation gives us the shortest distance between a point C and the line passing through points a and B so let's includes the main part of this video but there are two further things I want to mention first of all it's sometimes the case that we have multiple points and we don't care about their actual distances from the line we only want to sort them based on how far away they are if this is the case we can of course do the computation a lot more efficiently by leaving out the square root term secondly if we want to figure out on which side of the line a point lies we can use the same equation without the square root term but instead of taking the absolute value we take the sign of the result this will give us positive one if a point lies on one side of the line negative one if it lies on the other side and 0 if it lies exactly on the line so of course if we want to figure out if two points are on the same side of the line we can just compute this value for both of them and check if it's the same all right that is everything for this video Cheers
