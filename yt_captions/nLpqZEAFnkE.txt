my stepdad needs a new car so we're going to go withdraw 1.2 million pennies from banks and buy him a new car using only pennies how many pennies do you guys have i just need all the pennies you have all right guys it turns out bb t is actually really nice and they gave us two thousand dollars in pennies so we're going to load that up rolls of pennies i need as many as y'all have i mean literally as many boxes as y'all can give me so we hit all the banks in my city and the car costs 12 000 so obviously this is going to take forever there's probably not even 1.2 million pennies in my state so we're going to start getting quarters and nickels and dimes from banks because we just can't get enough pennies about like 250 we need to exchange for like any kind of variation of coin [Music] yes ma'am okay now we're headed to the next bank yeah yeah career huh and y'all are going to have it on youtube right yeah i need to get your youtube channel man i love those videos all right guys we are here at the car dealership and uh yeah we have all the coins back here and uh we're gonna buy a car with coins if they let us the dealership's right there we have these wheelbarrows we're gonna fill these things up with all these coins and we're gonna walk in there we're gonna buy a car see these they're impenetrable they're little [Music] look at this colored coin so amazing we've been doing this for about four hours still going strong hashtag beeps getting holler for life so we were going through the coins and there's actually a japanese yen in there i believe that's what this is i don't know what our government is trying to pull yeah are you impressed by them that's unbelievable that's a decent amount oh good thing i ate my wheaties well that's money yeah that gave me a workout just looking at it you stand right here and we'd be walking this way and then all the cars line up in the background i can't do that bro yes no there's a hill right there all right chris save the noises for later we finished unwrapping most of this we unwrapped a lot of pennies and then we got really bored and we didn't unwrap the rest and now we're just gonna go in there and hopefully they give us a car i don't know what's gonna happen i highly doubt they'll give us a car it is breaking oh my god that tire i want a relationship as strong as that tire help me already one employee walked up to us what do you think of all these coins that's insane man you guys come over here put your hand through it i mean there's it's all straight change not a dollar bill in there that doesn't sound fishy here's your money thanks for saying it [Music] all right let's go we're heading in oh my goodness all right we're taking a break already don't mind us just buying a car oh there's a hill right here i can do it we would like to purchase a car can you give us a car one car please this jeep right here this one right here so do you guys still have it yeah we do this is twelve thousand dollars so you look counting it i don't know what to do now can we go see it cause i've actually never seen it all right let's go take a look jesse can you make sure they don't steal yeah yeah yeah cause that wouldn't be obvious you should see somebody with a wheelbarrow [Laughter] okay seriously though is it all right if we buy the car with those pennies yeah that's fine is it really yeah that was fun money's money's right that's easier than i thought all right so i gotta ask why why in uh why in pennies and coins uh i'm a coin collector um basically someone told me to buy bitcoin i thought bitcoin did pennies also he moved the couch cushions around and he found a few extras yeah is this it this is it oh really wow that's pretty nice yep it is a 2014 gp trip latitude's got a 98 000 miles on it great condition uh four-wheel drive jimmy it's got four wheels it's got all the wheels it needs i like cars with four wheels he's just laughing like when will they shut shut up by the car he's so confused like why are they doing this um show the camera what do they think about the car do you guys like the car i like it all right we'll take it all right sounds good yep all right um do you want to count the money or how do we do this i mean is that actually 12 000 in in pennies yeah well i mean pennies quarters down it's a mix yeah okay you're not trying to scam us with it or anything i mean i can't say that people do this on a daily basis so i have to figure it out for you i assume you're gonna have to take it to a bank to count it i mean or whatever because that machine counter the bank's gonna love us well you're just giving them back what we just took from them yeah oh there we go they'll be like oh that's what those guys were doing there's a few dollars there like roughly like one or two i appreciate that i counted don't worry you need to bust a lot of piggy banks over this yeah yeah a lot of couch cushions and we hit every bank in north carolina you guys are going to see on the news next day three guys stole every corner from every bank try lifting it up these are insanely heavy oh yeah there's a lot of weight to that oh that's actually kind of gross this is the license plate and whatever he said this was separate registration yeah probably get at least like 10 views right oh i would think so i think we'll get 12 views 12 probably yeah wait how do we get paid
