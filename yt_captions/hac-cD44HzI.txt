ladies and gentlemen this is gonna be a series video now we do these every now and then uh because not every video has to be a ted talk but every now and then it's nice to leave the memes at the door and just go more with hard facts and statistics because you know one thing i've noticed about entrepreneurship finance all these things there's a lot of uh really popular myths that always get spread around and the way to get past those is usually with statistics you know i did this with the trending tab back in the day you know people are so um superstitious about what's on youtube trending and so we just collected the data and we found out what's actually on it and we found some really interesting things and i want to do the same thing here today i think you can do the same thing any in any part of life just look what are the statistics say about that thing and today i want to talk to you guys about um our entrepreneurs and specifically one of the greatest questions of all time she's like how old are successful entrepreneurs there's this really common thought going around you've seen it everywhere not only on the show but even uh more perniciously in popular media that the young founder well they're successful but all uh innovative founders they're young man they're they're teenagers they're high school dropouts or college dropouts or they're in their 20s you know it's people like this you know there are remarkable versions of this which is like self-made millionaire at 20 a global group of enterprises you've seen a lot of this on this show you know you have the ceo of teenage money you have people like this taking advantage of this preconceived notion you have the teen executive you guys have seen this guy there's so much money cryptocurrency may be in the last so how much i made off crypto in 30 days but there's also just like more explicit examples of this in mainstream culture things like the social network where they we follow mark zuckerberg you know this celebrated young founder from college and this is what a lot of people uh think of when they think of a successful silicon valley founder someone who's gonna change the world they're thinking of someone in their 20s maybe 30s but that's basically it and because of this we've had some con men crop up and grain gain credibility because honestly you know like people expect this is the look they think this is the look of the young or uh the successful founder they think it's people who look like stefan keane right he's a ponzi scheme artist who's now gonna be in jail uh they think it looks like this uh elizabeth holmes you guys all remember her and i would contend across entrepreneurship widely there's just this idea that you know if you want to be an entrepreneur you have to rush you have to hurry you have to maybe not maybe skip college or if you go to college you have to start a company right after college right if you haven't could have any chance of being a unicorn uh you know a billion dollar company if you're going to have any chance of making something of yourself there's this huge rush and this is played off of in popular culture in what we see in these like get rich quick schemes and what we see from you know confidence confidence artists and even what we see in media right you have all the 30 under 30s like these are the boldest young entrepreneurs you didn't need to know in 2019 and it's just a bunch of like super young people this is what we think of is what's shown to us for what founders act like look like whatever basically none of this is true in the data the young founder is kind of a myth especially the young successful founder so this is a study by harvard uh they did this in 2018. great read i'll link it in the show notes but they found that the actual age the average age of a successful startup founder is actually 45. yes actually it's perpetuated across all these media companies that uh the young age is these people are actually young like the average tech crunch award is given to someone who's 31 the average age of inc magazine is 29 so we're showing only the young entrepreneurs but in actual fact the average age of startup founders is overwhelmingly not only in the 40s but if you look at the highest growth startups meaning the ones that actually made the difference who actually got past that hurdle and they're the top one percent of companies so they're doing well overwhelmingly they're founded by older guys so that means again if you account for the fact that just more people are starting companies when they're 40 then when they're 20. you also have to account for the fact that they're also more successful than their younger counterparts and this makes sense by the way because of course more experience makes you more likely to be successful that's true across the board with all skills the older you get the better you tend to get so why do we not believe this about entrepreneurship when you go when you track how likely someone is to succeed their likelihood of success with their company spikes in their 40s and my point here is not to dissuade you from starting a company that's not it at all it's to say guys you you can take your time you can have patience entrepreneurship is a long-term game and if you go by the media it looks like something that you can only be a part of when you're under 30 right and if you don't participate under 30 there's no chance you'll be successful and of course the numbers show the exact opposite the more experience you get in a field the more likely you're gonna have to uh have a successful company in the field because you'll know more about it if you go work a job in an industry for 20 years and then go start a company relative you know relevant to that industry of course you're going to be more likely to be successful but that's not what we see in mainstream media and not only that it seems that even the people who invest in these young founders also are sort of confused about this stuff paul graham the founder of y combinator once quipped that the cutoff for young inve for in investors heads is 32 after 32 they start to be a little skeptical so it's not just like entrepreneurs that have this you know thought in their head it's not just young entrepreneurs it's even the investors themselves are sort of confused about what makes someone successful everyone's sort of been led away he pied pipered away from the truth by this you know silicon valley fantasy that the young founders the guys are gonna revolutionize the world are all these young dudes that actually we find out that's completely false even in software by the way like the silicon valley thing the average age is still 40 years old okay even in a place where it's like yeah it's mostly you know the young people are known to you know be more likely to do startups in that field no it's still 40. uh and they're saying that in oil and gas and biotech the average age is closer to 47. the point is not the specifics the point i'm not saying like hey don't start a company until you're 40 you're you know you're 30 whatever what i'm saying is you have time and you have to push back against these not only the con men who are telling you that oh i'm you know successful when i'm 20 years old that's probably not true but also the fact that even these companies who are entrepreneurship magazines or whatever are presenting you a picture of entrepreneurship that is also just completely wrong i think this sentence sums up the contradictory nature of this whole thing uh best if you're faced with two entrepreneurs and know nothing about them besides their age you would do better on average by betting on the older one and yet i bet if you gave that to a bunch of vcs they would probably pick the younger one now the last interesting thing from this article that i want to highlight here is uh they talk about you know the obvious outliers of these young guys who we've lionized like bill gates steve jobs all these guys and basically what they say is that while it's true they started their companies young when you actually look at where they made the most impact how old they were when they made their most cutting edge innovation it turns out they're actually we were very likely to be quite old steve jobs made the iphone when he was 52 they're talking about like you know the amazon's biggest growth came when bezos was 45. the point is is that even among people who were entrepreneurs young they actually also just get better over time because of course they do this makes sense intuitively when you think about it but if you just kind of unquestionably going go with the narrative you're going to be thinking that young founders you know are just getting outside of college and reinventing the world that's not the way the world works so what does this mean for you if you're someone who wants to go into entrepreneurship well it just means that you can relax you can take your time to sharpen your tools to work a job where you might get some experience or you can take your time and realize that most people don't succeed in entrepreneurship until later in life and really understand that that gives you breathing room this isn't to insult young founders this is to say that hey you don't have to reinvent all of humanity by the time you're 29 you don't there's no magical cutoff where we say you can't be you're disqualified from being a great entrepreneur because now you turn 30. in fact quite the opposite is true so to all of you guys out there uh who are entrepreneurs i hope you learned something to those of you who are not i hope you also took something away thanks for watching a serious video of coffeezilla we don't do this too often but let me know what you thought of my ted talk thanks for watching and i'll see you guys next time nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
