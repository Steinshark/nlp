all right you ready why are work culture sucks okay last year after finding myself between two jobs I interviewed with a bunch of startups I stream on Windows shut up okay I can't help it that I stream on Windows okay it's just it's just so much better for video than Linux okay I still can't get my video and audio to even work rarely okay so shut up shut up all right last year after finding myself between two jobs I interviewed with a bunch of startups and Patty all successfully accessible businesses that's good you know I'm not gonna lie to you if you were if you were interviewing with unsuccessful businesses I would change my strategy the creme de La Creme of the French Tech a very French thing to say the creme de La Creme uh looking for experienced developers to con uh consolidate their Tech teams all right I discussed with CEOs and ctOS about their Visions for business project management and Company culture of course welcome to Costco I love you I forgot to turn off alerts alerts are off thank you very much for that I appreciate that boner poll and Juan prito appreciate that bait let's see okay I would often quote the famous base camp books so I don't know the base camp books I don't know what they're famous for I just I've never seen them base camp is a famous project management startup they wrote a series of equally famous entrepreneurship books advocating for a shift in the industry towards a culture closer to their own okay so am I the stupid one or is it not that famous which one I also don't read books and I only shoot shotguns and drink beer is that a problem I also write ATVs or Segways while shooting shotguns and drinking beer is this problematic the Ruby guy okay okay okay maybe both okay could be both shape up remote work rework it doesn't have to be crazy at work getting real all the great books filled with great advice getting real nothing like software engineers talk about hitting the streets and you know getting real hey hey man you know what last week I had to work 50 hours it was awful like I sat down and I got up and sure I had a yogurt parfait and and went after they brought me a hot lunch I was like sleepy and then they made me work even during my sleepy hours dude let's get real here okay the hours of two to four should be reserved for naps at work everyone I talk to and I do mean everyone agrees with the amazing content of these books and the necessity to follow such great advice wow I have never even read the book I feel like I've left out am I really missing out this much gosh there was still a problem no one is actually doing it what is it is it shaping up or getting real what book oh of course shape up remote work rework it doesn't have to be crazy at work and getting real yo a prison Mike uh that's what I'm thinking about right now remote work that's amazing and great and the Future No we don't do that here it's I mean people see first off I've been remote working for about two and a half years at Netflix this is not you can't blanket say this there's plenty of disadvantages to working a remote and there some of them are unfixable they're absolutely unfixable there are I I'm on a team of I think 12 and over half of them have no gosh darn clue what I even do that's part of remote work right remote work by it's like very definition makes it so much harder to you know interact it's just the way it is and anyone that tells you that's not true or if you just change this or that they're lying to you okay we've tried we've tried so many different ways to change that it just base camps advice on project management it's great and we won't change how we do things though their company culture the best and no we won't change ours I actually think that Netflix has pretty good culture so I am curious what theirs is okay can we I want to know what it is can you stop telling me how good it is and just tell me what it is you keep using even the term it all italicized and and stuff what is it the problem with Basecamp books is the following it's great advice everyone knows it everyone agrees on it no I don't remote work is not perfect no one actually wants to apply it yeah what is it I feel so stupid what is it don't get me wrong I'm not saying every company should copy pasta the base Camp Model what the [ __ ] is the prescription model uh what works somewhere might obviously not work somewhere else but there is wisdom in those books and on the approach to work and to life and a wisdom that companies consistently refuse to apply it's the advice in the books duh five head I'm sorry this is a one head take for me not knowing this all right so let's start with an easy example remote work I'm very curious what they have to say because I have a lot of feelings about it how many companies were forced into remote work by the pandemic oh yeah that's okay and realized it was actually great not everyone thinks this advice is great okay not everyone's out there loving remote work you may have heard of Reid Hastings started several successful companies including neetflix I've asked him many uncomfortable questions uh but I'm just saying I'm also I I'm also became a remote worker as well uh but I think the thing is is what he's highlighting is a very interesting points not all positions are easily remotable some things that you do like to okay Real Talk press one in the chat if you are a remote worker and press two in the chat if you're uh like uh in office or somewhat in office two days a week uh person chat one for remote two for uh in office okay so a lot of remoters huh very interesting three yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so follow-up question follow-up question for all the people that hit one I want you to type 69 if you have worked in an office and are now remote due to a pandemic all right so give me a 69 if you've never if you were full-time in office or mostly in time at an office and now remote due to pandemic and then you just kept on doing okay a lot of people people obviously have changed greatly their lifestyle I'm that same person I would be typing 69 right now all right for those that typed 69 I want you to type 420 if you've noticed a dramatic difference in how you collaborate and think through problems meaning how often have you just popped in someone in slack and just start casually talking yeah it is different right it is vastly different the remote work you know some of my best ideas did not come from me alone but it's someone else just saying something about their work or saying something about their weekend or saying anything that I just haven't thought of and all of a sudden it's a lot different but for the better interesting see for me it's like I don't have as many ideas alright so here we'll do one more type one if you think you're solving problems better not because you have more time but because you are having better ideas or two do you feel like you had better ideas or better ways to see things when in an office one for it's better remote two for it's better in office as far as ID ideation goes okay pretty split this is interesting it's pretty split very interesting very very interesting for me I feel like I had better ideas than the office but I'm more productive at home so it's like I'm not sure which one is is right I have much less distractions I don't drive for one hour every day to and fro from work that alone makes a huge difference it makes a huge huge difference that's just more productive I have less [ __ ] on my brain uh I think hybrid is really good yeah higher productivity I'm an introvert okay well I'm I was an introvert I used to mix up my words I had a lot of embarrassment issues I used my body used to sweat all the time I just had a lot of weird things with me and now uh you know things have changed all right all right here we go all right worse how many companies oh hey hold on how many of them uh used to categorically refuse remote work uh Beyond maybe a couple days a week yeah that was Netflix actually and why was that uh because Netflix is a purely senior ran company there were no Junior engineers at that time like none we're talking about none no interns no Juniors no mid-levels all seniors but we also ran on literally one tenth the staff of YouTube so we are a very very very very lean company and you know being able to work with somebody was a very important facet of it I would get up and I'd walk to the API section not go on the slack Channel like walk in and just start asking them questions and you can just do like think about the speed of communication there and the amount of nuance you can get in a spoken conversation as opposed to a typed conversation it's just a lot different uh it was just a lot different back then worse how many companies had great remote work success during the pandemic but will shift back to mandatory on-site work once this is all over even worse many did not wait for the end of the pandemic before doing so see the problem is is it's hard for me to buy this sentence because I don't necessarily think that remote work is a pure win I think it's a loss and a win right like I think there's I think there's there's like it's nuanced right I just hate these one-dimensional takes I heard all the excuses from CEOs and ctOS it's always those [ __ ] fancy sweet sons of [ __ ] it's great it's just not for us for a web development company this is most of the time it is just not true again have you ever had have you ever hired a brand new Junior person right an intern is is remote work great for an intern I would argue that it's almost a categoric negative categorically negative for someone brand new to the workforce to work purely by themselves and only get stuff from when someone calls in and checks on them they're not seeing them struggle they're not there with them they can't sympathize they can't sit down in the same sense they can't turn around and go to a whiteboard and let people go back and forth it's just no matter how good these tools are it's never the same as in-person communication and I feel like you're just you're you're also doing a disservice to people that need mentorship you know how hard it is to get mentorship remotely and even more so how hard it is to find a mentor remotely you can video Call of course you can video call but it's not the same you know mentorships often are because you were in the right place at the right time you were somebody with whom totally just worked out with somebody else and they're just like hey let you know let me help you with this let me help you with this I've seen this happen a lot of times you just can't get the same experience from a you know from a video call I know people are like absolutely you can it's just not the same it's just it's never going to be same I love remote work I love remote work in office has as many benefits as remote but it also like but just the same thing it has as many negatives I don't think there's one I don't think there's a one size fits all most people aren't mentoring most people don't get mentored either mentoring is one of the best activities you can have done to you and it's one of the best activities for you to do if you have an opportunity to Mentor take it you'll change someone's life and on top of that it will teach you about teaching which is a very hard skill to have nothing is going to make you grow faster trying to explain Concepts you know really nothing you know how do I get mentorship well if I was in a company in an office I know how I'd go about it because that's how I did it remotely I honestly I have no idea the perfect balance for me work in a few days yeah I think this is great the best way you can learn is to teach it is one of the best ways I'm already nine years working remotely wow that is so long I love having the academic uh quarter after work just head down in a Pub bar with your co-workers talk about something not yeah I think that that's actually a really good it's just hard to build that with VCS it just really is hard to build that I can't crack two and I can't Mentor you unless if you're in my barn you know what I mean it's always cool when someone you Mentor starts showing you stuff and teaching you new things yeah see it's the turnaround the master becomes the sensei wait the pupil what the hell am I saying uh anyways let's keep on going the problem with uh we don't have infrastructure for remote work what prevents you from putting it into place I mean it can be complicated I mean I I get what you I get I get this argument that we should allow I think remote work has a lot of benefits we've already said that like the truth is that CEOs and ctOS are afraid that again unilateral bold claims going on here and don't get me wrong I'm not throwing any Stones here no you literally threw a stone the they're afraid they're nothing but puppies and they can't handle this all right like that's what that's literally what you're saying right there managing a company is hard and stressful I'm sure I would be afraid as heck too if I was managing a dozens of employees change is difficult and frightening and scary that's understandable still pretending that it's just not for us is a [ __ ] excuse I like how I used heck here and [ __ ] there it's kind of fun like the double the HD double hockey sticks swear word followed up by the uh the actual [ __ ] it's funny it's just funny way of writing just little things anyways uh again it's just so one-dimensional I don't feel like this is a good take what I'm asking you let's see asking is that you would at least be honest with yourself and your employees and take a long hard introspective look at why you don't think remote work is good for you and let's see why would your company be the one exception I mean he really is selling this as if there's not a single drawback to remote work like none ever the first reason why companies are uh let's see uh let's see whoa whoa all right now hold on uh let's see uh is that they fear a loss of communication interaction between employees yeah okay so this is good the other okay that's not a fear I've met very little people that say this is not true uh leading to a drop in Innovation camaraderie and productivity I do think there is an innovation drop off I think it's very hard to innovate in the same way without group I think group is really good and I I again I still think it's hard to be like all right right now is creativity time from 2 to 3 P.M this Wednesday we're being creative and then afterwards we all leave like it's just not the same like that that impromptu creativity is really amazing and it's very hard to create they are afraid that the soap will stop bubbling so to speak that's understandable the problem is it's just not true when well managing it's really not hard to I mean these are all such crazy statements uh does not have does not have these downsides so many companies were forced into this reality because of a pandemic but we had told them before the information was really out there they are just not brave enough to trust the data and take a leap of faith it's like bungee jumping no it's not on the surface level you know it's a it's actually a safe activity uh you have a very resistant elastic rope which will prevent you from crushing in the canyon or crashing the canyon below you know it's safe yet deep down your brain refuses to jump no no understandable still it's not a good excuse remember the health of your company and your employees happiness are at Stakes here you know there's some people okay real talk for I know I already know it's going to be pretty negative or not many people but type one in the chat if you like being in the office for some amount of days a week type one in the chat if you like that experience so it turns out some people are different than other people isn't that crazy how that works out we can all be different people isn't that weird that like I might like being around people and you might not like being around people I know this is crazy I know what's crazy I know you might actually be different than me I'll pull this one we'll do a poll I know it's it seems fake this is probably fake news Alex Jones is probably spreading this conspiracy uh where to work full office uh half and half full remote is that pretty good I feel like that kind of covers most most of the situations when I say half and half it can be a little bit you know it could be like two-thirds remote one-third in office or the other way around maybe it's one day a week but it's something that's mixed right I'm probably half I'm on I'm personally on the half and half side I'm somewhere where I like some time in the office but I also like sometime not in the office you know what I mean yeah not being forced is great all right well look at that number jeez that sure looks a little bit more complicated so it looks like we have some people that just love pure remote work awesome and we have a lot of people that like mixed work and we even have some people that like full office work
