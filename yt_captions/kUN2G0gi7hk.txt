hello everyone and welcome I am sitting inside of a Tesla Model S and I have sat in Tesla's before but I have never driven one not the model three not the Model X and certainly not the Model S that I am sitting in right now and this is all thanks to omae's for sponsoring this video and for providing this opportunity I'll talk more about that a little bit later on but basically they're giving away a Tesla Model S P 100 D and I've got more info in the video description so yes we are starting with the very best never driven any Tesla but why not start with the Model S P 100 D this is super exciting let's go for a drive so just as an introduction what does P 100 D mean well the 100 stands for the size of the battery PEC 100 kilowatt hours which in this case is good for 315 miles of range the d stands for all-wheel drive it's got a motor up front and it has a motor in the rear two motors all wheel drive independent control of each motor and then the P for performance so this is the performance variant of the 100 D which takes it 0 to 60 from 4.1 seconds in the 100 G to 2.5 seconds in this car right here the P 100 D this is the fastest car fastest production car to 60 miles per hour that Motor Trend has ever tested they got it in 2.28 seconds absolutely nuts so how does it do that well let's talk about what's under the hood because it's not an engine it's electric motors and so what Tesla says is it has dual three phase four pull motors 2 3 4 so let's try and understand those numbers the first one is very easy dual simply means it has two motors we get that part one up front one in the back three phase now this is the number of alternating currents that the stator of the motor has so you have the stator the stationary part of the electric motor and the rotor the part that actually rotates stator stationary rotor rotates and so the stator has three separate alternating currents that are creating this swirling magnetic field and that is forcing that rotor the part that actually rotates to rotate in the center and thus power the car so three stands for those three rotating alternating currents for that stator and then the four the four pole means that that rotor the copper rotor in the center that's spinning instead of having just a north and a South Pole and has two north poles and two south poles so it is a four pole rotor so you've got dual three-phase four pull motors so basically what these motors are doing is when you put your foot down you're taking one really strong magnet and you're slamming it up against the same Pole of another really strong magnet so taking south end to South and putting those two magnets together and of course those magnets don't want to be together so it launches the car forward so when you put your foot down you force that magnet to hit another magnet and you're doing all of this using electrons it's wild it's kind of mind-blowing it's crazy it's the future and it's pretty neat actually how it works if none of this is making any sense I do have videos going into more detail about how these electric motors work as well of course include some links to that in the description but the combined total of these oh my goodness I'm sorry the combined total of these two motors 680 horsepower 791 pound-feet of torque you put your foot down oh my goodness that is crazy you might you might call it ludicrous sorry that comment was ludicrous okay so briefly let's touch on how this giveaway works and it's actually really cool because every donation is going to support a big green so big green it's all about bringing education to children about healthy eating habits using learning gardens so they learn how to garden they learn how to grow their own food they learn how to have healthy lifestyle activities and how to eat healthy how to be healthy so a very cool thing that's spread across the country helping kids hopefully lead into healthy lifestyles very neat this is actually a non-profit headed by Kimball musk Elon Musk's brother and so if you donate $10 or more to try and win this tesla p 100 d which i've got a link to in the video description then ten dollars or more you get entered to potentially win this car and you are also supporting big green so worst case scenario you help out some kids best-case scenario you help out some kids and you win this ridiculously fast car now currently all the 2018 Tesla Model S vehicles have all-wheel-drive so they're all either 75 D which is the 75 kilowatt hour pack good for 259 miles of range 0 to 60 in 4.2 seconds so the slowest Model S is still hitting 60 in 4.2 seconds then you have the 100 D with 335 miles of range 0 to 60 and 4.1 and then you have the P 100 D 315 miles of range 0 to 60 in 2.5 seconds now what's crazy about that 2.5 second figure is that this car weighs nearly 5,000 pounds it weighs as much as a full-size pickup truck with double cab doors and with ax and in bed and four-wheel drive this thing weighs a bunch and yet it's still one of the fastest accelerating cars out there period which is just absolutely wild it shows you you know kind of how responsive electric motors are how much torque they have from down low very neat how it works and another cool thing about having all-wheel drive in an electric car is that you can shift where you want that power to be you have independent control of each axle and so for example when you're accelerating oh my you have that rear transfer that weight transfer to the rear wheels and so then the rear motor increases its torque output the front motor decreases its torque output so that you balance that weight control as you have that loading occur on the rear axle now Tesla also claims that this is the safest car ever so how do they come up with this aside from all the five-star crash ratings that you've seen that it's gotten the reason you know part of the ways that they're able to create something so safe having it being an electric car there are advantages to that so up front there's no big engine as a result not only do you have storage space up front there is a front I think it's about five cubic feet and you also have extra space up there for your crumple zone and so the crumple zone is really what makes front impacts safe or dangerous because it's how much space do you have to decelerate so think about it this way if you're to jump off a you know ten foot ladder not a good idea probably shouldn't do it onto a road let's say and then the second you hit that road I mean your deceleration rate is very quick because you just hit that very hard surface and you have nothing it doesn't give it doesn't have a rate of deceleration when you hit it you just simply stop when you hit the road if for example you were to jump from ten feet onto a stack of pillows well that stack of pillows is going to slowly press in and so you're going to spread out your deceleration over a larger distance and by doing that the rate of your deceleration is lower and because of that you don't get hurt so you jump off the ladder into the pillows you feel great you're happy same idea with a car except it's a bit more destructive but you if you were to hit something front on the front end has a larger crumple zone it's designed to smush and decrease you know that deceleration rate and bring you to a safe stop without putting massive G's on your body so that's the idea with the front of the vehicle they also have this massive battery so the battery is underneath the car underneath my feet right now and as a result it's also a structural member it's not just functional from the fact that yeah you need a battery for an electric car it also is very functional from a rigidity standpoint and from a safety standpoint so if you were to have a side end collision you've got that massive battery pack the structure of that battery pack which is very strong helping you to prevent that side impact collision or front or rear it's a pretty large battery that's going to protect you pretty much from every direction and on top of that battery you know being there and help protect you it's also the heaviest part of the car placed at the very bottom of the car so this means that your center of gravity is very low and as a result your chances of rolling over having this car flip over are very low so all of this is to say you know from a safety standpoint your probability of getting injured in this vehicle is very low and also very low in comparison to many of the cars out there today now the Model S is also extraordinarily efficient part of how it gets that 315 mile range is its aerodynamics and has a drag coefficient of just 0.23 one of the absolute lowest drag coefficients of any production car out there period very slick how they've done this so you know it looks cool the styling looks cool but it's also extremely functional so all of the curves smooth curves connecting allowing for this very aerodynamic shape so you don't lose energy as much energy as you could with a different shape due to air drag from resistance from air for example the door handles they fold in flush so you've got that nice smooth surface you've got a little bit of a spoiler there on the back and just the overall flowy feel of the body that rain drop kind of effect in order to be very aerodynamic now as far as the interior it's very simple in here which I do like I think these white leather seats are pretty awesome the leather is actually really soft so I like that you have this very prominent massive 17 inch touchscreen which is pretty much where you do everything so you can change your acceleration mode from chill to sport to ludicrous if you hold down Ludacris then you can go into that Ludacris plus mode it's pretty wild steering is in comfort standard and sport you've got different options here one of the things I think is cool if you put it on suspension it shows you the James Bond submarine and you can choose your depth so 0 2,000 10,000 or 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea a childhood favorite video movie of mine I watched that movie countless times so I think it's cool the little Easter eggs that they've included in here 20,000 miles or 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and you can lower that suspension quite a bit so you can change your ride height in here which is pretty neat from a visibility standpoint I was a bit surprised the front is somewhat narrow it's not to say that you don't have good visibility you do but I was surprised at just kind of how narrow it is looking out the back it is a little bit cramped as far as the visibility but checking our blind spot looking left and right not a problem seeing what's going on around you here overall it's just a simple nice elegant comfortable nothing wrong with it nothing you know too crazy too fancy or in-your-face I do really like the touchscreen it's very responsive works really well and it's easy to see it's not you know one of those tiny screens that you know takes forever to do each little function it works quickly it's easy to see it's very functional so I do like that about it and I think the interior looks nice it's clean it's going to kind of be I think a bit timeless simply because of just how minimalistic it is but it's also a nice place to be okay so we've talked about the car a lot but seriously what's this thing like to drive and it's just it's just crazy I mean it is wild when you put your foot down it's just how much I mean I mean 50% throttle and you're like okay that's that's enough and you keep going and you keep getting so much more and it just keeps on pulling the acceleration and how responsive it is I mean that's the cool thing about electric motors is that you can go from no throttle to full throttle like that you don't have to worry about gear shifts it's just simply there so it just slams you I mean it's crazy I mean literally the car just goes to like your body just goes I mean if I were to not brace myself for it just kind of relax when I press on the pedal here's a little straight section right here I mean you see just throws my body back this the acceleration the jerk the rate of change of acceleration is extraordinary when you put your foot down and so yeah I mean you're gonna you're gonna blow the minds of all the passengers that you have riding along in this thing now as far as the steering feel it's pretty effortless there's not too much required to get it to turn but that said the responsiveness is actually pretty great so I actually like it you don't feel too much through the steering wheel but you know on the other hand it does exactly what you asked of it when you asked of it so I do like that about it it is quick to turn in when you turn the wheel so no no major complaints with the steering now as far as the ride quality I'm actually been really impressed by it because you know there's some bumps on this road and you don't really feel much and yet there doesn't seem to be too much body roll with this vehicle I mean it's firmly planted you can kind of feel the heft of it but you don't really feel so much the minor bumps on the road it does a nice job of absorbing those damping them out and still giving you what feels like good control as you kind of carve around I mean you have to think that this is a 5,000 pound vehicle and yet what it's capable of is just crazy it does feel like it should be cornering as well feeling as nice not having as much body roll I mean part of that is just having that super low center of gravity so I guess the physics of it makes sense when you consider where that center of gravity is but it definitely kind of something in your head is saying like wait a minute it shouldn't be this good at cornering it shouldn't feel this fast it's 5,000 pounds and yet you know again put your foot down and gosh it just pulls as far as the throttle pedal and the brake pedal it is really cool I mean that's another advantage of electric cars is being able to tune the throttle pedal exactly as you see fit and you can do this with internal combustion cars but it's not as easy because engines aren't quite as quick to respond so it's neat how you can put your foot at any you know percentage of throttle and just get exactly that and nothing more nothing less it's very cool to have that kind of throttle control it's similar somewhat to a naturally aspirated engine but a bit better a bit more precise than it and then the braking feel so you do have regen so when you let off you start to have a little bit of regen and then the braking pedal you know not too much travel to it a nice progressive build and braking pressure and how much you're slowing down as you start to get onto that brake pedal I don't have any complaints on the brake pedal I think it feels pretty good feels natural even though you know obviously it's mostly an electric motor doing it and then goes to the disc brakes as needed now as far as the transmission and the gear shifts how smooth are the gear I'm just kidding there are no gears just single speed for the front and rear motor so there is no shifting done just a single reduction gearbox so at any point you know you put your foot down you get that full torque and that single gear that you are set in pretty neat accelerates all the way up to 155 miles per hour in just one gear and that's pretty weird to think about because it means that one gear is allowing you to accelerate very quickly from zero to sixty but it's also allowing you to have a very high top speed and then on top of that it needs to be efficient where it keeps that motor so it's pretty interesting you know that this can all be done with a single speed with electric motor it's pretty how that's been figured out so it's crazy fast it's got a great comfortable ride tons of space in here stupid quick you know you can actually fold down those rear seats fit a whole mountain bike in here without taking the wheel off lots of cargo space basically as much as an SUV and then you also have the trunk up front really cool vehicle just incredible how fast it is I mean that part is definitely just what is so addictive you just want to keep putting your foot down and flying this thing is just crazy fast it's super fun to drive I'm very excited that I got this opportunity thank you so much to omae's and remember if you donate $10 or more I've got a link in the video description you get entered a chance to win this 2018 a Tesla Model S P 100 d that includes taxes that
