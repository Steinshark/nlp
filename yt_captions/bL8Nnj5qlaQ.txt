people ask me questions like you know do you think God is real and a question like that always pigs the question for me is like well what the hell do you mean real like what makes something real and you know you could say tangibility um although that's only one dimension of what makes something real it's like I think what makes things real in the final analysis is probably death and in the in the example you used of the silhouette which is a very famous example with regard to birds the silhouette traveling in One Direction that signifies death reliably right over a very long span of evolutionary history and any creature that didn't respond to that silhouette was at a much more at a much higher probability of being picked off so then one of the things you might note and this is where the postmodernists got things like dreadfully wrong and where the large language models have drifted into insanity so imagine that there's a statistical relationship between Concepts that's okay so then you might say well what gives that statistical relationship reality and the postmodern types would say well it's just arbitrary cultural construction but it's not because there are patterns of relationships between events that are part and parcel of the world per se and some of those need to be accurately mapped by the conceptual system or you die and so I would say the like the the ideas that ring most true to us that grip Us in this sort of archetypal way are ideas that bear directly on our survival whether we recognize it or not they strike a cord within us like here's a good

a tour right now we who wrestle with God and it's focusing on biblical stories I'm trying to explain I'm trying to understand what they mean and then talk about that so other people can understand in so far as I'm able to and one of the Striking meta themes of the biblical library is the necessity of sacrifice right and so I've been trying to understand first of all what what it means to sacrifice it it means to give up something that's desirable for something that's more desirable it's something like that it's it's something higher and it's higher because it's it it's it extends over a long longer period of time and it includes more people and so like sacrifice is the basis of community well why well it's obvious Russell as far as I can tell it's like if you're in a communal relationship which is any relationship obviously then you're giving something up that's immediate to you to establish and maintain the relationship right so it's a sacrificial gesture and once you understand that once you understand that sacrifice is at the basis of community the question immediately arises which is well what's the most effective form of sacrifice and the the this biblical story Old and New Testament together is actually an examination of sacrifice per se it's an attempt to spiral down to the core of what constitutes well you might say the sacrifice that's maximally effective maximally acceptable to God but it it's something like what sacrifices by necessity at the core of community I also don't think there's any difference between that and cortical maturation by the way I think they're identical Concepts because as you mature from you know istic power mad 2-year-old what happens is that you integrate modes of attention and action that facilitate your longer term survival but also your inclusion within more and more complex webs of social Community that's all sacrificial good God now there's a lot of Jordan Peterson 101 there's a lot of hits running simultaneously here JP because we've already already touched on the idea of chaos and the necessary inevitable emergence of patterns within chaos and it seems that you are positing to a degree that this CA chaos is analogous to perhaps the collective unconscious and some of the patterns that are emerging in AI models even with the biases evident within them are an indicator of how how these patterns emerge within a container and I suppose to say a container is to indicate that we're acknowledging an absolute we've moved from this idea of a collective unconscious and and patterns emerging within chaos into sacrifice which obviously another great Jordan Peterson theme and as you say perhaps the overarching theme of The Bible my contribution to this incredible amount of information that you are relaying it has to do with where might one's intention carry you in so much as it seems that in this process of maturation and and one and a personal relationship with sacrifice how that develops and evolves it seems to me is when one starts to acknowledge that there is not when you use the phrase immediately beneficial that when we're referring to immediacy we are talking about both spatial and temporal immediacy and we might have to consider that when dealing with the sublime as surely the Bible is is that even these categories are called into question the most basic and taken for granted categories of any temporal creature will have to be challenged this perhaps helps me to understand how the ultimate sacrifice as rendered in the New Testament and and and and most I suppose would regard as the defining Christian image the the image of sacrifice can tackle the complex idea of The Pact that is made by the sacrifice of the man God because I I as I as I explore and attempt to understand Christianity more deeply the this the the nature of the Triumph the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and the nature of this pact is something that I'm mulling over and I feel that the reason I can't reach resolution is because it's irresoluble because I I ask that when there is absolute dominion and omnipotence with whom might a pact be made and I starting to conclude that it must be a kind of Cohen that you know that that all is coming from the same Source yep yep y because otherwise how can it be packed well I can tell you a story about that and you tell me what you think about it that's a very good question because the other the thing you're pointing to too which is [Music]
