ladies and gentlemen chess is a hard game that's why there's an ELO system the highest ELO ever achieved by a human is 2881 by Magnus Carlson the lowest ELO ever achieved by a human is a hundred because the ELO system doesn't go any lower than that so 200 level chess generally is quite poor in fact 200 level chess inspired me to make a playlist here on YouTube called how to lose a chess you should watch those other videos as well but today I'm going to be showing you a game that was absolutely genius this is a breathtaking display of skill played by two individuals right at around that two 300 ELO range this game was sent to me a few months ago by an individual named Adam and uh well I don't really have much else of an intro let's jump into this absolutely breathtaking display of chessability intellect Beauty and wit by the innocent 200 ELO player and Adam the game begins with Pawn to E4 and the Brilliance already begins on the first move of the game as Adam breaks away from traditional chess principles and plays a hyper modern Neo fashionable opening the alyachan's defense which is an opening where you disregard opening principles you do not put pawns on the center of the board to control space in fact you actually induce moves like Pawn to E5 from your opponent which would attack your knight and kick it out into the middle of the board the move Knight to F6 is known as the allyokins defense and the best move against it is to play the move E5 black rotates around and then tries to undermine the pawn whitechier plays already a Gambit Bishop to C4 this is known as the 200 ELO Gambit and you have actually given up the pawn on e4 completely but you are doing it because you are baiting your opponent in and then you would like to set up a Scholars mate you're actually not exactly losing the pawn if you find the sequence Bishop F7 King F7 Queen H5 check King G8 Queen D5 E6 Queen takes E4 but I'm not really sure that that was really White's idea and for that reason here Adam plays the move E6 which by the way already completely puts to bed all Scholars move Opera Scholars made opportunities because the queen and the bishop now cannot even team up on the F7 Square given that the bishop is now blunted well that does not stop our protagonist with white pieces who still plays the move Queen to F3 after two seconds of thought 200 ELO autopilot does not allow you to adapt to your surroundings and it can prove fatal because even though the queen does not even see the pawn and the bishop does not even see the pawn yes still go for it now black could play Pawn to D5 here Bishop out black plays the move Pawn to B6 which is a trying to play Bishop B7 which would then counter-attack the queen in the center white here does not go for Pawn to E5 which would simply be a bad move attacking the Knight and the Rook at the same time and instead white plays D4 I don't really hate the move d4 I don't think there's anything wrong with it two Pawns in the center of the board is what every single 200 ELO player should be shooting for uh and now we have the move Bishop to B7 Bishop B7 puts pressure on the pawn on e4 like this and white has a couple of ways of Defending it white can defend it with the bishop white could defend it with the Knight white could defend it with the Knight like this white could also maybe push the pawn in the center of the board and block the bishop or pin the Knight to the queen none of that happens and instead we have Knight to E2 which is still a good move developing and trying to Castle the king black here obviously with the last couple of moves has aligned the pressure on the pawn on e4 and you would expect to move Bishop takes E4 to come in or you would expect to move Knight takes E4 to come in but instead black plays something even better according to stockfish which is the move Bishop to B4 check throwing in what is known as a zvichenzogen in between move before taking the pawn on e4 because after all it is not going anywhere now black plays Knight C6 foregoing the plan of Bishop takes Pawn blocking in their own Bishop but defending the bishop on B4 which frankly is all we could really hope for at this level now white plays the move C3 it is not a good idea to leave your Bishop out in the open like this among the enemy pawns because your Bishop could very easily get trapped black definitely should have relieved the pressure here or taken first and then relieve the pressure because now white plays an absolutely outstanding move and the bishop needs to absolutely Retreat the bishop doesn't Retreat however and we have Bishop to A5 and now the natural follow-up here is Pawn to B4 simply rendering the bishop useless and not just useless but frankly dead because ponte's Bishop will occur on the next move but white has something else in store for us and plays the move Pawn to E5 counter attacking the knight in the center before the move B4 is played here black plays a move which definitely looks like a blunder but is actually an absolute brilliancy Knight takes E5 spending about a minute of thought on that move and it was a minute well spent Knight takes C5 is a discovered attack on the Queen by the bishop of peekaboo if you will if Pawn takes Knight is played Bishop takes Queen is played if Queen takes Bishop is played Knight takes Bishop as played and black has won a pawn but white does something even better when you are faced with a trait of Bishops instead you should just lose one for free Knight takes Bishop on the board and Adam has struck with a discovered attack Queen excuse me the Knight gallops out to G3 now Bishop takes G2 was on the way Knight takes D2 Knight takes B2 in the white position is absolutely falling apart but when faced with a prospect of taking multiple free things including the fact that you have just played multiple moves in a row with the Knight for some reason our protagonist Adam gets a little bit scared of the disturbance of the arrival of the horse and he plays the move Pawn to G6 there is nothing inherently wrong with the move Pawn to G6 but anytime you move a pawn to a light Square you have to remember that it used to stand probably on a dark Square unless it's the first move of the game and now the dark squares are a little bit weak and actually a fantastic move is played here by wike who plays Queen to H6 and infiltration of the dark squares the king is feeling a little bit unpleasant but Adam does not miss an opportunity twice gallops to the other side of the board grabs an extra Pawn with the sauce on the side to go and forces The Rook to move and slides the bishop back so three Adam has a five point material advantage now as early as the 12th move of the game which is borderline decisive Advantage for most of the ELO ladder but definitely not the ELO ladder at the 200 level white plays Queen G7 an absolutely fantastic move driving the queen into the territory it's a really bad move because Rook to G8 just defends everything and now the queen is booted and white continues to get absolutely punished over here but black overreacts to the threat which is why at this level of Chess you need to create as many threats as possible black completely overreacts plays King to E7 and now has given up all of the advantage because the queen is defending the rook and the king is defending the Knight but a couple of moves ago you took a little bit of careless attitude toward your dark squares and after King to E7 white delivers Bishop to G5 which is basically the kiss of death because now white is gonna play Bishop F6 or queen F6 and it's gonna be brutal Bishop F6 wins the queen you would expect the king needs to move or the queen needs to move but if the queen moves white gets two pieces to go the king is out in the open and probably it is mate to follow so instead of that our protagonist Adam plays the move D5 which not only loses the night right but it also loses the queen he had a good start to the game but as all two and 300 ELO games go he has succumbed to the pressure and he is probably going to lose but you haven't seen nothing yet now why does up a queen so what should the queen do hunt the queen should take as much free stuff as possible or white should play moves like Knight to D2 which Target multiple things and get exchanges and let's not forget that the move B4 is always possible white just has a bishop that is going to die on the edge of the board at any moment a queen needs a little bit of help but in this case the queen does not have help the queen has just an army behind her it's not even a matter of help why didn't this position plays Knight E2 so again I say this in many of my videos if you are watching this and you are a newbie eight or nine times out of ten the best move in the position is not going backwards it is almost always possible to make a forward move in the position that does something and Achieve something Knight to E2 Knight to D2 is a very good move Knight to E2 is uh is not a good move Knight to E2 does nothing I mean maybe you want to reroute the Knight to F4 but you have not made any progress in your position when you are up material in chess you have to utilize the material that you are up the bishop goes back to H5 as I said the best move is often not going backwards Knight F4 is a great move now we're gonna take the bishop and we're gonna trap the bishop the more pieces that white can trade the easier this game is going to get black plays H6 white doesn't even hesitate grabs the bishop fantastic fantastic chess uh black here doesn't take the Knight for some reason and attacks the queen that's not a good move because the queen can just take the pawn and now you can't take the Knight because I take the Rook so you're trying to be fancy but when you're dead lost don't be fancy okay you got no customers coming to the restaurant stop making fancy food all right your water's contaminated root G8 not the best move allows this but now Rook G7 and white is gonna guarantee some exchanges this this is good technique um now of course if black takes I mean it's bad news if Rook takes you all of this is gonna fall black plays the move King 6 here which I don't really understand but I don't understand this level of Chess because they're too strong uh black now is simply going to lose the rest of these pawns with various checks White NOW finds B4 that's really bad news that was the move that was really up for question and do you know what why the only reason the 200 ELO player found this move is because black moved in that direction look folks you you you don't lie to yourselves that happens all the time your opponent makes a move on the side of the board and you go oh wait a minute now I'm looking over there I got no checks but wait a minute I got this yeah on to B4 that's bad news that's really bad news yep um okay Knight to D6 Pawn takes A5 and this is going to be quite clean or is it in this position Adam finds the backwards knight move Fork oh that's brutal white is going to be losing a rook right what is the best move here for white why does in a white is caught in a fork the queen and the Rook are both under attack so what is the best move if you move the queen anywhere your Rook gets taken so what do you do you don't have any checks on this King if you take this you lose your queen so what do you do look takes Rook because if they take your queen you run out of the bank you've made a way with both of the Rooks and now you are completely winning if they spend a moment doing this now you just go here and you are completely winning Rook G1 is nothing you just move your king that is the way you have to calculate this position that doesn't happen white goes here white loses a full Rook now white almost has no Advantage white almost has no advantage in this position because the material balance is rook and a couple of pawns for a queen but it's worse than that it's the fact that now you probably have to move the queen again now the Knight will move and The Rook will get down here and if your king and other pieces can't move you're gonna be in big trouble 98 Queen E7 Rook G1 check and white is paralyzed white now only has a mobile King which is not what you want because the king is he ain't that impressive now black plays B5 which is a which is a bad move because it allows Queen C5 check and now I can take your pawns but white is obsessed with taking this Pawn which I don't blame at all King D6 now playing defense the queen grabs yet another Pawn with and queen E5 check is threatened that is a fork is black going to blunder that it is now a queen for a rook purely it's nine to five it's a four point material advantage for white Knight to F6 black has blundered Queen E5 check you're gonna have to guard the Knight and I'm gonna get in here and then I'm gonna get here and the more pawns that fall the more difficult this position is going to get to defend because I might not be able to move a knight in a rook but let me tell you something when my a pawn gets rolling when a pawn gets to the end of the other side of the board it becomes a queen so Queen F7 is played instead I don't hate this move but now Knight to E4 and we have a problem on our hands we've got a problem on our hands because white can't move any pieces but that doesn't stop white from moving a piece and all of a sudden white has lost The Rook however black has a minute and 30 seconds on the clock will black Against All Odds be able to win this game down seven minutes black in this position just has to take the Rook he tries to do this instead spends 27 seconds out of his 90 seconds remaining which is a ridiculous time expenditure Knight C3 hits the king but now the king can walk up to the Knight and after this white is going to have a queen in the night and that is more than enough to win the game but white doesn't do that white plays King to E3 King to E3 loses the rook in the corner and now it is back to two Rooks versus the queen it's dead equal but black only has 58 seconds on the clock Queen to F6 The Rook slides over to G80 spend 30 more seconds on that move is this man absolutely out of his mind what is he doing is he on Plain internet Rook to G8 played Queen to H6 grabs upon the Rook gallops in I mean the white king is claustrophobic he is suffering but look at this he's got very little movement here rookie two Rook D1 can weave a mating net but there's almost no time on the clock in fact I don't even know what's happening here it looks like black has lost on time wait what what is going on is that a malfunction it must be a malfunction because black definitely didn't lose on time all right well it looks like we're gonna have a game played with zero zero zero on the clock folks I'm telling you this is some sort of bug this is not what I saw black definitely did not lose this game on time so let's just pretend that every move black is making in about half a second because that's basically what happened white in this position plays Knight to D2 black still has no time on the clock Rook E2 Rook to D1 that was necessary you gotta take the Knight Knight B3 Rook D1 check Knight D2 and now the game is over the Rook swarm the Knight anchors both Rooks the pawn anchors the Knight this Pawn anchors the king's Escape Rook D2 Queen D2 Rook D2 King D2 the game is over not because black has no time that's a chess.com bug I don't know what's going on there but let's just keep it on the screen because it's very funny E5 perfect move Pawn takes Knight takes Pawn takes King takes now the way you win this game is white is going to try to promote over here you've got to monitor this and disallow the king from taking all of your pawns but that's very easy to do because you've got an eye on this that's not getting through and the king is fast enough to stop the pawns and so is the Knight we have H4 we have D4 the pawn is trying to sneak away but the king sneaks in but now here comes Pawn to F4 Knight takes A2 H6 the king stops the pawn F5 the king stops that pawn F6 the king stops that pun two C5 black has no time remaining not literally that's not what I'm trying to say A6 King takes F6 the King has now been swarmed by the pawns and Adam the Grand Master playing beautiful magnesian style end game technique will now bring us home Against All Odds Pawn to B3 but he has to avoid a stalemate is he good enough to avoid a stalemate he's good enough to avoid a stalemate King E5 d two King A4 he makes a queen but now the king is running to the opposite side of the board you got to be really careful here because if that King is able to get this he's gonna grab it move and run B2 King C6 is it stalemate no and now Adam delivers the Final Touch Queen to B6 check and queen D to D6 stalemate on the 60th move of the game and a draw up 22 points of material
