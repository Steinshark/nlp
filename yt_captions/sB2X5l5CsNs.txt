hello and welcome to my perfectly normal nothing 
unusual video about spatial derivatives in this   video nothing unnecessarily exciting will happen 
it is just one nerd and they're whiteboard talking   about derivatives so we've got your position 
in space X that's what I'm going to call our   position and I'm going to measure it in meters 
but what if we want to take the derivative well   the derivative is just the rate of change over 
time so that would be d x d t which means if   we've got a small amount of change in position 
over a small amount in time what is that often   call it your velocity I'm going to call it speed 
because we don't care about Direction and that's   in the meters per second unit category what if 
we want to take the next derivative well this   is acceleration which you might know from 
the accelerator pedal in the car if you're   American the gas pedal which stands for greater 
automobile speed pedal so checks out now that's   if we differentiate with time again now a little 
secret what it's actually doing is you're putting   another D DT which is another differentiate with 
respect to time at the front of your previous DX   DT but because mathematicians are mildly lazy you 
don't worry about all this you pop a squared on   the D you pop a squared on the DT and you're in 
business you've now got acceleration which I'm   going to abbreviate to acceleration and that is 
in meters per second per second meters per second   squared so far so standard but what if we take 
another derivative well of course we can do that   mathematically there's no reason why we should 
stop there over here we know the pattern just   continues it's going to be D cubed D that's the 
worst three I've ever done d t cubed it's going   to be in meters per second cubed and it's going 
to be the rate of change of acceleration and if   you're familiar with that you know that is called 
The Jerk yep you got it and this is not a Perfect   Analogy because of friction but a jerk is when 
you move the acceleration pedal around but how   fast are you moving it around what is the rate of 
change of jerk well of course we can have more and   more derivatives the next one down oh goodness 
I think I can just fit in the fourth power D to   the four over d t to the 4 which is going to be 
in meters per second per second per second per   second what's that called what do you call the 
rate of change of jerk well if you change being   a jerk that's an o snap situation rate of change 
of jerk is snap rate of change of snap is crackle   I don't have to let us pop because physicists just 
think they're that funny but as a mathematician   I'm obviously familiar with like the theoretical 
derivatives but I want to actually experience them   I just haven't got a Need for Speed I've got an 
e for Speed and it's higher order of derivatives   can I do something and log some data so I know 
if I've definitely experienced jerk and indeed   snap but for that kind of crisp rate of change 
of the rate of change of the rate of change of   the rate of change I can't just get in a regular 
road legal car no I have to go into the world of   Motorsport and something like Formula One might do 
the trick but if you want true pure acceleration   and it's higher derivatives you want to go on a 
motorbike you want a MotoGP bike that's what I'm   going to experience jerk and hopefully snap so I 
guess to continue this video I need to go ride a   Grand Prix bike so I'm gonna ride hey Grand Prix 
Mike I'm here at the British round of Moto GP at   Silverstone Racecourse as part of the cosmic 
shambles documentary about speed I'll link to   that below and they're actually going to put me 
on a Grand Prix bike it's one of the Ducati bikes   from the 2012 season and they're going to send 
me around oh there we are that's easier to talk   send me around the Silverstone waste track 
so I can enjoy some extreme data collection oh my God [Music] yep I'm a bike guy now that's no no as I 
mentioned that was because I was helping   out with the documentary you can watch the whole 
thing I'll link to it below and if you want to   have a go at that it's run by a charity called two 
wheels for life they will occasionally auction off   the opportunity to do exactly what I did which 
is mostly motorbike people who do that in the   training they were saying things like no of course 
reposition your weight and look into the Apex just   like you would when you're riding your own bike 
and I'm like I write a very different type of bike   but they let me keep the gloves uh these would be 
great for when I'm cycling is what I thought but   did not say out loud never one to waste a data 
logging opportunity separate to the documentary   on my phone I just happen to be running an app 
which dumped all the data from all the sensors   including the GPS and the accelerometers into a 
CSV file so afterwards we can have a closer look   at it and see not only how fast did I go but what 
level of derivative did I definitely experience   I'm going to take these off now first thing I did 
was just pull off the GPS which is updated once a   second and gives you the latitude and longitude 
and I just did those as a scatter plot and very   pleasingly you can see the path I went around 
it looks like there's a gap here but in the   data I mean that's just kind of what I mean I also 
you've got like all these clumpy bits So in theory   this is the Silverstone race track that I've gone 
around and up here at the top is where we started   and stopped and then I mean this should follow 
the shape of well let's check it you know what   um let's check it into Photoshop one second okay 
we're in Photoshop I've just got the plot from   before and over here I went to Wikipedia from the 
2022 British Moto GP thing and I got an outline of   the track so we're going to copy the track that's 
the original one off Wikipedia there and I've just   orientated it with North up so it matches my 
latitude and longitude here and uh let's have   a little look if we pop that in the corner ah look 
at okay if I don't change the aspect ratio that's   maybe my plot maybe the ratio that's not bad look 
at that that's kind of close it's not the worst I   mean you can definitely see the dots are roughly 
the outline of the track give or take and GPS   I mean it's once a second it's not outrageously 
accurate it's accurate enough but it's not super   accurate which is why we're not getting an 
exact match to the shape why there's some   weird clumping here and there like all these dots 
there that's just me going around quite a tight   corner you know the one that corner on the 
Silverstone they've all got names and the   Gap here I know something went wrong so who 
knows so GPS is pretty good but not amazing   it does also record the speed so she 
better get the velocity for the speed   from the GPS and that's log separate and that 
traditionally is more accurate because it's not   an absolute recording it's a relative measurement 
so we'll bring that up here it is let me talk you   through what I've done this spreadsheet I've got 
the uh exact time and date that each bit of data   was recorded and knowing that that's all text 
so reference time is me just pulling that out   and turning it into seconds and then here my 
absolute time is how far through the Journey   around the course and I picked a time to start 
roughly near where I began moving and then this   is each interval so the actual data that's been 
recorded by the app is a hundred times a second   but the distance and the GPS and the velocity 
from that only updates once a second so we'll   get to the higher resolution stuff later and 
then what I've done over here I'll scroll down   a bit uh you can see now I'm actually moving and 
doesn't update that often and then over here I've   worked out the amount I will have moved from 
that tiny bit of time at that speed and when   I add them all together you can see my lap was 
5.5 [Music] six zero kilometers and Silverstone   is 5.9 kilometers so where within 10 like that's 
pretty I think it's pretty amazing GPS and this   is not super accurate but if you actually work 
out the area under this plot this is my velocity   plot and it's all quite chunky because it's only 
once the second data if you add up all the area   under there it's within 10 of the actual distance 
around the track and I think that's actually quite   amazing that you can just put a phone in your 
pocket and get a measurement that is that close   um but this is not this is not good enough like 
the resolution is not fine enough to be able to   look at acceleration with enough resolution 
to then get jerk and snap so we're gonna have   to do something else but before we move on I'm 
just gonna you know what I wonder what my Max   Speed was let's find out the maximum of all the 
speeds and this will be in meters per second was   72 point 0.25 now I think that's going to be 
pretty accurate let's just look that up now okay 72.25 meters per second in kilometers per 
hour so my Max Speed was 260 kilometers an hour   oh my goodness what is that in miles per hour 
I was doing 161.6 I was doing a hundred times   the golden ratio miles per hour that's so stupid 
and the reason it's so incredibly fast by the way   is that was an actual like retired racing bike 
so you know in my uh everyone's got a copy of   the uh motor course book from 2012. this is the 
year that that bike was actually racing and so in   here I can find a photograph of the exact bike 
there it is that's the bike I was actually on   going around the course so they converted it 
to be a two-seater and by converted it made a   mildly bigger seat and welded two tiny handles 
to the fuel tank thanks a lot so I was on that   actual racing bike which is why I was going at 
such insane speeds and I've been asked to point   out that uh that oh that's a race worn helmet 
from the 2012 season and that is not a it's not   2008 season I've just been told 2008 season 
and this is also a 2000 that's also 2008 by   7 2007 bike as you can see not yet 
a fully fledged bike person [Music]   and now we pick up the pace by moving on 
to acceleration which is a whole other   thing because the accelerometers in the phone 
very cool um they're logging a hundred times a   second roughly but as well as getting the like 
the acceleration in three different directions   I'm also getting the angle the phone is on with 
its pitch your and um uh roll that's the other   one and we need to better convert from the three 
different acceleration components in the phone by   using the angle of the phone to work out in the 
reference frame of the bike and of course you've   got gravity making the whole thing a complete mess 
the phone does a little bit of the lifting for you   but a bunch of the heavy lifting mathematically 
speaking has to be done after the fact which I   was not able to do so I asked very nicely I have a 
podcast called a problem squared I do it back held   normally we solve other people's problems but we 
also ask our listeners to help with our problems   and I put a call out for people who could take 
my CSV and do something nice with it so I want   to very quickly thank uh Cass Visa Dom Wilson 
and Jan Jan Jan Wolfe for giving me a hand and   crunching the data and sending through some nice 
aversions which I then had a bit more of a play   with so well the final inaccuracies are absolutely 
mine but uh here it is this is the acceleration   data in the direction the bike is pointing so 
this is not the acceleration that's leaning me   into the corners it's not any of the up and down 
movement this is pure forwards and backwards down   the central axis of the bike and I've plotted it 
so you can see at the beginning the acceleration   goes up that's me accelerating uh straight down 
the line um and then there's a lot of positive   there's a lot of negative oh my goodness there's 
a lot of negative you can see down here that is   more than one G deceleration and actually there's 
slightly more than a g acceleration over here I   think I got to like one point oh we can find out 
let's find out there was some Max of uh that's   the acceleration in G there and that's the Min so 
actually I'm at I think I hit like 1.1 G was the   most I had which is I mean the maximum that the 
actual writers have in a proper race is apparently   about 1.8 G in terms of acceleration deceleration 
down the line of the bike and so I mean I'm not at   the max but they're still it's a lot it's a decent 
percentage of the total acceleration now before   we move on to see if we can take the derivatives 
of the acceleration to get the jerk and the snap   in theory we should be able to integrate this 
we should be able to take the area under this   and work backwards to get velocity we should 
match the velocity we got from a completely   different sensor from the GPS so I thought you 
know what just as a little bit of a validation   of what's going on I'm going to integrate 
this first and get the same velocity plot   but through in a completely different means 
and here's what that looks like it's not great   so I'll talk you through this plot so this is the 
velocity plot here in meters per second and it   kind of matches what I remember happening in the 
race that's us taking off from the line that dip   there was the rider doing a wheelie down the first 
straight which is why the velocity flattens out   for a second and then the acceleration kicks back 
in again uh and then so on and so on and so on now   you may notice at the end of the ride we are way 
way up here and that's because we've got all these   values we're taking a hundred a second there's a 
lot of inaccuracies that are going to add up so   this is why you've got the GPS and you've got the 
accelerometers accelerometers are good in a moment   by moment basis but the accumulative errors are 
pretty horrific whereas GPS is not a particularly   good Moment by moment give or take depending on 
what you're doing but it doesn't it stays the same   over time and so I was like oh well I'm gonna how 
am I going to compare this so I'm still confident   this is great on a moment by moment we'll still 
get our jerk and snap that I experienced because   those will be very fleeting but I really wanted to 
see if I can match this up properly so down here   all I've done in this plot is take the top plot 
and over time try to compensate for the drift   which is not perfect it was a really lazy linear 
correction I assume that the accumulating error   is linear over time and I've just deducted it 
and it's given me this and the question now   is how close is that to the GPS one from earlier 
and it's not wildly different I mean GPS there's   there's going to be some lag in there it's very 
low resolution but you can still see accelerating   off the line really and then rapidly catches up 
whereas here we've got a much smoother curve so   I think on a small scale the shape is better on 
this one but the long-term accuracy is better on   the GPS one so what's really nice is I was able 
to show we get exactly the same shape plot two   different ways by either taking the GPS location 
and its derivative the velocity versus the   acceleration and its integral the velocity it's 
a fundamental theorem of calculus moment [Music]   to recap I'm quite confident in the acceleration 
data on a moment by moment basis so we are going   to do some derivatives I will say however that 
having a phone on a vibrating motorbike which   is basically an engine with a few trivial Wheels 
it's not the best way to collect that sort of data   and so we did have a lot of other vibrations and 
things to be removed and so the acceleration data   as well as being converted to the bikes reference 
frame has been filtered a lot to try and take out   um the frequencies coming from the motorbike in 
fact a huge debt to Dom Wilson I'll be using Don   Wilson's filter data for the rest of my analysis 
so again thanks to everyone who helped out with   the day even the people who had a look at it 
but weren't able to do anything I appreciate   everyone who gives it a go but now we are going 
to take this plot here which is our acceleration   plot and then we're going to take its derivative 
to work out the jerk in the direction of travel   which looks like that that one down there so I put 
an extra column on where I've just worked out how   much it changes between data points and 
the time interval between them and there   I mean does that count I think that's a very 
abrupt negative jerk oh my goodness yeah that's   that's a jerk where I'm really slowing down and 
there's some pretty clear jerks early on over   here so I wonder what that was that's me that's 
me going real slow you know what let's see if we   can match that back to the GPS coordinates and 
work out what was happening so that jerk came   at 93.4 seconds into this data set so if I go 
back to GPS and I come down to 93.4 seconds is   here and so that's when I'm at 52.7 and negative 
1.01 and if that's is that low enough resolution   to be able to see it 52. that that's it 
there there it's this part of the track huh   I mean it looks like it's a pretty sharp corner 
but you know what we'll look up the footage we'll   see what was happening then and we'll play 
in the moment when I was was a maximum jerk [Music] all right so I'm now convinced that I'm there I 
experienced very distinct jerk I think actually   these points here are non-trivial a lot of these 
smaller ones that could be noise in the data let's   go one further though see what our snap looks 
like uh so there's our jerk and uh this is the   snap column I've put in there but I haven't 
plotted it yet I thought we could all see it   together so I'm gonna do is duplicate The Jerk 
plot pop that down here and then I'm going to   move it one over so instead of being the data in 
column L I'm going to move it to column M so we   go in here and we change the data so that's now 
column M and we're plotting M against the same   horizontal axis and it looks a little bit like 
this oh wow that is real quiet and then real big   so look at this that is a lot of snap okay I 
mean I know I know snap is all oh snap but that's   that's too much snap I think now I think that's 
noise in the data I mean I believe in The Jerk   because when we look at the footage but that 
that these snaps yeah yeah I think now with um   we've just hit hit mess in the day I could be 
wrong not a professional at this I don't think I   could say just by eyeballing this plot having been 
messed with by me and filtered by other people I   don't think I can definitively say uh that's 
a snap but I will say that's a jerk [Music]   okay just had an update from behind the 
camera a little Trent my Moto GP consultant   and writer director of the documentary I was 
in saying that corner is the most kind of EX   acceleration deceleration you're going 
to get on the course apart from I guess   maybe starting so maybe maybe snap let me 
know in the comments below do you do a vote   if I think if you think I am a loud snap just 
at some point in your comment put oh snap   if you think I'm not I'm being a jerk but you're 
being a jerk and and that'll be the that's how   you decide things in physics you take a 
vote pretty sure that's how science works that's it for my nice boring video about spatial 
derivatives thank you so much for watching this   hello to all the students watching this in a 
lesson at school thank you so much my patreon   supporters who make this possible please do check 
out the documentary rapid motion through space   made by The Cosmic shambles folks uh although 
Trend sitting right behind the camera right   now uh go watch go watch it it's on their website 
um and ah huge thanks to two wheels for Life the   charity who got me on the bike that was great 
and loads of other people I mean using footage   from Silverstone on the actual race weekend is 
a non-trivial task in terms of both my bravery   and admin so we're going to thank everyone 
Below in the description uh please do check   that out and that's it thank you for watching 
I hope you enjoyed this lesson about to reverse [Music] thank you [Music]
