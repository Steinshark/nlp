last week I showed speed promoted Paradox crypto which was widely criticized to be a scam and he apologized and I confronted the founders behind this crypto coin only now one of the founders has gone full internet tough guy and is making threats towards the people who criticized him when it comes to you personally myself yeah for spreading all that fake [ __ ] lies on my name what's when I catch you I'm gonna smash your teeth in this double down by itself would seem so insane but it actually gets worse so this is a full expose on amio talio the founder who in my opinion is a danger to himself and others in addition to being a scammer so we'll discuss all of this but first let me bring you up to speed on what's happened so far as many of you know I confronted Paradox crypto on a live stream a week ago and things went pretty badly for the two of them there were two brothers they kept deflecting basic questions about is this a get rich quick scheme or not and they also kept saying that like it's not that you think we're a scam you just must not like us you don't think we're a scam you just you just think that we're not gonna no I think you're scared you must not like the way we dress or the color of our skin all it is all it is is because we're in your we're not your average suit and tie kind of guys maybe you don't like the color of fast skin which is a pretty pretty shocking allegation when only an hour earlier I was a man of dignity and a man of the people you are a man of dignity and a man of the people because you are obviously exposing fakes I don't know why I just keep going from awesome guy to horrible person whenever I confront one of these people but at this point it's just the coffee Zilla but honestly I thought the story was gonna end here for me because even though they've made a response video about this a couple days ago where amio talio the founder tried to talk a lot more carefully and considerately about his crypto coin I watched it and realized it wasn't worth my time to cover because a voice critical already covered this and I felt like he had done a great job already but also B it was basically all the same counter arguments that I had already debunked on a two-hour live stream but yesterday something changed amio talio decided to Double Down by going from a crypto scammer into an unprofessional goon who threatens people who criticize him what's worse is that he didn't just threaten people with big platforms like me or or moist critical no no no no he was nice to us he told me after I toasted him and his brother for two hours on a live stream good luck on your future Ventures no instead of going after us amio talio decided to Target a small Tick Tock creator that dared to criticize him the exact same way I did but instead of saying good luck on your future Ventures he said this what should I catchy smash your teeth in every single time you look at your face in the mirror you're gonna see your broke up nose bust up in 20 different places that's what I'm gonna do that because of yours right if it was funny in it you thought it's funny just 12 months on the internet although I'm not an internet guy imma put your email I'm gonna put 10 bags down to anyone that shows me this guy's address I'll give him 10 bags and then I'll see what you're gonna say when I come there because I think you think I'm just some internet yeah so see you very soon now this is so annoying to me it's the ultimate internet tough guy act you choose the smallest voice criticizing you and you say okay I'm gonna bash your teeth in if you don't shut up like why not say that on a live stream to me it's also the dumbest thing too because you're literally threatening somebody online recorded you're saying you're putting a bounty on them like you might get arrested doing that and honestly this thing was so unhinged that even after seeing a screenshot from amio talio's Snapchat I didn't even believe like this was real I thought it might have been a deep fake or something he says 5K to the person who grabs this guy who criticized him and brings him to me I want to see this Troll's face in real life and then he asks for his mom's address I honestly thought I was trapped in some kind of paradox metaverse nightmare that I'd have to like pay para coin to get out of there just is no way in my mind someone could be that stupid to voice physical threats over a recordable voice memo and then have screenshots of them putting a bounty on somebody and it was doesn't until I reached out to the person who's actually threatening all of this Naim that I actually believed any of this was real for sure so the CEO basically yesterday the CEO of paradox messaged me he straight away went with friends he's like said I'm gonna put a 10K bounty on you like I'm gonna make people come after you look for you took a screenshot of my Snapchat profile and put it on his story telling people to come look for me now obviously these are pretty shocking allegations so I wanted to make sure there was no doubts given how serious it is so I reached out to Paradox metaverse to try to hear their side of the story they decided not to respond but they did respond on Discord about it confirming some of this we have the brother of amio talio responding under the handle Professor you can see on Discord he's labeled the co-founder and someone gives naeem's Tick Tock account he says hey amio's making it worse his brother says just a fudder getting told off nothing to worry about quote each of them I guess the critics have contacted us to pay them to remove the posts isn't that called blackmailing now here he seems to confirm the threat saying they were just telling them off but he also implies that they were blackmail which is a new allocation so I reached out to them for a comment about that no response so I asked Naim about it and he of course says well that never happened although I don't do that stuff like that's just weird why would I try and blackmail someone and so we have no evidence of this blackmail story but we do have evidence of violent threats so amio's brother finally admits on Discord that the founder and face of the company sending threats via voicemail is hardly a good look he responds I do agree emotions can run High when you're being attacked and everyone is believing it over the truth and it's overshadowing it um I guess the strategy here being the best way to stop people from thinking you're a scam is distract them with threats of criminal violence now I'm not sure this is such a great move for them and it calls into question amio talio's whole Persona about like he's just ignoring the haters I've got plenty of hairs I just ignore them just ignore them why do you look carry on hey you know keep stacking bread well so much for that apparently he only follows this advice when someone bigger than him is talking to him online if you're a small Creator he will threaten your life now it may not surprise you to learn that this whole story didn't stop there because I started to do a deep dive on this guy and it turns out he actually has a history of this even though he had a low profile online he's apparently lived a lot of his life being a tough guy and threatening people for seemingly no reason like for example he got in a fight with this guy at the gym uh who didn't enjoy being filmed taking pictures what don't worry don't worry one second and it's not just that either he got in a fight with his luxury car dealer who goes by the name cash as well he makes some pretty disgusting statements about the guy's family which I will be bleeping out but I think you can uh read between the lines here Hanky Panky dad your [ __ ] stupid kids yeah you're [ __ ] brother that needs to come out of the [ __ ] closet I told you a lot of them yeah so uh he seems horrible I mean not exactly the stable guy you want running your Investments right this is the kind of guy who will literally just post himself online threatening crimes that's what's most shocking about it like he will film himself trying to commit crimes and then post it on YouTube for example he literally did this with a attempted theft open the boot don't record me help me come help me huh we're just making sure that no one can steal this so we're just making sure see if it fits in the booth it don't we'll put it back now I don't know what his defense is here maybe he would say this was all a prank or a joke or at least he should have been able to say that if he hadn't basically confessed right after that in the same video cool we are the worst we are the worst criminals ever we got cool wow I can't believe I'm saying this but that was the first thing amiotalio has said that I agree with he's the worst criminal ever hence the title actually it's not even me saying that he he says it himself and then says the crime he just failed to do we just need one of those caught Little Robot machines and he's walked and he's like okay we're just making sure literally that's his Mo he broadcasts himself like making threats attempting theft and then only does that when he thinks he can get away with it I mean it's just the worst I could keep showing examples but I think this is the last one I'm going to show this one though shows especially what kind of a delusional narcissist this guy is the biggest [ __ ] watch what happens to you and you think I'm going to calm down I'm a big man bro make one phone call bro yeah but you think I'm gonna come down to you of you don't worry you'll see what time it is in it don't worry don't worry you carry on carry on yeah you can't [ __ ] everyone don't need to swear no one's kids problem you watch this guy is so unbelievably full of himself I I don't truly don't understand how people see this stuff and think like it's alpha or cool it's pathetic that's basically what I wanted to talk about I just wanted to follow up on the last video with this update and just uh talk about the character of the guy behind Paradox crypto
