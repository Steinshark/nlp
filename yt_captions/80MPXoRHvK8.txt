I figured if we're going to start off this this Devon take we' start it off with trash [ __ ] you Devon today we are excited to introduce Devon the first AI software engineer by the way that is already a pretty bold ass claim this feels like this is a tweet designed for VCS this is not a tweet designed for the average person you're telling me that chat jippy wasn't the first one remember how you just offloaded all of your python visualization scripts to chat jippy and all a sudden now that oh chat you're not you're you're not a software engineer 100% popping they yeah they're pumping some serious stock right here Devon is a new state-of-the-art on the S bench coding Benchmark has successfully passed practical engineering interviews from leading AI companies and has even completed real jobs on upwork um I I do want to say something even about this because I know right now there are here how about this one before we go I'm going to do this we'll we'll do we'll do an actual poll I'll oh gosh I'm highlighting everything Let's do an actual poll for a second okay so there you go so as you can see most people fall into look at that the no experience less than one year 1 to five years so I bet you that if we were to take a little bit of a poll and we were able to say okay of these groups how worried do you feel about your future career and AI taking your job my guess is that you would see lots of worry here worry here less worry even less even less and my guess is that worry and experience probably kind of line up so I just want to I the so this is the reason why I think it's really important to talk about this because my guess is that there's a lot of people right now that see this and they're going I don't even pass an interview I'm genuinely [ __ ] I can't pass an interview I'm having trouble getting um I'm having trouble getting jobs on upwork and out here there's this AI That's a lishing tasks on on upwork and is being able to pass real interviews so let me let me let's talk about this for a quick second most companies hire extremely dumb they they they literally tell you to write up a program and the program is extremely simple it's literally an AI prompt like you've been aiting you were the AI like that is a software engineering interview so much it's just like oh yeah well I have a uh I have a service that is really slow because we're using bubbl sword can you quick sort right and it's just like like there's actually there there's literal interviews I've seen where people actually ask for sorting algorithms and it's just like do you really need me to know a sorting algorithm like do you genuinely think as an engineer a sorting algorithm is a great way to identify Talent or not Talent it's like no it's not it's never been that I wanted to be clear on this I think a lot of people people are worried about their job they're worried that they're going to lose it there's a whole bunch of like this kind of [ __ ] just makes people go absolutely nutty that they're like oh my gosh they're passing interviews they're able to do real work like how can I ever keep up how can I do any of these things this is a little little bit of a marketing trick okay whenever you see these kind of stats you must understand something they have gamed the system completely you know what they didn't say right here how many upwork jobs do you think they went through to find the perfect one you don't see that how many do you think they went through to find these things a thousand 10,000 you know how much of like these type of like even with even with Contracting and that kind of stuff the amount of just back and forth communication for you to even get close it requires you the human developer to sit there and think about okay when they say these things what they're actually asking for is these other things okay when they do this they actually want that like the amount of just [ __ ] that has to go on for you trying to sus out what someone wants anyways I mean this idea that humans can write an accurate description of what they want when humans don't even know what they want is ridiculous you know the greatest way to have a failure in a business let one company tell you exactly what they want and you implement it like go ahead go do that you won't have a company bye-bye now right like that's how you do it you let somebody treat you like an llm so yeah maybe this will make you faster maybe you'll be able to do more work hell maybe you'll be able to pass 13.86% of GitHub real world issues unassisted do you know how stupid there are some GitHub real world unassisted issues what are you testing here so this is this is what I like to refer to as um confounding factors okay confounding factors let me let me hit you with something let me hit you with something so when you're testing something you're trying to test on a single a single variable right and so this one variable it has to be absolutely isolated as much as possible so if we're talking about llms and GitHub what are you isolating here well there's a couple things one difficulty of issue two well-written three tribal knowledge required there's like a whole set of things that testing here which is maybe it's literally like what level of issues are simply written that are just like need to update or need to document this an AI could be pretty good at that it could just literally be pretty good at that in fact that could be a very good one and you know what I I don't know I don't know if it actually is good at that there's just so much to it and so I don't think you can see like when I see this number it means nothing to me cuz it's like what what' you test next something that's kind of of interesting in here is how did it select the issues to assist right do you think that maybe because VCS really really really want you to have something that's going to make a lot of money and how do you really ensure that you're having the best possible percentages maybe just maybe you're pre-selecting a a couple issues that are just really nice for one of these things to actually solve like there's just so many confounding factors in this that you cannot possibly say that this is going to be what they're promising it to be I mean okay they didn't create the Benchmark fantastic this is the S Benchmark I mean I'd still need to check out the S Benchmark and see if it actually okay I guess that's something I need to go look at maybe you're 100% right maybe these things are fantastic but when I see this stuff all I see is gaming okay this is gaming upon gaming upon gaming upon gaming sweet Benchmark how much do you want to bet that none of those issues look like issues I have to solve check out what Devon can do in the thread below okay so let's read this let's see what they're doing upwork is peer gaming you guarantee that's pure gaming okay there's just I I'm not going to lie to you I just don't I just don't believe this at all okay I I think it's just a gold rush and people are trying to optimize I think all we're seeing right now is a simple optimization curve where it's really it's almost like you're having these it's almost like a radial basis function and we're the human like each one of these llms are like the the little nose inside inside the RBF layer and it's just like people trying to interpolate these things as best as possible to say okay this is actually how you solve we've optimized this one use case so good sweet benchmarks crushed and it's just like is it actually good did you actually really I know I actually put a third one in there just so you wouldn't say titties but you telling me they're not gaming the system you're telling me these things aren't being trained to be the best possible sweet benchmarks benchmarker you're telling me that these indices the show how fast FR frontend Frameworks are and backend Frameworks that these companies aren't producing these Frameworks that are optimized for this one thing just so you can say you're the fastest like there's those trusted benchmarks the most trusted benchmarks ever and those ones are literally filled with examples where they know the input they know the output and they make it as possibly best as possible and they're like well look at us we're the fastest benchmarks that have ever existed and it's just like cool cool anyway sorry I feel very passionate about this because everyone I feel like everybody's getting Bamboozled I like AI I like AI coding assisting I like using co-pilot I enjoy it I feel like it's nice I don't think it's taking my job anytime soon I don't even think it's close and I'm not saying like oh it's like it's 20% way there oh it sure won't get there you know it sure won't get that other 80% no it's not a percent way there like we're talking we need like a 100 plus X Improvement before it even comes close to really taking jobs real jobs sorry I wanted to get that all out of me because it's just like so I feel so intense about it again I like AI I use AI I I literally I use it all the time I I think I think co-pilot is absolutely fantastic that wasn't fantastic though co-pilot I didn't like that okay you're not you're not helping your case right now co-pilot I I I wanted you to produce a real piece of code okay co-pilot this was this was terrible this is it was absolutely terrible code right there okay just get rid of that for a second uh pretend that didn't happen all right Scott woo I'm Scott from cognition Ai and today I'm really excited to introduce you to Devon the first AI software engineer again that claim na na let me show you an example of Deon in action I'm going to ask Deon to Benchmark the performance of llama and a couple different API providers from now on Devon by the way notice what he is asking is like the world's most obvious thing to do you'd go to any of these different ones you'd grab their API Keys you'd follow their example tutorials you'd put those all things together and bada bing bada boom like nothing in here is actually difficult like nothing this is just takes us time hey guess what Devon you're faster at find you're faster at Googling than me congratulations is in the driver's seat first Devon makes a step-by-step plan of how to tackle the problem after that it builds a whole project using all the same tools that a human software engineer would use Devon has its own command line its own code editor by the way this is also a huge risk just so everybody knows like your own command line and plus your own editor is just like a giant risk why why invent that like literally that's probably the worst possible thing to spend your time effort and money on is trying to integrate any of these things integrate inversely why because you're spending time programming that [ __ ] okay you're spending time making the UI so that everything fits together you're spending time doing all these things that you should not be doing like this is this is startup 101 don't do don't solve these problems and even its own browser in this case Devon decides to use the browser to pull up API documentation so that it can read up and learn how to plug into each of these apis like I said GOOG unexpected error Deon actually decides to add a debugging print statement reruns the code with the debugging print statement and then uses the error in the logs to figure out how to fix the buug hey print F debugging I've been telling you guys this how long have I been telling you print F debugging is the way to go okay hey Devon you know you're 95% shitty yeah oh [ __ ] Deon the bugs like the prime gen I've been telling you it's the way to go okay you're 5% cool Devon 5% you still wave with both hands finally Devon decides to build and deploy a website with full styling I Do by the way just like as a pro tip if you're making a video just revoke your API access Keys afterwards and just not have these things blurred out like what are you doing you look like a dumb Dum visualization you can see the website here all of this is POS POS today because of the advancements that we've made in both reasoning and long-term planning it's a really hard problem and we've only just started but we're super isn't Cloud 3 out Cloud 3 I thought it wasn't Cloud 3 just recently released so they may also already be losing to cloud cloud Jean Cloud Claud Claud Jean Claud they probably already lost sag excited about the progress that we've made so far in the meantime if you'd like to try out Devon on your own real world tasks send us a request below and we'd be happy to forward it to Devon so okay I'm going to I'm going to give you a little hot take here just a little hot take AI is an incredible Gold Rush right now and like everything that I saw with nfts is being played again before our eyes like the the only difference is is that nfts were particularly useless AI at least there there's useful stuff okay there's at least some useful stuffs like at least you got something out of it right again love co-pilot if you've never been in Flow State which is obvious like you see a lot of new people they're shocked that someone can program without Googling for an hour straight right like people see this and they're completely like how how's this even possible it's just doing something for a long period of time right you get in the zone you get in the Flow State you're producing code at such a high Pace right and it's an incredible experience it's it's fun to do it's a it's it's just awesome right and the thing about when I see these type of like these type of AIS all I see is like permanent Flow State Breakers cuz you're just waiting you're just observing and you're just looking and I do think that this is going to cause unique slowdowns I'm not saying that it's going to be slower or faster I'm just saying that I I'm curious as to the end goal of what it's going to do cuz like a huge part of like my success is because I'm able to like get into a flow State and be in there for a while and so like I really and something that really just destroys my flow state is when I have to go and wait for something right like have you ever had like a f minute build and you're just like in you're just destroying it and all of the sudden it's like a 5 minute build you're just like oh my goodness and it just like robs you of everything and it's just like your like like that energy is just it makes just it's just so frustrating and then you find yourself you're not gone for five minutes you know what's going to happen right you know what's going to happen someone's gonna someone's gonna start off their Devon task they're going to go on Twitter afterwards they're going to go on some stupid social media go look at that for 10 minutes then realize ah [ __ ] it didn't work it stopped after 13 seconds but my expectation was 10 minutes and then they're going to go and you're just going to get these just huge chunks over and over and over again taken out of it right man it's the worst it really is the worst you you truly lose a huge amount of time when that happens writing more code is fun than reading code absolutely absolutely but there is something really fun also about like if you're able to have a fast debugging state where you're like run go change go change go change go it's one of the reasons why I got really good at using t-u is just because I want like I want it to be like muscle memory so I can swap back and forth as fast as possible see what's going wrong see what's not going wrong like I really do like that experience of going fast you know and so like having that is really good it just feels good I needed the coat a lot today but I just wanted the fish instead yeah I mean that does happen a little fly fish and it's it's good for the soul anyways uh let's check out a little Devon let's check out one of these de and I'm going to show you how Devon our AI software engineer can autonomously learn from a blog post tell me you're reading from a script without telling me you're reading from a script Sarah did you generate that with AI Sarah within a few minutes Devon successfully generated this desktop background image for me okay I did not pre-at that can we just can we just be real for a quick second I I I didn't pre-at this okay yes of course the reflections wrong of course is Reflections are extremely difficult problem again this is why programming is so dang unsuccessful often with these things is because these little Reflections are all errors within your code you know with an image your brain can kind of just ignore it because your brain is super good at looking at video and just going nah that's not real here I'll fill I'll fill in the blanks for you ah [ __ ] doesn't work out you know I'll just make it happen right like that is what is really good it does say Sarah it it does say Sarah my name on it so all I had to do was send this blog post in a message to Devon from there Devon actually does all the work in this blog post hide in plain site it's possible to generate images with hidden text is there like a dickpick or something in here that I'm unaware of if the hidden word is Sarah I'm going to be genuinely disappointed right now my disappointment will know no bounds I just want should know that I had to do was send this blog post in a message to Devon from there Devon actually does all the work for me starting with reading this oh my gosh oh my goodness the first one the text should be Sarah oh my goodness okay I'm completely unimpressed I'm just I'm just letting you know that that fine fine you got me this is incredible it's Inc it's impressive is it is it really that impressive it's impressive it's impressive because it did something that you find difficult to do is it impressive because it's actually impressive and figuring out how to run the code in a couple minutes Devon's actually made a lot of progress and if we jump to the middle here you can see that Devon's been able to find and fix some edge cases and bugs that the blog post did not cover for me and if we jump to the end we can see that Devon uh sends me the final result which I love I also also got two bonus images uh here and here so uh let me know if you guys that one's much better hey everyone my name is Sarah and I'm going to I can't believe Sarah just went with let me know if you can see anything hidden in these like I mean it's actually hard not to see the first one like the first one I actually don't even see the city the last one though the last one was pretty great last one was pretty good cognition is pretty good to have in there it said a couple minutes by the time it prompt it was one and a half oh jumped by one and a half hours please tell me that was not true and if we jump to the end we can see that Devon uh sends me the final result which I love okay look at this first off this man's working at 1:41 a.m. give Devon a break here people and 1:32 a.m. did not cover for me and if we jump to the oh my goodness I'm trying to I'm I'm literally trying to adjust this scrubber I'm such an idiot 1:00 a.m. 12:59 a.m. yeah so it took it took about what how much 30 40 minutes it took about 40 minutes that's all it took it took 40 minutes that's I mean impressive okay impressive that it was able to generate all of that within 40 minutes minutes it's pronounced d 40 minutes $750 in API credits absolutely incredible like think about that [ __ ] you Devon everybody quote in trash Dev umth and I noticed this issue where when you take the log of a fraction you get Zoo which is a type of infinity so that's definitely wrong did I just hear zero is a type of infinity which LF is that again zo is complex Infinity math called I'm fire damn okay oh produces zoo I thought he said zero fine flow state is infinity fine I I can be wrong hey I look like an idiot okay I look like a dummy I accept it I'm just I only knew about the LF Infinities I didn't realize that there's there's more Infinities beyond that hey I'm Neil and I want to show you an example of hey just real just real talk for a quick second shy R did you even really know that shy R you weren't on the big stage real talk did you actually did you did you actually know about Zoo did you actually know about about this Infinity hell no I'm just saying you know you know I'm willing to be stupid in front of people I'm still oh this guy's just like I don't know what that what the hell is happening I know about LF right but I don't know about uh I don't know about these other things Devon our AI software engineer helping me fix a bug okay so I've been using this repo called simpai is an algebra system this guy's such a s in Python and I noticed this issue where when you take the log of a fraction you get Zoo which is a type of infinity so that's definitely wrong but instead of trying to figure this out myself I just asked Deon to take a look Devon immediately jumps in sets up the repo I also don't like an anamorph azing things I find that just uncomfortable in general because they're not you know what I mean like got it Neil right like no just tell me just tell me the answer like don't don't make it feel like a human it just feels you know what I mean and is able to reproduce that same Zoo output Devon then figures out the right part of the code and adds print statements um in order to figure out what the cause of this issue is okay and we can see here that the cause is that integer division leads to a zero and then we take the log of zero So based on that Devon's able to fix the issue in The Code by replacing that integer division with true Division and then cleans up the debug output and verifies that the results is what we want and then what is the result the audio is terrible but what's the result wouldn't it just be would wouldn't the result be Infinity cuz he said that you're still dividing by some sort of zero business I mean this doesn't look like it's zero but Deon even runs the test in the repo as well to make sure nothing else is broken so that was great um saved me a ton of time so thank you D so question they didn't really quite answer is this what the library wanted well that but that's not quite the bug right it's not that bug that you're putting I mean I'm curious because there was the there was the look there's like a log on the outside of all of this I thought no never mind it doesn't okay whatever anyways okay well interesting I mean I guess like I mean it's neat that it can fix that type of bug but I also don't think that that's like a very interesting bug like there's nothing really to that that was you know it's a ywn for sure and so I mean this is this is just how I feel about these things I know a lot of you how many people in chat are like e accelerationists type one type type one if you're one of if you're one of these people cuz I've been told recently that I won't even have like a job in one year that's how soon it's going to be do you guys actually for all the one pressors okay for all the people that actually think that AI is going to take over the world very very quickly why like what what makes you think that's true okay people stop typing for a second I can't read when it's going this fast humans are dumb is one answer I got exponential progress is the next one exponential growth capability so what makes you think it has expon growth capabilities what gives you the notion that exponential is there history cuz if you mark the points the points certainly aren't exponential like there was definitely a step a step function of improvement but it wasn't exponential is not quite it oh Elon Musk said it is that is this the reason why Elon what' you say what' you say let me see it Elon AI will probably be smarter than any single human next year smarter is such a funny word right by 2029 AI will probably be smarter than all humans combined that's such a funny word you know smarter like I mean to be completely Fair AI knows more than me sure absolutely like it knows it definitely knows like more algorithms than I do but I just you know if AI if AI is so smart then why can't you produce me a self-driving car that still can't tell the difference between a baby and a log like how many years have we been on this whole self-driving car business and all I want is this the the baby not to be a ba you know like I know they're getting close they're Gott pretty close things are getting pretty good okay I've just also heard this for quite some time okay I'm not a Doomer or a gloomer or an accelerationist I'm someone who just wants something that makes my auto complete better call me oldfashioned call me a boomer I just want my auto complete better okay that's all I want why would I spend $150 or $750 worth of credits on something that I can pay one of your interns doofuses uh $15 to make I'm not saying this is not accurate but it's kind of accurate yikes okay anyways hey the name the name is Devon is uh nobody likes Devon okay no ain't nobody liking you Devon and here's the here's the biggest thing honestly if I were to give a piece of advice to all the AI people out there I would stop trying to sell it to VCS and start trying to sell it to people you know what I mean stop selling it to VCS if you really want people to buy it here's the thing you sell people a [ __ ] hoverboard and when they get it it hovers for 1 second and then just catches on fire guess what they're going to do they're going to all hate it all right that's how it works don't sell us a hoverboard just say hey man this thing goes pretty fast like you want a skateboard that's better yeah this one this one has a lithium battery in it like you'll go way faster stop selling to VCS start selling to people all issues are solved by human poll requests so technically 100% I think most issues can be solved uh By Us within 20 minutes but we need to do some more rigorous human study all issues are solved by human pull requests can I just take a second and just the way the AI people phrase things just makes me want to cringe get cringed too hard you know what I mean it's like the the the the thing I'm thinking of is that image where's the image is it damn okay it's not showing up but it's like that it's like the guy that's holding up a vial with something green in it and it's just like finally pure cringe right like that's what I like when I read phrases like whatever we just got done reading that was just like oh yeah right there finally pure cringe there you go when billionaires say you just have to work hard finally peer cringe I mean not all billionaires are created equals some actually became a billionaire in their lifetime which is very impressive I would listen to that guy um dang it okay well we Lo we lost it we lost we lost the Tweet but you know you you know what it says you know what it says just like ah these humans like stop sounding like Mark Zuckerberg okay you sound like a damn lizard don't be a lizard human be a be just be a h no who the hell says this who says this just just talk like a normal person again I swear these things are designed to be sold to VCS they're not designed to be useful to you this just in hot off the presses Devin the first ever AI software engineer the company's also hiring software Engineers so if you if you would like to be a software engineer at at the first ever software engineer it's available right now for you for there's software engineering available there's machine learning researcher and there's also General application uh development because if you want to be able to work on a software engineer that can solve upw work wait a second what happen if that's their whole goal this whole time okay hear me out on this one what if Devon's whole Ploy is that it's going to solve all of up workor and it's going to make all of its money by solving upw work tasks have you thought about that easy money free money infinite money glitch anyways I just think this is hilarious if if if their software engineer was so good why would they hire a just a level three software engineer and a General application developer huh why would you even hire these if so- calleded deid and so good huh why would you ever do that just saying
