Today, we will settle once and
for all, which is better: YouTube or Twitch. I might be slightly biased, but I think YouTube's like
30 times better. What? Pick one: rock, paper or scissors. - Mhm.
- Oh my God. - I like the chicken. - Pick one: rock, paper, or scissors. - Well, what, what? "Pick one: rock, paper, or scissors?" - Yes. - Paper? - Okay. Hey. All right. Moment of truth. She chose paper. What will he choose? - Yo, MrBeast donated 50 pound. "Pick one: rock, paper, or scissors." Did you just donate 50 pound, bro? I'm gonna go with rock, man.
I'm gonna have to go with rock. - Oh, he lost. - He picked rock, she picked
paper, paper beats rock. How much should she get? - Starting off with 1000? - 3000 it is.
- Oh- - Congrats, you won. - Wow. She's very talented at
rock paper scissors. Good job. I love this reaction. Yeah. - Look at that fox. - Congrats. You won. - I can't move. - Uh, she's moving right now. She's lying. - I see she lied to us. - Oh my God. Are you kidding? - She has 15 viewers. Don't tell me I only
donate to big streamers. - I'm shaking. I can't, I
cannot, I can't. I'm shaking. - Zoom in on the shake. Can
we confirm there's a shake? - There is a shake. Look. - All right. We can confirm it. - Is it chocolate or vanilla? - This is our next victim.
Let's hope he wins. - "Pick one: rock, paper, or scissors." "Pick one: rock, paper, or scissors." - "Pick one: rock, paper, or scissors." Let's go rock. 'Cause
we rock hard out here. - All right.
- Ooh. Yeah. - So the Twitch streamer has picked rock. Now we will go over to YouTube. This whole video is YouTube versus Twitch. Let's see what the YouTube streamer picks. - "Pick one: rock, paper, or scissors." All right. Twitch person picked rock. - "Pick one: rock, paper, or scissors." Bro, you just donated 50 pou- $50! Rock paper scissors. All
right. I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say... - Before we show you who won. I need to tell you about the
sponsor funding this video. Because lots of my videos
get copyright claim because of music and
yeah, I'm going broke. You might be wondering where
did all this money come from? It came from TikTok. The greatest app ever invented. - I love TikTok. - You see this clip right here? Wow. That is a funny clip. The best clip I've ever seen. - I really like that clip. - Same. Do you see clips
like that on YouTube? Exactly. With TikTok, you can
watch comedy, or more comedy. Or attractive people lip syncing. Did I mention they have comedy? - Whoa. They have comedy? - Vine committed game end, and TikTok is here to
win the battle royale. Now you might think you have to go to an ancient Mayan temple to
find something this amazing. ♪ Houses driving 15 cars ♪ Wow. But you don't. See that
link in the by-scription? That's not a Mayan temple. That's a redirecting
URL available on what? - IOS and Android. - What other app is doing it like that? And if you don't like TikToks like this, you're just a hater, man. If you don't believe TikTok's
the best, just watch. - I'm gonna say paper. Oh, he won. - Paper. No, scissors,
scissors, I'll say scissors. I'll say scissors. - So he just picked scissors. - Yeah. He changed it. - I was literally about
to donate him $3,000, and he was like "Nah, I don't want money." All right. Well... - It's gonna suck when
you watch this video. - You let down us YouTubers.
Thanks a lot, man. - The Twitch streamers are two out of two. - Twitch is two for
two. Come on YouTubers. Lettin' me down. Disgraced of my platform. What do we give him? I'm
just gonna press random keys. - Oh, that's a big number. - I think I put one too many. - The other streamer chose scissors, good job dad. - Why is the Zoe character disabled? - The other streamer chose scissors. G J dad. - Yo, what the f-? MrBeast6000 donated $2,345. - [Person Offscreen] No way. - It said the other
streamers chose scissors. Good job dad. Nah, bro. Is that the real MrBeast? - Nah, MrBeast doesn't wear purple. We'll start off with the Twitch streamer. - Pick a number between one and 10. - The number is four.
Whoever gets closest wins. - Pick a number between one and ten. - Seven. - Okay. She is fast. - Yeah.
- I mean, what? I should've thought about
that before I said anything. - Nope, too late. - I don't know what happened. - Get muted. Get unmuted. No! - Pick a number between one and 10. - She picked seven.
- Eight? - He picked eight. She won.
- She won. - Dude, YouTube lost again. - You won, he picked eight
and you picked seven, the number was four. - Twitch is three for three. - Man. Maybe Twitch is the
dominant streaming platform. Holy- - You won. He picked eight
and you picked seven. The number was four. - You are kidding me. That... Is this real? I don't know what to say. Hi, sorry. Yeah, you're
in chat. I just realized. Oh, it's awfully warm
in this room right now. - When you give people
money, it gets hotter. - I should quit. - You've gotta stop. You're creating global warming, man. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. - PewDiePie or T series? - They're boat gonna say PewDiePie. - Let's see. - PewDiePie or T series. PewDiePie, of course. - Okay. He picked PewDiePie. - PewDiePie or T Series? I don't know what T Series is. What is T Series? Just pick. - Oh, it's a series. That's awesome. I'll pick PewDiePie. - Aw! Oh wait, yay! All right. Well then they
cancel each other out. All right, they both
picked PewDiePie. Next. - To be fair though, that guy said he didn't like PewDiePie. - I've never enjoyed PewDiePie. - Actually, you're right. He said he didn't, that's
slander on PewDiePie. YouTube guy gets money. - You won, the other guy didn't like poods and that is a sin. - Punishable by death, actually. - Yeah. - MrBeast donated $2,000. "You won, the other guy didn't like poods, and that is a sin." What? It's the 11th commandment. What just happened? Well, you like PewDiePie, and I like you then. - I feel like it is the real one. 'Cause I said PewDiePie. - Well, it is the real MrBeast. Well, thank you very much, MrBeast. - Wanna bring back rock paper scissors? - Yes. - Pick one: rock, paper, or scissors. - Yeah. I'm just gonna stream, might hang out with my friends later. Maybe. I don't know. We'll
see how the night goes. - It depends if you win, you know. - I'm just getting money
left and right here, like what is this now? Paper. - Paper.

don't think we're gonna be doing much more Twitch donation videos. I've just kind of like, I don't know. I've like I've done this a lot. So this will probably be one
of the last ones I'll do. I don't know how to explain it, but like giving money
to people is fun to me, but I've just done this so much that it's kind of starting
to lose it's funness. Like I'm sure if you added it up I've probably given like hundreds
of Twitch streamers money, and it's kind of like,
you know what I mean? It's kind of just like the
same thing over and over. So I don't know. You get the point. - MrBeast, thank you so much. What, what even, what even just happened? ♪ MrBeast6000, oh, oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast6000, oh, oh ♪ ♪ His random videos are
