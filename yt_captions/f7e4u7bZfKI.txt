hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about the engine of the most powerful production cadillac ever the ct5v blackwing and it's also very exciting because it is coming with a manual transmission now there's a pretty hilarious timeline to this so let me catch you up on some news on january 28 2021 gm announced their aspiration for an all-electric future by 2035. the press release states they want to establish quote a safer greener and better world and quote they also said quote the company will also continue to increase fuel efficiency of its traditional internal combustion vehicles end quote now on february 1st just four days later gm announces uh their most powerful cadillac ever the ct5v with a supercharged 6.2 liter v8 engine producing 668 horsepower how beautiful is that gm here to save the world with v8s and manual transmissions now this story gets a bit confusing because yes this is a ct5v blackwing v8 engine however gm developed a 4.2 liter twin turbocharged v8 blackwing engine specifically for the ct6v which is no longer in production but the blackwing name has returned so i thought it'd be fun to compare these two v8 engines okay so let's start off with specifications starting with the ct5 the blackwing so this has a 6.2 liter supercharged v8 which is based on the lt4 engine which came out in the 2014 corvette z06 now the ct6v with the 4.2 liter black wing this came out in 2019 five years later however it is no longer in production so now we're looking at a new variant of the lt4 engine which came out quite a while ago so this is a 6.2 liter supercharged v8 with a 1.7 liter twin screw supercharger about 10 psi if it's anything like the lt4 in the z06 and the engine for the ct6 was a 4.2 liter twin turbo v8 with twin scroll turbochargers and about 20 psi of boost so the 6.2 liter making 668 horsepower at 6 500 rpm 659 pound-feet at 3 600 rpm uh versus that 4.2 liter 550 horsepower at 5 000 and 640 pound-feet of torque at 3 400 rpm both of them having similar compression ratios uh 10 to 1 and 9.8 to 1 thanks to direct injection and its cooling effect helping to increase that compression ratio uh the ct6 engine 131 horsepower per liter versus 108 horsepower per liter with the new engine the new engine variable valve timing but just a single camshaft this is an overhead valve engine uh versus that 4.2 liter blackwing engine the latest and greatest technologically advanced dual overhead cams four valves per cylinder and variable valve timing on both the intake and the exhaust so interesting looking at the bore and stroke of each engine uh the 6.2 liter here with 103.25 bore by 92 millimeter stroke so a little bit you know kind of stretched out cylinders versus a longer stroke versus its bore in the newer engine so these tend to be kind of a more efficient design and these tend to have higher revving better airflow because you can use bigger valves except the thing is they're only using two valves so not really though interestingly even though this is a pushrod engine revs higher 6600 rpm was the lt4 and the z06 it revs higher than 6000 rpm for that latest and greatest 4.2 liter with the dual overhead cams and 4 valves per cylinder so interesting that it was a fairly low revving engine that they put that new 4.2 liter black wing all right so let's start diving into airflow so for the 6.2 liter air coming in through the intake up front traveling through the throttle body then through that eaton 1.7 liter supercharger from there it travels through air-to-water intercoolers before passing into the cylinders and then out the exhaust and looking at this engine i mean it's a super compact design which is what's really so great about these you know large displacement but very compact also you've got with that air-to-water intercooler you've got a very short path for your air intake to flow so you're keeping everything compact and keeping that airflow short which is great for responsiveness of course superchargers helping with response as well and then an interesting thing to look as a comparison standpoint of where you have the intake in the exhaust on the 6.2 liter versus where you have the intake and the exhaust on the 4.2 liter but first let's chat real quickly just about this for lobe eaton supercharger so just for quick demonstration here we have the internals of the four lobe eaton supercharger this is just a smaller version of what's being used in this engine you can see the four lobes there on the end and so these rotors these lobes rotate like so pulling in air along the bottom here and then having that air compress and exit out the back there so it's creating higher pressure on this side versus this side thus giving you boost in your engine now looking at an exploded view of the engine the air will enter up front through the throttle body getting compressed through the inverted twin screw supercharger where it is then directed up and over to then travel down through the air to water intercoolers which are mounted in the cavities you see here in the manifold before entering the intake runners and as you can see this 1.7 liter supercharger means a significant bump in power but keeps the overall size of the engine fairly similar to the naturally aspirated version it's super compact packaging great for flexible engine placement but also the short routing for airflow means good response now this exploded view is of the lt4 engine from the z06 but i was able to get some new images of the actual engine which is going to be going in the ct5v blackwing so this is the new 6.2 liter now moving on to the 4.2 liter you can see the air comes in through the intakes passes through the intake portion of the turbocharger through an air-to-water intercooler then through the throttle body where it is then routed to the intake manifold and into the cylinders and as i mentioned previously you can see that the exhaust is now on the inside of the v and the intake is on the outside versus previously where that was reversed and so the reason why they're doing that with this twin turbo engine is to have that hot center v where you have these turbo chargers so you have a really quick really close routing for those turbo chargers and they're stuck within the center of the engine where you have all that heat and so it's got a short path and it maintains all that energy if you cool that exhaust down that's energy loss that you can't use to spool up that turbo charger so you keep it really hot you route it a very short distance and that enables you to have a more efficient turbo chargers and better response you're also keeping your intake manifolds away from that center of the v where you have those really hot temperatures now this actually has dual air to water intercoolers which is pretty neat they've got you know of course that short path because that intake air doesn't have to travel all the way to the front of the car instead it just goes right across over to the intercooler and then into the cylinders they said they're able to drop the temperature through that intercooler by 130 degrees fahrenheit with only a one psi pressure drop so really cool engine here and the way that they've laid that out neat strategy that you've also seen from the german manufacturers now i want to talk about a v8 with twin twin scroll turbochargers because the way this works out is actually a very beautiful thing so starting off with our basic engine we just have a four cylinder engine with a single turbo single scroll turbo and so of course if you're running a four-stroke engine you have one power stroke uh for every four strokes thus your crankshaft rotates two times 720 degrees for every one cylinder firing so if you have four cylinders well you split those up evenly and so you have 720 degrees of crankshaft rotation two rotations you divide that by your four cylinders and you have a cylinder firing every 180 degrees of rotation so what's happening in your exhaust however is that your exhaust valves may be open for significantly longer than 180 degrees so you know it could be 220 degrees it could be 280 or greater and so what happens is if your firing order for this cylinder this engine right here is one three four two which is common for four-cylinder engines then cylinder one fires your exhaust goes into the turbocharger then cylinder 3 fires and when cylinder 3 fires the exhaust valve for 1 because its duration is longer than 180 degrees that exhaust valve is still open so this exhaust has come out of cylinder 3 the exhaust valve opens and it's just trying to find low pressure areas and low pressure areas include that cylinder number one because it's released all of its exhaust gases or most of them and so this exhaust might then travel back into that cylinder messing up its intake charge and you know decreasing your power decreasing your efficiency and so what you want to do is make sure you don't have any overlap where you've got these two exhaust valves open at the same time one with high pressure one with low pressure and so that's why twin scroll turbo chargers are so advantageous and so what they do is they split up the cylinders into two separate scrolls of that turbocharger but both of those same scrolls feed the same turbine which spins up the same compressor and so as you can see here one and three are on separate scrolls so they're now separating their exhaust pulses and two and four are on separate scrolls so they're separating their exhaust pulses so instead of 180 degrees uh between firings within each exhaust manifold there's 360 degrees between firing so if your exhaust valve duration is 280 degrees well you've got 360 degrees of total timing to wait so it's no trouble it's not going to interfere with the other so as a result by not having that overlap between the exhaust valves you get more power you get better efficiency and you get better response you get your turbo charger to spool up quicker and at lower rpm everything about it's better it's great so how does this work out with a v8 well consider if you had a v8 with a single turbocharger so for all eight cylinders to fire you've got 720 degrees of crankshaft rotation two rotations of that crankshaft so 720 divided by your eight cylinders that means you have a cylinder firing every 90 degrees of crankshaft rotation but if your exhaust valve duration is in the 200s well then you're gonna have multiple cylinders overlapping with their exhausts you don't want that to happen so what do you do well if you separate it into twin turbochargers now you can divide that by two and then twin twin scrolls superchargers now you can divide that by four so 720 divided by eight divided by four and that gives you a 360 degree window for each cylinder just like we had with our four cylinder with a twin scroll turbocharger so very cool the strategy here and it's beautiful how the exhaust pulsation works out now this is just an example this isn't the cadillac but the cadillac they did provide their firing order if you were interested so i think it's fair to ask the question you know was that latest and greatest engine with all the new technology that went into it the 4.2 liter black wing was that better than their lt4 and so part of that comes down to you know preference um and for me personally i'd prefer supercharged engine over a twin turbocharged engine you just get better response i feel like they're more fun but there were just 1400 of these 4.2 liter black wings made which you know it's it's a bit disappointing they put so much money and research and time into this um it was new it was different they tried something a unique engine for cadillac which i thought was very cool and then they they end up dropping it now was it actually any better i mean it made less power i don't think powers you know everything here and they could probably crank up the boost if they wanted to but from an efficiency standpoint it certainly was better if you look at fuel economy numbers i mean the all-wheel drive 5500 pound cadillac ct6v is getting 14 mile per gallon city 25 mile per gallon highway versus the rear wheel drive 3500 pound uh 2016 z06 with the lt4 engine is getting 13.23 so the fact that it's doing just slightly better uh you know not that impressive but the fact that it's doing just slightly better with so much more weight and all-wheel drive so definitely a more efficient engine i guess i should read that quote again from the beginning of the video the company will also continue to increase fuel efficiency of its traditional internal combustion vehicles or not whatever now very exciting to me both the ct4v blackwing and the ct5v blackwing are coming standard with six-speed manual transmissions how cool is that rear wheel drive tons of power manual transmission i love it they're coming with rev matching flat foot shifting which they say for the ct-4 v which has a twin turbo charged engine helps it maintain boost through that shift and because i just love trolling far too much here's a quote from an executive chief engineer at gm who during the reveal of the ct5v blackwing stated quote to be drivers cars first and foremost you need to row your own gears so standard six-speed transmission in both vehicles both referring to the ct4 and ct5e blackwing so there you have it i i was wondering if the c8 corvette was a driver's car uh but i i guess it's not and i guess in 2035 i guess they won't have any driver's cars which is kind of disappointing okay enough trolling thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
