- This is $1 million in cash. Now I'm gonna give
random people one minute to try to spend all this money. Karl start the timer. You guys have 60 seconds, whatever you put in
this cart I will pay for up to $1 million. (crickets chirping) Starting now.
- Go, go. - It's been six seconds. (upbeat music) Oh, that's a big TV for our cart. - [Chris] Who wants one more TV? (upbeat music continues) - It's almost been a minute. It's almost been a minute. Almost been a minute. Oh, and it has been officially a minute. On the dot, no extra time. You did good, little man. I told these guys I'd pay for whatever they put in this card. Let's see the damage. Holy crap, you grabbed so many gift cards. And these are $10 to $500.
Look how many he grabbed. $13,000 in gift cards. Play back him grabbing these in slow mo and put "Play of the day." (dramatic music) Oh, boys. They managed to spend
$18,000 in under a minute, which is below $1 million. So congratulations, you guys get to keep all this stuff.
- Yeah! (boys cheering) - Our next location is this
entire jewelry store here. Jewelry is really expensive. As you can see, this stuff
here costs $900,000 by itself, and all this stuff here cost $1.3 million. And of all the stores, if someone was to spend $1
million, this would be it. For this next one we have
Ashley here. Here's a bowl. In a second I'm gonna start this timer. Whatever you put in this bowl before this timer hits
30 seconds, I'll pay for. Starting now. (group yelling)
- Go. Go. What do you want? What do you want? Tell me, tell me. - Just put it in the bowl.
- Chandler. Chandler, catch. - [Ashley] Can I go over there? - Oh, golden necklace.
- Hurry. - [Ashley] Yes. - Go, yeah. Go see Karl. - Nice, Karl. Yes, yes.
- Of course. Of course. - [Jimmy] It's only been five seconds. - I love this necklace right here. - You love this necklace?
- Yes, I love it. - I got this necklace. She
loves the necklace, Jimmy! - Five, four,
- Oh, yes, that ring, perfect. Perfect. Oh, yep yep yep yep.
- three, two, one. Oh, okay. Times up, times up. Okay. That's a lot of really expensive jewelry. Let's go see the damage. Is this like real? - That is 18 karat gold. - This is $5,800? There's
so much more here. - [Karl] It looks like
you just robbed a pirate. - [Chandler] What are you
gonna do with all of it? - Givin' some gifts away. - That's true,
- Keep some of it. - [Chandler] It's Christmas time. - Christmas time. - We just finished scanning what felt like a hundred items of jewelry. What's the damage? Oh my. - 60,990. - Yeah!
- Wait, what? - I can live with 60 grand.
I can live with that. Boys, on three jump. - Alright.
- One, two, three. (explosion booming) For this next store we
have a special guest. - That's my brother. - Whatever is in this cart when
this timer hits one minute, I will pay for it, it is all yours. Starting now. ("Green Hill Zone")
(boys shouting) Wait, wait, wait. That was the joke. I didn't actually start it. - Oh. My bad.
- That was a joke. That was a joke. Oh, but it is going now. ("Green Hill Zone")
- Does that cart count? - [Sean] Games! Games! Games! - [Chris] Goin' Fortnite. - [Sean] I need all of this. I need all. - [Karl] Keyboards will work for- - [Jimmy] I don't know why
Sean jumped over this counter. I wanna let you guys know that we actually know
the owner of this store and he was okay with everything we did, but Sean got a little
carried away at some parts. - [Cameraman] What are you doing? - [Karl] Sean! - Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. - It's okay.
- Games! - [Chris] Are we just grabbin' stuff? - [Sean] Keep throwin'
games, keep throwin' games. - Sean, I'm getting these Pokemon cards! - [Jimmy] 54 seconds. 55 seconds. - Gotta get these.
- 56 seconds. - Two. One.
- I need it! I need it all! - Done. Done. Done. Done. First things first, we made a mess. Everyone, we need to pick up. Anything on the floor, put in
the cart, we gotta pay for. - PS4.
- Who grabbed a whole PlayStation 4 Pro with no box?
- Ya boy. - Where even was this? - I found it. (upbeat music)
(scanner beeping) - I'm smiling underneath this
mask, but you can't tell. Thanks to Jimmy for
giving me all these games. Obviously I don't need all this, so I'm gonna be giving a lot of it away to friends and donating it. And, yeah. - Next up we have John Deere. We're gonna do something special. Our contestant is actually Chris's father. - Yeah, he's a farmer. Let's do it. - So before we begin,
I need clarification. Chris, is this your father? - That is my father. - Now that we got that out
the way, we can proceed. You have 30 seconds and anything
you touch, I will pay for. Since he's your father, we're not gonna make him put it in a cart, 'cause it'd be hard to
put a lawnmower in a cart. So anything he touches
I will pay for starting- - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Oh, wait, what? What? Wait. - I gotta make this easier. - I'm gonna go ahead and start the timer. Starting now, go! (upbeat country music) (prices dinging) - Touch the jet pack, touch the jet pack! (Chris yelling) - Touch this tractor.
- More coolers? He's touchin' everything in the store. - [Karl] He touched a tractor! - [Cameraman] I don't even need to help. - [Jimmy] It looks like Chris
pulled up something for you. I forgot they actually sell tractors here. - Touch it.
- Time. Wait, how much is this? - I think like 50 or 60 grand. - Who woulda thought that the person at the John
Deere store would spend more than the person at the jewelry store. - I knew we were gonna do this store, so I made sure to get him a tractor and pull it right up to the door. He had like two seconds
left. It was clutch. Now you finally know what it feels like to spend Jimmy's money like I do. - We're grabbing everything he touched and putting it in this pile here. Look at all this stuff. - Why does he need 17 weed whackers? - How did you do this in 30
seconds? Did you actually run? - Yeah. - I don't think I've ever
seen your run in my life. - I wanna thank Mr. Jimmy,
Mr. Beast and everybody. It'll make life a lot
easier. A lot simpler. - The total of everything here is $30,000. And if you include the tractor out front, it is over 80 grand is
what you managed to spend. - Let's go! - That is insane. We are now in Walmart. This time I'm gonna give the
next person a little more time. This is Jordan. You told
me you're a school teacher? - I am. - Okay. How many students do you have? - On my roster, about 91. - Jordan, we wanted to
do something special for your students. Here's a shopping cart. - Okay. - Anything you put in this shopping cart, we will pay for for your students. I'm gonna start this timer here. Anything that's in this cart
in five minutes, I'll pay for. Alright, timer started. - For the students. For the students.
- Okay. Just for the students. (upbeat music) Let's just grab TVs for your students. - How 'bout some gamer headsets? - Yes. Yes.
- Okay. There we go. - [Chris] I got a vacuum cleaner,
'cause children are messy. - Yes. They need that. - Alright, two minutes has gone by. You got three minutes left. - What else? What else? What else? What else? - Can we just have all your laptops? - Notebooks. - The keys aren't working.
- Okay. We might have to come back
to the laptops in a bit. Let's go somewhere else. That sucks they couldn't
open up the laptop. As you can see, we did
cross the five minute mark, but I just don't feel
like this is enough stuff. Your students deserve more. Here's what I'm gonna do. Oh wow, it reset. Well you have five minutes, let's go. - Okay, let's do it. They could definitely use
headphones. Projector. - Hello. - Okay, I'm gonna go find you
a good cart of goodness, okay? - Okay.
- It's gonna be good. - I trust you. - They finally opened up the laptops. - School supplies comin' through for the kids.
- Oh my goodness. (upbeat show music) - There's no PlayStation's,
only controllers. - Five seconds left. - Alright.
- Three. - Oh, this.
- Two. I mean, one, let's throw more lamps. Oh.
- Yes. - Did you just grab a
giant rack of light bulb? The time is up, but this
isn't her only cart. She also had the cart full
of supplies from Chris, her other cart that she filled up, and Karl said he was filling up a cart. I think we did good work. Let's go check out.
- I did great. - [Jimmy] What did you get? - Listen, kids love snacks. - You know who else love snacks? - Who?
- Me. - Oh no.
- They're gonna be elated. They're gon' be in shock, for sure.
- Yeah. (upbeat music)
(scanner beeping) In these carts is over
$10,000 worth of stuff for her students. And we didn't wanna leave
Jordan empty handed, so we have a surprise for her. Shaun, bring it on in. This is Shaun, our bodyguard, because we're in the middle of Walmart. Thank you for the briefcase
and making sure I don't die. Jordan, congratulations,
here is $10,000 in cash. - No. No. No. No. - You're gonna make me cry. - Just don't know. I just don't know. Oh my God. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. We have so many bills
that need to be paid, and Christmas is comin' up. My son's birthday is Friday - Oh, really.
- and we weren't gonna be able to get him things that he wanted. My husband's birthday is the 21st, he was just willing not to get anything because things are so behind. And so I'm just so grateful. - I'm just really glad
the money and all that just went to someone
who actually needed it. That makes me really happy, and yeah, we're gonna
head to the next store. - Thank you so much. - No problem. Up next we're not at a store,
we're actually outside. This is Mitch. And Mitch, we have cars lined up for days, - Whoa.
- cut to the drone shot. So here's the deal. Two football fields away is a
six figure Lamborghini, okay? So basically we have a lot of really expensive cars lined up, the further away they are,
the more expensive the car is. And I have a stopwatch here. You have exactly one minute to get a car and drive it across this finish line. And if you do, you get to keep the car. But, if you don't cross
the line, you're just shy, you don't get the car.
- High risk, high reward? - Exactly.
- Wow. - So the second nicest car is a Tesla, it's still worth over $40,000. - Wow.
- So, gentlemen are you ready? (Karl yelling)
- I'm ready! Woo! - Let's go, Jimmy. - Okay, he did it, he's gone. The time is starting.
They're off in the truck. - [Karl] Holy cow. - Oh my God.
- Oh my gosh. He's going so fast. - [Chris] He's going for the Lambo! Nevermind, he's going for the Tesla. - Oh my gosh, is he gonna get it in time? - Key.
- Where's the key? - Oh no, he doesn't what he's doing. The password's 6969! - Someone help 'im! - [Cameraman] Go, go, go. (men yelling) (intense music) - [Karl] Oh my God it's really close. - 10, 9, 8, 7. And just in time, he got it. With eight seconds to spare, you just won a brand new tesla! (men yelling) - [Cameraman] You got it to the line! - Oh my God. Are you serious? - That is your Tesla. - This GPS is bigger than my TV at home. This is a dream right now.
This is literally a dream. - Mitch is here because he's
a subscriber to the channel. That's why we invited him to compete. - Mr. Beast just gave me a Tesla
because I watch his videos, I like his videos. - It's that simple. If you're not already,
hit the subscribe button, we're gonna go to the next store. - You're the man. - To spice things up, I
literally made my own store, but everything is wrapped as a present. - I'm all cozied up. - I don't know why that was relevant. - I am all cozied up. I don't know what to tell you. First off, I need you to pick a number between one and three. - Three. - So you, Brandon, have three minutes to grab as many presents
as you can from here and put them underneath
this Christmas tree. I just started this timer, which means you're
three minutes has begun. - Just start throwin' stuff. - And you might be
wondering, what is here? Well, here's a couch. - [Chris] How do you
know? It's wrapped up. - Over a minute has elapsed. You still got two minutes left. - I can't pick this up, but
I don't know what it is. - [Jimmy] Everything. - It's so heavy.
- Oh, jeez. - I dunno what it is. Alright, so I should probably mention that we only bought
really ex, a PS4, what? Everything here is
actually kind of expensive. (upbeat music) Two minutes and 20 seconds has elapsed. 40 seconds remaining. - Karl. - [Jimmy] Brandon, you
got 25 seconds left. - Hurry! - 360.
(present boinging) - Pick something else. Eight, seven. Alright, it's not even that
close, 'cause, alright. Four, three, two, one. Stop. Bazinga. Bazinga. Three minutes has elapsed. Alright, so let's go around the edge. This isn't on the red,
so we gotta kick it out. These are on. The Foreman grill is on. What about this? Oh.
- Oh. - All I'm sayin' is I might
have to sneeze real quick. - Hurry. Oh, wait.
(Jimmy mocking sneezing) - Oh, okay. I finished my third sneeze. - [Brandon] Looks like it's in. - Okay. Good enough. Congratulations on all
the brand new stuff. You wanna just start opening some of it? - Sure. - Yo, let's go.
- You got some logs. - Where is the "Frozen?" I got that specifically
for the four year old. It's got Anna and Elsa. It is - A PS4.
- a PS4. She'll love it. - Ooh.
- It's a gamin' PC. - I'm not gonna make you
watch us unwrap all of this. On the screen is everything
else that he won. - Been a dream come true. Can't thank you enough, Mr. Beast. It's gonna be a game changer for the way our year has been. - I'm proud, man. I hope
they have a great Christmas. Honestly, I thought
he'd grab more presents and we still have a bunch left over. So I decided to let my security
guard, Shaun, have a go. Shaun, you need a recliner! - Yes, I do. Come on, pick it up. Pick it. Is this a lawnmower? It
looks like a lawnmower. - Hey Shaun, if you hate giant
70 inch TVs, don't grab this. - Oh, I'm grabbin'. The kids'll love it for their room. - Congratulations,
Shaun, on all this stuff. Because you're super muscular, you were able to fit a bunch in here. Don't try to mess with
us, look at this man. - This is a heck of a surprise. My kids are gonna love it. You're all about the kids, that's why I like keeping you safe. - We are now at Karl's house. - Why do we keep coming here? - Meet Matt. Matt, meet Karl. - Hello, Matt. - Try touching this TV. You touched the TV. Let's get it outta here. - Oh my God.
- Okay, there we go. You now own that TV. Karl, I owe you a TV
that's twice as expensive. - Ooh.
- That's how it works. You have 19 touches left. You can touch anything in Karl's house. - Well, I just got an Xbox. - There you go. Hey!
- Alright, well. Does that mean I have
to buy Karl two Xbox Xs? - Where's his room? - Oh, my room's up there.
- Upstairs. Matt, Matt, Matt. What are
you touching right now? - Door knob.
- You're touching a doorknob. - I got it.
- Okay. That is touch number three of Matt's. Matt, you just earned yourself a doorknob. - [Karl] I just got two door knobs. - [Matt] Alright. - Okay. It's kind of a blanket, but
we'll include the mattress too. I think so. - Gonna be number four. - [Karl] Another TV? - MacBook. - Karl, you just keep it, I'll just buy him a MacBook
that's twice as good. - We shoulda thought of
that with the mattress. - Yeah. (glass tinkling) Oh. - That's my Monster mini fridge. - [Chris] Here's your doorknob. - Oh yeah. Thank you so much. - I want more VR. - You're enjoying this
more than you should. Hey, hey, Tareq, can I see that? - Oh yes. - There you go. This is now yours. - [Chris] You got Tareq's job. - AirPods. - Sure. Alright, boom. 18, 19, one more touch. Oh no, a Q-tip fell. Oh, darn. (boys yelling)
- Oh, no. - Tyler just mentioned that
he coulda touched the house. - But you got a Q-tip, so that's cool. - I thought about touchin' the house, big brainin' it, but I didn't. Didn't think I was gonna get
this. I need one of these. Got the bed. I got the Xbox. Super excited, super stoked. - I got two PCs. I got two beds. Dude, if a girl comes over
