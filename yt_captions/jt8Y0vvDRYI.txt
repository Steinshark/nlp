ladies and gentlemen this video is being recorded on January 24 2023 and the game of chess has literally never been more popular than it is right now it is so popular in fact that it is crashing chess.com servers on a daily basis in this video I am going to take you through exactly why the chess boom is happening I'm going to explain to you why the chess.com servers are crashing based on a statement that they put out and at the end of the video I will share personal analytics from my own YouTube dashboard things that you never see and these will explain to you why so many people are getting into chess right now if you're a returning viewer hi welcome back you know me if you don't know me I'm Levy or also known as Gotham chess let's talk about the chess boom all right it's gonna be a short video I'm going to talk a lot it's going to be things on your screen I hope you enjoy uh chess is booming and our servers are struggling this is a message put out by chess.com um if you want to read the article I'll put it in the description we'll read this and then we are going to look at some of the reasons why chess is booming you see the Mogul chess boxing championship you see Messi and Ronaldo give me like 10-15 minutes of your time and we're going to be in good shape you're going to find things out in this video that you otherwise may not have okay on December 31st we had 7 million active members on chess.com in a single day for the first time on January 20th we had 10 million members so they basically doubled their uh not doubled but it basically went up by you know from seven to to ten uh in the span of about you know three weeks which is crazy I mean 3 million when it's originally 7 million right goes up that much it traffic on chess.com in general has nearly doubled especially during peak hours from noon to 4 pm Eastern we're very sorry we know it's frustrating uh and now they're going to discuss what's going on here so I don't know if you guys know this shells.com was number two in the free game section of the IOS app store and actually was number one in some countries it was gardenscapes and chess Play and Learn that's chess.com I mean first of all I don't know what the heck these bozos are doing playing gardening games but that is insane because if you think about the amount of kids that are using iPads and phones just to download random nonsense games to play and even adults like we we know we got to kill a little bit of time we all have a guilty pleasure for me it was OverWatch okay that game is like 20 and extremely toxic but that's crazy that it was the second most downloaded app that is millions of people since December 5th 1 million people have solved the daily puzzle uh on January January 19th we had one million visits from Google for the first time uh we had over 300 000 members joining a single day and uh there was almost 32 million games played I mean think about that 32 million chess games and this is the chess.com internal dashboard showing the craziness that's going on right now um now here they talk about some of these things I'm gonna go actually more more in depth as a person who is a content creator and I'm constantly around analytics and I love this stuff and this is all the stuff I think about and goes into my titles and everything I'll get into that a little bit more most popular social media post uh 2022 featuring Messi and Ronaldo many celebrities talking about Chess ever since Queen's Gambit or some you know some other stuff cheating controversy and the resulting drama with lawsuits uh creators blah blah blah chess boxing I don't know how many people got into you know chess because of the acquisition but okay yes during the holidays there's a lot of Chess gifts very much a thing uh App Store and of course yeah mittens I mean chess.com's mittensbot was unbelievably viral like if you check Google Trends it's uh it's completely horrifying how many people just know chess because of mittens and um so here there's uh some description about the servers uh their database spins out the control they can't write fast enough 250 000 new accounts are being created every day people are playing more games people add friends commenting chatting using classroom analysis blah blah blah and this is mostly for the developers uh let's be honest 95 of us watching this right now just want the servers to work faster we know absolutely nothing about what it takes to run a website or to code it and I've actually seen some threads where people are discussing like you know yes it could be better but a website cannot really prepare for a doubling of its traffic in three weeks this is basically what I'm reading regardless of what it's coded in and you've probably seen this 502 database connection error um and what chess.com is doing right now is they are ordering expensive uh they have something uh sharding here not that sharding this type of sharding um you know I I don't know I you can read through this this might mean something to you essentially they're saying we understand this is a problem we are not unaware of it and you know we're ordering expensive material and Hardware to kind of improve everything and it's true like you know if I download chess.com and I get into chess and I get a server error twice in the first like four attempts like I'm not gonna use it I'm not gonna lie like imagine your friend recommended you a website right and and you know you're getting into this thing and also it's just crashing all the time like you can forgive it every now and then so chess.com was just I mean who could have expected this right it's not I can't I can't say it's their fault I can say that I wish it was better and I wish you know but why would you spend the money on potentially you know going from seven million to 10 million users in three weeks that seems completely nuts but this seems to be the new reality all right and they made this post you can get into it people here discussing in the comments um and unfortunately this just kind of like the people who are already in the Chess World are just gonna have to deal with this you know New Wave now all right let's talk about what's going on in chess apologies for the you know dark to light switch chess has literally never had a higher popularity on Google and on YouTube than right now you folks you have to understand something you and I've seen this on Reddit YouTube comments whatever everybody has a theory people tell me what they think is going on and I'm the Creator and I'm gonna tell you right now and hopefully you know it sticks um the chess has literally never been popular 100 is basically Peak Interest in the last five years you go back 20 years there's only been one other time it's been close this is Queen's Gambit this is p Queen's Gambit Mania and this is where we are now and it's beyond that I mean I think it's literally double okay it is absolutely nuts what is going on now remember chess.com said Messi and Ronaldo put out this post yes absolutely this is just good exposure for chess period someone sees this they're like oh chess maybe that's you know something that I played in the past in school but I didn't have a lot of friends who did it it was boring to learn back in the day a lot of you watching who are in your 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s blah blah blah you probably played chess in school at some point but it was lame there's no good teachers like me and anybody else you watch on YouTube right so this was good uh chess boxing was absolutely massive I mean this this event was absolutely huge um I also did two wired interviews I didn't throw them up on here but uh if you go to the wired YouTube page uh it's uh it's actually quite I wonder if I can just you know go there right now um my videos on wired no my videos on wired had so many views it was absolutely shocking this one pro answer question 4.3 million three and a half million on the one I did prior the only person that had more views than me is Millie Bobby Brown and Jenna Ortega that is insane it's Millie Bobby Brown Jenny Ortega and Gotham chess that's nuts okay now some other stuff also happened between December and January I'm gonna get into that uh Emil sotovsky who is a CEO of uh fide I thought he was director General I think he got a promotion congratulations to him uh he he commented on this post and he said I feel video events were among the key drivers Madrid candidates was a you know just basically saying over the board tournaments like the Chennai Olympiad World rapid and Blitz also contributed and you know tell it to your mittens with this smiley face that's uh how the russian-speaking audience writes a smiley face um he's not wrong that these events were massive successes where he is incorrect is the events themselves are accredited to fide but here's the thing you need media Outlets to get those events out there and the number one reason the world rapid and Blitz went viral is because of these guys Sagar Shah uh amruta uh and uh the whole chess based India team um like these guys are unbelievable you they are still uploading live footage they work look at their shorts views from the last month eight million seven five five this is all that tournament that Emil is talking about I got news for you that tournament probably has more than 120 million views look at these shorts this is all from the last two weeks by the way soccer you can uh I'll invoice you for the free promo I'm just kidding um they are awesome all right they are absolutely awesome and uh you gotta you like you absolutely have to check them out um just incredible stuff I mean I get their videos all the time and uh oh I didn't even see I get videos all the time I didn't even realize it wasn't subscribed so I'm gonna hit that subscribe button here you go that's the thing like sometimes you don't even realize because I see their content so much I thought I would subscribe I had no idea there you go I'll subscribe and these guys probably have 200 million views in the last couple of months all right World rapid and Blitz so Emil's not wrong but if there was no media outlets for these over-the-board tournaments folks you know it and I know it you wouldn't even know that these tournaments are going on sometimes you find out a chess tournament is going on when the tournament is literally happening or a day before all right so fide is good they're running the tournaments fine uh you know but you need you need like if you go to the I'm not even gonna go to the fide YouTube channel because we you know you you need guys like this you need Partners who are very good at creating the content now folks I told you at the beginning of the video I'm gonna share my personal analytics this is gonna shock you I don't know if you've been on my social blade recently all right I don't know if you've been on my uh let's go over here you may have noticed that in the month of December and the month of January something weird has been going on on my channel look at these look at that chart look at this folks in the month of December I gained 300 000 subscribers folks it's January 24th right now I am already up nearly 500 000 in the month of January like there is a legitimate chance of this continues I will get up to seven eight maybe nine maybe ten by the end of the year that growth is catalyzed by the following I started posting short form content my Tick Tock Channel you don't have to follow me you don't you might not even like tick tock I have 220 million views on Tick Tock in the last 50 days December 1st until now 220 million here's a peek inside of my YouTube dashboard I've never shown this on stream before if I hit that button you'll see how much money I make I'm not going to do that maybe a little you know maybe at 10 million um look at these numbers like this is completely nuts look at 156 million views that is now 380 and if you go to my Instagram it's a lot of the same thing Instagram reels get they make less they have less less uh exposure but it's also about 20 30 million folks we are talking about four hundred plus million views between December 1st and yesterday two days ago all right whenever I you know created this all right I posted 92 pieces of content I am a Workhorse but views are coming in from the short speed browse features suggest that all these different things not even subscribers okay this is the stuff that makes chess boom in the last 50 or so days just my face and then you count all the people that are reposting my content illegally violating copyright my face might be out there five six hundred million times chess based India content is out there one two three hundred million times boat says started posting more short form content her face and chess is out there twenty Thirty forty million times all the other short form chess creators on tick tock on YouTube whatever you want to call it chess Clips Magnus started streaming again Hikaru speed Chess Championship okay World rapid and Blitz Magnus wins the Triple Crown all right Hikaru uh gets second place uh in the in I believe it was the world Blitz like everything everything like all of it chess has had billions of Impressions the amount of times my videos have been recommended not clicked but just recommended in the last 40 days it I mean it's something like 2 billion yeah literally literally in the last uh 50 days my channel has been recommended to people two billion times and it has been clicked on about you know five six percent of the time and that translates into views on my videos so I can give you the personal uh element of it which is this is the amount of people that are seeing chess through my content I can give you a landscape overview of wired chess boxing Messi and Ronaldo uh chess base India anything Hikaru or Magnus does always has a good chance of going viral uh botes all right like it's it's out there the mittens bot it is all out there and chess has literally never been more popular so the servers are struggling uh but keep signing up for accounts uh it's free and um play chess teach your friend chess really like there has never been a better time to get into chess and it's really not as boring as you might have thought in childhood it's it's a little bit of a dorky game but it's also pretty fun and uh learning it the long the the Younger You Learn chess the much higher chance you have of becoming extremely good but doesn't mean that if you start at 20 or 30 even you know later than that you can achieve great things it just takes time patience dedication uh and you know there's you can start on my channel learning some of my beginner stuff you can start anywhere else uh that's the beautiful thing about Chess right now if you get into it you don't have to stick with one Creator like let's say you get into chess through me but I'm too loud and annoying there's like 20 other YouTube channels you can go to that's the beautiful thing about it so that's what's going on with chess that's what's going on with chess.com yeah I'll see in the next video get out of here
