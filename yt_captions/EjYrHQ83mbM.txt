toyota has developed a very clever all-wheel drive system in fact it's the first new all-wheel drive system toyota has created for a sports car in over 20 years it can send as much as 60 of the engine's torque to the front wheels or it can send as much as 70 of the torque to the rear wheels so how does it do it hello everyone and welcome i had a lengthy conversation with the chief engineer of the gr corolla and as a result we're going to be learning all about the all-wheel drive system used in the gr corolla as well as the gr yaris all right so let's start off with a simplified diagram and overview of how this all-wheel drive system works so we've got our engine sending power through a transmission that is ultimately going to be rotating this transfer case or bevel box which is going to be powering these front wheels you can see here in purple that will rotate causing this front differential to rotate the front tires now this can be an open differential or you can opt for a torso limited slip differential in both the front and the rear now this bevel box is also rotating a drive shaft which is headed towards the back so simultaneously it is always spinning this shaft as well as the front drive shafts for the front tires so that driveshaft heading towards the back then has a clutch pack at the back so it can engage or disengage from that rear differential which is then powering the rear wheels the beauty of this all-wheel drive system is that allows for very different torque splits so for example if this clutch pack were to be fully open you'd basically have a front wheel drive vehicle now that's pretty much never going to happen we'll get into some exceptions but you're pretty much never going to have that 100 versus zero in the rear torque split your options are front which is a front bias of 60 in the front 40 at the rear track which splits everything 50 50 and rear which sends 30 percent of the torque to the front and 70 so the majority of the torque to that rear axle really lively for some nice back road feel so how do you create these very precise torque splits well the key to understanding this comes down to this drive shaft as well as this clutch pack so this drive shaft right here is rotating with a 0.7 faster gear ratio and so what that means is if you were to take this vehicle and put it up on jack stands and drive it at a set rpm and let's say your wheels your front wheels are spinning at 1 000 rpm and this clutch pack is closed up well your rear wheels are going to be spinning at 1007 rpm so the rear wheels if this clutch pack were to be fully locked would be rotating 0.7 faster than the front wheels and that interaction occurs because of this gearing right here now that's not actually what happens because when all of these wheels are on the ground of course they always want to be spinning at the same speed otherwise you're going to have that bind happening within the drivetrain so what really happens is both wheels while they're on the ground are going to be spinning at the same speed so let's say the front's at a thousand rpm the rear is also at a thousand rpm where the slip occurs is within this clutch pack so you're always going to be having that 0.7 slip occur within this clutch pack as it is transferring that torque to the rear okay but how does a 0.7 difference in gear ratio translate to all of these various different torque splits well the best way to think about this is by thinking of this clutch pack as a brake now what do i mean okay so remember the rear axle as you start to engage this clutch pack it wants to spin up this rear axle the rear axle wants to spin faster than the front axle another way of thinking about this is that when you start to engage this clutch pack the front axle wants to rotate slower than the rear axle in other words it's a break it's trying to slow down this front axle so what's happening is you're creating engine torque and you're sending that engine torque to the front as well as the back and then this clutch pack right here is causing you to try and reduce that front wheel speed meaning break that front axle and so you're taking away your subtracting torque from that front axle and instead that torque is going to the rear axle all right let's go over an example to help clarify this so let's say we are in front mode meaning we want a 60 40 split and let's say our engine is producing a hundred pound feet of torque in other words we want 60 pound-feet going to the front and 40 pound-feet going to the rear well that engine produces a hundred pound feet of torque and if this clutch pack is open pretty much all of that torque is going to the front axle now remember this clutch pack acts like a brake and we know that we're in front mode so a control module tells this clutch pack that because we have a hundred pound feet of torque to provide a subtractive torque a braking force of 40 pound feet so then we have 100 minus 40 that gives us 60 pound feet on the front axle and then that braking torque is delivered to the rear axle so we have 40 pound feet on the rear axle so if you want to increase the torque that is delivered to the rear axle for example for using track mode and sending 50 or rear mode and sending 70 well you're simply going to be creating a larger subtractive torque using this clutch pack from the front axle so the more pressure you provide within this clutch pack the more torque the more resistance you have on this front axle and as a result you're subtracting more torque away from that front axle and delivering it to the rear axle now in reality it's a bit more complicated than how i make it sound because what you're actually monitoring is what is your engine torque what's your gear ratio of what gear you're in and what's your final drive ratio and then from that wheel torque what is the actual torque you need to reduce using this clutch pack in order to create that 60 40 split or 50 50 split or 30 70 split and that is all constantly being adjusted as your engine load changes as your gear changes in order to maintain that ideal ratio of whatever mode you have selected now you might wonder why 0.7 what's so special about this number and really all you need is a speed differential just like how brakes work right you have a rotor spinning at a very high speed and then you have a brake pad that presses against that that isn't moving and so you have that speed differential and thus you can create friction in this braking force the same idea applies with this clutch pack all you need is a speed differential the thing is you don't want to go with a really high speed differential because that means more heat is going to be going into that clutch pack and thus more wear remember this clutch pack is pretty much always engaged and so there's always going to be that slip occurring but in this case we're only talking about a 0.7 speed differential between the two and so within that clutch pack that's really not that much slip thus you're not going to generate that much heat so reliability becomes a concern when you hear that a clutch pack is always going to be slipping i think people really underestimate just how durable wet multi-plate clutches are in this case i count 12 clutch discs and also that's going to be soaked in oil so it's a very durable very reliable thing and also we have very low slip just 0.7 percent that is occurring so there's not going to be that much heat really generated within it however let's get to a worst case scenario what if there is a lot of heat generated within that clutch pack what are some of the levers that you can pull on one of the things i found really interesting is that one of the things they can do on a straight away say you're driving on a track and this thing is starting to get really hot on straightaways where you really don't need any power being sent to the rear wheels they can fully open up this clutch pack so that it's not going to have so much heat being generated so that you're basically just driving front wheel drive on the straightaways you're still putting down the full amount of power traction is an issue at these high speeds so on those long straights you can actually open that up to help remove some heat from it and help cool it down that's one lever that you can pull on of course if it just gets to the absolute limit and things are getting way too hot within the clutch pack you can provide cautions you can start to disable things you can open up that clutch pack and say hey you need to chill out the thing's overheating you can't keep driving at these speeds and we're not going to allow it so there are levers where you can pull off and say we're not going to let you destroy this thing but realistically speaking it's not going to be an issue with heat because of the low amount of slip and the size and number of clutch plates it's also worth mentioning that going down a straight if it does decide to help cool the clutch pack and open it up and thus make the vehicle front wheel drive the second you have any steering input or yaw it re-engages that clutch now i was curious would it be possible to send a hundred percent of the torque to the rear wheels and thus having a rear wheel drive vehicle with that zero 100 torque split and i was told that it's not possible in low gears again going back to this acting like a brake and having this subtractive nature of torque from the front axle there's simply too much torque in these low gears in order for it to subtract all of that torque using the clutch pack i was told it might be possible in gears four five and six where you have a lower wheel torque so for example if you're looking at your first gear wheel torque you've got 273 pound-feet of torque multiplying that by your first gear ratio multiplying that by your final drive ratio and that gives you about 3 900 pound-feet of torque simply too much for this clutch pack to subtract but in sixth gear 273 pound-feet of torque multiplying that by your sixth gear and your final drive ratio and that gives you 850 pound-feet of torque and that's something that might be manageable for it to subtract from the front and thus have it acting like a zero 100 split now it doesn't actually do this right these are the three modes right here that you'll actually be driving in now what about drifting will it drift one of the interesting things the chief engineer told me was that if you're on a high grip surface you don't actually want to use rear mode if you're attempting to drift and so you might intuitively think okay rear mode 3070 that's what i want to use if i'm trying to drift this car and so the reason he said well you'd be better to choose track or front especially track with that 50 50 split is that you're trying to get all four wheels to spin in a drift not just the rear so if you go with rear and you have this 30 70 torque split and most of the torque goes to the rear axle and you get that rear axle to kick out perhaps you yank the handbrake well you don't have enough torque going to the front and so the front is still going to maintain grip and so it's not going to be overloaded and if the front isn't overloaded it's going to pull you out of that drift because it's all-wheel drive so you need all four to spin and so on a high grip surface it's actually better to go with something like track or front where you're sending more torque to the front to help get all four wheels to be rotating pretty challenging considering how much power we have in this scenario uh but that is your best bet and then if you're on a low grip surface sure you can go for rear you can go for front you can go for track you're gonna get these all to spin up and he did say that occasionally in these really low grip scenarios like on ice and snow you might have moments where this clutch actually locks up and these rear wheels are thus spinning a little bit faster than the front it's not intentionally doing that but it might happen occasionally remember what it's trying to do is always keep the front and the rear wheels speeds relative to the ground to be the same uh however you know you're going to have that slip occur within the clutch pack occasionally it could happen that it locks up in a icy scenario so you could actually get you know a bit of a nice slide because your wheels are actually spinning faster than the front now once my gr corolla review is live i will provide a link to that right here and in the meantime if you're wondering how is it possible for a transmission to have two different final drive ratios well i've got another video here that explains how you could have two different final drive ratios on the same transmission thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
