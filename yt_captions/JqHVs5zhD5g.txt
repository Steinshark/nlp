so we've gone over our four basic uh postulates and now I have a little another table here where I'm just numbering the four different uh effects again and I'm I'm numbering them in this way because in some sense it's like a staircase for some of these you can't really have one without having the one under so you can't have superposition without some label for your space of States that's that again is is uh discrete for for the system in the box that we saw and you can't have entanglement without having superposition because entanglement is just a many body version of superposition uncertainty you can kind of have either way that one doesn't really matter so on the top here I have sort of the four big paradigms of quantum Technologies they're sort of organized into three actually so one is sensing or Metrology or Imaging and everything is quantum so we prefix Quantum to everything the other one is cryptography or communication and the third one is Computing the fourth one here is appended as simulation and I'll get into that a little bit more but I guess I want to emphasize here that historically the primary Quantum effect that has been utilized in Technologies has been the first one the bottom one discreteness and super and in some sense superposition and uh the later effects the so the later Technologies are the ones that utilize these other effects because these other effects are much difficult to distill and to uh utilize in Quantum systems because Quantum systems are so fragile so if we go back in time a little bit the first technology that that utilized uh this discreteness of energy levels or that requires discreetness to describe um is NMR nuclear magnetic resonance so this was one of the earliest uses of quantum technology is another one is the laser resistance standard atomic clock principle of uncertainty helped us detect gravitational waves and nowadays if we go to sort of more state-of-the-art we have something called Quantum Imaging where there's several different technologies that are utilized to enhance the your current known Imaging standards like pet NMR as well as create new ones using some of these Quantum systems that are more relevant to the Computing side and collectively you can call this Quantum Imaging or Quantum Metrology and there's very many different proposals here that are still actively studied up to date so that's basically Metrology I want to emphasize that it's the most sort of longest studied Paradigm here for the application of these effects the next one is uh cryptography or communication uh if we go back now uh and remember our principle of collapse we can imagine that we could design a protocol for communication that would be sensitive to eavesdroppers namely if we could somehow utilize quantum mechanics in a way that an eavesdropper could be detected using this principle of collapse maybe we have a way to protect ourselves from eavesdroppers and such a protocol does exist uh it's the the the Pres this this requires basically all four different Technologies and hence it was not realized until a little bit later the use of quantum mechanics here is during these What's called the key generation stage of this protocol so in order for us to communicate securely we need to generate a key to generate this key we need to make sure the eavesdropper doesn't know it and we can utilize quantum mechanics to utilize entanglement and uncertainty to in superposition to generate a key such that both you know you and the communicating party know the key but any eavesdropper that comes in and tries to intercept the key as you're generating it will get caught because of the collapse principles of quantum mechanics now I can't the reason I have to use this scheme is that if I just send you the key on an on the initial communication line that's assumed unencrypted the eavesdropper will just know the E because the initial line is unencrypted so we have to encrypt it but to encrypt it we have to generate a key in a way that thieves dropper doesn't gain access to it and using quantum mechanics we can do so in a way that if a needs dropper tries to access it we will know and we can stop hey there's many different commercial devices that do this and the state-of-the-art key distribution has been done in order hundreds or thousands of kilometers in both Optical fibers and in free space communication so that's hence this line here we mentioned several different uh Technologies here they're basically utilizing small Quantum systems one two atoms um not very many but I told you that entanglement here is a property that is present not just for two particles but you can write States like this with two commas for three particles four particles Etc and you can have something called many body entanglement and the more particles you include the harder it is to control but the more particles you include the more different possibilities of States you can have now let's say each article each subsystem has two states and this means when you add a subsystem you double the number of states because each one can be in two states so here this one is in two states this one is in two states two times two is four you have a nice video about this by somebody from Righetti describing these states in terms of bits so you have to think of that number of doublings each time and showing that the number of possible bits doubles every time you add another coordinate to the bit string same is true for generic Quantum systems generic Quantum mini body system and utilizing many body entanglement is harder to do it's not something that these technologies have really utilized they have utilized entanglement but they've utilized entanglement between maybe two three only a few bodies utilizing really many body entanglement is something that only the most recent Quantum technologies have really been able to do and some of these of course these are the ones that are involved in Quantum Computing and Quantum simulation Quantum Computing you can probably already Imagine by the words is that it's a way to to do some sort of computation to get a result using a Quantum device using these four principles that I covered Quantum simulation is something that's very similar but it requires less uh fine-tuned Precision uh the the purpose of a Quantum simulator is is to design a mini body Quantum system that can emulate or simulate another Quantum system that you're interested in studying but that is not readily available in nature it's not quite a computer it doesn't need to be a computer because it's not doing some particular calculation it's not doing some algorithm uh that that's that's spitting out necessarily some precise number it's just trying to simulate another system that we're interested in studying so for many body Quantum systems what are the ingredients that we usually use well I mean we just use the ingredients that are available to us and these are nothing but atoms ions which are just charged atoms photons or electrons really all we have and so we stack these up in some way that we can do what we can control them in some way we that we can control them and uh the process of stacking a bunch of these up and maintaining the level of control that you need to utilize the four different uh features of quantum mechanics that I mentioned is called scaling up it's very hard these systems are fragile if you make them super big they're going to collapse to a classical State like we humans do right I'm not in a Quantum superposition as far as I know right uh where are we now with this uh it's called n the number of systems here and we have been able to scale up to roughly hundreds of atoms we have about 50 ions we can do hundreds of photons and through something called superconducting circuits we can use Electronics to construct Quantum systems that have roughly hundreds of electronic based qubits now these do utilize electrons but the jargon that you may want to know about is superconducting circuits the reason I highlight this is because this is sort of the most dominant technologies that companies are currently using uh like IBM and Google and these Quantum systems are just super cooled you know circuits with an inductor and a capacitor and another thing another sort of inductor that acts in a in a in a non-linear way relative to sort of the the way an inductor is supposed to act just some beefed up inductor and these things are cooled these things are on a chip these things are cooled these things are small and so they're Quantum and you can have hundreds of these on a chip we're very good at making chips and this technology is what has been used to achieve something with the Quant with one of these Quantum devices that at least shows that they are indeed quantum which is called Quantum Supremacy I remember from a previous video that qubit is a Quantum bit um so would you've mentioned atoms ions photons electrons and the dominant being electrons would one say electron be one qubit is that how it works no it's unfortunately a lot trickier than that really the word electrons is not really used to describe these things um it's a whole another lecture but uh so I just think when you say oh we can say do a hundreds of atoms or we could do 50 ions I'm just wondering does that mean hundreds of qubits or 50 do you see what I mean yes this this little n here is the number of qubits that are based off of these of these Technologies okay I see technology right and in the first well in the first two cases we do mean 100 there is really one qubit per atom okay uh in in one qubit per ion um because we store things in sort of the low-lying states of these atoms or ions in the case of photons also roughly you can say that a photon stores a qubit in the case of electrons you're really storing information in pairs of electrons because electrons themselves are pretty uh you know they're they behave very differently than than when they do when they pair up and uh you basically buy electrons here I really mean Electronics Quantum super cool circuits uh like you know inductors capacitors that we have in electronics class but they're cold and small and they utilize another um another non-linear circuit element called the Josephus injunction that we don't utilize in our electrical plugs so so with the with Quantum Electronics what has allowed us to achieve uh Quantum advantage or Quantum as it was originally called Quantum Supremacy which is just roughly the ability of a Quantum system to do something faster than a classical one now I'm not saying it's doing anything useful but it is doing something and what does that do if we can show it well we then we know the system is at least using some Quantum features right because otherwise it would be classical and then we can we can simulate it classically on a classical computer just as fast as this Quantum device was doing so what is the task well again roughly if we go back to these effects then this effective collapse allows us to basically become statisticians so we can induce a Collapse by looking at the system from various different directions and every time we do this we get some outcomes with some probabilities so we got a snapshot of the system when we look at it and we get a bunch of outcomes um for each of our subsystems so here we only have one but you know you can imagine having 150 and you get 150 different outcomes so that's that when we do a collapse like this we get a sample of outcomes we run this this whole process again we get another sample so we can collect statistical data about our system by looking at it from in various ways and getting outcomes out and the types of outcomes the distribution the statistics of these outcomes uh can be used to discern if the system is really Quantum or if it's just some random person in inside the quantum computer flipping coins so I've showed you four basic features of quantum mechanics that have been harnessed to make many different Technologies uh that some of which we use today and some of which we hope to use in the future and listed the technologies that people have been using so classical physics hasn't been standing still throughout that time there in fact classical computer scientists and classical cryptographers have observed the development of these Quantum Technologies and have developed in response new classical stuff so for example here in Quantum key distribution it's a way it allows us to communicate securely and there is another algorithm called Shores algorithm that quantum computers are most famous for that allows us to break another protocol that allows us to communicate classically that you use to log into your bank called RSA and in response there's been a new wave of cryptographic protocols that beat RSA in the sense that they are supposed to be or postulated to be resilient to Quantum attacks so this is called post Quantum crypto and these are classical protocols that people attempt to show are impossible or very difficult to hack using a quantum computer and nist is uh sort of leading the the standardization of these protocols in the same way that they were leading the standardization of the rsa-based classical protocols that we currently use on the Computing side um there's often the quantum algorithms often use different uh ways to perturb the system that that basically translate to different Quantum data structures so to say but some of these data structures and some of these processes can actually be peeled off from the quantum system and distilled into a classical system and that has led to the establishment of quantum inspired algorithms that classical computer scientists have developed some of which wind up beating the initial uh algorithm that was designed to run on a quantum computer the beauty of this large swath of quantum Technologies is that they allow us to learn new things about that we can do with classical systems and so there's this ever present sort of push and pull and competition between equanimous and the people who are able to do classical Computing and uh classical algorithm design um such that we we help each other become better at doing certain tasks now sometimes uh it's you know you you you may become better at doing a specific task with some specific number of qubits but you may not be able to be to overcome this exponential wall uh that you get with with some classical algorithms that you can overcome only with a Quantum algorithm but in other cases people have shown that you can indeed overcome the exponential wall uh using a classical algorithm only so it's a very nice and fun time to be in the field because uh we're not really uh certain of what kind of power quantum computers can be harnessed for and uh there's still room for uh potentially harnessing them for a lot more quantized or discrete energies the word Quantum even comes from this one simple system that we can demonstrate this with is called a particle in a box we can also think about trying to limit the probability of success or failure or the probability of certain extremes I think we can talk about that later
