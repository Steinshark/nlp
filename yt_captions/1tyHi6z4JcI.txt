unpacking Google's new dangerous web environment Integrity specification now we did go over this a little bit earlier uh it's really hard to talk about this topic without getting too political so we're gonna do our best here to thread the needle here why Vivaldi browser thinks Google's new proposal the web environment Integrity Way spec is short uh is is a major threat to the open web it should be pushed back okay well let's help it push it back Let's do let's do some pushing back Google seems to love creating specifications that are terrible for the open web and it feels like they find a way to create a new one every few months this time we have come across some controversy caused by the new web environment Integrity spec that Google seems to be working on at this time I could not find any official message from Google about the spec so it is possible that is just the work of some misguided engineer at the company that has no backing from higher up but it seems to be but it seems to be work that has gone on for more than a year and the resulting spec is so toxic to the open web that at this point Google needs to at least get give some explanation as how it could go so far that is a seething review for those that don't know hopefully uh oh good okay it's gonna go over it I'd love to hear what they have to say Okay uh the second question which is described right here which by the way uh I'm gonna go over one quick little part of this one one really small one which is this right here is that uh they want you they want to be able to verify users or users and their first line kind of gives away the game right away which is users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain but they often want or need to do it without directly paying so if you want to know what Google's kind of up to this is a very good first statement and then the second statement which is actually even more scary is this one right here which is users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that limit imitates software like their banking apps to steal those uh to steal from those users the bank's internet interface could protect users if it could establish that the request it's getting actually come from the banks or trustworthy software meaning that Google wants to exist somewhere in the middle of you and the internet right that's truly what it is saying more than just the browser but even deeper on a request level right so just so you know there we go welcome to Costco I forgot to turn off uh alerts hold on we'll we'll get to you I just forgot to turn off alert let's finish this and I'll say thank you yep men in the middle attack is now a feature all right it's called the web environment Integrity the idea of it is simple let's see is as simple as it is dangerous it would provide websites with an API telling them whether the browser and the platform it is running on that is currently in use is trusted by an authoritative third party called an attester the details are nebulous about the goal seems to be uh to prevent fake interactions with websites of all kinds while this seems like a noble motivation we can all agree this seems good and the use cases listed seem very reasonable the solution proposed is absolutely terrible and has been equated with DRM for for websites with all that it implies it is also interesting to note that the first use case listed is about ensuring that interactions with ads are genuine we let we looked at it while this is not problematic on the surface it certainly hints at the idea that Google is willing to use any means of bolstering its advertising platform regardless of the potential harm to its users yes is the answer despite the next uh despite the text mentioning the incredible risk of excluding vendors read the other browsers it only makes a lukewarm attempt at addressing the issue and ends up without any real uh solution so what's the issue simply if an entity has the power of deciding which browsers are trusted and which are not there is no guarantee that they will trust any given browser any new browser would by default not be trusted until they have somewhat demonstrated that they are trustworthy to the discretion of the attesters in other words who gets the own the browser eyeballs Google does Google gets to be the you know I'm sure there will be a foundation you know there's some you know because we can all agree that foundations never are linked to any really terrible Behavior or any things that are pushed back by uh by corporations yeah it's it's certified it's it's yucky right anyone else also anyone stuck running on a legacy software where their spec is not supported would eventually be excluded from the web to make matters worse the primary example given of the attester is Google Play on Android this means Google decides which browser is trustworthy on its own platform I do not see how they can be expected to be impartial yeah how could Google be impartial on Windows they would probably defer to Microsoft via the Windows store and on Mac they would defer to Apple so we can expect at least that at least Edge and Safari are going to be trusted any other browser will be left uh to the good graces of those companies I wonder if those companies then have to agree to something like there's going to be some uni company right the Ultimate Software Gateway company right that has to exist at the top of all this the ultimate Gateway Foundation right of course you can Note One glaring Omission in the previous paragraph what of Linux well that is a big question will Linux be completely excluded from browsing the web or the Kanata or or will canonical become the decider by virtue of controlling the snaps package repository but who knows it's not looking good for Linux this alone would be bad enough but it gets worse the spec hints heavily that one aim is to ensure that real people are interacting with the websites it does not clarify in any way how it aims to do that so we are left with some big questions about how it will achieve this will behavioral data be used to see if the user behaves like a huge in a human-like fashion that's actually that I actually never even thought about that that's actually kind of scary you know that's kind of scary I I don't know about this I you know I never really thought about the attestations in that kind of sense right um will it be uh let's see this will this data be presented to the testers will accessibility tools that rely on automating inputs to the browser uh cause cause it to become untrusted will it affect extensions the spec does currently specify a carve out for browser modifications and extensions but those can make automating interactions with a website trivial so either the spec is useless or restrictions will eventually be applied there too it would otherwise be trivial for an attacker to bypass the whole thing yep can we just refuse to implement it unfortunately it's not that simple this time any browser choosing not to implement this would not be a trust would not be trusted in any website choosing to use this API could therefore reject users from those browsers Google also has ways to drive adoptions uh by websites themselves first they can easily make all their properties depend on using these features and not being able to use Google websites is a death sentence for most browsers already furthermore they could try to mandate that sites that use Google ads use this API as well which makes sense since the first goal is to prevent fake ad clicks that would quickly ensure that any browser not supporting the API would be doomed yep there is hope uh there is an overwhelming likelihood that EU law will not allow a few companies to have a huge amount of power in deciding which browsers are allowed and which are not there is uh no doubt that a testers would be under a huge amount of pressure to be fair as possible unfortunately legislation and judicial judicial machineries tends to be slow and there's no saying how much damage will be done while governments and judges are examining this if this is allowed to move forward it will be a hard time for the open web and might affect smaller vendors significantly it has been long known that Google's dominance on the web browser Market gives them a potential of becoming an extental threat to the web with every bad idea they have brought to the table like Flock topic and client hints they've come closer to realizing that potential though it is kind of terrifying that so few companies truly own the access to the web you know what I mean the problem is you know in America we have like the whole like uh what's called Monopoly effect but I guess in some sense maybe you could call this like some sort of corporate version of racketeering right you can't you can't like landlords can't agree to all race prices it's racketeering so in some sense by having three companies control access to the internet one could argue maybe it's racketeering maybe there is laws and which are currently in place obviously this is like a not a uh like right there's a whole new world right how do you you could never make a law that could have foresaw this from happening maybe uh but it's curious uh web environment Integrity is more of the same but also A Step Above the Rest in the threat it represents especially since it can be used to encourage Microsoft and Apple to cooperate with Google to restrict competition both in browser space and the operating system space exactly this is like truly like it's it's racketeering really it is imperative that they uh be called out on this and prevented from moving forward while our vigilance allows us to notice and push back against all these attempts to undermine the web the only long-term solution is to get Google to be on an even playing field legislation helps us there but it all uh but so see but so does reducing their market share similarly our voice grows in strength for every Valdez Vivaldi user allowing us to become more effective in these discussions we hope that users of the web realize this and choose their browsers consequently uh consequently uh the fight for the web to remain open is going to be a long one and there is much at stake I mean obviously they have a uh they they obviously have a dog in the fight right they clearly don't want to be just shut out right and they run the risk of being able to be shut out right that's kind of it is in itself pretty terrifying I think the advice is really good which is you gotta quit giving Google views you know what I mean your girlfriend uses velvetalde and won't uh won't let me hear the end of it really I didn't did you do you have like some chat AI program on your arch install like how does that work can she pause your music and your YouTube ads because you're using valdaldi the the Vivaldi I know see the problem is is just stop using Google right like how do you even do that got him um I think someone that's uh one thing that really was interesting is when uh when third-party sites start using this such as imagine cloudflare how many companies use cloudflare as like an in-between to prevent ddosing and stuff like that right you could imagine a world where it's not just Google doing it but once Google sets it in motion and then cloudflare requires it the whole internet becomes shut down yeah you know I don't like this I don't know the problem is I don't know how how do you how do you how do you change this honestly how do you change this I use Firefox I how do you change this how do you cause a real change in the market I feel personally I just feel like powerless in this situation other than I can say what's happening and maybe you guys can can tweet about it Adam you can right like what do you do I don't know the name is the primogene
