in 2018 a high school math teacher in the
USA who goes by the online handle Robert loves pi math teacher confirmed discovered a family
of eight shapes which are built using solely Kites and rhombuses and when they came out
they kind of languished on this obscure website I was like that's a real shame these are amazing
shapes in fact this one is my favourite it should not be hidden away it should be viewed
by let's say 25 000 people that would be appropriate which is why we have built a few of them and
put them up here at the Big Feastival [Music] thank you [Music] the plan was to build two
giant versions of their shape to install outside the Cheese Hub each of those made from 150
pieces of laser cut mirror finish acrylic and then inside the cheese Hub we were going
to make four smaller ones that were small enough to put actually up above the Dance
Floor itself we were going to build one of these in the lead up to the actual Festival
as a trial run and the remaining three would be built during the festival itself but the
question we kept getting asked was what on Earth is this shape actually named this shape
is so new it hasn't even got a catchy name I mean it's got the boring name because it's
got 150 faces so that makes it a Hectapentacontahedron 150 faces technically it's a Kite-Rhombus
Hectapentacontahedron because it's got Kites and rhombuses as the faces but it's a shame
there's no real good name we I guess you could describe it based on how it's built so this
shape is actually based on a dodecahedron and a decahedron is one of the platonic solids
there are five of them only five if you take a dodecahedron and you explode it so you move
all the faces out you can fill the gaps with equilateral triangles and squares those are
both regular polygons so this is kind like a protonic solid in that all the faces are
regular but it's not because they're different we call that an Archimedean solid and there
are 13 more of those and we can get another one just by twisting the pentagons because
those squares turn into rhombuses which we can then split into two equilateral triangles
and this is the snub dodecahedron one of the 13 Archimedean solids and this well it's kind
of a snub dodecahedron but combined with its dual shape so to get the dual of a shape you
link together the centers of all the faces into vertices of some second shape and the
dual of the decahedron is an ecosahedron the juvenile calcahedron is it a decahedron the
dual of the snub dodecahedron is a pentagonal hexacontehedron which just means it's a 60
face shape where each face is a pentagon but not a regular one weird kind of pointy ones
my favorite Pentagon if I may and because these are duals you can put one inside the
other and actually you enlarge the middle one so that they have edges that intersect
and this is now a compound shape of the snapdecahedron and its dual that is the convex Hull of that
shape which means if you join together all the pointing out vertices all the ones that
stick out the most and you make a new shape out of that it's the smallest possible shape
that's convex and can contain the previous compound shape so I guess the other name for
that is it's the convex Hull of the compound shape formed by the snubdodachahedron and
its dual the pentagonal hexacontehedron that's just a lot less catchy so why have I built
two of the shape that's called that thing and brought them here to the big Festival
well the reason I'm here specifically is the big Festival is the brainchild of Alex James
who is the bass guitarist of the band blur some of you may remember if you're old yeah
within 24 hours of saying that I found that blue we're reforming to go on tour and release
a new album links below and bear with me here Alex James as well as being a bass player
also became a farmer makes cheese this is Alex James Farm hosts the Big Festival that
is his cheese Hub where he sells cheese and has DJs it's a lot of fun and it turns out
he's a big fan of maths videos on YouTube who knew so we got in touch I said look we
should do a mass building thing and because there are DJs in there I thought I'd make
a geometric mirror ball to go with the dance floor and I was thinking well I need a shape
that anyone can enjoy you can look at it it looks like fun but also it's quite mathematical
and then it dawned on me if I pick this specific one of the eight different kite rhombi shapes
it's got chirality which means as a left-handed and a right-handed one when you snub that
dodecahedron you've got a choice which way you twist the pentagons and because it's got
a mirror image that's different we can build both of them and you may not have noticed
but they are rotating in opposite directions this is a set of mirrored mirror balls they're
each other's mirror image and they're made of mirrors I am way too pleased with this
but I am I'm beside myself me and my mirror image I'm very pleased with this but you think
how do you cable tie together 150 pieces of laser cut mirrored acrylic per ball well thankfully
that happened in the past it's a week and a half ago behind me they're still building
the site the main stage has been going up today very exciting and you know it's the
past because you can see on top of that poll there are no mirror balls that's yet to come
and the cheese Hub is still all boarded up but inside the balls are being built welcome
to the Bowl lab they're under construction but it means you can still see inside them
so right in the very center is a dodecahedron that's where all the supports are mounted
and then there's one support for each of where the five kites meet at a vertex and then to
stop these from moving around as well as being locked in the decahedron in the center they're
strapped together but these straps have formed an icosahedron and the reason that's happened
is because the dodecahedron the acostahedron are dual shapes so when these come out of
the face there's an informal vertex you get the alcosahedron so not only is the notion
of a dual shape used conceptually to design the ball in theory totally unrelated practically
we needed dual shapes to make the physical structure it's Mass all the way down we're
doing the test install of the Mini Ball just to see how it all lines up get in the right
spot Tony here's just sorting out how we're going to attach it to and cut the chain the
issue is once you've built it you can't put it down so my job it's got to hold it I think
I'm doing a good job I got a I got a lot of balls to keep in the air [Music] the balls
are finished all we have to do now is get them up to the top of this Tower in this cherry
picker right here and I'm going to go up and help which is to say I'm allowed to clip on
and tag along [Music] [Music] let me get to remember why we actually did
this why did we do this well this is the whole Joy of organizing a big Crazy Event like you
can do stupid stuff that you just wouldn't do anywhere else oh man what a moment this
is uh this may be my proudest achievement it was the festival itself the small being
made during the event and as they were finished we installed them one at a time above the
dent foreign good morning and welcome to the pre-dj
cheese Hub we're in here doing some building and you can see the fruits the balls of our
labor hanging up here so we've got the two small ones on this side of the Dance Floor
uh dick and Dom were DJing last night with these spinning up there but very sadly look
at the empty void the space where there should be two more of these I believe uh Simon Peg
has been doing a DJ set tonight so we have to get those up in time which is why we have
the whole team on hand building away we've got all our favorites we've got Matt scrogs
over here we've got Paul Taylor they're not allowed to stop working while I say this okay
these tackles over there wrangling the tape excellent and Lisa Matha is uh here dealing
with the cable type so yeah so we're here we're both building these and we've got some
origami activities for any families that come along and they want to make something that
hasn't got sharp edges there you are but given it still quite early in the morning there's
not that many people here this will get busier and busier and then when the DJs kick in hopefully
we'll have the last two balls up there [Music] today yeah and we are done we've got two giant pair
of balls out the front we've got four medium mirror balls out the back and with some waving
people behind me ah filming at a festival so now all we have to do is wait for the sun
to go down because Alex James got the person who normally does the lighting design but
the blur live shows to point some lights at this so once it gets dark they should look
even more spectacular [Music] hey thanks so much for watching my... oh... thanks so much for watching my video about
the mirrored mirror ball thanks to Alex James and the whole team for
helping out thanks to all the build volunteers [Music]
