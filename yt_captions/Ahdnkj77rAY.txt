it is a scanner from micro range scanning of rock art which has deliberately been built for that purpose what you see here on the floor is a small portion of a 3D print of ancient rock art packed into large Rock panels in wam Monica in Italy this has been reconstructed in 3D printed and is now just used as a demonstrator object what we would do out in the wild is put the scanner on top of the art to be scanned press the button what you see is a Flash and what you maybe hear I can do it another time later when the green light is on again you can now here two different pictures being taken in succession first one with flash second one without flash and also you see it's two SLR cameras here what we are taking is a pair of images with flash and another pair without Flash looking at the specifics of The Flash this is Custom Design 220 high-intensity white LEDs cast a very homogeneous field of Illumination down on the ground pictured by this stereo setup of the two cameras we take a stereo pair with illumination another one without illumination and by subtracting these frames from each other we can virtually show throughout the influence of daylight so we can even eliminate cast Shadows which would be cast by direct sunlight and that ends us up with radiometrically corrected images which just show the radiometric surface properties under artificial illumination so radiometric that means color does it radiometric means color but in addition what we also model is by reconstructing the 3D surface we have direct of Illumination calibrated for each of these 220 LEDs we have uh few angle of the camera and we have surface normal of the particular surface element so we can really model the interplay between uh incident light surface normal of a small surface patch and uh feu Direction in the end we reconstruct a dense 3D Point Cloud where each point carries radiometric information color information about each element in this point Cloud on the rock surface so for people who've never heard of a point Cloud before are points a bit like pixels it is coordinates actually uh it's not uh not the same as pixels in an image because even if it is very very dense there is a lot of space around the individual point so it is 3D coordinates a file full of 3D coordinates you could say and each of these points uh carrying additional information in this case RGB if you try to visualize that you would see a lot of dots and either if you splatter them if you make say a spherical approximation of this uh infinitesimal small points yeah you would end up infu it you would perceive it as a surface but actually it is points it's a bit like a computer version of atoms yeah it could be so here there is custom electronic including a raspberry pie on the pi it runs Linux and it just controls uh the cameras actually it it then fetches the jpex and Via Wireless transfer it transfers it to a tablet PC which normally is taken by the archaeologists with him laying on the Rock just beside the scanner and on this tablet PC online uh we get a rough 3D Reconstruction from jpex at the same same time we store raw images in the cameras on the storage cards and going home we take the raw images for doing this fine radiometric evaluation using structure from Motion Plus stereo we get correctly scaled Point clouds which means it is a point Cloud where distances can be measured distances between different points however this point CL it could be anywhere in the world uh if we would like to relate what we scan to what has been scanned before side by side maybe we need common coordinate system that's the other trick with this scanner here what you see there is a micro prism so this prism is very precisely measured by a total station as a various instrument it could be vied as a theodoly where you also measure the distance from the measurement device to this prison not just angles originally when we develop the thing with started and asked for measurements every time the button is the button is pressed right but uh in the end it turns out if you for instance need say 100 scanning positions to scan a reasonable area of rock it would be enough to do a few of these prism measurements just at nicely balanced locations uh to finally be able to translate and rotate this 3D model in a way that it perfectly fits with Geor reference coordinates of whatever has been scanned pictured uh reconstructed by the archaeologists otherwise it is Altitude as well it is the 3D position in geographical coordinates of this particular prism this is the one 3dp rock art scanner prototype most of the time it it proved to work quite well uh when something went wrong it mostly concerned communication via the wireless to the tablet people see if it's too far away we have done we we added some aluminum shielding here uh this also blocks the wireless communication in some cases but that are minor issues actually the other thing is this device will measure only perfect if uh It is Well calibrated so it had to be shipped back to our department in grads for fine recalibration we also designed some targets so that it could be calibrated in the wild in the archaeological campaign but best calibration was of course obtained at home in our in our measurement lab it's a nice thing it has worked very well and robustly over one and a half years almost uh but it's Unique so that's a drawback of course uh we have already submitted a proposal to the EU for a follow-up project where this should be turned into a product Zone then this product would be available as a commercial product for archaeologist all over the world and probably it can be used for many other questions of 3D reconstruction of surface shape including surface radiometry it is color maybe even extended to Invisible wavelengths ultraviolet infrared the final one it should become a product it should be well under 5,000 uh EUR this one was a little more expensive because it had to be uh assembled from many components and there was also some trial and error facing from one to the other place and to other places and use this information
