ladies and gentlemen we all enjoy chesbots we like to play against them whether it's Martin the dumbest bot on shells.com or stockfish the strongest bottom chess.com or whether it's getting your game analyzed after it's finished by the chess.com game review which tells you that you're brilliant or which tells you that you're stupid some of us use chess Bots to cheat during live games don't do that you'll get banned in any case chess Bots have been better than humans for nearly 30 years at this point in 2023 but we don't really care in fact we keep innovating about a month ago I made a video about torch a brand new chess bot that was made by several team members and is being championed by charles.com and torch destroyed everybody except stockfish but in today's video I'm going to show you a game where torch completely obliterated stockfish recently in the last couple of weeks here in August of 2023 and I'm also going to show you a couple of games where torch absolutely obliterated Leela which is basically the second or third strongest computer in the world so sit back relax and uh enjoy these four ridiculous bot chess games this is like watching the two biggest gorillas in a zoo exhibit just have a slugfest and we sit back and relax because we we don't we don't we don't we don't understand what's going on um and uh yeah enjoy stockfish uh had the black pieces and opened up with a Sicilian Defense now normally when Bots play against each other uh you know if you just paired them to play the best moves uh Bots would always play E4 E5 so the way you determine who is the strongest engine is you make them play the same opening against each other right so like the next time that these two play torch will have black so let's see how torch handles this Sicilian Defense it plays Knight to F3 with the intention of playing Pawn to D4 uh and that is exactly what happens and black AKA stockfish does not play at Tai Mana but instead plays what's called a Khan a Paulson con this is a light squared Sicilian opening uh and then you try to fight on the dark squares with your bishop and your queen white plays C4 which is one of the ways to play the other way is to put the knight in front of the C pawn and then develop your Bishops sometimes you Castle Queen side sometimes Castle short beautiful thing about Chess is you have choices C4 though fighting back on the light squares taking a little bit of space black plays Knight F6 white plays Knight C3 and black plays Queen C7 which fights on the dark squares puts pressure on the pawn that you put on C4 life is good nothing complicated just yet uh and now white plays this move A3 this is a good move because it prevents Bishop to B4 and if you don't prevent Bishop to B4 and instead you play like Bishop E2 uh black is gonna go here and by that point it's too late because after take take you're just losing the pawn in the center so A3 black develops the Knight white develops the bishop and white just wants to do this right but stockfish gets provocative stockfish attacks the pawn on C4 and basically makes white defend it except white doesn't what I don't so this actually no actually no that is not the idea in fact that's actually very dangerous for black because even though you want a pawn after Rook C1 your queen is a massive Target and actually can't move anywhere your queen can't go this way or this way or that way or that way the only way your queen can go is straight back and then I go here double attack on your queen and then I put my knight exactly where that Queen is and then I fork you so instead of that black does this but black lost a little bit of time doing this and torch basically says look I'm gonna put my pawns forward stockfish I'm threatening E5 I'm threatening F5 what are you going to do Rook C1 castles this is the position okay two biggest gorillas fighting in a zoo exhibit right torch stockfish best computer of all time the modern day stockfish versus the new computer on the Block uh the young fighter you know the hungry fighter uh who do still kind of go and paycheck to paycheck what are we gonna get here torch plays B4 utilizing all of its forces to come forward Pawn to B4 trying to create something on the queen side and if you don't create anything on the queen side at least you're taking space you'll notice that White's pawns fight on every one of these squares because when I when I say fighting it's not about pushing it's about capturing so you look at what squares these pawns can capture and they can capture across the entire Rank and that that nobody cares about that square but White's got good backup there too and I mean white could also play G4 by the way so Bishop D7 now a very important move King to H1 it's always a nice move if you want to create a same side attack your king is just safe and it's off of this diagonal black plays B6 it's very clear that that you know the way stockfish is playing the stockfish is like this like come on like do your worst come on elbows tucked protecting here you don't want your hands out here because if the punch comes in it's going to Ricochet off your head that's what I learned in boxing class B5 okay so we're trying to attack over there clearly take take White's position looks really good but I mean so far it's just a tense fight I mean it's an overall pretty equal position and uh you know uh in this position Stafford said okay great I don't know why you put the bishop there that was a stupid move stupid move I don't know why you did that I'm just gonna get your Bishop now you gotta Retreat I'm gonna take the pawn except in this position the entire purpose of the move Bishop to F3 is revealed although it doesn't make any sense at first it doesn't make any sense at first because you're a dumb human like I don't know if you're actually dumb but compared to these things you you're remember watching the gorillas fight at the zoo exhibit so there is no point playing the movie E5 now because Knight takes F3 so white plays E5 allowing Knight takes F3 what okay well it's just a fair trade right this is the idea no look what happens to the eval it's back to equal wait a minute so what's the idea is it Rook F3 and over here no because now black is winning what so what is the idea oh it's it's probably to take the Knight that makes a lot of sense not a bad move no the idea is okay we got a bishop taken and our response to that was not to take the night or the night but to go here the point we're threatening to take this bishop and the Knight is still hanging and this Knight is still hanging and black can't really stop anything you know all of that okay so black takes the night well that makes a lot of sense now we're gonna go here and then we're gonna take one of these back no we're gonna take the Knight now what well now the bishop is hanging and the bishop is hanging and the Knight is hanging but why would you allow this to be preserved because now oh because when the night moves now you're gonna take that Bishop so there's no more threat there well that makes a lot of sense doesn't it now Rook takes C6 F take C7 and now black moves the oh The Rook is hanging but this is mate if you take this and make a queen then after this black is threatening the queen and mate the only way to stop that is to go here but then I take the bishop and now it's just a complicated game where black just kind of pressures for a long time and I guess instead of doing all that black plays Rook C3 Queen B2 and my friends the sense of humor on Bots it promotes to a night and now torch has to win this end game and what's funny is torch evaluated the send game as completely winning for white stockfish didn't actually stockfish look even browser stockfish does not think it's that much better for white because black has six pawns white has four so it's a knight and two pawns for a rook which is five five but white is doing much much better here because white has really good long-term opportunities to attack on this side of the board by the way you will notice that the move Rook A1 just got played that may confuse you why is the computer sacrificing The Rook just Rook to A1 with the Rook hanging right here Rook CA check the king is hunted out and now Rook C7 and just King H2 and the king is safe from checks you're gonna try to win these pawns you're gonna try to put pressure Queens come off the board but the Rooks are just better than the rook in the night and watch as stockfish's eval just starts growing stockfish starts realizing in slow motion oh I'm in trouble oh I'm in trouble Rook F6 look at this brutal hunt now on the pawns one Pawn has fallen stockfish doing its best to defend itself H4 prying the defenses apart King g194 and unfortunately the Rooks have been forcefully traded off the board and it is a completely lost end game it's completely lost because Black's King is completely stuck on the back rank King H5 look at that look at this jump for a while it was like oh it's equal and now it's like oh no I'm definitely losing and now rookie six and in all of these moments you're gonna take the pawn rookie oh this is such a nice move if takes Pawn takes and uh you promote and torch cleanly converts a king and Rook vs King end game stockfish not resigning Rook D6 Rook A6 and absolute obliteration punctuated by this crazy sequence in the middle game where torch opened the attack and then just went Knight C6 and the Absurd configuration of the black position where three pieces are hanging at the same time take take the Knight comes out you take the bishop and now here Rook C3 counter attack mate and the promotion to a knight is just I mean it's hilarious stuff um torch has been on fire as of late giving up all of its pieces in all of these games here's a game that I played against the dutchbot I don't Dutch folks y'all name things in a way that is very difficult to pronounce for a dumb American like myself so I'm just gonna say roughshade that's how an American would pronounce it D4 uh we have what's called a benoni kind of like a uh like a like a like an Indian defense like the Indian game black plays E6 and then plays B5 now now this is actually called the Blumenfeld it's called the Blumenfeld counter Gambit and in a nutshell the idea is to go here and take a pawn so why does but black gets a big Center I've played this on both sides and I don't understand it with either color which is sort of how you play chess um so you know I I I can't really vouch for this either way but in this game torch plays Bishop G5 which is considered the main move now you may ask yourself isn't this a free pawn and I would basically answer that by saying yes but then white gets a really big Center Knight C3 white wins this Pawn back so it's not exactly a free Pawn B4 Knight A6 and the reason why this opening is not good for computer chess computers really are good at dominating positions where they have a space advantage and they're really good at dominating positions where pieces are offside like you know not like uh football offside but uh you know on the on the edge of the board not like behind the enemy pieces this Knight just can't really get back into the game so easily humans don't really capitalize these advantages that well but uh but computers are and this game is just so brutal and the next two games are just absolutely ridiculous uh D takes F takes you know white just developing normally and and like a normal human being here just castles and you know black plays Bishop E7 and we just play a normal game of chess as you can see from the evaluation yeah these things are not normal though uh the big gorilla just beat the other big gorilla so now it's gonna go fight a medium-sized gorilla and in this position uh torch plays H4 for no reason I mean really there is like absolutely no reason to play this move and by the way this is stockfish this eval bar so we have torchada and we have stockfish on the sidelines going um I have taught you very well H4 Bishop B7 and now we see the purpose of the move Pawn to H4 Bishop takes F6 you say okay oh I get it oh white wants to go Knight G5 ah that makes a lot of sense after Bishop takes G5 H takes G5 now we have a big attack if Pawn to G6 I got news for you that doesn't stop anything Rook H7 look at this queen H5 check you can't take it's force made oh I get it well the idea is to put the Knight on G5 but what if black goes here ah yeah that kind of stops everything doesn't it yeah that's a problem um well you see how this thing just spiked stockfish sees what torch sees in this position so he can't go Knight G5 at first glance in this position the computer goes okay well you know I got G4 and Rook G1 and that's you know I got that's my idea can't go Knight G5 anymore frankly can't really move the Knight anymore but backwards and that's not what we want so in this position torch plays a move that the black computer did not even see when this move came on the board the black computer went God damn it I what is this dude cheating it's funny funny joke in this position torch played the move Knight to D4 which just looks like you're 500 I mean it just looks like you hung a knight now what is the idea of this the idea of losing the Knight obviously is to open the queen right well that's easy Queen G4 check no um Queen H5 no F5 is called interpose I just get in the way of your attack I just block your vision what then what is the idea Knight T4 I don't understand CD4 the idea is that you suck you suck I don't get it what king H7 so what queen H5 King G sub how do I oh oh now we see why now we see why the move H4 was so powerful because it wasn't just about advancing or anchoring the Knight it was a rook lift which is why it waited to Castle Rook G3 is mate the only way to stop this is to maybe hide your king Rook G3 king f8 queen H6 King F7 Queen H7 Rook G8 and then I win your queen oh my God Knight D4 and at this point goes all right you know what I'm not gonna get mated I'm gonna have to just lose a pawn and probably my Rook Knight to D4 Knight to D4 is the and the idea of which is to give up a second piece to hunt out the black king to the g-file where it has no oxygen and just hunted to its death Queen H6 and made it in the center of the board with a pawn I mean this what what so instead of that decides to lose a big amount of material and the rest of this game is textbook activate the queen there are two ways to win a winning position simplify down to a winning end game or deliver a Checkmate and this way torch very cleanly defends against the pressure wins as many pawns as possible and it's gonna go trade or maybe not it's gonna push its H Pawn all the way to H7 black is defenseless King F2 and let's see if the bot has a sense of humor or if it's going to spare its opponent King F2 rookie I mean look look at look at this oh my God oh my God and now Rook G7 check brutal giving up a rook returning to the G8 Square do you see this the bot has a sense of humor what is the best move in this position making a queen obviously making a queen instead it plays King F2 do you know why it plays King F2 because it can it can Queen on the next move the bot is such a scumbag it plays King F2 what King to C8 now it trades now it makes a queen and now it yeah it comes back and it takes and you know I I feel like these computers have one move every game where they just disrespect D6 Queen C7 no stalemate and a Checkmate has been delivered this dude really it played King to F2 and Knight to D4 was was was was just otherworldly uh I got two more games for you these are against Leela uh which is basically the number two number three ranked uh bought in the world besides stockfish and yeah my friends what you're about to watch is just oh my God it it's it's real bad oh it's real bad let me take a sip of coffee I'm gonna need it for this this is um yeah this is this is crazy stuff um okay ready okay here we go ah E4 D6 this is called a check appearance this is the periods with G6 and Bishop G7 this is the Czech pures F4 Queen A5 pinning the Knight to the king Bishop D3 defending the center black plays E5 torch locks the center so the dark scores are a bit weak right opportunity to fight on the dark squares for black but white has a nice space advantage and as you can imagine might attack over here if given the opportunity and that is why in this position white plays Knight H3 what white does not play Knight F3 white wants to defend the pawn on G4 if it makes it there alright so this is already a very clear indication from torch that I am going to play G5 and I'm going to attack you which is why black plays H6 torch plays Bishop C4 okay pressure here potential to play G5 now torch cannot very quickly Castle queenside because black will go here if torch does succeed in castling Queen side like this torch is going to get a fantastic attacking position down the center down the Kings okay terrific Bishop C4 Bishop B4 Bishop D2 and black comes in with the queen a lot of pressure pressure on the Knight the bishop the pawn the bishop the diagonal and you know Knight F2 is good here H4 G5 trying to make some preparations Rook D1 long Castle now torch plays G5 okay obviously the point being that if Pawn takes the Knight goes and then there's good pressure here but I got a question what about G5 Bishop takes right point being that you're gonna lose the pawn that's the that's the whole idea so you're gonna lose the pawn on you for and after you lose the pawn on e4 uh you're gonna have to trade Queens well that's really unpleasant so what is torch gonna do about this position [Laughter] well if you had the attention span to watch 19 minutes of this video You're gonna be very happy with what I am about to show you because this is this is sick okay this is sick stuff obviously white has to trade the queen White's just got to figure out a way to do it because the Rook is hanging so for example if White Castle's here you know you're gonna lose this and then this is gonna come here and you're gonna lose this it's gonna be really unpleasant so with the Rook hanging and the Queen's staring at you at each other in this position torch plays Pawn takes Knight wait torch sacrifices The Rook but it doesn't come back to defend itself it sacrifices another Rook what in one move it just lost both Rooks look at stockfish I'll move ago stockfish had no idea what was going on it was thinking that this is equal and suddenly look at that eval look at that eval stock picture is like oh yeah we cooking now we cooking now the idea is to butcher the black position down the center line because white is playing with a queen a knight a bishop a bishop and two pawns nine plus nine plus two twenty points of material at the king black has two Rooks but they're in the corner I mean black is basically playing with two pieces of material that are just not in the game at all how does black stop this Onslaught Knight takes E5 if Queen takes C5 check the bishop will block and then black will Castle so black is moments away from defending themselves with Bishop E5 Knight E5 which is why before torch takes with check it flicks in this move for a moment torches down 10 points of material and yet torch is completely winning this is unbelievable stuff torch is completely winning despite being 10 points down why because black has to defend the Rook black is to defend the Knight and black is to defend the king Rook G8 now I come to collect and now a very important move my friends if you take like this oh oh is a check you know how you prevent that by taking with the bishop black cannot Castle into a check if black gives a check I run here I also have a block check which is crazy so instead of that the king would just run but in the game black goes here trying to go Queen takes G7 bringing the rook and White's King just walks out to C3 walks out to B3 and blocks the queen The Rook not powerful enough to attack the king F takes E6 the pawn sneaks through mate is threatened F7 is threatened black is on the verge of death the only chance that black ass here is a Perpetual check so black sacrifices their own Rook Queen B2 Queen B1 the king is in the center of the board but the king is going over here to get the support of his pieces King F3 King G3 King H4 and when it comes this far the queen slides back made us now not a thing but we get into an end game where torch has a horse and it's good to be on a horse if you remember the Old Spice commercials of the old days H5 H4 and white is just going to convert the game by winning the black pawns Knight F4 King C3 you'll notice that torch hasn't even taken this Pawn because it has a sense of humor like it literally just has a sense of humor the Pawn's not going anywhere finally it takes A4 A5 white is pushing on both sides of the board A5 and it makes a queen queen E4 it doesn't need a second Queen it knows how to Checkmate geometrically restricting the black king to only one legal move and queen to G7 check this was one of the most absurd attacks I've ever seen just when it looked like blackhead stopped White's initiative taking the Knight sacrificing two Rooks oh my God and it burrow it just absolutely blasts open the center of the board prevents the black king from castling walks the white king to the edge and blocks the attack and wins this in a convincing end game and the best part of this video is that I have one more game for you listen you know my videos are about 30 minutes 25 30 minutes you know you you can enjoy this with a meal or while taking a shower or while driving you know hopefully you don't watch the screen while you drive unless you drive a Tesla because I think they have the big screen but um I got one more game for you and then you can go yeah torch torch has really been on a roll we have another benoni last time we had we had this remember Knight F3 B5 in this in the second game of the video from the opening remember this looks the same that's not what we got in this one Knight C3 this is a real benoni uh black plays D6 black wants to advance a6b5 black wants to play here play on the E file after castling white very common idea is to play Knight D2 to put the Knight on C4 to put pressure also to prevent a6b5 by playing A4 all of that is gonna happen Knight C4 A4 you see I wouldn't lie to you now White sets up very comfortably defends the pawn on D5 disallows black from getting very typical play and as always torch is going to start an attack G4 of course Bishop G5 Leela takes the Knight because it wants to play F5 there it is and it wants to play F4 so what does torch do puts the bishop on the home Square you see pawns cannot go backwards I know you didn't know that before you clicked on this video pawns can't go backwards once you commit a pawn forward that's it so torch is basically left like all right so what are you gonna do with this you play a four that looks interesting I'm gonna play E3 so what are you going to do well here's what I'm gonna do I move my Bishop out of the way so my pawns can go forward you thought you were attacking me it's like Judo all right you get closer I step back I use your momentum against you right takes E4 Bishop G5 F4 and now here comes the attack roaring forward now stockfish as always is just kind of saying it's still a complicated game look at Black coming out with the queen you could defend this Pawn instead of that we give it up completely all right come and take it you want it so bad come and take it now we're trying to trap The Black Queen in the position black queen escapes to B4 now Rook a four oh all right looking a little bit unpleasant but now c4 very well timed very well time move you take the queen I take the queen and then I sneak in the queen can get out to C5 now so now we kind of try to you know prevent that position looking nice so right now Leela up upon up a pawn everything is good everything is good but White's got more space you want to play where you're stronger you're stronger in the center E5 all right Knight B6 counter-attacking The Rook The Rook slides out of the way Knight H5 opening up the f file maybe rookie a is a very tense position now white plays King H2 gets off of this gets out of a check potentially it covers the G3 Square H6 now white goes into hunt but that was Black's idea now we take on E5 attacking the Queen the queen takes pressure here eyes over oh over on G7 potential to push both the pawns be a little careful though Queens can see each other Rook F2 check but we block we take but Rook C7 oh my goodness wait a minute what's happening pressure there pressure there this is hanging bit of a tongue twister of a position now Rook takes the Knight Rook takes B rookie eight I mean it's a very close game all right torch is just very slowly and methodically applying pressure and has the pawns but how is torch actually gonna break through here Queenie five Rook B8 we're looking for a rook trade the bishop drops back hits the queen The Rook sees The Rook The Rook sees The Rook The Rook sees the Queen the queen sees The Rook but the Rook can't take the queen because the Rook is pinned to the king we now fought Queen A4 and here we go you ready rookie two hitting the queen prying the defensive the way from The Rook in the corner takes the king slides out of the way now rookie seven putting the pressure here and here and here and the d-pawn can still go Rook G3 counter-attacking that's mate that is a Checkmate so we give a check the bishop blocks now we push anywhere the bishop moves is a discovered attack the bishop runs away sacrificing itself so the pressure is relieved but it's a fork that was the big idea if you take it's a fork white says no problem take the queen I get the bishop I get the Rook you take the queen no problem and guess what queen B3 oh did torch miss something because torch is going to lose a bishop no plus five how is it plus five like this F6 check Pawn blocks and now you would think F7 right no because Queen D6 and it's a draw so you know how torch is gonna win this game all the way back here you know how Torchy's gonna win this game watch the King this is one of the most gangster King walks I've ever seen the King goes to F4 and to win the game the king joins his forces joins his troops check is no longer possible and if you check the king from the other side the king continues to move forward shielded by his soldiers Pawn to D6 Bishop to B7 sliding into D7 and now the Rook sacrifices itself to promote a queen and the white king makes it all the way to the other side of the board to facilitate the advancement of the d-pawn queen to D4 d8 Queen takes Queen E7 and you think you know the rest Queen to G8 I mean what a that came out of nowhere it was a tense position white was improving the position creating winning chances Bishop to E8 looked like you couldn't take because of the fork torch took and gave up the queen and the King walks to the opposite side of the board to win this game white only won this game because the king defended everybody and created a fortress around himself to advance and that's what won the game ultimately by Checkmate on the G8 Square torch has been on fire creating highlight reels against stockfish against random other Bots that are rated like 3500 Leela I can't wait to see where this goes very very fun to track and uh yeah let me know if you like the torch videos because um I'm gonna keep making them that's all I have for you today you know the drill uh check out the book how to win at chess available in the US
