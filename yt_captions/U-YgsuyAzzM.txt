a little while ago gm began telling the customers of their chevrolet bolt not to use them this is due to a rash of battery related fires that have triggered three recalls and cost gm 1.8 billion in warranty costs gm is looking to pass those costs onto their battery supplier lg energy solution sometimes also referred to as lg chem of which they are a recent spin-off lg has acknowledged their responsibility in the whole situation attributing it to a cell manufacturing quality problem lawsuits are probably forthcoming this kerfuffle illustrates a going concern with this latest generation of high-energy ev batteries fires in this video we're going to take a look at these high profile electric vehicle events and what it means for the industry for this video i want to give my sincere thanks and appreciation to an anonymous viewer and good friend of the channel for his thoughts and technical guidance ev batteries are a complicated thing and i would hate to be spouting whatever any errors are my own of course okay first let me talk about the asiometry newsletter if you subscribe to the channel you should also sign up to the newsletter read the full scripts to older videos with extra commentary after the fact there's also newsletter exclusives like a recent one on the maldives you can find the link to the newsletter in the video description below or you can just go to asian arbitrary dot com as of right now you can expect a new newsletter every thursday at 1 am taiwan time all right back to the show the 2017 chevy bolt made by gm has a 60 kilowatt hour 350 volt lithium ion battery pack the 2020 version had an improved version with 66 kilowatt hours the pack is made of 288 lithium ion cells in 96 modules three cells in parallel and has an expected range of about 200 highway miles these are pouch type cells their major chemistry is made up of lithium nickel oxide lithium cobalt oxide and lithium magnesium oxide this nickel-rich architecture allows the car to go further and accounts for a fifth of the car's total cost the first recall was issued in 2018. in november 2020 the company issued a software update that attempted to address the issue but a few more fires occurred with one of the bolts having the updated software this led to a second recall in july 2021 and now this latest one a month later this august 2021 recall is the most expansive thus far it covers chevy bolts from the 2020 to the 2022 model years as well as a few 2019 models that had not been covered in previous recalls it basically recalls each one of the 141 000 bolts ever sold gm has advised that owners of the bolt do the following things park 50 feet away from other cars park on the top floor of parking garages monitor your car while charging only charge the battery to 90 percent do not discharge to less than 70 miles and always park the vehicle outside the chevy bolt recalls are a bitter pill for gm to swallow considering that bloomberg reported back in 2016 that the company was expected to take an 8 000 to 9 000 loss for each vehicle sold regardless gm will replace the batteries working with lg to scale up production of replacement battery modules the two companies are so intimately tied together now that they have no choice but to work together through this divorce is not an option when an ev battery in a car catches fire it tends to get into the news especially if that car happens to be a tesla which always gets clicks this is for two reasons the first is that ev battery fires are rare if stored and operated within manufacturer recommended limits a lithium-ion battery has a failure rate of 1 in 40 million elon tusk makes a good point that fires are a whole lot more common in internal combustion in cars av battery fires tend to make the news because they are relatively rare exact comparable statistics are hard to come by but in 2019 there were in 190 000 conventional vehicle fires in the united states has as dogenus points out of course the stat is in part due to the fact that electric vehicles themselves make up a relative minority of the overall car population but there is some automobile insurance data that shows that evs tend to have a lower rate of vehicle fires and of course it is also necessary to counterpoint that ev owners tend to be wealthier and thus possibly are better or more careful drivers thus the lower car fire rate as twain says there are lies damned lies and statistics such and such the second big reason these ev fires tend to make the news however is indeed very safety related it is because like i hinted at earlier these fires tend to burn big and hot to know why that is the case we need to look inside the battery itself if you recall batteries always have a number of comic components the anode the cathode electrolyte and separator during normal operations lithium ions move from the anode to the cathode and this drives the machine in recent years customers have come to expect more from their electronics for instance more range and faster charging times for their evs to meet this demand the market has developed and introduced new chemistries especially in the cathode space these include nickel-rich and manganese-rich materials and a bunch of other stuff that sounds like it belongs in a hard sci-fi novel vanadium pentoxide or carbon-coated lithium-iron-phosphate nanospheres manufacturers walk a bouncing rope adding more of these materials can increase how long the battery can discharge energy or how much energy it can discharge but doing that can also lead to thermal instability and really bad fires if the battery gets too hot is damaged for whatever reason or has manufacture flaws then there are fire risks it can lead to what is euphemistically referred to within the industry has thermal runway batteries catch on fire for any number of reasons for this specific scenario i would discuss a temperature induced one when things are operating normally the battery cells generate heat but that heat is relatively low and safely dissipates out of the module the battery's internal structure remains sound but as a temperature rises and keeps rising beyond certain thresholds then the battery's components start to transform chemically and if there is nothing to stop this then it can lead to thermal runway the first thing to go would be the solid electrolyte interface layer or the sei the sei layer is formed on the anode as part of the electrochemistry manufacturing process this impermeable layer protects the anode from reacting with the electrolytes molecules i mentioned this in my video about ev battery manufacturing you can learn more about the whole process in that one anyway when the temperature gets too high usually at around the 90 to 120 degrees celsius level the sei breaks down this generates additional heat and creates carbon dioxide in the process the chain reaction can now continue with the sei layer gone the barbarians of the electrolyte can breach the gates and react with the anode this generates yet more heat as electrolyte reactions tend to be especially hot with the temperature at over 135 degrees celsius the separator loses its structural integrity the separator is an important safety measure inside the battery with the separator no longer separating the anode and the cathode come into contact and causes what is called an internal short circuit an internal short circuit is the single most common reason why an eevee battery starts to catch fire at this point the battery begins to self-discharge the cathode and anode start to decompose releasing oxygen and yet more heat different chemistries of cathodes are more vulnerable to this decomposition than others lithium cobalt oxides probably most so lithium iron phosphates probably least vulnerable and thus tend to be the most safe but with different drawbacks of their own when the temperature gets over 200 degrees celsius the electrolyte also decomposes releasing its own heat critically the decomposition releases reactive and potentially explosive gases like carbon dioxide hydrocarbons and fluoride gases by now every part of the whole battery is breaking down and the car is likely on fire a fire exceptionally difficult to put out ev fires are not your regular garden variety car fires if such a thing exists because they are partially caused by direct reactions between battery components they may not require external oxygen therefore firefighters generally find them more difficult to extinguish than conventional vehicle fires one example in the city of fort lauderdale in the united states took between seven hundred and fifty to one thousand one hundred liters of water in some cases it can take over ten thousand liters of water and over sixty minutes to suppress an eevee fire this is substantially more than the five minutes for a conventional car fire firefighters tend to use water to smother a fire but this may lead to additional risks the salt in the electrolyte briskly named lithium hexafluorophosphate can react with the water to create hydrogen fluoride a corrosive gas hydrogen fluoride is used in the petrochemical industry to create super acids enough said and water being poured into the battery can cause additional short circuits it is known that dirty water leeching into the battery's innards can spark eevee fires there have been a few eevee bus incidents in china of such furthermore ev batteries have a tendency to reignite long after the fire has been seemingly extinguished this is due to residual energy inside the battery for instance the battery in the fort lauderdale carr fire reignited as the burnt vehicle was being towed away from the crashed scene that fire was quickly put out but then it lit up again once it arrived at the salvage yard another ev fire in south jordan usa also reignited the same day of the crash and then again five days thereafter considering that an ev battery fire is not your ordinary fire manufacturers have gone to great measures to install systems to prevent them from happening there are a variety of reasons why battery fires can start sometimes they never find the reason thus manufacturers have engineered a variety of safety measures to either prevent thermal runway from ever starting or from getting out of control some measures are no-brainers others require balancing tradeoffs for instance enlarging the space between the cells in the modules tests in the lab find that if one cell is compromised it can heat up its neighbors and cause chain reactions for this reason sometimes manufacturers add literal firewalls between the cells but doing something like this reduces energy density and cuts down on the vehicle's range customers might be less willing to buy such a car so trade-offs the battery management systems within the modules are also critical separating a module and it sells electrical systems can prevent a total thermal runway event and since modules are the pac's nervous system software can be incorporated to predict a sales possibility of thermal runway based on charge levels and temperature changes the latter since abrupt variations of heat are just as dangerous as the absolute level of heat for the cells themselves manufacturers have identified the separator has a critical safety measure to prevent thermal runway the reason why the separator is mostly made of polymer is that when it gets too hot the pores in the polymer close a process called separator shutdown this keeps the cathodes and anodes from meeting and prevents an internal short circuit from happening reactions will stop and so long as the separator maintains its structural integrity the battery can start to calm down engineers have implemented triple layer separators and ceramic coated polymer hybrids that maintain their stability even throughout difficult temperatures it is important to remember however that every item has its limit and to deal with thermal runway gases from causing potential explosions cells can be made with fail-safe venting mechanisms there are a variety of granted patents for them cylindrical 18650 batteries can have small vent windows pressure sensitive caps or simple sealed pinholes this is by no means a comprehensive review of ev battery safety mechanisms i have literally just scratched the surface but it gives you a window into just how big of a deal it is in the minds of manufacturers and despite all that things can still go wrong there is no doubt that this recall is a hit to lg energy the company prides itself on its advanced chemistries and industry standard pouch designs for its battery cells whether or not there might be something actually fundamentally wrong with lg's pouch design as elon seems to imply in a tweet that's harder to say issue that is more interesting to consider is whether actual or perceived safety risks with these nickel-rich battery chemistries are going to have car makers opting for lithium-iron phosphate batteries as i briefly mentioned these chemistries tend to be safer when it comes to thermal runway but they do have drawbacks in the form of energy density and weight companies like byd and kadl dominate the lithium iron phosphate world in terms of production and patents they're doing some really interesting things with cell to pack that attempt to ameliorate those aforementioned drawbacks tesla using lithium iron phosphate in some of their chinese model 3s might be an indication that these chemistries are getting good enough it is likely that the chinese players gain share in areas like norway where range is less of a concern as for the industry as a greater whole ev momentum is too strong right now gm has committed to putting out a whole series of electric cars in the future companies like ford and porsche are making electric versions of their flagship cars a few bumps along the road is a willing price to bear for a greener future that being
