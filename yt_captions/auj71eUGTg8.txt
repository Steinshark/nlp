paradise welcome to camera comparison to branching Walter sever pro galaxy s 10 plus and the Huawei P 30 right now it works recording on the front cameras of each phone so we think to the video quality as well as audio quality so starting off with rear camera video the oneplus is off to a flying start its high dynamic ranges so capable that it's the only phone where you can distinguish not just the dark water the green trees but also the blue in the sky also only the oneplus and the Samsung can record 4k video at 60 frames per second the four-way is limited to 34 this whole comparison I've set the hallway to its smooth color option but even then colors are coming out a little bit funky Samsung is the most natural in the situation stabilization at 4k resolution it looks like oneplus has knocked it out the park the oneplus 7 pro looks even more stable than the p30 pro which in itself is even more stable than the s10 plus when we turn the resolution down to 1080p all three phones have incredible stabilization the galaxy s 10 + moves into its super steady video mode and p30 pro uses its AI features as well to create a similar results safe to say the 7 pro is at least as good as the other 2 something you will notice on the oneplus though is that whilst the phone does come with an ultra light camera you can't use it for video at least not yet even when you can use it and we've all come to this when we talk about photos it's just not as wide as the other two phones it can do 117 degrees versus always 120 versus Samsung's 123 degrees you might also know that all three phones have a telephoto lens as well the wampler 7 pro at 3 x oom as 10 plus with two times and the Huawei with five bear in mind though that the oneplus footage looks pretty grainy it looks like instead of taking video using d telephoto camera it's actually just cropping in from what the main camera is capturing all three can record continuous 240 frame per second slow motion and I was really happy with how it looks on the S 10 + and the 1 + 7 Pro and in fact you can see that in terms of exposure of the background oneplus is even doing it better than Samsung the Galaxy S 10 though does go a step further it can record bursts of super slow motion and 960 frame per second video the wall we can - but it's using a bit of software trickery to achieve it and it's not true 960 fps okay as the light starts to dip this is where it gets really interesting so we're starting off with a middling lighting scenario it's not really dark yet but you can already see that Samsung's footage is already starting to Peter off it's lost a lot of sharpness compared to the other two if we try zooming in five times on each I would actually say oneplus looks better than Huawei this could be because it seems to use the main sensor as opposed to its telephoto for video and in this particular case that helps it you can also see the noise reduction algorithms as well as the high dynamic range algorithms on the oneplus really drawing out every bit of detail that the cameras capturing I was super impressed with this as we go even darker you can really tell the STM plus is falling behind whilst both the one plus seven pro and the p30 Pro are actually capturing the details inside this well-lit building the attempt loss is just making it a blown-out mess the seventh pro is at least keeping up with the p30 Pro that's kind of amazing and super surprising considering that this is one of the p30s main at selling points ok so just before I talk about nighttime photography let's take a quick look at the specs of each smartphones camera all three phones have a primary camera with the oneplus as being the highest resolution in terms of ultra light you've got the galaxy s 10 which has the widest ultra wide lens and then in terms of telephoto while we has the maximum zoom 5 times versus two times and three times also only on the huawei you've got a fourth time of flight camera for assisting with portrait mode as soon as we dive into nighttime photography the Huawei p30 Pro really starts to come into its own it creates generally speaking the most well rounded image the one with the deepest blacks but also the brightest whites it creates a super high dynamic range picture even when there's barely any dynamic range in the actual environment Huawei also adds a healthy dose of sharpness which is not always a good thing but it usually helps in these nighttime scenarios take a look at the brickwork on the floor in these images now to be clear all three are actually really decent night modes the oneplus 7 pro has been a massive improvement over the 60 the galaxy s 10 plus is the first time Samsung is actually introduced a dedicated night mode feature but in most scenarios Huawei is ahead and for starters is actually the only one of the three that can use its ultra wide lens while taking night mode for toes on doormat note is actually the only one that can use a zoom lens as well which as you can imagine with five times zoom capability makes a game-changing difference but there is one point worth addressing whilst the hallway is undoubtedly the more flexible camera a night when there is a decent amount of light in these nightmare shots it doesn't necessarily capture more detail in fact it's noise reduction algorithm is so powerful - often times it smooths out the edges even more so than the other two versions when it comes to flush one plus has the most powerful flash module although sometimes that can result in a bit of overexposure you'll see the STM plus has a slightly green tinge to it and the hallway it more on the warm side daytime photography is where hallway starts to fall behind and the samsung galaxy s TM plus i would say takes the lead the images between the 1 plus and the Samsung though are not too far apart the Samsung adds a really nice dose of saturation that brings a warmth to images in this image you can see that while we is struggling to balance both the dark water and the bright sky but the 1 plus on the Samsung have pretty comparable high dynamic range capabilities the differences are more just in how the image is presented and the color processing the p30 pros photos have a high contrast look to them the slightly grungy industrial aesthetic you might like it you might not you'll notice again the difference is in the field of view of the ultra wide lenses although it's not as stark as the difference is when taking video because of the way the sensor is used but it is still enough of a difference to mean that the Galaxy S 10 Plus can often fit a whole building in that the p30 pro struggles with and other one plus has no chance with oh yeah and take a look at the p30 pros image here even though I've purposefully set that phone to its natural smooth color option when you go to that ultra wide camera it just dials a contrast art alright let's talk about zoom so these three photos were taken with each phone's main camera and these three with each phone's telephoto you can see that one plus is 3 x oom gets you a fair bit closer to the subject than Samsung's 2 x with the p30 Pro and it's 5 times optical zoom way in front if you then push each phone if you force them to adopt 10 times magnification you kind of get the result you'd expect p30 pro in front then the 7 pro then the s10 plus if we try again with this image here you can see that one plus and samsung they have a good level of consistency between the colors of their main camera and their telephoto cameras but neither of them can come close to just the detailed of what way captures when zooming in in terms of macro that while we can get quite a lot closer to subjects and still retain focus on them compared to the s10 which in itself can do better than the womp plus portrait mode the one plus seven pro takes amazing portraits but it is a little bit annoying that it uses the telephoto lens so you have to take a couple of steps back every time you want to do one I think always high contrast look kind of works here although if you look at the buildings in the background it doesn't really create a smooth transition between them and the sky what about straight-up raw detail what about if you wanted to take a photo print it out and just blow it up as big as possible it's gonna be Samsung Samsung captures almost in every scenario slightly more texture than the other two Samsung also generally speaking takes better quality front-facing video it's 4k resolution completely smashes the other two phones ability to take 1080p only having said that if you want to take 4k video on that camera you're gonna miss out on stabilization the other two phones with their 1080p footage will be more steady also whoa is AI HDR kicks in here and you can see it's the only firm that can correctly exposed the blue sky in the background for taking selfies during the day there isn't a huge amount in it but generally speaking I would side with the s temp plus because it has a secondary depth sensor on the front the portrait mode especially looks as good as the portraits from some phones and rear cameras don't underestimate the oneplus though in some cases I would say it does outperform the other two and it's clearly a massive improvement over the oneplus 60 last year all three can capture a fair bit in one frame so they're gonna be OK for a group photo but not quite as good as their Google pixel three's front-facing ultra wide camera what surprised me is that as the light starts to fall the oneplus slowly emerges as the best selfie camera amongst our three whether you're taking standard selfies or portrait mode selfies it consistently beats out the s Templars and the p30 Pro and finally bit of a mouthful but if you're taking a front-facing video in low light then Samsung is slightly ahead of the oneplus which is a fair bit ahead of the p30 pro which is a complete mess at this point all right if you enjoyed this video I've got plenty more coming so it'll be massively appreciated if you could subscribe to the channel my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
