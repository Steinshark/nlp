contemporary amperex technology or kadl recently unveiled their first generation sodium ion batteries for commercial use i've been hearing a lot about this technology and thought it would be worth talking about scientists started off developing sodium ion batteries right alongside lithium-ion batteries over time lithium rose to dominance and sodium fell by the wayside but now things have changed and sodium ion batteries have started to see renewed interest in this video we will briefly review sodium ion batteries their state of development and what their commercialization means for

cathode an anode a porous separator between the two and an electrolyte when the battery is being used ions migrate back and forth between the cathode and the anode the primary difference between the two battery types is that their components are made of different compounds that is actually part of the appeal it is likely that commercial sodium ion batteries can share the same engineering and production methods as lithium-ion batteries the single biggest advantage that sodium ion batteries have over lithium-ion batteries has to do with the availability of certain raw materials and linked to that cost almost all of the world's lithium comes from four countries australia chile china and argentina and this element is not particularly easy nor environmentally friendly to extract furthermore there are other critical elements like cobalt which present particularly large environmental and humanitarian concerns the global supply of sodium by contrast is essentially unlimited there are over 1000 times more sodium than lithium in the earth's crust this translates to a raw ingredient cost of 150 dollars per ton as compared to lithium's 5 000 a 30 times decrease researchers have been trying to commercialize sodium ion batteries side by side with lithium ion batteries development kicked off in the early 20th century when it was discovered that molten salts were capable of conducting high amounts of sodium ions in 1968 scientists at the ford company developed the sodium sulfur battery for use in electric vehicles it was essentially made of a tube of metallic sodium dipped into another tube of liquid sulfur ford felt that a 350 pound sodium sulfur battery could provide 200 to 300 miles of range for a 1 350 pound car running at 40 miles an hour the minimum charge time was said to be half an hour the biggest challenge was that it only worked at very high temperatures 570 to 660 degrees fahrenheit or 300 to 350 degrees celsius as you might expect this caused safety and longevity issues especially in cars for instance at those temperatures the aluminum-based container tubes would react with the battery chemicals and rupture ford never was able to commercialize the technology for a working electric vehicle and it makes a lot of sense why molten salt batteries as they are called have yet to see wide use in mobile electronics but they do have several real world applications the most common is to provide power for guidance systems and missiles but they are also ideal for extreme environments i just finished a video about using them on the surface of venus ford eventually sold this technology to a japanese company called ngk today they are sold as stationary battery solutions for peak energy use and grid stabilization the oil crises of the 1970s revitalized interest in this technology in 1985 south african researchers created a new version of the molten salt battery using nickel chloride and sodium tetrachloroaluminate the zebra battery as it was called held a lot of promise but in 1989 sony successfully commercialized the lithium-ion battery and its advantages quickly won over the industry from then on research largely focused there today lithium-ion battery technologies largely dominate the industry they are the first choice for use in electric vehicles stationary batteries and mobile gadgets but in the 2000s concerns began emerging with regards to the supply of raw materials like as i mentioned earlier natural sources of lithium are limited and that cannot be the case if we want to be truly serious about a carbon-free economy secondly a less heralded reason has to do with intellectual property rights so many patents have been filed around lithium-ion technologies then new companies have to be extremely careful not to run afoul of the lawyers sodium ion battery technologies by contrast offer far larger green fields thus starting in the 2010s people started taking a second look at sodium ion batteries which would again use sodium but at room temperatures the number of publications relating to sodium ion batteries began to quickly rise and in recent years have even surpassed that of lithium ion batteries batteries especially prototypes wildly different from one another but for the most part scientists have started to hone in on a few high potential sodium ion battery chemistries most studies have converged on making the anodes from a substance called quote hard carbon end quote it can also be colloquially described as charcoal the electrolyte makes sure that sodium ions can travel from the anode to the cathode these have to be of low viscosity high conductivity and be electrochemically stable researchers have generally chosen sodium salts dissolved in solvents of organic carbonate though there is plenty of research advocating for other options too i won't cover them here the cathode is where much of the latest research has been focused on same as with the lithium ion battery makes sense since the cathode is the single most expensive component in the whole thing and is key to its overall viability many candidate materials have emerged as potential contenders the most common and most closely study class of cathode material are sodium layered oxides these are pretty wild they have a crystalline structure made up of sheets of metal oxides with sodium ion sandwich in between they are distinguished with a p2 o3 and p3 notation that refers to their geometries and the reason why they show so much promise is because their crystalline structures have a lot in common with that of lithium cobalt oxide the first legit cathode material in lithium-ion batteries there has been a whole lot of research in cathode materials for sodium ion batteries other research candidates include sulfides phosphates fluorophosphates carbon phosphates vanadium based polyanionic compounds and so on catal for their part has opted to make their cathodes out of something else there has been a whole lot of experimentation in past years the science has moved fast and the first few sodium ion battery products have started to inch towards the market the first really actually commercial ready sodium ion battery looks to be an 1865 zero cell created by the french research agency cnrs cea in 2015 1865 0 is a standard format size and refers to the battery's dimensions 18 millimeters wide 65 millimeters tall and the zero means that it is a cylindrical format the reported energy density is about 90 watt hours per kilogram two years later in 2017 the agency spun off the research into a startup called tmat energy the company's long-term objective is to develop low voltage systems for hybrid vehicles and help ensure french technological sovereignty in june 2020 researchers at washington state university and pacific northwest national laboratory announced a more advanced sodium ion battery its creators speculate that the battery might be able to achieve a practical specific energy of about 160 watt hours per kilogram this is comparable to current lithium-ion phosphate batteries that being said we should temper our expectations here sodium has lower ionization potential or ionization energy than lithium this means that sodium ion batteries will have lower energy densities and operating voltages than their lithium counterparts and it is not clear whether they can ever catch up to top-line lithium-ion batteries in this regard there are also a number of other technology startups trying to commercialize sodium ion batteries some examples include uk-based faradian limited swedenbase ultras a b chinabase heine battery and us-based natron energy now that we have very very briefly gone over the current state of the research and sodium ion batteries we can review the catal announcement and get some perspective here in their announcement cato gave a few details about how their sodium ion battery works the anode is made of hard carbon as is commonly the case they noted that their hard carbon anode features a unique porous structure which lengthens its cycle lifetime and allows for more sodium ion movement for the cathode however they are using something interesting they mentioned that they are using a substance called prussian white prussian white is an analog of a pigment called prussian blue first synthesize over 300 years ago the dye makes a beautiful blue shade and has been noted for removing heavy toxic metals from the body it is very cheap easily made and non-toxic but sometime in the early 2010s researchers also notice its suitability for use in sodium ion battery cathodes they have good discharge rates and can sustain their capacity over many charge cycles some tests have shown 95 retention even after 10 000 cycles one big drawback of prussian blue cathodes and there will always be drawbacks is that they lose a lot of their capacity in the presence of moisture other companies have been exploring prussian blue cathodes notable companies include the aforementioned altruist ab and natron energy kadl said that their first generation sodium ion battery can achieve energy densities of up to 160 watt hours per kilogram this is comparable to the washington state battery unveiled last june which as i mentioned is in turn competitive with current lithium-ion phosphate batteries the second generation hopes to be over 200 watt hours per kilogram furthermore like as i also mentioned the engineering and manufacturing processes are similar between sodium and lithium ion batteries so cadal can really take advantage of this by tightly integrating their sodium ion offering into their existing lithium ion infrastructure and product ecosystem it is worth keeping in mind though that since the two preparatory processes will have so much overlap sodium ion battery cost will not be drastically lower than lithium-ion batteries most of the savings will come from cheaper raw material costs it is like how gasoline prices don't rise and fall in step with oil prices one paper estimates that the end users will see 10 to 30 price savings using sodium ion with all things being equal the company also called out battery system integration capabilities where they can mix and match sodium and lithium-ion batteries into a single system lithium ion batteries which right now have higher energy densities are automatically used by the system when sodium ion falls short so that is kind of interesting we talk a lot about new and exciting battery chemistries but the reality is that a lot of these concepts do not see commercialization and far fewer get widely adopted for instance lead acid batteries have been around for 150 years their energy densities are not comparable with lithium ion and their materials are quite toxic yet because lead acid batteries are cheap and reliable they are still very widely used in 2020 global lead acid battery sales totaled nearly 50 billion dollars so inertia really means a whole lot so not everything will be a lithium ion battery level a success and it looks like sodium ion batteries will never be able to replace lithium in certain use cases like mobile phones and other electronic gadgets but they have potential in short-range electric vehicles and especially in stationary power systems places where space is less of a big deal making their lower energy density not so much of a confounding factor for instance energy storage for solar and wind renewables those areas which operate at scale can also really appreciate the cost savings there are already some small startups in the space but cable is no ordinary enterprise they are the biggest battery company in the world and it appears that they will pour a lot of resources into this endeavor leveraging their size manufacturing skill and r d savvy to make this work let us see if they will succeed and help sodium ion live up to its full potential all right everyone that's it for
