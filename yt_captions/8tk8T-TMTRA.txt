[Music] so first things first wake up at seven o'clock in the morning and i think it's really important to do things for yourself things that motivate you and that interest you so very first thing off the bat is i do an hour of language learning every single morning i try to fit the whole hour in currently i'm learning spanish and i use this website called italki to match with spanish tutors and right now my spanish tutor richard is out of colombia then of course i get my coffee and i start work by 8 30. yes i know tech jobs will allow you to start work at 11am but why would you want to do that i like to finish my days as early as possible so i can reserve the evenings for myself i don't want to be at work at until 8 pm at night the code i write at work is pretty heavy-handed so i don't have some sleek macbook that i use for my regular dev work i actually have a desktop tower the workload i'm running right now takes about two hours to run end to end so it's pretty vital that i use that tower i have a small 13-inch laptop too but i mostly just check email and listen to music on that i can't share too many details but i'll give you guys the bare minimum my team works on windows [Music] but we don't actually create new features for windows we work on the system that actually builds windows images we're actually responsible for creating those images for release and also for testing this is the system that keeps the bugs out of what oh son of a some things that you'll do on a day-to-day basis the first one is stand-up which yes i actually stand up for it's essentially a morning meeting to share your status and most importantly if you're blocked on any of your work next is code reviews i'm going to show you the lead party repo that we have here at tech intern this is where all the code reviews live on github your teammates need to take some time out of their day to review each other's work and get as much feedback and as early as possible i ran a workload overnight so before i post a pr i want to check the result i thought something looked off so i'm digging through the log files to see what i can find a large part of being a developer is finding bugs in code the best way to do that is to have a comprehensive logging system at review council i use roll bar to inspect my logs and my errors it also sends me an email whenever there's a new error so i can be alerted of it one thing people don't really talk about too much in these videos is being on call so every week we select one developer for that entire week they are on call every few weeks i am on call and that's what the entire week looks like for me over lunch i like to work out that usually goes from about 12 to 1. this is the gym in my apartment building it's really nice it's got this really unique climbing wall as you can see i'm actually really good okay well maybe i'm not so good when i get back into the day this is when i'll do my real coding so today on review council i'll show you the problem i'm trying to solve obviously i can't show you the code from microsoft so what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you a new feature i implemented in review council which is the startup i just launched and it's real code running for real users so what review council allows small companies to do is review their work so this is some work on the left and then you can see the checklists on the right so the checklist might be item one might be something like make sure someone's name is spelled correctly item two is make sure that this email is correct um essentially they're just things to look for when you're reviewing a document now let's say i saw item 1 to 3 here and then i said oh i actually don't see item 4 here it doesn't work so i rejected this document well when the document is fixed and i do see item 4 here problem is that when i come back into the review it'll look like this i'll have to look for item one two and three all over again this isn't a great experience it's fine when you have four items but when you have a list of 40 items becomes really difficult so today we want to remember which items we've already checked off so that's what we're going to be implementing okay so in our reviews table each review has its own id what i want to do here is create a new table that stores which items have been checked off and then i want to link each of those items to the review that it comes from so what i'm doing here is basically making a foreign key which means that this row links to a row in a different table if that row is ever deleted then just delete me too now i want to create a new function and this function is going to be get checked off items for review it's essentially it's going to select all rows for that id so we're going to get all items that were checked off for that review i like using connect.js instead of raw sql this gives me the freedom to choose between what database i want to use under the hood and i don't have to change any of the syntax while also giving me the ability to write queries just like regular code so that's what all of this dot where stuff kind of looks like okay now i want to add to the get review metadata function this function basically just returns the review what i want to do here is return the checked off items also okay now i want to add to the update status function basically just taken a list of checked off items and what i want to do is include that in the update status table and i'm going to put it to do here have this function actually insert those checked off items into the table that can be left as an exercise to you guys okay now we're going to go to the front end and essentially what we're going to do is grab the checked off items out of the review so remember we included the checked off items in the review now i just want to see hey if it's not equal to null um then i just want to save those and then we're going to iterate through them later that's what i'm doing here okay now when i scroll down you see this piece of code is responsible for printing all of the items in the checklist right here you can see all these items this part code does that so what i want to do is just copy and paste it and i'm going to make this already seen list and i'm going to loop through them and show which ones have already been seen so essentially we're gonna we're copying pasting this code twice but instead of going through the regular buttons we're gonna go through these already checked off items and i'm just gonna disable this button to show hey we've already checked this off you don't have to do anything to it then lastly there's one other thing we would have to do here and that is remove the checked off items from the regular button list right because they've already been checked off you don't need to check them off again so this is looking good let's go back up to the top and implement this filter here basically we're just going to say hey if this item has already been checked off then don't include it in the button list and i'm just implementing that last but not least we want to grab the checked off items and put them in this function that actually makes the http request to the back end and we already included that parameter in the back end so uh there's a little bit of work you'd have to do here that i haven't showed but it's pretty simple and pretty straightforward now you can see i check off items one two three i reject this review and then i'm going to refresh i'm going to go to the rejected column what you'll see is items 1 to 3 have already been checked off you can't change them and now you only have to change item 4. i finished work at 4 30 depending on what needs to be done for the day and then i go for a walk it's important to get out of the house and get some fresh air i think it's way too easy to lock yourself up during coveting think that that's what's making you safe but i think you really need to get the sun get some fresh air and get a nice walk in every day i already showed you my gym but i think i'm going to show you some of my other amenities this is the game room there's a pool table in here pinball machine and whatever the hell this thing is called oh it's skee-ball by the way i'm horrible at it on the top floor there's a big kitchen if you want to have guests over board games really nice outside area you've got pizza ovens barbecues there's some nice seating up there and of course a really great view of the space needle then i come back to my apartment this is usually where i do some personal work this usually starts out as checking any questions in the tech and turn discord which you should definitely join link in the description it might be me shooting some videos or working on review console a bit more or even just sending some emails and making some cold calls usually i work till about 6 45 and that's what when i cook dinner and then i usually take a bit of a break i take the next two hours off until about 9 30 then i might read a little bit after that i might read for an hour before bed or maybe i'll just go to bed early usually i'm in bed by 11 o'clock and ready for the next day you can't underestimate how important that eight hours of sleep really is i'll be working from hawaii next month for the entire month and i'm going to do another one of these videos and show you the difference between what it's like living in seattle versus working and living in hawaii so definitely like and subscribe if you're interested in that i can't wait to see you guys in the next episode thank you so much for joining
