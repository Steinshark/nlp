this is mr beast and he has just invited me to his top secret youtube warehouse well actually we're currently inside of it and i want to show you guys around so he can get views we're going to show you where his videos are filmed how his videos are edited and then finally how much a ridiculous setup like this actually costs and i'm a little scared because i've never shown anyone around this studio this is gonna be a first time this is gonna be cool come in here is around 50 000 square feet there's no polls or anything so we can just build sets we can do whatever we want you know what's blowing my mind this is not what i associate with youtube you know what's funny that's literally what everyone says when they come in here they're like for youtube one thing i noticed immediately when i walked in is like you clap you hear nothing back yeah except these guys in the back yeah they're working on a video that's exactly right so we soundproof the ceiling on top of that uh you'll probably notice there's hundreds of sprinklers on the ceiling do you have sprinklers because you keep blowing stuff up in here yeah exactly no you could blow up a car there and not have to worry about burning them in the building that's a rare use case scenario in one of our coming up video we need a million dollars these are empty don't try to rob me right now so we're putting ten thousand dollars in a hundred briefcases is there a reason you've settled on this particular model of briefcase does this just not look like ten thousand dollars i don't know it could be maybe more golden [Laughter] okay time to ask jimmy the big question android or iphone obviously iphone steve jobs steve jobs name the person who created android andy rubin okay well i didn't know that we'll keep a tally of every single person we meet in this tour this right here is one of our coming up videos the beauty of having all this space is our old warehouse was basically the size of this room this room feels like there was some havoc yeah there's a lot of havoc there's just like random broken bits of tech and eggs yeah so you should remember that if you show anything bad i'm gonna get egged that was a threat oh you're gonna break tech in front of me yeah yeah i will this was our little hub over here that you would have thought was baller so this is what it looked like when we were filming so you could see all the girls cameras there all the boys cameras there so we could constantly monitor it this is the kind of stuff we don't normally show we had to have six or seven people here monitoring every angle because if they just touch the red line they're out you have to basically set up like 40 cameras so you can monitor every single inch of the line what they're doing on top of content and there's two of them it's a role you don't think about yeah what did you do today i stared at girls for a hundred hours like you might want to refreeze i stared at a red line for a hundred dollars someone's getting a little edgy over here yeah and on top of that you can zoom in as well so we have tons of shots but just zooming into their mouths or whatever they're eating food oh my god like what kind of zoom level do you want to go to the camera room yeah okay james he's curious do you use iphone or android oh two to zero two zeros steve jobs wrapped around the studio is tons of office space multiple floors you'll just see like these are some people planning our next video is that room called boobs i didn't do it all right so this is the camera room yes some videos we use 100 cameras some videos we use 10 some we need to be able to zoom in 100x something we need a hundred vlog cameras for hide and seek there's a lot of weird things in here you want to summon tariq by some of them you're summoning them hey what's up this transition is going to suck this is tariq he's had a camera hello he's going to show us what's going on here i've never seen so much camera gear in my entire life we have 26 fs5s these are the time-lapse cameras that you guys see so every time you see a time-lapse shot this camera is usually hanging somewhere on set capturing it okay what just to give you guys an idea the fs5 was a six thousand dollar camera when it was launched in 2015. these guys have 26 of them five kids 26. let's do the math yeah the total is a lot and then you've got loads of the same lens so the way it works is every single camera lens has a focal length which basically just indicates how zoomed in it is our videos relative to these are very homegrown we film most of them in my bedroom the widest angle we have is like 24 mil and the most telescopic one we have is like a 55mm but these guys when they go wide they go wide this is a 10 millimeter lens which is used to capture the entirety of a massive video set in one shot and then when they want to get close-ups from further away they have a lens here capable of not 50 millimeters or 80 millimeters but 300 millimeters this is a telescope but there's three more key cameras that the mysteries team uses the first being the sony 4k camcorder so we usually use these for run and gun videos slash when we have a lot of night time shots and that's because it has not just actual night vision but also just insane optical image stabilization look how much the lens moves on the inside and then to top it all off there's about 50 gopro cameras in these boxes here and another 50 of what are effectively super high-end security cameras each capable of streaming a live view of their feed so that people in that control center can keep an eye on the video contestants in real time oh and also they have 20 times optical zoom and then the pista resistance this is an fvv drone that looks like you've made it we have an fpv pilot you build this you built it yeah it's actually wild that's something that someone has built themselves is a big part of your filming gear i'm putting you on the spot here all right can you guess the total value of tech in this room i'm about to be so wrong 1.3 million sweet it's been great thank you so much man oh and thank god i'm back tariq sucks i won't leave again i kind of missed you jimmy oh my gosh we're missing a lot of our play buttons we do our videos in tons of languages this is just our english channels this is mr b6 000 so what point did you change it in between 100k and a million apparently but anyways this is missing a lot don't look at it it's ugly do you have iphone or android i don't know which one i have android are you using oh wait so that's one for android one for android you use iphone well i guess a point for both it's 2022 and if you're still buying white boards you are an idiot there's a thing called whiteboard paint you can just draw wherever it doesn't matter it comes off so for us any note that we make we make it a thing to keep it digital you want to keep it online so that anyone can kind of log in and check it do you guys not care about that no no we're wall drawers i grab a water no he took it anyways this is an enormous screen when we got this place someone was like yeah we got free tvs and that was all i was told i don't even shout out to sony get your marketing budget on this it turns out jimmy's free tvs that you find all around this building they're actually sony's new 85-inch 8k hdr smart tvs and they're being used to watch 1080p content fantastic very comfortable that's an ipad holder yeah but does anyone actually use this you tell me and while he's getting comfortable we're going to continue the tour we don't need them what is this for like in the middle of a meeting is someone just going to be like sorry guys hey we're doing a tour i don't mind wait it's too comfortable no no it doesn't what i can't get in were you struggling to get inside that room all you gotta do is just that it picks up the bluetooth on my phone and it recognizes it's me so i can unlock the door so yeah this is my little apartment this is where i live for the most part so you actually sleep in your office of course this is my bed looks like my girlfriend left me a message yes if you want to sleep in my bed i won't stop you okay this is nice okay so in jimmy's fridge yogurt and water what we're potentially launching our own sauce at cheeseburger blur what's on it so they don't get the ingredients the only thing you have to eat them with is yogurt the worst part of my tiny apartment is uh the fridge blocks the tv i'm running out of room i missed that this is an enormous screen but it's above the couch so i don't use it these are all my clothes over here bathroom talk oh really even my bathroom's not off limits bro really we're about to just film the bathroom together so this is a heated toilet seat i'm telling you it will change your life get a heated toilet seat it will make your butt feel great josh yeah he's getting b-roll with my toilet this is kind of my morning routine i get out of bed i walk over here work out and i walk over here i shower and i walk over here i change and i walk over here and i eat it's like a little morning circuit and then i walk out there and i work and right over here is one of the cool rooms we also have a gaming channel and a react channel which we film in here iphone or android on three hold up what phone you use okay it's three well you have two why they're both iphones let's go nevermind good anyways we're actually here to show them the react set so come on in over here so this is where we film all our reacts videos let's react to some tech content let's see it you got to see the best tech video of all time is this like 360 camera wait josh what's going on here we go to video two no it just looks like it was rendered weird was this supposed to happen what is going on is that your cat's bum that's milo nice to meet you milo's butthole oh i know this video this is one of my favorite visions of the future these calendars here oh my gosh you can walk up to it like that so it knows what part of the room you are i love this idea this digital overlay on the real world i do too honestly i'm kind of pissed off we don't already have this could you see yourself using like all this kind of stuff 100 i mean i don't know how to ride a bike so not this i'm just thinking about like pokemon go too oh all right now we're on to our next clip with tesla there's no elon i'm disliking this is some very brave piloting yeah oh my gosh isn't it a tesla the safest car ever made in history remember it survived a crash test and actually broke the crash test dummy do you see teslas as like an art form i just like obviously that they don't run on fossil fuels faster than other cars it has more like amenities but i don't really use any of that the biggest pull to me for tesla is the interior like you sit down you feel like you're being of course if you're a car guy i'm just not who's this guy oh this i need yeah that looks very cool you like sushi right i do no screw this frick roll i don't care that was actually genius i'm calling someone to order them i know you were trying to prank us but i don't care wait i'm buying them hey i need some uh auto stick chopsticks love you you don't probably get much experience with android vents never this is the xiaomi 12s ultra one of its big selling points is the fact that it has the biggest camera sensor and a phone wow this is cool yeah this is crazy love it yeah the coloring's good look at that tell me that doesn't look like a wallpaper i can't say it's better but i can tell you it's how it works it's an interesting take because normally iphone users just kind of shut down android phones and for coming out to beast react studio you get a giant lot of money here you go thanks for coming out all right let's continue the tour android or iphone yes two more android points i hate you guys and this room over here i think you guys will enjoy so it's top secret but i'll let you in right in the back corner of the building of all the rooms in the building i feel like you would appreciate this the most all right so this is the mrb server room the way these guys have set it up is that all the projects that they're ever working on are stored right here on site in this server which means that every single computer in this entire complex is accessing the same set of files at the same time but the cherry on top is that it's configured so that even if you're sitting on the other side of the world you can actually remotely log in and access the editing machines here to use them to edit footage that's stored right here in this server so how much storage would you say you have in this room infinite what do you think the total cost of this room is 400 grand do you use android or iphone you play chess i do play chess on a game of chess now over the few days that i spent with jimmy the one key thing that i've learned about this guy is he takes board games seriously he absolutely came to me in a game of katan the night before chess was my way of making sure i won one back oh my god that was a girl game all right so this is the editing room and i had two things that i wanted to find out here one how fast is mr beast internet oh i see you know what i mean yeah what what upload this you know with footage finding stuff and two if these guys have any special gear to edit with yeah they kind of do the editors who prefer windows they'll be choosing 19 000 hp workstations with 24 core server grade processors and 256 gigabytes of ram and for those who prefer mac a pretty equivalent expect one thousand dollar mac pro wait that's how much they cost yeah feels like we've been in a lot of rooms but this is only part of it there's so many rooms in this building and it's so massive that's what i love about it i feel like i'm getting my steps in and over here is the little kitchen there's festival bars over here you should be eating this it's a very colorful selection of beverages you've never seen unicorn magic honeydew soda it was in there because it was a punishment for a video we don't obviously drink this it's actually really nice yeah so much sugar that i'm literally tearing up so i have an editing question for you actually you've got the most ridiculous camera gear available to you you've got 300 cameras in some videos you just upgraded your cameras actually to new ones that can shoot 8k resolution which i never will because i think it looks too professional yeah so this is the question why is it that after all that you still export in 1080p i don't like the way high quality footage looks you know at the end of the day it's just me and the boys messing around you know we still come up with the videos it's still things that i find fun and i enjoy and i don't ever want things to feel too produced why do you do 8k we do 4k to some extent in the tech genre there's like an expectation that you have good production value of course if i can't take good footage who am i to judge other phones for how good they listen 4k this is in 4k okay but there's a twist here you've come here thinking that jimmy has just one studio he actually has two we've just seen what they call studio c okay and this is studio a this is where it all began this is also where i've heard a lot of mystery secrets are and this is walt hi i'm walt i'm the head of on-site production for mr b's gaming and mr beast reacts there's a whole bunch of lights here yep what lights does mr beast use for his videos they're called sky panels every single one is a seven thousand dollar fixture i'm capable of lighting an entire warehouse on its own honestly that's like at least 10 12 kilos probably [Laughter] now because studio c is becoming the main office that everyone works out of studio a is the one where you find the most exotic items i'm talking like a mini drivable lamborghini giant fake marshmallows from when they tried to recreate willy wonka's chocolate factory and then tubs upon tubs of costumes that they used in their recreation of the squid games so this is the gaming trailer oh yeah iphone or android i am iphone i got a 12 pro max this cabin which is a part of studio a is where the entirety of the mr beast gaming channel is filmed and it's kind of nerd paradise the shelves upon shelves of wonderful and questionable tech items there's a real ice cream machine and there's nerf guns everywhere but then we go deeper inside so this is the office where i kind of currently work out of is this what i think it is yeah it was the retro future the custom made original game boy wow the logo the sesame seeds the pink power button you can change the color on the screen it has that authentic that is wild you can't beat it weirdly that's one of the coolest pieces of tech i've seen so far here we have jimmy's gaming room the main idea with these setups is that they could sit down and then be good to go filming within a minute or two i'm gonna sit down and i'm gonna rate mr b's gaming setup oh good choice of chair you can tell that the entire setup here is just geared around efficiency they've got it to the point that with one tap of this button here all lights can be turned on and off and with the top of this button all the relevant programs that they need to film one of these gaming videos they are loaded and ready in one go including the software to be able to see your own camera view in real time the mouse is really smooth this is the most responsive windows experience i've ever had the keyboard is a membrane keyboard which is normally considered like a tier below but you've done that for noise really yeah intentionally and so given that it's actually actually really nice to type on it doesn't feel bad the keys have nice travel he's done a definite solid with this controller this is my favorite looking xbox controller ever the chrome outlines around each button are nice this is a very good choice of mic and if you're wondering what the pc is that mr beast uses for gaming with an i9 11 900k 32 gigs of ram and an rtx 3090 graphics card hooked up to a 4k 120hz monitor this whole setup would be around 15 000 but that's not the crazy part because there isn't just one of them the entire room has actually been almost 100 cloned four times one for each of the characters in jimmy's videos chandler carl and chris they all have slightly different chairs and keyboards based on their preferences but the core machines behind it are one-to-one so this is the storage worker this is the storage of our house i've been told this is the weirdest place yes you need giant 40-inch touchscreen iphones got those yeah so as you can tell i'm very heavily on to team iphone so this giant iphone it's essentially a real iphone 6s that's casting its screen to an apple tv box screwed into the back that's hooked up to a large tv screen it sounds ridiculous but it works this is wild this is like the one part of it that i i wouldn't have thought actually works yeah i could take a portrait mode all right let's do that yeah i got it i got you i got you there we go there you go left my mark this storage center is just rammed with all the stuff that's been used in past videos that might need to be used in future videos literally anything you can think of tiki torches rubber chickens an even bigger nano leaf light collection then we have even a box full of shockingly realistic babies don't ask me why it's here pretty much all the expensive stuff lies within here as far as like phones to give away it's always apple i think you're just broken i'll scare you a little bit i'm sorry and to wrap up the studio tour i wanted to show him something cool so walk with me boys oh there's a plant there we're doing a video where i put a guy inside of this red circle see that outline around the house and if he survives in there for 100 days straight he wins half a million dollars okay so we've seen studio c we've seen studio a we've seen whatever this is we've got the full price of all the tech inside what is the actual cost of the buildings themselves oh boy the big studio over there was a little over 10 million dollars the old one actually was a church that we renovated that was like probably 1.3 million so okay 11.3 million dollars in buildings yeah everything i don't even want to know the total you know what i just make the best videos possible and sometimes i have to spend money and if you enjoyed this video then a sub to the channel would be he told me to say beastly you might have noticed over the last few months that the entire way that i'm trying to make my videos is changing the way i spend much more time moving between locations and being out and about the way i'm trying to get more interactions with youtube friends and members of the public and how i'm trying to have a clear golden moment in every video a culmination of everything that rewards you the viewer for clicking a lot of this stuff has come from the storytelling through film course that i found on skillshare by a guy called thomas de gea and the thing that really struck me about this is
