- I will be donating
$100,000 to streamers, but they're gonna have to earn it. I represent Twitch,
Chris represents Mixer. - Yay, Mixer, cool. - We will present a challenge. Whoever completes the challenge
first, wins the money. And as the video progresses, the challenges will be for more money. Towards the end, they're
literally competing for $20,000. Chris, you have your person, correct? - [Chris] Yes. - I have my person. First one to kill a creeper wins $1,000. $100, please kill a creeper ASAP. - You should kill a creeper, please. Oh my goodness. - Don't worry, I'll get the job done. Oh! Get that!
- Oh, he found one. - Oh, he got a creeper!
- He found one! - I'm stuck in the wall! Does that count? - Did your guy kill it?
- It's dead. Yes! - Wait, my guy the creeper exploded. Does that count?
- No, that doesn't count. That's a creeper killing itself. - Jericho, if you could've... no. I'm gonna let Jericho know he lost. Sorry, mate. The creeper killed itself. - No. See chat, I knew it. What hurts the most is being so close. - They were. They were so, so close. Gg. You got to the creeper first. - Yo, MrBeast droppin' 1000, what? No way. That's insane. - We gotta hit 'em with a good one. How about first one to say the word the? - Okay.
- Starting in three, two, one. First one to say the wins. - Excuse the horrible pun. Shall we go get some splash pot of healing and then we can move the rain dog. - The. He said it.
- We still have another villager to move, guys. - He said "The rain." - You donate $100 to your
guy and let him know he lost. I'll donate to my guy. - There was a competition between you and a Twitch streamer to
say the word the first. You lost. - What is that? Hold up. I know my Bobs are good, ♪ Bob the builder ♪ but they ain't that good. I'm callin' hacks. He doesn't believe it's me. It's real. I am MrBeast. - Whoa. What the heck is goin' on there? You said the first. - You did. You said it first. - That's absolutely nuts. Thanks, man. - No prob. First one to
count to 100 wins $2,000. You ready Chris? - That's so creepy.
- Three, two, one, go. Okay, mine just sent. Oh boy. - No, don't wait. Just go. Count. - Oh, MrBeast. Count to 100, please don't skip a number. Well, if that's what
you want then I'm sorry, but that's not gonna happen. - My guy's not going. He
doesn't believe it's real. - My girl doesn't wanna count. - Start counting! He's goin'.
- One, two, three, four, five, what-
- Keep going. Keep going. - I feel defeated. - 30, 40. - Chris, it's not a race. - 61, 62, 63, 64. - Chris, did you win yet? - 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.
- I won, yeah boy! Send this man money right now. - He won $2,000. - Here it comes, boys. - [Donation] You counted to 100 first, which was easy because my
person didn't even count. So good job winning, even
though it was handed to you. - There was a lot of salt in
that, Jimmy, are you salty? - I'm just slightly. - Oh, he's goin' mental, bruh. I think the game play on this
streamer is very magnificent. (Jake laughing)
What do you think? - Yes. - Also, Maddy, just skip a minute. Do you approve of this as streamer? - Stop. - Okay.
- I'm going back to Mixer where it's safer. - I think our next challenge
should be a math problem. First one to answer it, wins. - Alright. ♪ Love she wanted you to wait ♪ - Jimmy, I need you to
pull this up right now. ♪ She had 9 10 pants and a very big bum ♪ - What is this? - Dude, Mixer's awesome. - What is 2 x 8 x 2 x 8? It is 256. Alright, and now. - Wait. Wait. Is that the real MrBeast? - It is. Answer the question. - Look at the donation, man. Mine's not showin' up. Yeah, my guy hasn't even seen it yet, so. - 256! - Oh, Chris, she won. (upbeat victorious music) - [Donation] Gg. Chris sucks. - How does that make you feel, Chris? - That makes me hurt. - Alright, Chris, do you
have your next contestant? - I do have my next contestant. - I have my next contestant. And now they will be competing for $4,000. First one to blink 20 times wins $4,000. Let's begin in three, two, one, go. One. Two. What if? Three. What if
he blinks when I blink? - Whatever. - Five.
- Anyway. - One. Two. Three. Four. - Six. Blink! - You got this.
(intense music) - My dude doesn't blink. So my guy just lost $4,000 'cause he... Awe, I feel bad for him. How 'bout I donate $1000 and say sorry? Wait, hold up he's freakin' out.
- What? - [Girl] Did you just get donated $50? (Jimmy laughing)
- 1000. - She said, "Did you get donated $50?" - [Girl] There's no way. - From MrBeast. I'm actually
scared this is not real. - It is. Alright Chris,
we have your winner here. Good job blinking. (donation screaming)
Whoa, what was that? - Oh my goodness.
- What? - Dude, he only has a heart
and half. He might die. - I thought I was gonna
have to stop streaming and get a different job. We were gonna talk about budget today. - Budget.
- Then I found out that my dad has skin cancer. - Oh wow.
- Someone tell me that's real. - It is real. - Dude, MrBeast, thank you so much, man. I knew you were comin' over to Mixer, but I didn't think I
was anybody important. - You're very important. - You're very important to all of us. - Let's get some hugs,
man. Hugs for MrBeast. - Alright, everybody
makes sure we hear this very important thing.
(donation screaming) - Oh God. Download Raid: Shadow
Legends using MrBeast's link. - Chris, do you have a streamer? - I have a streamer. - I have four streamers. Whoever wins this next

be? I'll let you pick. - First person to touch their nose. - Sure. I have four
people, so that'll be easy. - Go. Oh, he's scratchin'
his, he scratched his face. - This guy's touching his
face. No nose scratches. He's close, he's touching the 'stache. - Touch your nose. Yes! He did it! He did it!
- He did it? - Yeah! - Let me let Barstool know they lost. - [Donation] You lost, frowny face. - Barstool, you may have lost, but I still give you permission to react to any of my videos. - He wins $8,000 for touching his nose. - Your nose must have been super itchy. - What the heck was that? Oh my God. I'm on the verge of tears right now. That'll help me move. Pay off my car. Oh my God. Thank you so much. - I just took my sunglasses off. It's about to get serious. We're entering the over
$10,000 donation range. Chris, do you have a streamer? - I do. - I have a streamer. This is my editor. This time we're gonna put
'em on a level playing field. First to get a kill in
Apex Legends gets $10,000. Give me a countdown. - Three, two, one, go. - Get a kill. Hurry. Wait. Oh, he's about to get a kill. He's already about to get
a kill, it just started. - Oh man. - Oh. Oh. Oh, no. No!
- Oh my gosh, Dustin! - Ethan's gonna be so
sad. Till you call Ethan. - [Ethan] Hello? - Ethan, get a kill quick. - [Ethan] Well, I'm trying. - Just quit the game and start a new one. You're goin' against a Mixer streamer. - Alright, I'm in a game! I'm in a game. I don't know what I'm winning, but. - At least three sandwiches. He's gonna be so angry, dude.
I can already hear Ethan. - If he doesn't win. - Yeah. It's gonna be bad. Ethan's gonna hate me so much. My guy's playing very
conservative right now. - Oh, oh, Ethan found someone. Oh, oh, oh, oh. - Oh, my guy just spotted somebody. And he's goin' for the kill. - Oh, alright. Ethan did like 100 damage. - Got him.
- Oh. - Get him. Die. - Oh, aye.
- I just got a kill! - He got it. - He killed him?
- He got it. - Yes, Ethan. I mean, oh, darn. Darn Mixer streamers. - Ethan got it. - I told him he was gettin' sandwiches. - Did you say 10,000 sandwiches? - No, I told him he was gettin' four bacon and cheese sandwiches. - Here are your bacon and
cheese sandwiches, for a year. More like a decade. It's
about to go through. - Okay.
- Oh boy. - [Donation] Here are your
bacon and cheese sandwiches, for a year. (Jimmy laughing) - What? - Chris, we mighta killed him. - I feel terrible for the
other person now, though. - Chris, give him the other person so he can donate to other person. Awe. Ethan's bein' all heartfelt. - This is the guy. Tips are appreciated. How 'bout we donate to this guy, - Whoa.
- Whoa. - 200 bucks. (both laughing) - I was like, wow, $2,000. And
then he takes the zero off. I was like, okay, that's more expected. Chris, for this next round we each need to pick a Raid:
Shadow Legends streamer, okay? - Okay. - I just found mine. Grab yours. - Jimmy.
- Yeah? - You're not gonna like this. - Uh huh. - There are zero people
currently streaming Raid: Shadow Legends on Mixer. Which means my guy won. (loud upbeat music)
- What the heck? - [Donation] Since you're
playing the best game ever, - Oh my god.
- here ya go, mate. - Thank you guys so much. Jesus. Well, that's gonna take
care of some bills. How in the world did you
guys find my channel? - We just searched the best game ever. Yeah, I'm gonna raid him as well. - 9,009-
- Do it. - He currently has eight viewers. Just wanted to point that out. - Oh, he doesn't have mods. Rip. Rip. You just ended this
man's streaming career. Oh no.
- Look at his chat. Look at it.
- Have you deleted the tweet? You might need to if you haven't already. - He has 2000 viewers, I'm
gonna delete the tweet. That's the MrBeast touch. (sad music) So Chris, since $20,000 is on the line I'm gonna pick a really small streamer. - Let's see, MrBeast says,
"Can you turn off the music?" That'll be a negative, sir. Hey, can someone ban MrBeast real quick? - I asked this guy to turn off the music. He said, "Can somebody ban MrBeast?" - Oof. So my guy wins by default? - We're just gonna not give him $20,000. - I've got a perfect streamer right here who's ready to get $20,000. - Let me find someone else
who does not try to ban me. Alright, we're not
having good luck, Chris. - Yay.
- Oh, wait. I checked back in on the guy
- I guess he's gone now, huh? - and he turned it off. - It would seem I've made
a mistake. Come back. - This is for $20,000. The first one to drink water, because staying hydrated is important. - He has a cup of water beside him, so I'm actually okay with that. - Drink some water IRL, please. - Notice my chat. Drink water. Come on, man. - I'll do what he says. (water splashing) - He drank water! He drank some water! - No. I quit. I quit. I'm done. - Chris, come on in here. Let's do it. Water contest for 20k. - What?
- Is it too. Whoa, it went through instantly. - No.
(Jimmy laughing) That's not. No. No, I don't. I'm gonna disagree. That's not real. - It is real. - No. - Yes. - That's not real. - It is real. - That's not real. - It is real. - No. - Yes.
- How do I know that- - Let me follow him on Twitter. I bet he's happy he
didn't actually ban me. - You followed me on
Twitter? You shut the! Oh my God. Oh my God. Mom, I'm movin' out! It's done. I'm movin' out! - Mom! I'm movin' out.
- I'm movin' out! - Let's ask him what he's
gonna buy with the 20 grand. She didn't join.
- What? - What? What am I gonna
buy with the $20,000? Buy MrBeast apparel. That is what you do.
- Yes. - You go here and you
get everything on here. That is what you do. Thank you so much. - Now that the competition's over, we still have $40,000 left, so we're gonna visit Ninja and
some other Mixer streamers. Hey dad. I see you found a new home. - Oh my. And the 3000 ember? That's not the real one. - I sent to him a DM. I said, "It's me." - Dude, okay, so apparently
it is actually MrBeast. Okay, I have undeleted the ban. (both laughing) We got a $1,000 dono from MrBeast. You can use this in the video, Ninja didn't believe it was me! I'm sorry that I didn't
believe it wasn't you. (sirens wailing)
(gun shooting) - Oh.
(Jimmy laughing) - Oh gosh.
- That killed her. - You did a good job with that arrest. (sirens wailing) - MrBeast, thank you, you have no I... Dude, I've only got like 30%
of my heart function left. We're really temptin' fate with me. - This is one of Chandler's
first times donating. - I'm very new to this. - What do you feel?
- Let's do 5. - Thousand?
- Yeah. - [Donation] Chandler had your back, bro. (intense music) - Look at his face. Dude, the beat just dropped
too, just as he got the dono. - Yeah, 'cause it's his donation alert. - Oh. (Chandler laughing) - Oh my God, are you kidding? - No, we're not. - No way. - If he cries, he gets another five. - Oh my God, thank you so much, man. I was talking about you
the other day, I was saying that I really respect everything
you do on your channel because you do a lot of stuff for people who are a lot less
- You know what that means? He's subscribed.
- fortunate than you. So thank you so much, man That's crazy, man.
- Oh, we gotta give it to him. He wiped it. He wiped it.
- That's a lot of money, dude. - [Man] Bro, that's 6,000
bucks you can spend on V-bucks. - Oh. God. Charge back. Charge back. - [Man] Oh my god. ♪
Make the ground shake ♪ (gun firing) - MrBeast, thank you
so much for the $5,000. I'm trying not to cry because - Oh. - then it's just weird for everybody, and then everybody's-
- Wait, so he didn't cry. - He teared up. What's the
specifications of crying? - Crying is sweating from the eyes. - Well then, I guess he cried. - Did he sweat? Or did he cry? He was crying his sweat. Oh gosh. Chris, come back. Chandler doesn't know the difference between crying and sweating from the eyes. You wanna just switch with him? - I don't understand what's goin' on. - Okay.
- Well I'm gonna go sweat in the bathroom. Okay?
- Okay. - By myself.
- That's called peeing. - Oh my-
- How much you give him to make him sweat? - Chandler went a little
crazy and gave him $11,000. Yeah. Why do my friends keep leaving me? (donation chiming) - Awe. Oh wait, I remember you. Hi.
- Hi. - Straight up, I actually remember you. I remember you were in my
stream a long time ago, and now you're back. What do you want me to do?
You want me to blink my eyes? (blinks boinging) I got you. I will blink my eyes for you. - [Jimmy] And I still have $15,000 left, so I decided to put a
bounty on Techno's head. He's one of the best Minecraft
players in the world, and he's currently competing
in Minecraft Monday with lots of other YouTubers, and the first one to kill him got $15,000. - [Mich] He's tryin' to heal.
- Get him, we got to kill him. - [Mitch] Go Jerome,
go. Don't let him heal. - [Techno] Two, three hearts. No. - Don't let him heal!
- We got him! - Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh my god! 7 1/2 Gs. - The sweats.
