okay there we go here we go ow this is that time of year where you shock everything metal that you touch in here all right what's up mkbhd here just wanted to talk just me and you for a real quick minute what's up so there's a bunch of things that have been evolving in the background that you haven't seen that have been completed right around now so i wanted to share them with you a lot of these things when they're an announcement they end up as a tweet so if you're not following me on twitter already a lot of these things end up there first but here we are this kind of feels like a little new year's update video basically because we always have we know the second half of the year in this tech world is product focused there's so many things that come out i mean you guys know about tectober but we're always so in the thick of it about covering and sharing all this new stuff that's coming out and figuring out if it's any good and then we get to january and then we get ces and then there's kind of like a little bit of a little bit of a chill period now there are still some products here and there but this is definitely uh january and now february is more of a chance to sort of refresh things a little bit and that's actually something i enjoy like just as much as the rest of the videos because if you don't change things up a little bit if you don't stay on your toes a little you might find yourself in cruise control so we'll be doing exactly that you guys have seen the new intro also new channel banner for 2022 fresh new graphics absolute fire just freshening things up you know i'll always have a place in my heart for all of the previous years graphics and and banners but if we're not moving forward we're standing still so we're getting better the studio channel is going strong and we're trying all kinds of new things over there behind the scenes looks tutorials mini reviews even shorts and now also that channel has a new banner too by the way so if you aren't subscribed to the studio you're missing out there's so much good stuff but speaking of new there's some even bigger new stuff that i lowkey wanted to i kind of want to launch everything like right around new year's but some of it took a little longer because we wanted to get it just right and so we've gotten to that point now so it's february 1st as i record this but there's some good stuff so number one new channel i have officially launched an mkbhd shorts channel for the hashtag shorts link is below there's already two shorts there as of right now with many more to come and so now normally launching a new channel i'd be like alright go over there right now and subscribe but i'm not gonna say that i'm not gonna do that only go over there to that link to that shorts channel if you really want to see i really like tic tocs and shorts and that's probably like sacrilegious to say in the cinematography communities and you know i although 30fps for life so maybe i'm not in all of those communities but there's just something different it's obviously a very different format but it's a different challenge to package information in that way and to make a really good short like i i can make a video an mkbhd video but the new challenge of making a good what is an mkbhd short that's actually really fun for me so it's still tech related it's still high quality but i wanted to give you the modularity basically to be able to subscribe also to shorts if you want to or not subscribe if you don't want to see them so instead of putting them all in one place you can decide if you're interested in shorts and subscribe there if you want i'm not ruling out the possibility of posting occasional shorts on this channel i haven't done it yet but you know i might as well it's fun to play with but that's the idea is to give you that ability to subscribe to exactly what you want to like that's why we have a separate channel for the waveform podcast and a separate channel for the studio now if you want mkbhd shorts you know exactly where to go plus it's got a pretty sweet new banner too so why not and then another brand new thing brand new website oh yeah mkbhd.com used to be uh pretty embarrassing if i'm being honest probably the only way you can actually see what it used to be is if you're on like a archive or something like that but the new site is everything i wanted we took the extra time and now mkbhd.com is a beautiful functional secure dope site as a hub for all things here it is mobile friendly of course as you'd expect and as a bonus we created two entirely unique websites that you can flip between with the flick of a switch because there is a dark mode toggle so there's a dark mode version of the entire website and that site of course is where you'll find the new merch and we've refreshed the entire mkbhd merch store that's where you'll find all this stuff and by the way we're graduating from more than just apparel so we've got the whole checkout process streamlined it's entirely contained on mkbhd.com but it's going to be more than just like clothes stuff so we still got the soft shirts and the long sleeves and the hoodie and the windbreaker that's all great also now we've got hats we've got five panel hats and beanies for the winter months and then some actual products so the desk matt mousepad we've been teasing a few times is actually incredible i love this thing and then there's also a matte black woodwick candle that is a new studio scent i don't know if you've ever made your own candle before but the process for making your own candle is quite fascinating and you end up obviously designing the outside but also it smells like a studio full of new gadgets and that's kind of awesome that we actually managed to make that happen so we have a candle so there's that and there's even more coming soon i'll keep you guys posted on when the new stuff drops i'll tweet that of course too but i think this is the best drop we've ever had and it's the most complete store we've ever offered and it is the best way to support the channel directly i think probably one of the biggest misconceptions about running a channel in general is that it's easy and it you know it can still be easy to make super simple basic videos it started off easy but if you have ambitions to do better things or to do more which many do it's not easy and that's exactly why we're hiring so that's sort of the last mini announcement is that i've updated the application that's on the site to join the team at the studio that's response it's a slowly growing creative team but it's responsible for all of the stuff that you see on all these channels and on the site and in the store and on the separate projects we're also working on that you'll see coming soon that is happening so a couple of positions that i know i'm definitely looking for right now are an assistant waveform producer for the podcast um ad sales and an editor so after 13 years of editing all these videos you know maybe there's some room for growth there too but basically anytime there's updates to that for what positions i'm hiring for at the studio you can always just click the apply link and you can see that right there and if you ever want to apply that'll always be there and then last thing i'm going to be doing i'm going to be trying some live stuff some like live chats directly with you guys maybe q a type stuff um and i'm running it as a trial with people who are members of this channel so you've had that like join button down below and many people have generously been members of the channel supporting and all they've really gotten is like a little badge next to their name i appreciate y'all but we're gonna have uh yeah i'm gonna do some members live streams and just do some chats and q and a's and games and stuff like that and see what that's about on this channel as well so while we're at announcements just one more quick one for you um and that's that's pretty much gonna do it new graphics new channels new website new dark mode theme new merch new people it's all coming together i love this time of year that's been it back to your regular schedule programming see you later peace
