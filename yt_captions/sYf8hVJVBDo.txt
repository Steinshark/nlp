ladies and gentlemen in this video I would like to apologize to none other than Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura for yesterday's pro-chess League match between the Gotham Knights and the California unicorns the protest league is a four versus four online format where your average team rating has to be 2500 you have grand Masters you have some strong Junior players as well and it was a ridiculous match that we played against California two very very quick announcements the first one is absolutely massive we just launched the first ever merge drop on my channel and it's for the Gotham Knights of the pro chess league go to gothammerch.com also link is in the description uh beautiful hoodie in my opinion I love the letters the back is this night you also can get it in white and black and we also have some nice very minimalist t-shirts for you I honestly think this looks awesome shout out to a fourth wall working closely with us there uh yeah just really high quality I so you can support support the team managers players and and so on um by uh by by checking that out and uh yeah rooting for Gotham and a friendly reminder that if the Gotham Knights win in the protest League we do a giveaway on Chesley so we're gonna go through the recap maybe there won't be a giveaway this week uh maybe there will and the only thing you need to do for the giveaway is have a Chesley account also link is in the description literally just sign up if you win we'll let you know um let's begin Hikaru begins his campaign uh for the Gotham Knights by playing the board for Zoe Tang uh young player from the US she might be 16 or 17 and she's like 22 2300 uh fide Hikaru plays an opening known as the Czech benoni not to be confused with the Polish benoni not to be confused with the Hungarian benoni the Czech benoni and it's a very offbeat system that frankly if you look at stockfish stockfish does not bless it stockfish is like it's plus 1.6 what is this guy doing kick him out out of the league he doesn't but like stockfish isn't playing the game and the thing is these sort of offbeat weapons they take strong young players out of their comfort zone and uh when they're taken out of their comfort zone they have to kind of play structure they have to play positional chess and Zoe makes a very Zoe's name is not officially Eternal Knight eight it doesn't say that on her driver's license um so the idea here for Hikaru is to trade off this bishop it's a very odd and exotic idea and the point is that after this exchange there is this massive hole on E5 and really only two pieces in the white position uh can fight for that square this night and this night these are the only two pieces I mean the light the light squared Bishop for white is not going to fight for it and the Rooks are also not going to fight for it because there's no way to take so Hikaru just goes to G4 and voluntarily gives up his Bishop why because this is just the Big Pawn that Bishop is not scaring anybody in fact that Bishop literally looks like a pawn just standing in that chain and now the Knight goes to D7 the other night goes there and look at that I mean how do you get rid of that Knight you don't and look at hikaru's time he spent no he spent no time it's so hard to play these top guys because they can play an offbeat opening against you and stockfish might laugh at it but I mean ain't nobody gonna be laughing you know listen the Gotham Knights right the Gotham Knights two nights on a black hoodie with a pink fire night on the back gothammerch.com you know how it is King B1 long castle and Hikaru has to now choose how he's going to win the game which is literally how it works when you're that at that level it's not about when you're gonna it's not about if you're gonna win it's when you're gonna win he avoids a queen trade he pressures on the file and then uh he plays B5 and this is kind of the beginning of the end he he castled long but he walked his King to the corner it's very rare you see same side long Castle attacks usually it's King side Queen side or it's both on the king side nope take take and uh yeah it's bad to worse and it's just an avalanche I mean it's just the white king is now in a cage Queen C5 and uh and he he ends up putting both Rooks and Rook takes A2 is a dagger because you sacked the rook and you play Queen A5 and uh the white king can't escape Queen A3 Queen A3 so so we resigned Hikaru won the game uh very very convincingly but it's round one I mean what are you gonna like you gotta win you gotta win round one right so he gets the job done uh the other big game of the first round was Christopher you who is definitely not from Papua New Guinea and big fish who is apparently from Samoa uh yeah this is just a matchup of two guys that are absolutely not where they are I think big fish is in Europe and Chris USA in the United States but you know anyway um this game was nuts so it was a night or of Sicilian A3 a move that I've basically never seen before E5 and now Knight F5 and now D5 and now Bishop G5 and now D4 take take and the Knight goes back to B1 what now we have take take Queen to D5 Queen H5 check and the King goes to D1 what is this this is modern chess ladies and gentlemen it's like a Salvador Dali painting just pretend you understand what it is and shut up don't ask any questions all right I don't know what's going on I have no idea what's happening D3 is a sacrifice of a pawn by fatasev who takes on G2 puts his Knight on C5 and then takes this and this and then preaches what is going on why is Chris Hughes King on D1 now I would have to I would lose this position with with black black is better but I would lose this with black because it's like I got you know it looks scary and this is under attack and Knight takes F6 is a check but it loses the game because you attacked the the the Knight and the rook and uh yeah white is lost so that's pretty cool uh so Chris you plays King E2 and feta say of long castles and I mean this game was just absolute chaos look at it look he just takes all his Pawns just walks into the white position eats all the Pawns I was looking at this like what is going on in this position and then Vladimir played in this position uh the most clutch move that he played of the entire game only one move here wins for black try to find it why just played Knight C5 threatening both mate and Knight D7 it in fact if you didn't see the eval you might think this is just actually straight up lost for black because how do you stop Queen B7 in Knight D7 well you have to stop one of them you don't necessarily have to stop both of them uh and as it turns out uh you you you have to stop mate like this because if Knight to D7 check King to A7 Knight to f8 um a few things win but actually E4 is the most convincing move and uh White just cannot defend Queen E1 white just can't defend Queen E1 and if this white just can't defend the Rook so Queen E4 King D1 and this is mate so yeah that's really really bad uh so phariseev with like a minute on the clock finds all the critical best moves infiltrates with this queen and the E4 the dagger crisscross applesauce million pins on the board and he gets the job done in the first round against Chris you so um yeah I mean uh just a very very convincing game from him by the way this week uh the knights fielded Hikaru Vladimir fetise of big fish Shield 12 AKA shamsidian vocido from uzbekistani is I think the third or fourth highest rated player in Uzbekistan and our board four uh was a player from Kazakhstan she's a medalist uh in the world youth championships from a couple years ago I actually coached at that tournament her name is ALU and nurmanova she's like 2200 feet so we had a really really good good team I think we had one of the strongest teams uh in the entire league actually and yeah alua uh despite being um 2200 I mean this is a rapid rating in the first game against Shanklin she she was fighting I mean she attacked Sam from the get-go she's a very aggressive player so uh I was I was really really confident in her ability like in this position she just had to not respect the high rate of you know uh player and just play a five she Chad and excellent in position early and you know you can get a crushing position here if black goes wrong like you can go even G4 and G5 and Knight D5 and I mean her position against Shanklin was super good I was like who's this board for we have but of course you know uh Sam did what all what all 2700s do but she was out I mean she had a great position against Sam for 25 moves it's a player who's like 600 points lower rated than him right so I was very confident early in the match uh and unfortunately she blundered Rook A4 um which loses to Rook C3 and the queen hits the rook and the Knight no longer guards the Rogue but it's life I mean what are you gonna do right you're playing a 2700 and the amazing thing about the pro chess league is how often are you gonna get to play these guys so um I was really rooting for her throughout the match as well um but listen it was close early but we started to pull away as a team in the second round uh when Hikaru played the B3 Sicilian against Christopher you and he Hikaru did what Hikaru does he gets an offbeat system all right his opponent might have a comfortable position but look at the time Hikaru up three minutes that's a lot of time that's like very meaningful percentage 40 50 of the remaining time on the clock and you know Hikaru kept attention in this game for quite a long time with Rook C1 now now Chris down to 250. Hikaru keeping that three minute time buffer and you know again the engine just like in that in that first game from the opening here in the middle game the engine's like black is better what is Hikaru doing but if you're a good Defender your opponents will make mistakes Hikaru plays H4 the engine's like what if H4 what is this guy doing Knight takes Knight takes I'm just gonna you know now it's minus 1.4 but look at look at the time you got a minute minute and 40 in this position to beat Hikaru takes Knight F5 G6 played nice move Knight D4 and now Chris had to play Queen B6 apparently instead he went here he played Bishop F6 with 50 seconds on the clock and what did he blunder he blundered Knight takes night and here he has to take the Knight he cannot go for tricks and complications you know why because his Queen needs to guard the bishop you know why because after bang bang he blundered Knight E7 check tragic 39 seconds on the clock that is why Hikaru is a beast because you can play 26 good moves and you play one bad one and the game is over he wins The Exchange and now he just has to convert brings the Rooks and just starts hunting Chris's pawns Rook B6 rugby five King goes out blocks the check Rook D7 infiltrates this Falls that falls and Hikaru wins this game with a two minute time advantage to Chris's two seconds and a losing position I mean Hikaru was just making a mockery out of the stockfish evaluations the entire match he's two for two the biggest win by far for us I would argue uh maybe the second biggest win but at the time the biggest win in the entire match came in this round as well uh as Mr Shield 12 AKA sham season played a Catalan and Shanklin played well rather Shanklin played the Catalan this is the California Board one and uh Mr Shield 12 also not his name on his passport gets a pawn and hangs on to it and Shanklin plays this Uber Ultra aggressive line of the Catalan where you just fly forward with your pawns and and after Knight D7 white just has to keep going f5d5 five like super aggro if you take I got Rook F5 on the way I got EF5 Bishop H3 and stuff like very very very aggressive line but Sam did all of this and then he started going back and shield lashed out with F5 to try to clarify the structure and Sam tried to bulldoze but the problem is now Shield has good support in the center and he finds a gorgeous and one of the most brilliant ideas I have ever seen Shield is already up one Pawn which means he is now up two pawns which means that when Sam goes here attacking the Knight trying to get it to move so he can take on D5 and crash into the position Shield says come take my knight C6 oh my God have you ever seen a brick wall of Pawns like that and I got news for you brick doesn't move very well but Shield 12 does because that Armada that spaceship of Pawns begins moving immediately look at it marching forward and shield 12 gets the bishop and then ends up getting the Rook as well and is up material C5 strips the white position of all of its Defenders Bishop D4 and the king is marooned on the edge of the board unable to return home Rook F6 on the way you can take my Rook but Rook H6 is made in one and Sam Shanklin resigned as Shield 12 delivered a a maker to the California unicorns lineup I mean this was a ridiculous game he grabbed the pawn early as one does in the Catalan and white has options to win it back all right but Sam played a G3 nimso Catalan style and just hesitated and look at that idea what an idea from Shield 12 sacrificing a piece and we went up we were up big it was a great great start for us meanwhile Hikaru was cooking and again again Hikaru was playing the board too now he's playing Ray Robson he's playing A6 I thought the idea of A6 might have been to play B5 B5 little Gambit action over here cb5 D5 I mean I could see Hikaru playing this on title Tuesday B takes A6 D4 something crazy like this but Hikaru just went for a king's Indian now folks here's the thing about Kings Indians engines hate them but in particular Ray Robson was playing in my opinion it looked like a pretty good game of chess like B5 he was doing a lot of logical stuff and he was making Hikaru defend a very very unpleasant position make no mistake Hikaru I know kikaru is doing Recaps now and in his you know recap he might say he thought the position he could still manage let me tell you something right now 99 out of 100 Grand Masters lose this game with black the one remaining is Hikaru he does not lose this game with black at least he will not lose easily notice that once again he is up three minutes on the clock why is this position so bad because black literally has zero moves literally has no moves there is one idea in this in this position for black that just doesn't lose immediately can you find it I found it during the live commentary I was actually very impressed with myself the point is that this Knight can't come back to the game if black ever plays D5 white will just go here and win on D5 if you go here I play F5 so you just can't do anything the idea is to move the Knight put the bishop here maybe even sacrifice the pawn to put the Knight on C5 that is the idea so Hikaru despite stockfish sitting there going plus two plus two plus two brings the Knight back brings the Knight back and look at Ray Robson just absolutely no regard for the black position allows Bishop D4 uh-oh he needed to respect the idea Bishop D4 and go here and you know keep the clamp and then maybe play H4 but suddenly Here Comes kikaru shredding open the position right Pawn takes Rook F4 92 and here Hikaru had to find Rook F3 Rook F3 Knight E5 hitting a lot of different stuff here I actually thought he was going to find this but I guess it's not so clear I don't know what he what he didn't like uh of course if like The Rook I don't know goes like to H3 for example Knight C4 is obviously crushing and it's a fork he must have not liked something maybe he didn't like this and he didn't like that you know maybe he's still under a bit of pressure here um but he played Rook F7 and the position was just absurd look at this Ray Robson is checkmating the black king I mean the Bishops are terrifying I would lose this position more often than not and now Queen b295 and if you take this I'm getting this you have to go here you have to go Bishop G2 apparently and after Rook F1 Rook F1 if Rook F1 the Knight maybe goes back here and there's no mate it's it's like very very tricky you can go Rook F1 I think I have to take with the bishop here I can't trade Rooks with you but Rey takes the Knight and now it's an equal end game and I got news for you not only is it equal would six seconds on the clock Ray Robson blunders a fork and he loses the game he loses the game and he loses the game in very brutal fashion as his King is forcefully checkmated in the corner of the board oh my God folks if you had the patience to make it this far in the video you can see that a couple of things have been going on you can see that Hikaru has been crushing laughing at stockfish the entire way you don't stockfish thinks my position is worse stockfish is not me he's three for three we are crushing the California unicorns it is seven and a half to four and a half we are up three games we are about to obliterate the unicorns from existence as if they even existed in the first place you're about to get a bunch of giveaways because every time that the Gotham Knights win we have Coors giveaways on Chesley except the last round of this matchup versus California was much more stressful than we intended you see our board for alunava is a beast of a chess player and she was the favorite in her matchup and she was proving that against Zoe Tang she played an aggressive King's Indian in fact she played a line that is so Alpha you literally put your Rook on F4 and sacrifice it she gave up her Rook voluntarily to open up the dark squared bishop and get a massive bind on the position white lost the right to Castle black was swarming swarming the position with Knight to B2 up three minutes on the clock completely winning all we need is one point eight and a half is the magic number seven and a half to four and a half she is dominating white is down to a minute 94. Queen F3 Bishop goes back to G7 but wait a minute suddenly what whoa whoa whoa whoa alua instead of Bishop back to G7 she had to play Bishop F5 the point is you cannot take the bishop because Knight G5 hits this and this it's very traits a little tricky here I mean like it's instead of that suddenly wait a minute wait a minute we're worse we're worse but okay white only has 30 seconds so obviously a loo is going to hold wait a minute whoa whoa oh no oh it's going from bad to worse oh no now it's like probably completely lost but it there's still some tricks okay we got the oh oh White's gonna get those pawns oh no oh white got the pawns and white has more time and in an absolutely unbelievable turn of events after being winning loses this game she loses this game as white comes forward now the pawn is Unstoppable and black resigns oh god oh dear God oh no oh no but what's gonna happen what's gonna happen in Chris's game right Chris versus Shield is it's the bat matchup of board threes it's an open Spanish here we go all right life is looking good pretty solid position Chris is you know gonna try to slowly but surely March forward kind of attack the black pawn structure we got Queen's Rooks and knights and suddenly Chris breaks into the black position and E6 G4 and uh the king is gonna whoa why is the king out there now it's still equal but it's anything but easy Queen D6 Knight G7 uh oh and if you take rookie seven but if you don't take the Knight comes back oh no oh Chris is infiltrating with his Queen and his Rooks Rook D5 and he's just winning all the pawns and he's hunting the black king and in an unbelievable turn of events we have now lost on two boards and meanwhile big fish and spicy caterpillar AKA Vladimir faresayev and spicy caterpillar are going at it they play an offbeat night off line all right now obviously fatasev knows he doesn't need to take any risk all right he can just kind of keep it chill it's a very very stable position all right Knight D5 but suddenly he goes Bishop H6 oh my God he's sacrificing his Bishop what queen C4 Queen E4 better save is just all in but Rook C2 counter-attack from from uh Ray Robson despite only having 20 seconds on the clock he's up a queen and queen C6 that's not mate because Rook G8 and Ray Robson wins the game with four seconds on the clock the point is that the Rook moves anywhere and the white king is under attack Queen all the way back to A8 the satellite Queen you got this this and Rook G3 check and that is game over because the queen is coming in oh my goodness The Rook can be taken three different ways but it can't be taken at all because it's checked from the opposite end of the board we just lost three three boards on the in the last round after absolutely dominating so who do we look to we look to the big man big man board one last round perfect score plays a slightly offbeat line in the Sicilian Defense D3 very close position against Sam Shanklin and uh Knight Knight H4 grabs that Bishop opposite side castling Sam's going for it Sam knows he has to play for a win there were a couple moments here hikara would have could have taken on C6 it looked like but Hikaru went for a locked position and he kind of went look Sam you got to beat me you got to beat me you gotta take risk Sam plays G5 because he knows that California is down he doesn't right Bishop F4 Knight E4 Knight D6 and hikaru's got the Bishops versus the knights it's a very tense position Sam is up a pawn but hikaru's got G6 and Rook C1 and Rook E1 and queen E5 and Sam makes a mistake Knight D5 looks like it's he's going for the bishop but normally when you have the two Bishops you don't want to trade them you don't want to give them away Hikaru finds take take Queen E5 attacking this and attacking this and I got news for you this falls apart these pawns are gonna go and that is exactly what happens Queen G7 Queen F7 and Hikaru just Bishop D6 hits this hits that hits that defends that we have take take take take and now white is just completely winning he's completely winning because there is nothing you can do to stop my Pawn from coming forward absolutely nothing Rook F1 give this up rook f8 surgical Precision now there are no checks because the queen covers the diagonal black plays A6 but the pawn is marching check check check check apologies I thought I thought he repeated one more time with Queen f8 now he gave the check he gave the check he took on D4 and Sam Shanklin just resigned the game here because after this he's just down two pawns two clean pawns and the game is over and we won the match eight and a half seven and a half much closer than we would have liked because we were up three games going into that final round now as it goes Hikaru actually won this game before feta safe uh went all out and fed a save uh in hindsight said you know I saw Hikaru was doing well so I went for a little bit of a sacrifice and I tried to play for win maybe the match could have been 9-7 but it was ridiculously close I mean credit to the non-existent animal the unicorns fighting all the way to The Bitter End and uh we move on we move on to 2-0 and next week we will play the Shanghai Tigers they have a stacked lineup including the current women's world champion Zhu and Jun so that's going to be very very tough uh but uh Gotham versus Shanghai we
