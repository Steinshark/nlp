i'm speaking about presenting code and let's go so this lightning talk has been inspired um by the keynote from scott myers which she did at minnesota 2014 which was about preparing material for the modern age and um also kind of you know seeing lots of talks being given at various conferences in various settings so um let's talk a bit about like you know how to present code how to uh think about things um but first you know i want to point out like where's your audience today and this has been true like prior to the pandemic that a lot of your audience will be in the recording um and have in mind that the slides are recorded separately um but also of course pay attention as andrey just said um to the audience in the room even if a lot of people will just be sitting there and reading email doing social media following your talk along but the other half will listen and be you know uh engaging with you for questions and that's if you're presenting on site this audience will be the source of the questions about your talk right so you better be engaging to them um but actually i'm talking about presenting code so um there are various forms of how you can put code on slides text is probably one of the best screenshots some people do a live demo so you're just streaming your editor and also like the the common programs used for slides are not like coming with a slide for code there's no template for it you can just there's various ways to do it and um i would like to just go quickly through them um first please remember that fonts matter um they bring readability and for code make sure it's a mono space form and of course also as your slides will go through a projection and some encoding uh things nowadays probably uh the code for your phone should not be too thin um highlighting less is in my opinion better and some people do like bold keywords and other people do other things that's like you know express yourself there feel comfortable with that at some point um also colors um your slides should have a good contrast uh stick with one theme dark or light theme for example should not be too colorful and of course please be aware about color blindness avoid for example red green text is one of the easiest things but also be aware that if your contrast is getting bad then like uh the one of the classics is like having blue texts on black background or gray background that can be in a lighting on on the stage where you present suddenly a lot less readable than it was at your screen where you wrote the slides and all of that also applies to code highlighting right um here's an example which i used a couple of years ago where i just put the code into how it was and i skipped the things which were not important with ellipses but didn't like cut out everything which makes this you know kind of showing the code which is important and then when i talk about something in my talk i highlight the part of the code which i'm talking about though people know actually what i'm doing on stage and uh that way i don't need to think around with a laser pointer another very nice way i have seen this by michael cass um at cppcon he did a way that basically most of the code is grayed out and when [Music] he continues in his talk more and more code the code he's just talking about is just the next thing coming up and then he's like this is not now what we're implementing and talks about that works very well and works fantastically in this presentation and you already can kind of see what's next and you can also like see what's in the past uh what you know has been added to the sweat prior um very nice way to do this and also um be aware and be not afraid to ask to change the lightning if the lightning runes ruins your slides please check for that always um and you see here that there is basically uh the code and then there's like comments which they or things they want to say about their code and put into little uh speaking boxes that's also very nice to do um just to to give people and what you're talking about and that's that's that's also a great innovation um but of course you know that's like also the question like what do you do when people have a question which isn't about something which is not highlighted or you want to highlight something which you didn't think about um there are for example ways to draw on a slide um but also um there are virtual laser pointers and laser quantities i think the next thing i want to talk about laser pointers are often used i've seen them there are some problems with them for starters did you see the laser pointer that's that's my my op which which i often observe when i sit in a talk and people highlight things with laser pointers i get confused okay and of course most importantly it's like one point i i didn't know aside for that but please we're online now we're talking online this is a new default think about that part of your online audience will never seen laser pointer even if like the sliders being streamed via via the camera which hopefully it does not um also what do you do with a double projection as cppcon loves double predictions and then you know you you come to a meeting c plus and in the big room we had this setup right so you're never going to be able to to or maybe you're running in the back and showing the those people too with a later point so there's alternatives there's a various methods to have a virtual laser pointer um and there's various methods to do this on screen um but it's best to prior highlight the things you want to talk about um so conclusions laser pointers are hard to see but also they're not recorded and that is then missing a lot of the audience which will see your talk actually most of the audience like 10 of your audiences in the room at best um and look into virtual laser pointers know your tool if you want to write or draw on slides uh highlight what you're talking about um and with code there's something called slide plus plus you don't have to show code which is like 100 compilable and has all the keywords that is needed to be in production uh focus on uh the code that is important for your example for your slide live demos can be great but need to be prepared which we'll see soon and of course if you want to watch the keynote that's online too and
