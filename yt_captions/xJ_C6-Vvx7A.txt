this is the most real video I've ever made and if you could watch it till the end it all makes sense and would really mean a lot to me in 2016 mister who's the boss hit 200,000 subscribers and to commemorate I made a draw my life video explaining how I got to this milestone and essentially how I was hell-bent on making it to a million subscribers what I didn't realize at the time is that I had barely scratched the surface of YouTube all the great things that were about to happen but also the dark places it would lead me up until this draw my life video after five and a half years on YouTube I'd never met a subscriber in person I'd never worked with a company I'd never flown to a different part of the world for work this was about to change very quickly as soon as I graduated University in 2017 I went for it for the first time I could say that I was a full-time youtuber all those videos I could make because of my studies all those pent up ideas there was nothing holding me back now it had so much momentum I was uploading one video every single day and very soon the channels daily subscribers turned from hundreds to thousands and company started taking notice I didn't consider myself some sort of big deal I'm a guy who makes videos on tech because that's something I love to do and so when company started flying me to Munich Barcelona China just to attend their events it really in moments felt like a dream come true I've bumped into people who've told me that I inspired them people who felt forever thankful that I helped them save money these are moments that have stayed with me and I'm so lucky and grateful to have had them so understandably it is tough to sympathize with all this and I don't want you to feel sorry for me or anything but I've not been feeling great for a while now and I'd consider myself a tough person but this is the toughest thing I've ever done back when mister who's the boss was on a hundred followers I remember having a conversation with a friend we sat down and dreamt about what it would be like to have 10,000 subscribers 10,000 people enough to fill a stadium all wanting to watch what you could do I would look at channels with this number and I'd think to myself wow this person must be so happy little did I realize that soon enough I would also be passing this momentous figure but when I did I would smile a little give myself a pat on the back and carry on that was it why couldn't I appreciate what I just achieved the problem stems from this being first matters on YouTube especially in tech nobody needs to see two of the same comparison video people rarely need a second review once they seen one good one two days late on an unboxing is the difference between a million views and a tenth effect and having some pressure can be a great thing but on YouTube for me at least it wasn't once a year or once a month it was every hour of every day this world is moving so fast and I felt like I had to keep up with it this was my job if I like every day there was a new phone or new app or a new story and I had to be first and as I started to raise my quality the pressure only mounted now that I've produced a video at this level I can't go back every video needs to be this good or better as your audience grows there are more people you don't want to disappoint and then you've got your emails piling up throughout the day deadlines looming you've got tweets comments questions to attend to these people need your help it is your duty to help them I was completely overwhelmed add to this the massive amounts of admin I had to do just to set up a company and the weight of this article 13 potentially destroying everything I've been building I didn't really know where to turn it wasn't unusual for me to work 14-hour days 7 days a week there was no distinction between morning and evening a weekday and weekend and it just felt like this continuous unending race to remain relevant against some of the most creative hardworking people on the planet and hard work is great but there's something I didn't anticipate when I made that draw my life video and when I was at university surrounded by friends YouTube is lonely whilst it's not obvious when you see a polished cut up video with upbeat background music and a smiling Erin 95% of the time I'd be on my own when I'm filming I've been on my own for the whole day prior scripting and would quite possibly be on my own for the rest of the day editing they are creators who have a healthy work-life balance but it was my never-ending determination to keep getting better that started to drive me a bit crazy I wasn't just physically alone but emotionally alone there wasn't a single person I felt like I could talk to who could actually relate to the stresses I was feeling to put it another way YouTube is a privilege job to have but can also breed an attitude that creates relentless unhappiness so I found as the channel was getting larger I was somehow an ironically becoming more busy more lonely and less happy I'd lost touch with all my friends from school most of my friends from University and by the time I'd usually finished working in the night my family was often asleep so where do you go from here there are three things I've come to realize and the reason I'm making this video is just because these three things are a stark shift from who I was in 2016 when I made the first draw my life before YouTube hit me full force and each person has their own way of living so I'm not going to say this is the key to life or anything but these ideas have massively helped me out in this uncertain world one it is good to be determined to have a goal and to be willing to work like crazy when you need to but not to always make it your life's mission to chase the next thing by telling yourself you want something you're also telling yourself that something isn't good enough as it is and this kind of attitude can leave you always wanting never settling as it did for me determination is what got this channel to where it is but at the same time it's what stopped me seeing how great things already were number two it is crucial to just try and be present a lot of the time I was working I'd be so caught up in my to-do list the minute I'd finished scripting I'd start filming the minute I finished filming I'd start editing it's anyone I'd look back at the end of the day but I'd see that I was on autopilot for the entire journey it's fine it's natural people do that but more and more I'm starting to realize how powerful it is to unplug to take a step back and to realize that just to be alive and breathing as a miracle say a video you spent an entire week working on completely flops so what say an exam you spent the last month revising for you fail it doesn't matter you still got 20 30 50 years to figure it out and number three is persistence a lot of people come to me asking for advice everything from how to start a YouTube channel to how to study for exams and the best bit of advice I can give is to just do it just make that first video just take that leap and then make it a mission to use every bit of feedback you can get to make each attempt better than the last I've done it for 8,000 videos already and I can say for sure that I'm not going to be stopping now and really that's it for the people who've just joined the channel for the people who've been there from the beginning I really appreciate it now or more than ever before so thank you I'm still learning but at the same time the progress this channel has made in the last three years is crazy and I can't wait to keep creating videos to keep making those mistakes and to keep getting better every single day I've just expanded the team for the first time ever I've just upgraded our video gear and I'm learning to approach the inevitable difficulties with a slightly healthier mindset I think 2019 is gonna be a pretty great year [Music] you
