welcome to something incredible this package from oneplus contains their brand-new one +7 Pro and let me tell you right now it is not just a step but a leap forward so in this video we're gonna be quickly unboxing it and then comparing it against the Galaxy S temp plus and I think that is also gonna surprise you first things first you've got this little red packet on top and that contains a standard silicon case for the phone because the device itself and then underneath that is where it starts to look a little different you've got a red cable USB type-c but more importantly a walk charge 30 adapter lets you charge the phone nearly 40% faster than past generations and here we have it the 1 plus 7 pro creds a fine line between being svelte and chunky it's surrounded by gracious curves and it fits well in the hand but at the same time it's 206 gram mass makes it very noticeably heavier than 175 grams 10 plus to give it credit the design is slick and I really like the slightly matte finish on the back but the curves and the camera bump together do mean that the phone has a lot of table wobble the S 10 doesn't at all the company has brought its vibration motor completely up to speed with Samsung's in this phone so you get really crisp responsive haptic feedback but the oneplus does miss out on a few key features which might be important to you it has no headphone jack no IP rating for water and dust resistance and it's also got Gorilla Glass 5 on the front as opposed to Gorilla Glass 6 on the S 10 now that in itself in theory at least makes the Samsung up to two times more resistant to breaking from a drop on the subject of hardware it is worth mentioning that Samsung gives you a dedicated button for the Bigsby virtual assistant but also that their power button is way too high up on the phone on the oneplus it is in a more reasonable position you don't have to readjust your grip every time you want to use it and the alert slider is back which gives you a more tactile way to switch between ring vibrate and silent profiles alright oneplus has always been about speed but the combination of hardware and software on the 7 Pro makes it potentially the fastest phone on the planet right now both devices go up to 12 gigabytes of RAM and a powered by the Snapdragon 855 chip or the equivalent Exynos in some regions for the Samsung the differences can though in three key ways and bow on the seven pro is one of the first flagship phones ever to use universal flash storage 3.0 which is in theory up to three times faster than the s tends to point one so almost any process that uses that drive should be faster so that's loading ups the performance of apps as well as the transfer speeds with your PC although the difference isn't as drastic as the numbers might lead you to believe I will explain this in my speedtest video soon the second advantage comes from software the phone has not just a gaming mode that optimizes RAM usage but a fanatic mode kind of like an ultra gaming mode that looks at CPU GPU and ram without any of this the oneplus 7 pro already quite convincingly beats the Galaxy S 10 Plus on antutu benchmark turning on gaming mode increases that score by another thousand and then fanatic mode another three to four hundred so in terms of peak performance that software isn't really doing much but it's more about the consistency of performance as well as the standard stuff like blocking messages and notifications the third thing is that the oneplus 7 pro has a 90 Hertz display which means the display that refreshes 90 times per second compared to 60 on the s10 and almost every other phone it's not something that my camera can even capture but to the human eye it brings a whole new level of fluidity to the UI but also just bear in mind that most third-party apps will still refresh at up to 60 times a second so it's not like your average game will just start running smoother about that display it's the best display oneplus has ever used ironically it's a Samsung component but that doesn't take away from the fact that it takes up nearly 90% of the phone's front and that's an achievement both have quad HD plus panels both have support for super high contrast HDR 10 plus content and both are curved but interestingly Samsung's curve is much sharper the oneplus screen always melts around the sides the brightness looks comparable and although the S 10 takes in saturation straight out the box if you switch the oneplus 2 ntsc and its color settings I'd say both look pretty comparable right so to achieve this full screen oneplus has had to mount the front camera on a mechanised slider which means it's always going to take just that little bit longer to switch cameras credit where do though this is one of the fastest motorized sliders and the phone uses is gyro sensors to detect if it's falling and then retracts the camera which kind of somewhat addresses that issue of the extra frigidity samsung's alternative is this punch hole in the top right to the screen which i think still beats having an arch but I also know that some people do have trouble with the asymmetry it brings to the design neither is gonna leave you worrying about battery thankfully Samsung weighs in with a four thousand one hundred million power cell and one plus with a four thousand I've got a full battery comparison coming very soon but I can say right now that if you did want to take advantage of the super smooth 90 Hertz screen on the oneplus then that will cause an additional battery hit on top of the already demanding resolution of both displays regardless oneplus absolutely slaughters the s10 plus in charging speed with its warp charge 30 tech providing up to 30 watts of power versus Samsung's 15 it can also reverse charge other phones using a cable but that doesn't change the fact that Samsung has the wireless advantage a compiler see chart as well as wirelessly reverse charge software is crucial to the whole experience and thankfully both are running Android 9 with two very different looking but nonetheless very capable skins on top with one plus you get oxygen OS which is closer to a pure Google aesthetic you know get a built-in screen recorder and an unusual option called Zen mode which basically stops you using your phone for 20 minutes with no exceptions with Samsung you get one UI which looks clean in its own way it has a better looking dark mode to save battery and has a focus on reach ability with one hand and also a are emojis which are as good as they've ever been here you can really tell that cameras were a central part of both of these flagships they each have a triple camera setup featuring one main camera one ultra wide and one telephoto so that makes this on paper comparison quite a simple one in terms of telephoto oneplus has three times magnification which as you can see here side-by-side with the two times on the s10 plus is quite a bit more zoomed in however the s10 takes it in terms of ultra wide whilst the galaxy has a mega wide 123 degree field of view oneplus has a kind of mere 117 degrees don't get me wrong you'll still very much notice the change between using the main camera and the ultra wide on the oneplus but the difference won't be as dramatic as it is on the Samsung the Seven pros main camera has a 48 megapixel sensor compared to just 12 on the Samsung which might make this like a really obvious choice but the end images are in the same league I do have a full detailed camera comparison coming tomorrow which will make things crystal clear it's great to see there that the oneplus now comes with a wide F 1.6 aperture even better than the F 1.7 we saw last year although it doesn't quite match Samsung's variable aperture that can open all the way up to F 1.5 something I'm really excited about is that both cameras have a night mode the ability to take bright photos in the dark one plus is upgraded both the software and the hardware here to allow it to work better on this phone than its predecessor the oneplus 7 pro is a phone of firsts for the company one such addition is Dolby Atmos stereo speakers and considering that the S 10 also has this setup why not pitch them against each other [Music] Samsung's phone combines a 10 megapixel selfie camera with a depth sensor that makes for super high quality portrait selfies the front camera here is as good as the rear camera on some phones I'm happy to say though that there's been no compromise with a single 16 megapixel selfie camera on the oneplus I will go into this in more detail in the camera comparison but safe to say it's good and on that note from huawei Samsung and now oneplus we've actually seen a bit of a shift away from face scanning Paswan plus phones had superfast face unlocking but because the front camera is not tucked away this no longer makes sense Samsung used to have an iris scanner on their flagships but to achieve this new punch hole aesthetic that had to be dropped - thankfully though both have amazing fingerprint scanners the galaxy s 10 plus uses ultrasonic technology which can still detect prints through wet or greasy fingers and you pretty much just need to scrape it for it to detect your finger the oneplus still uses an optical scanner but it is so much better than their last effort I was a little underwhelmed when the company introduced the feature in the 60 but with this phone they've kept the same sensor but increased the scanning area by about 25% and massively improved processing speed so one plus has never been a fan of offering expandable storage and that trend continues here while the S 10 does but both do start with 128 gigs internally so for me at least that's quite a lot something that's a little bit less talked about is that Samsung's Wi-Fi is pretty much the most capable smartphone setup out there it supports 802 11 ax vs. oneplus as 802 11 AC and a X basically brings a couple of clever engineering tricks to not just improve speeds but also save power the oneplus 7 pro with 6 gigs of ram here in the UK starts as 649 pounds that's over a 200 saving on the S 10 plus taking that into account oneplus has just launched a killer phone in the 7 pro the phone that for the first time doesn't just match but exceeds its competition in key ways it beats the S 10 plus in charging speed and has a super slick display but there is still a bit of corner cutting going on and really you'll need to decide if the emissions on the oneplus like the headphone jack like wireless charging micro SD card support IP rating or chunky size are justified by the price saving for some it will be for others it won't so which phone do you think one if you could subscribe for the camera battery and the speed comparisons plus some other stuff I'm working on that that would be amazing and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
