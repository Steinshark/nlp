- All right, thank you, Sir. Guys, we just got this house and we're giving it to a homeless person. Chandler's family friend is in trouble. - What about Brother Bobby? - Brother Bobby's been hit by a car. He can't even freaking walk. He's on one of them little knee scooters. - Oh. - And because of that, he
hasn't been able to work much and he's about to go homeless. Not on my watch! - That was the key. We need that. - So we've got him this house. We're gonna deck out this house. We're gonna give Chandler
a couple thousand dollars to have fun with him, and then at the end of the day, he's gonna come to this house
and he won't be homeless because his lease is almost
up and he has nowhere to go, so he's gonna go here. - Here. - There's a lot of money. Take that, go get Brother
Bobby, get your dad, and go have fun. While you're doing that, we're gonna take this house we just got, deck it out, and at the end of the day,
we're gonna give it to him. - One, two, three, Brother Bobby! - Go have fun. - All right. - And now that we took care of that, we need to pick out what we're gonna buy. I want a couch here. I want a rug. I want a lamp. I want a table. I want a new fridge. I want a microwave. I want a new stove. - All right, so I guess
Jimmy gave me some money to go spend on Brother Bobby. I'm gonna go distract him for the day. I'm gonna go pick him up. We'll have a great time
and play some bingo. All right, so we just picked
up Brother Bobby and my Dad and Jimmy gave us some
money to go have a nice day. And we're gonna do whatever
you wanna do today. - I'm with you guys. Y'all do what y'all want to do. - We're gonna go probably
get you some clothes and then we'll see what
we can do after that. - Whatever y'all say. I'm with a good family. - It's all about you today, man. So whatever you want,
that's what we're doing. - How many years have you known me? - 100, at least. So you just be yourself and
let's have some fun, man. - That's right, awesome B-roll. Yes, yes, yes, please. This one's not bad. Okay, no, let's get it. It's ours. - Hey, this one's not bad. - All right, we'll take it. I think he'll like it. - Yeah! - This is all we need. This entire U-Haul is
just gonna be trash can and a vacuum cleaner. - Perfect. - Let's see if he wants this. - Hey, what's up? - Hey, do you think he wants this TV? All right, we'll get it. - Hey, that's the TV I have. If we're getting him a nice TV, we gotta get him a nice TV stand, right? - Where? - To Walmart! - Oh. - Ah, why? We almost made a very bad mistake. You need a plunger. Okay, there we go. He'll need some glasses. Old people love countertop ovens. Dude. Jimmy, tell me I'm wrong. - That's right, work it. Work it. - Hello? - Hey, is he a Suave or a
Head & Shoulders type of guy? - Head & Shoulders. - Gotcha. Head & Shoulders it is. - Do you think it needs these? - It doesn't hurt. - They're like Band-Aids. He could probably use some bandages. - Yeah, and like maybe for his elbow. - Yeah, these are elbow Band-Aids. Oh. - So we were going to
Walmart to buy some things and apparently Chandler's here. Okay, so how are things going? - Things are going really well. - Is he having fun?
- Yes. - He is? - He's so grateful. He said it like 8,000 times already. - Okay. Go back. - All right.
- Keep distracting him. To the next place! - Ahh! - All right, we're picking
out a really nice couch. That's the one. - I want this one. - This is the couch. I want this couch. I don't even wanna look at the rest. I want this one. - Is it comfy? - Yeah. - This whole set.
- Yeah. - Let's take all of it. - Yeah, this set is actually . - Hey, what type of
mattress should we buy him? Because I have no idea. I mean, we're just laying on 'em, but like does he want a sturdy one? Go on a covert operation
and have Chandler record it. Try to ask him what mattress he'd like without giving it away. All right, we sent his
dad on a covert operation. - What kind of mattress
do you have now, Bobby? - One that's hard as
that, that over there. Hard as a brick, old as dirt. - You like a real soft one? Or like medium? - Yeah, medium. - All right, Chandler,
what bed does he want? - A medium. - Medium? - This is pretty good. - Oh, that literally says medium. - Yeah. - Okay, cool, thank you. - I gotcha. - Watch yourself. - There we go. So this is everything we're
gonna buy for Brother Bobby. Now we're gonna take it
to his house, set it up and surprise him. Hey Chris, what do you
think Chandler's up to? - I don't know. - All right, Brother
Bobby, we're at Old Navy. Let's get you some clothes. - All right. God bless. I thank y'all. - Let's do it.
- All right. - Yes, indeed. - All right, what do
you think about these? - I think they're good. Like a glove. - You're looking stylish, Brother Bobby. - Thank you. - There you go. - You like any of those shirts
up there, the dress shirts? - Outfit number one. - Do they fit good? - Do they fit good? - Yeah. - They're perfect. - Dang, Bobby! - What size is this one? Brother Bob getting some jeans. Oh, he might like his jacket right here. - Hey, are you with brother Bobby? - Yeah. Here. He's over here. - Hey!
- What's going on? - Not much. Chandler better be nice
to you, or he's fired. - Hey, he's so good to me,
he done spoiled me already. Both of 'em. - All right, have fun. - Thank you so much. - No problem. - 79 years. - In my 79 years, this
has never happened to me. That's why my gratitude to you and all of you is exceedingly great. - And we have a big surprise
for you at the end of the day, all right? - Whatever y'all do, I'm with y'all. - All right. - I'm home. - All right. - And here you go, guys. This is Brother Bobby's new home. Just kidding. We're still in Lowe's. This is actually Bobby's house and we're gonna start
moving everything in. And we got another surprise for him. It's a picture of him riding a tiger. Dude, this looks dope. He's gonna love it.
- That's a panther, not a tiger. - Oh, boy. Wait. - What's up, Shawn? How are you doing? - All right, what's up? - All right, don't tell him,
but we're moving the stuff in. We still need a little bit more time. Could you like take him
to a movie or something? - Well, I think he's still napping, but I was just wondering. - Okay, yeah. Let him keep napping. Let me know when he wakes up. Bye. - Don't worry, I got four wheel drive. - Out with the old
fridge, in with the new. - Imagine walking out your
front door and seeing a fridge. - Old dishwasher. - Yeah, put it right there. - New dishwasher. Oh my God. - I'm done with the stove and
I am finished with this stove. - Tell us more, Chris, tell us more. - Look, he's gonna put snacks. - Okay, this 87 year old man that probably has like two meals a day needs enough for like 30 people. We don't have enough room for the table. He's just not gonna
have any space to move. There's stuff everywhere. Chris, what do you think
Brother Bobby's doing right now? - Brother Bob, what you gonna get? Get you a burger? - Yeah, I know I want a burger. - Make some smiley faces. That ain't too bad, don't it? - Yeah. - All right, we just finished lunch. Now we're going to play some mini golf. Going with the green one? - Yes, Sir. - Ah, only the best for Brother Bobbers. - You got it. It's almost there. Yeah! Yeah. - Can we switch this. Looks good. - Oh God. Merry Christmas. I bring a Walmart shopping cart. - This is probably the first time a Walmart shopping cart has
ever been in somebody's house. - You know what? - This is groundbreaking. - We set this boy free. We're calling Chandler because I want to go look at
Brother Bobby's old house and compare the two. All right, so we're gonna
meet you over there. We're gonna head over in a minute and then we'll look around that, and then we'll bring him over here and show him the new place. - All right, sounds good. - All right, we're on our way. So before we give Brother
Bobby his new house, we wanna show you guys his old house. So Brother Bobby's and
Chandler's car over there. Just figure out a way to get us inside so we can show the viewers
without ruining the surprise. - All right. - Come here right quick, Bob. Be careful, don't be getting
up there and tripping. Careful, Bob. - Yes, Sir. - What? - How much are you selling it for? We wanna show you one
last thing real quick before we're done. - Sure. - I saw at least like seven
roaches in his apartment. - And he gets evicted
at the end of the month. - Yeah, he gets evicted on the first. - So this works out perfect. - Yeah. All right, let's go show him. - Wow, this turned out so good. We have the 65 inch TV, this nice L-couch, the recliner, the rug. Oh my goodness, the table, the custom Brother Bobby
painting, riding a Panther. That is dope. That is Brother Bobby. Ooh, it looks so good. Chris? - Yes, Sir. - That's flex. - Fresh cup of coffee. - Yo, I've actually never had coffee. The bathroom, hey, guys. And here's his bedroom. Lots of random people in it. Don't mind them. They're not gonna be in
his bedroom, I don't think. This fridge literally
takes up half his kitchen. I think we went a little too big. - There is no such thing as too big. - All right, well, let's go
give that man his new home. - All right. - Brother Bobby, how was your day? - Beautiful, beautiful. Y'all made it. You made my day. - All right.
- And thank you. - Well, we have one last surprise for you. All right, well, Brother Bobby,
open this door right here. - This one? - Yeah.
- Yeah. Chandler, what is this? - I don't know. Looks like a door. - Yeah, to his new apartment. - Yeah! - Oh! Man! - Yeah, man. - Are you kidding me, man? - Do you like your picture? - Yeah, look at the painting. - Yeah, we got you a custom painting> - Look at that, man! - You're riding a . - All this mine? - Yes, Sir, it's yours. - This is your new home. - He better come and get that . - So this right here is your kitchen. - All this is mine? - Yes, Sir. You like your new kitchen? - Man, do I like it? I don't need to bring nothing. - Nope.
- Nope. We got everything right here. - We got a couple of
plates and stuff like that. We got that's full of silverware. That's full of glasses for you. - Welcome to where the magic happens. - Don't tell him that. - I'm in debt for a lifetime. - Nope, it's all- - This is all you. - All right, well, we're
gonna take your debt and rip it up. - We got you a stuffed animal, too. - Yeah. Man, oh man. - I know you're about tired anyway. - I'm getting a good
night's, Lord have mercy. - Dude, is there another
bedroom I can sleep in? This is awesome, man. - I'm in debt as long as I live. I don't care what you need. - Yeah.
- I can do. Just let me know you're thinking, okay? - Yeah, I will. Take my baby home. Thanks to everybody. - No problem. Here. - Individually as well as collectively. - So you love the kitchen table. Do you you love the fact
that two of the chairs are completely unusable? Is that what you love? - I really do. - Here, Gary, can you try to get in those back chairs? - Yeah, Gary, try to sit
in that chair back there. - That's awesome, dude. - You took care of Chandler
when he was little. - Yeah. - And now we use him
for views, so it's cool. You guys look so comfy over there. - Bob, come sit in your new chair, man. That picture kills me. - Chandler, do you have
any extra money from today? Let's pass it along. Give Brother Bobby that
the change from today. - There you go. - It's not too, too much. - That's for groceries. - It's for groceries, Bob. - Yeah, man. Thank y'all. - Yeah. - Thanks, man.
- Yeah, man, cheers. - Appreciate y'all. - You said they hid it from you all day? - Yeah, all day. - Yeah, so the first year's
rent, we got covered. Same with the utilities and everything. So you don't have to worry about that. - You took it? - We got it. We'll pay it all for you so you don't have to worry about it. - Phew. Mind boggling. - Yeah, it's fine. Thank you for taking care of Chandler. - I got to, man. I got to. - We like making fun of him
for views, so it's a win-win. You raised him, we get to make fun of him. It works out. But I'm glad you liked it, honestly. - Man.
- It's so nice. - I don't like it. I love it.
- I love it! - You gotta laugh. - Perfect. - Come get in the bed
with me for the B-roll. - Oh, ye. - Oh, for the B-roll. - Put that at the very end of the video, like after the outro.
