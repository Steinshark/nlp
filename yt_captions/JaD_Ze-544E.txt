this is a laptop actually it's kind of more like two laptops sure you can use it basically like a surface pro but give it a fold and suddenly you have two displays in one you can use it on the go you can draw on it and you can multitask with it maybe but is this foldy boy really all that it's cracked up to be well there's a lot to unfold there right after i fold all of this into a segue to our sponsor today's video is brought to you by kiwiko kiwiko ships out crates that contain hands-on projects for kids to help develop their creative confidence and problem-solving skills learn more at the end of the video or at the link below [Music] first off this display is awesome the x1 fold is a 13 inch 4x3 oled display with deep blacks vibrant colors and a max brightness of 300 nits being a folding device you might expect an ugly awful scene samsung but in reality it's virtually non-existent sure the the seam itself is there and if the display is off the light distortion is fairly apparent but when it's on it's barely noticeable even to touch the hinge does take two hands to open and close but it's smooth and there are no creaking noises to be heard in addition the bezels surrounding the display are raised and made out of a soft rubber material that prevents the display from folding onto itself so there isn't any worry of it being damaged while folding it now with a display this cool the rest of the device should be too right well on the surface it is it has a real leather folio cover on the back that gives it a sleek professional look ooh plus this little bit folds out to function as a kickstand with the optional fold keyboard you've gone from an 8 inch folded device to a 13 inch tabletop computer there's an optional stylus for the x1 fold called the lenovo pen pro which has a hexagonal design reminiscent of those things called pencils people used in the before times it feels good to draw and take notes with on the x1 folds oled display and while it's 4090 levels of pressure sensitivity doesn't compare to a dedicated drawing tablet and stylus from say huion it's more than adequate for the average user however in creda it seemed to randomly panic and become misaligned on the canvas which we weren't able to fix but it works fine in photoshop in one note i mean this is a first gen device which is super apparent given the way the pen pro charges because uh yeah it charges via usb c cord in a market that has become largely saturated with inductively charged styluses or entirely battery-free ones but hey uh first-gen first-gen device it folds can you that's pretty cool let's talk about the keyboard despite being just four millimeters thick it feels like what you'd expect from a device with think pad branding there's a distinct tactile bump and decent key travel for a keyboard so thin i'd go as far to say this is the best small form factor ultra thin keyboard i've ever used i think back to the fold though coming in at 999 grams for the base model with no additional hardware it is lighter than basically every laptop on the market sure it is 36 heavier than the 12.9 inch ipad pro but that is a smaller device and once again can't ful it can't do this i can't think of any backpack or briefcase that this wouldn't fit into comfortably i mean it would even look good on a bookshelf wait no no alex no now looking good is one thing being a good laptop well that's something else entirely right away this thing gets points for the nano sim slot which is awesome if you need a private internet connection while on the go and that's the only positive thing that i have to say aside from that you get two usb type-c ports that are good for charging but unfortunately they don't have thunderbolt but even if it did have thunderbolt they don't have a headphone jack what makes this even worse is that if you use this device in unfolded mode aka like you know when you might want to be charging and have peripherals connect at the same time one half of your ports is underneath it now given it's half a chunker you might think that there's some powerful hardware in here but you thought wrong in here we get an intel core i5 with intel hybrid technology aka lakefield and as we discussed multiple times on this channel lake field sucks it sucks so hard that while you're making this video it was discontinued it's like a year old cpu lakefield was essentially intel's first attempt at a big little style cpu with a single large core handling powerful and demanding tasks with four smaller low power cores able to take care of normal program and background tasks in theory this is supposed to get you more power without sacrificing battery life and incredible standby times but it it doesn't lenovo advertises 10 hours of video playback on this thing with a 50 watt hour battery which sounds fine until you look at basically anything else this is the hp dragonfly max which has a super powerful tiger lake i7 with xc graphics and it gets 17 hours of battery life from a 56 watt hour battery and things just get worse from there for our poor lakefield cpu compared to even the i7 1165 g7 in our spectre x360 uh although not cheap much cheaper laptop the cpu isn't even half as fast opening multiple general use applications can become super sluggish like what is this 2005 these days you can expect a thin and light device to be okay for video editing light gaming and even cad i would not do any of those things on the lenovo fold the biggest kick in the nuts though you're getting this atom level performance and a device that costs 2500 500 starting for the privilege of folding it in half the keyboard and stylus another 250 bucks that money could definitely be better spent on our merch at ltdstore.com these water bottles they're good to be fair to lenovo this isn't really their fault and they aren't marketing this as a device for gamers or creators honestly i don't really know who they're marketing for c-suite hipsters i guess i mean like fair enough it does look pretty cool but you definitely don't look cool if you record yourself on the built-in webcam all right that's enough jeez louise okay fine look the fold may not be a compelling value or a high performance device but what it does have is cool factor the folding display tech here is only going to get cheaper and better over time imagine a device like this but one as thin as a proper ultrabook without the giant bezels look think of it this way at a glance this seems like either a tablet that folds down to become more portable or a tiny dual-screened netbook but i would argue that this is in fact a laptop that can simultaneously exist in multiple form factors it can either be a 7-inch netbook a dual screen laptop a 13-inch tablet for drawing or a 13-inch laptop with a bluetooth keyboard all of which folds down into a small easy-to-carry book-like form factor and that's what makes this so cool i mean why wouldn't you want this form factor over a regular laptop this is an actual real product that fits a lot of different use cases simultaneously sure it is hard to recommend this until the internals improve and the price drops but it isn't hard to get excited i can't wait to see what lenovo comes out with next because we may be living in that folding future very soon a future with more segues just like this one
