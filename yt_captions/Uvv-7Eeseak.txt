jake paul was caught again promoting a scam and someone's going to jail unfortunately it's not jake paul they get back however it is a case we've done in the past we called this way ahead of time and i'm happy to say we're adding another name to the hall of shame scammers have been arrested after being exposed on coffeezilla so stay tuned for that but first we want to talk about jake paul promoting an nft scam to fans reportedly for 6.3 million dollars and look i know feels like groundhog day at this point talking about jake paul and scams i mean if you want to describe jake paul to somebody you say he's an influencer maybe first and then you might like i was thinking about this you'd have to say he's a scammer second boxer third he technically has scammed more times than he's boxed professionally in his life so i don't know if he considers himself a professional boxer but if he does he's definitely a professional scammer more than he is that so look i get it it's exhausting because we just keep catching him and he keeps getting away with it sort of right um just to briefly go over it we've talked about stick dicks board bunny apes in space safe moon yummy milf coin sad boys all of these scams or rug pools or some kind of worthless going in this is how i know it's getting to be too much for everybody that last project sad boys isn't even real i made it up on the spot and probably 90 of you didn't notice uh because it's just as stupid as all the others it just fits right in so i guess i want to explain real quick why are we covering this well i know it's easy to get jaded about the fact that these people very rarely face consequences for their actions or scams um and that's why actually i want to cover it i will cover jake paul you know if you're gonna if you're gonna promote scams i will expose you until something happens so until regulators until something happens basically i don't care what until he gets a slap on the wrist something we're gonna keep covering it even though i know we've been here before so today the scam we're talking about is anna moon uh he was caught promoting this it's like a it's a pokemon knockoff it's just like stealing money from people who are fans of pokemon anyway here's the promotion and moon team it's great to be a part of this project i love the designs inspired by pokemon the whole nine yards me personally i'm gonna try to get a legendary during the public mint but y'all better not miss this all right so he says two things there that are really important one he's part of the project which i think is really interesting he's not saying i'm promoting it he's saying i'm part of it and two um he says it's inspired by pokemon now this project is inspired by pokemon the way the new ghostbusters is inspired by the old ghostbusters it's actually just a copy that's worse here's the nfts in question anna moon nfts they just recolored the starter pokemon okay charmander squirtle bulbasaur pikachu uh they actually added supreme jerseys to these pokemon others have visors or masks on it just looks so stupid and childish and you might naturally be wondering who falls for this you know i know jake paul is like the sleaziest influencer promoter of all time and so like who is actually buying this and that's where it gets interesting because one of the promises of this nft of the legendary nfts was that they were going to generate revenue every month 2500 every month it says right here on their website which has now been deleted 15 cards are legendary cards that will be automatically generating 2500 every month for life to their owners sort of a yang gang style ubi if you get this 15 out of like 10 000 card and so you can see why people thought it was a good investment after all it only cost about 600 to mint each card and if you got one of these legendaries you were kind of set for life 2 500 a month is no joke and so you can see why a lot of people wanted to gamble and maybe try to figure out if they could find one right get one buy luck it's sort of like a lottery ticket or something except of course this was a scam because the founders never went through with it this is despite the fact they claim that they have a signed nda with pokemon they say that here they say they take a percentage of the royalties but when people ask for proof there was of course none which just makes it even weirder when jake paul says they were inspired by pokemon and the project claims well they're actually collaborating with pokemon and then pokemons has nothing to do with it make no mistake this was a rug pull they promised the world they promised pokemon partnerships and it was all a lie and it ended up raking in 6.3 million dollars scammed from investors so that's the story there and at this point you have to wonder with such a legacy of promoting scam projects at what point is someone gonna step in um and really kind of crack down on this i know that's what i was thinking and so it's what brought me to my second story today which is of somebody who got arrested after thinking he could get away with it forever because he had been getting away with it you may remember this story it's about open c which is an nft trading platform i know we're pivoting a bit but it's all going to tie in together so this is a story we did a little while ago about a guy named nate chastain who was one of the executives at openc and because of insider knowledge that he had about these nfts that they were going to launch every time they launched an nft would explode in value on one of their like promotion pages so nate would end up insider trading on those nfts before they hit the page because he knew they were going to hit and he made a lot of money this way and he got away with it for a while well right up until he didn't this just in the doj charges former open c exec in an insider trading scheme on the doj's website they call this the first ever digital asset insider trading scheme so we are making history here and basically nate is charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering because of this each of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison meaning nate could potentially face 40 years in prison because of this trading scheme now of course he probably won't get that maybe get 5 or 10 but it sets a huge precedence for those who think they can just keep getting away with it so that's why i want to welcome nate to the hall of shame which is a new segment that we're introducing here today he's going to join jay mazzini the other influencer who went to jail for for these schemes so um can we just get a little moment of silence for these two [Music] rest in pieces boys so in conclusion guys i know it looks bleak i know it looks like these guys just get away with scheme after scheme but eventually after catching you multiple times eventually you may pay the price uh so hats off to you nate for joining the hall of shame and uh that's basically it i'll see you in the next one
