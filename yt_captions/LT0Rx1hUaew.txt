and it's natural for human human beings to want to be liked by those that surround them but if Washington likes you as a republican attorney general that means you're not representing a threat to the current order of things so part of what I look for is to find people that understand there's going to be blowback when they're doing the right thing and are going to be happy to kind of wear that as a badge of honor [Music] I had the privilege of talking today to Governor Ron de santis who's running for president on the Republican slate um I tried to tilt the discussion more towards the personal my impression with Governor Dan santis is that he's established himself already as a credible policy um uh advocate and a credible administrator and that's no small deal he and also as someone who's willing and able to take the flock associated with making difficult political decisions but I had the sense that I didn't really know him personally and I believe that that's a sense that shared by many people and so a lot of what we did with the conversation today was to get to know Governor DeSantis at a personal level and so I hope that all of you who are watching and listening find that useful and interesting as I did so Governor dentus we met um I think it was probably more than a year ago at the governor's mansion now we had bumped into each other a couple of times at some at some different speaking events but never really had a chance to sit down and talk and you know we we got to know each other a little bit over breakfast you know and I was I was struck by how um welcoming the event was and how conversational our discussion became quite rapidly and you know I thought I might walk down that road a little bit farther today you've established a good reputation or perhaps a stellar reputation already on the policy side and with regards to General administrative competence but it's my sense at least to some degree that people don't know you as well as they might and and so I thought we might and that goes for me as well and so I thought we might try to redress that today so that's what I'm going to aim at and we'll take foray off into the Phil opical and political direction from that but that's where we'll focus so the first thing I'd like to know and to share with everyone who's watching and listening is where did you grow up what was your what was your upbringing like so I grew up most of my youth in in a in a town called Duneden Florida which is on the west coast of Florida in the Tampa St Petersburg area I was actually born in Jacksonville uh my mother was a nurse my father worked for neelon TV ratings which at that time you actually had to in stall the neelen devices on the boxes of the neelen families uh so that was his job uh it took us from Jacksonville to Orlando and then by the time I was in first grade I ended up in in Duneden Florida uh so my my folks were just work workingclass folks my my dad is from Western Pennsylvania his father worked in the steel mills in Alaqua and then my mom was from North Eastern Ohio Youngstown uh which is which is also very blue collar uh area so so that was kind of how I was growing up I was somebody that was very involved in in baseball all the way through college but certainly as a youth it was something that I did pretty religiously uh we were uh I went to church every Sunday and then as I started to get older I started working parttime jobs to be able to to make ends meet so it was a uh it was it was a good upbringing no one would have predicted probably when I showed up at first grade in Duneden Florida that I would have gotten elected governor of the state in in 30 years but but uh it just shows you I think this country uh still has a lot to offer even though we've got a lot of problems uh I was somebody that was able to to work hard and and really get ahead from from that place uh in West Central Florida how big is the town you grew up in D doen how do you pronounce that Duneden you know at the time I would say was probably about 30 30 some thousand it's grown since then when I was a kid it was a lot of strip malls now they've got a nice downtown area a lot of restaurants there's there's kind of a lot of life for it so it's a it's a very cute little place of course they do have Coast on the Gulf of Mexico as well and one of the things that we have uh is the connection to Canada because dun Eden is the spring training home of the Toronto bluejs so growing up as a kid once it got to spring training in February in dun Eden you would see a lot of Ontario license plates uh around because the Baseball fans would come down Canadians would come down and the blue Blue Jay's facilities were all owned by the city of dun Eden so as a kid growing up playing baseball I we were we would use all the Blue Jays stuff since it was owned by the city my high school team our home field was the spring training stadium that the Toronto Blue Jays played in when they were doing spring training in dun Eden and so that was kind of a unique thing to have but the connection between dun Eden and the Toronto Blue Jays was something that was a really big deal for the city and really big deal for a lot of us growing up at the time yeah well Canadians are pretty fond of Florida All Things Considered um it's a great alternative to freezing to death in the dark fundamentally and so now you said something interesting when you were talking about yourself in first grade you said that no one would have predicted for example that you might grow up to become governor you came from a workingclass background it's relatively small town um but that but that's a striking thing to say too what were you like when you were little kid do you think and and when did whatever promise you did manifest start to show itself well my my what drove me was was the Athletics I mean uh primarily baseball but but I I started to like all sports as I as I got older and and that was the thing that that we did so when by the time I was 12 My Little League team Duneden National made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport Pennsylvania one of four American teams in the entire country to make it there they have a stadium and everything it's it's kind of the big time for Little League baseball and and that put us on the map there we had a great high school program when it came time for me to get recruited for college I was a good student and so I was getting recruited by places including Harvard Yale and Princeton so baseball really took me and I had never been to New England in my life uh so baseball is really what brought me to New England when I ended up going to Yale and I would have done baseball uh for as long as I as I could have and actually uh all through college and I was the baseball captain my senior year at Yale uh I would have kind of I would have played as long as I could but but being a big league player is tough uh my I think goal at that point was to stay in baseball maybe more on the business side in the front office but then when 911 happened that's when I ended up commissioning in the Navy and I kind of took a different course at that time but growing up as a kid uh it was really about playing sports and and doing that and I had a lot of kids growing up with me who were really involved in it we had a lot of good programs particularly on the baseball side so it was fun and I didn't I kind of just took it for granted but now that I've gotten older and I've been AC been been around the block a little bit you know not every Community necessarily offers those opportunities to the kids and so we were really fortunate uh that we had a lot of uh a lot of opportunities to play so what position did you play on your baseball team so I by the time I was in high school and College I was an outfielder uh in Little League I was one of the three starting pitchers on our on our World Series team uh and then I would play u I'd play the infield when I wasn't uh when I wasn't pitching but my the one thing I could do uh is I could hit a fast ball so you could throw a fast ball 95 miles an hour I could hit the fast ball as they started to be able to throw like 86 87 mph sliders and change ups that that makes it a little bit more difficult but but I was a dead red hitter if you thre me the heat uh I could hit it so you look back on your life when you were young especially on the athletic side obviously with a fair bit of appreciation you said you took it for granted then so I have two questions about that like what do you think it was about you or was there something in particular about you that made you an effective team player because people who are athletically successful have to be skilled in the mechanics of the sport obviously but to really reach a a profound level of success you have to be a good team player as well you have to be someone who helps the other players on your team develop and so forth and so what and then I'm also curious on the developmental side so I I'm wondering what you brought to the team and also what being engaged in those team Enterprises for so long actually did for you well baseball is an interesting sport because it's both uh the team is is Paramount I mean you can't it's not an individual sport at all but at the same time when you're up at the plate uh you know that's just you no one can swing the bat for you uh you either you either hit the ball or you don't and so it's an individual uh Enterprise in terms of every time you get to the plate four times a game or however much you do uh you've got to make it happen but just because you make it happen there's a larger thing I mean you could be a great hitter you need good pitching you need defense you need all those things so it's it's an interesting combination of of individual achievement but really needing to have the The Supporting Cast and the teammates to be able to do it so I did learn that at at a pretty pretty early age and I do think kind of like my job as an executive now I understand that I can have the vision I can make these great decisions But ultimately you need a Supporting Cast around you who's going to implement all this stuff uh you can't just do it by yourself and so we have people when you know we're fighting some of the covid insanity I have a Surgeon General Joseph lpo who uh carries this out and and he's a leader and all that stuff uh when we respond to things like hurricanes yeah I can say we're going to rebuild a bridge in three days but I've got to have the agencies that are going to be nimble and going to be able to do it so I definitely think I learned that and I think what I brought was just uh I I was a a hard worker I was somebody that that really wanted to be out there a lot I enjoyed it I enjoyed the camaraderie I enjoyed the comp competition and I I remember thinking when we when we went to the World Series when I was 12 we pretty much did baseball every single day in the summer all the way through the World Series and sometimes it was because you know we practiced a lot as a team but even if we didn't have practice a lot of us would just be out there and we would be playing on our own and I was always one of those guys there I would be one of the first to practice I'd be one of the last to leave I just really enjoyed it and I really enjoyed putting the work in and I believe that when you put the work in in a sport like baseball that you do see the dividends and that's something I've carried with me throughout uh my life when you when you work hard when you're prepared when you know your stuff uh you're going to be able to do better than if you're you're just out there expecting things to happen for you yeah well there's there's two things I've noticed about political leaders or cultural leaders for that matter who are genuine so you know politics media entertainment surgery actually maybe medicine as well in general tends to attract a disproportionate number of people who tilt towards narcissism and people are born with uh with their trait personality somewhat intact and every different combination of personality traits provides people with certain advantages and certain disadvantages or Temptations and if you're going to be on the political landscape you have to be extroverted generally speaking and one of the things that extroversion especially in combination with less agreeableness tilts people towards is a kind of narcissism and so there's a lot of people in the political domain media entertainment as I said who are in the public eye who tilt towards narcissism but the great leaders that I've seen are people who are very good at listening who are very good at building teams and who might balance their ambition with conscientiousness now it seems to me very clear that you're a conscientious person because you stress hard work continually and you also say that you enjoy it and those are Hallmarks of someone who's conscientious and that's a very good trait personality predictor of long-term success it's the best predictor after general intelligence but the team building thing really interests me because that's something that's crucial the ability to build a team and to provide opportunity to people and to give them resp responsibility instead of keeping everything for yourself is definitely one of the things that distinguishes narcissistic people from genuine leaders and so I've seen political leaders who are confident enough to surround themselves with people who are even more competent than them right which which is a which is a risk because if you shine if you surround yourself with people whose lights shine brighter than yours at least at least under some circumstances then that brings with it the risk that you're going to seem rather dim in comparison and so what I'm I'm curious about the mechanics of how you go about building a team how you've done that in Florida and what you think you might bring to bear if you were in Washington I I read a fair bit about Donald Trump's early year in first year in in office and it was definitely the case that it was hard for him to build a functional team now I don't think he really expected to become president you know so a lot of that was thrown at him or dumped on him although he obviously put his hat in the ring but I'm very curious about how you go about building a team because obviously building a team on the federal level is an unbelievably difficult job and if it's not done right then well all hell's going to break loose yeah I mean well first of all my my view is what Ronald Reagan said there's no limit to what we can accomplish if if you don't care who gets the credit so I I'm not out to get credit uh I think when you deliver results uh I I I hope that the other people get credit I don't need the credit and in fact when things don't go as well one of the things a leader has to do is say okay I'm responsible for that so there are there are times and and and and I I I think you you can't be a really good leader if you try to micromanage anything I mean you've got to set the vision set expectations and you've got to give people the opportunity to do it without you picking at them and and that's the only way I think you can really do well the flip side to that though is that sometimes when you delegate like that the the job doesn't get done and people may do things that that are not in line with the vision and so what you just have to be able to do is you just have to take the necessary action to correct that sometimes you got to replace Personnel sometimes just uh internal course correction but I think it's important that you you praise the people that are working for you in public and you censor in private I don't believe people I think they know that you're going to have their back and that's part of what we I think there's certain things leadership generally and particularly in government as an executive and then I think there are certain things that given the moment that we're in uh coming at it from a conservative perspective what does that mean in terms of building a team because I do think it's different uh how I would build the team in Washington versus how Biden or Obama or the left because when you're going into place like DC uh the hostility is there for anyone that wants to be a change agent uh they don't want to change the the order of things there they've accumulated a lot of power they're really invested in the status quo so if you take an agency like the Department of Justice uh and you want an attorney general any Attorney General on the conservative side that's going to go in there and actually clean house Washington is not going to like you uh you are going to get hit by the media you're going to get smeared by The Washington Post and the New York Times and so you just have to understand that and what about your internal makeup uh what is your internal makeup are you somebody that realizes that's positive feedback that you must be over the Target or are you somebody that wants to be liked by official Washington and it's natural for human human beings to want to be liked uh by those that surround them but if Washington likes you as a republican attorney general that means you're not repres presenting a threat to the current order of things so part of what I look for is to find people that understand there's going to be blowback when they're doing the right thing and are going to be happy to kind of wear that as a badge of honor I mean I in Co our our Surgeon General Dr Joseph lpo uh he came from UCLA had a great tenure great great life but he was a covid Critic of the narrative and he got marginalized there I brought him on to Florida said listen you do what exactly what you're doing but just understand they're going to come at you are you going to be able to handle it he's like yep I get it and and his credit he wears it as a badge of honor but if you're willing if you're concerned about how the media is going to treat you in some of these key positions if that's something that motivates you you're going to trim your sales and you're not going to get the job done so so I think just understanding how the media plays a role in distorting how our government operates when you're building the team you really got to have that intestinal fortitude in those key positions as the holiday

more so how are you able to resist the temptation to be liked and how do you tolerate the stress that comes with the attacks that are inevitably going to amount some of them reasonable and some of them not so reasonable I mean I've thought about a political career from time to time but I've always well I haven't chosen to go down that route for a variety of reasons it doesn't necessarily seem to me where I would be most effective but I also have a certain doubt about my willingness or ability to handle the constant stream of attacks that characterize a political career and so I'm curious about how how those sorts of attacks do affect you I mean one of the Cardinal personality traits is neuroticism and that's the proclivity to experience negative emotion and it's a stress tolerance Dimension and I'm not exactly sure that I have the capacity to tolerate stress in the matter that might be delivered on the political front now you've certainly taken your fair share of heat and you said that you're trying to surround yourself with people who are capable of tolerating that and who are also not necessarily looking to be liked so how do you manage that on the personal side of things and how do you what would you say butress yourself and and reinforce yourself you know say with regard to your family relationships and your friendships maybe your business relationships for the for that matter so that you have people around you that help you withstand the storm well part of it I think is that I just personally don't really care to read about me or or watch anyone on TV even when it's good it's just not something that I'm that I'm interested I'm much more interested in other things I don't need to be hearing about me I mean people you know there are times when I'll get something nice written or'll be oh did you see this and this and I'm like no I'm like I'm just not I'm not fishing for for for compliments either but I just know it goes with the territory uh it's just something that that you're going to do especially when you take on certain sacred cows you can just guarantee and you just see it for example this is a relatively small example but uh I I've been watching what's going on in DC with the fed and this whole idea of a central bank digital currency I think that that's very dangerous so I did a i i in Florida this past year I said okay in Florida we're not going to recognize that because if the FED does it unilaterally I don't even know if they have the authority to do that and I started to say well it'll violate your privacy they want to get rid of cash crypto all this stuff and and it was all true and then literally within days Washington Post New York Times all The Usual Suspects they start having a spasm and they're and they're going at me oh he's he's pedaling conspiracy theories all this stuff and I and and so I viewed that as I must have hit a nerve they would not all be doing this in unison this is something that these guys want and so I'm standing in the way so they're coming after me so it's kind of like in the m milary you take the most flak when you're over the target they don't tend to go after uh people on the right who are not a threat to them if you're just sitting there and taking up space they kind of leave you alone it's only when you're making a difference and you're leading that they really care so so I just know going in if you are going to stand for the things that I think need to be done in this state and throughout the country you are going to face blowback you just have to understand that uh you got to have a thick skin and I know it just goes with the territory you know how some people are going to react no matter what and that's just the way it is so you don't let it get to you uh I don't appreciate necessarily if they um you know you know go after like my wife or things like that but she's very tough too and she's just like look I get it I understand and she's very effective on the campaign Trail so they try to they try to Nick her as much as they can but but that's just where we are as a society the good news is is I think most people get that I think most of the attacks fall flat because they understand this is just part of the process and Florida we're show a good example because as Governor I got attacked more than any governor in the country and yet I won the biggest victory that any Republican has ever won in the history of the state in a Governor's race in 2022 so what that tells me is there's a lot of garbage that gets circulated out there but the public knows a lot of what goes on in the media is deceitful uh one way or another and I do think when you're just out there standing for and speaking the truth I do think it permeates through the fog of Deceit that our society has become mired in right well it is interesting reversal to view the most vicious attacks as indications that you're actually on the right track I mean obviously that isn't an unaringa take on the issue right instead of being concerned about the fact that you're drawing negative attention and taking that personally you said that you're using it as an indication that you've actually struck to the core of something that matters and that that's actually a positive sign rather than something that's negative so that's a useful thing to have in your back pocket so let me ask you a little bit let's go back again to to to your to your early life and I'm very curious always curious in with regard to the people that I talk to how their interests develop now you stressed a fair bit you stressed your athletic interests a fair bit and we talked already about the influence that had on the way that you conduct yourself and and how you build teams but I'm curious too when did your first of all like would you say that your interests are primary polit primarily political and pragmatic or are they more philosophical and and and metaphysical with regards to your conservatism because conservatives can be very pragmatic and detail oriented but they can also take a more philosophical Tack and I'm curious about which side of that you might Place yourself and then also on where your intellectual and political interests how did they first make themselves manifest when you were a young person well I think it's interesting because clearly when you're actually in a position of executive Authority uh you know you have to have a certain level of pragmatism because there's different things that come up and you've got to be able to improvise with new situations uh now you bring to that I think ideally a solid philosophical Foundation that you're able to to parse things through but for me so when I got to college for example I didn't even know colleges were liberal at the time and and especially like like a place like Yale I guess I thought like in Ivy League school everyone was going to be wearing like a suit and tie and everything I thought it was actually going to be more conservative in terms of that well I got there was a rude awakening uh you're in the classroom a lot of aggressive leftism so what I gravitated towards was uh a real good good history Western Civilization but I think with an emphasis on the founding of America because I think that there is a lot of the western tradition that fed into what the founding fathers did both during the American Revolution and when they created and ratified the US Constitution so I started studying uh all those key sources I became very well read in things like The Federalist Papers uh I read the Madison's diary about the Constitutional Convention pamphlets during the American Evolution so for me in terms of developing a conservative philosophy it really started in in those you know really core philosophical enduring truths that Mark the founding of the United States of America and I think that's something I developed throughout College I joke to people and say because when I'm speaking be in front of conservative audiences the fact that I graduated from Yale and Harvard Law School is not necessarily a good thing on its face given how liberal those universities are but what I tell people is I'm one of the few people that got through both Yale and Harvard and came out more conservative than when I went in that's not easy to do but I think part of it is because I was gravitating towards things that I think really really mattered I was not doing ideological studies I wasn't doing some of the flimflam that you see in modern Academia uh I were I was doing things that uh represented I was learning about ideas that have really stood the test of time what did you study specifically at Yale what was your undergraduate degree history history and then at Harvard you studied law okay so now you came from a workingclass background and you know I grew up in a small town in Northern Alberta and in a in a working class background um and when I was young 14 15 I got attracted to more left ideas I would say especially because of people i' met met I suppose who were deeply involved in the labor movement and at that time in Canada particularly in my home Province most of the people who were on the political left were actually involved in the labor movement and actually genuinely involved I mean There Was You know the fair share of narcissists on the left then as there is now but a lot of the people especially in leadership positions had gone through the workingclass ranks and had been labor leaders and so what the reason I'm asking you this is because you grew up in a workingclass environment and you it seems to me that you could have easily tilted towards the more socialist left as a consequence of being part of the working class let's say and being surrounded by that uh or being embedded in that environment but you said that when you went to Yale you tilted even more strongly in in a conservative Direction what was it about conservatism in particular that attracted you and and and also enabled you to develop and defend your beliefs while you were in these ivy league fundamentally liberal leftist institutions well part of it was just a rebellion against the the real militant leftism that I experienced on campus and I had never experienced that before I mean for example growing up I didn't know who was a Republican or a Democrat uh it didn't really matter I mean people believed in our country they were patrio IC uh they were God-fearing and so you kind of had like a core set of values that were in common that were different from partisan allegiances so then I get to get to Yale and the one of the Yale's Motts is for God for country and for Yale well I get up there and um uh they were not very uh hospitable to God or any type of religious Faith even though it was founded in 1701 because Harvard was too liberal with its theology that's how was founded they had totally walked away from any uh of that and then for Country they would mostly bash the United States you know you'd hear people blaming America for this or that there was a a view of of of Communism and Marxism that was very favorable and I'm just thinking to myself uh you know there was a 100 million person body count because of Marxism leninism in the 20th century and yet that's something that they're just papering over so I just found the whole thing to be very unappetizing and then I was somebody coming in I was patriotic I was God-fearing and I may not have necessarily had a firm political philosophy but that definitely pushed me uh away from that I'm like you know what I don't know what I am but I'm definitely not definitely not that for sure and then I think just when you're when you're studying ideas that that really matter I mean some of some of these ideas that Mark the founding of the United States are really infectious ideas about about Liberty about the proper role of government written constitutions and those are things okay that's my Foundation that's what I think matters and then how do you apply that more uh in terms of contemporary and I'm like well look this is the this is the philosophical tradition that we're supposed to want to conserve in terms of being being conservatives that that the founding fathers on the big things got right uh we supposed to want to want to preserve that and preserve Freedom so by the time I graduated uh there was no chance that I was ever going to end up on the political left but it's interesting when I look back at at at Yale uh I was playing baseball I had a lot of friends playing sports I was also working a lot of part-time jobs anything I could do just to help make ends meet I was by the time I graduated I was considered the most employable kid at Yale because anytime someone needed anything you know if I can make six or seven bucks here or there I would do it and I could get people to come and it just it turns out that by by most of what what is animated there the people that were in kind of my socioeconomic sphere tended to be much more patriotic uh tended to be and I don't know if I viewed it this way at the time but tended to probably be more conservative whereas a lot of the anti-americanism and the militant leftism tended to be driven by a lot of the trust fund kids uh kids that had grown up and in a lot of inherited wealth and I don't know if this is their way to just Rebel but there was definitely a a very wealthy tilt toward Ward the people that were on on the far left and uh maybe that was my first introduction to to kind of leftwing Elites uh that that are advocating these things now they didn't always want to live by what they were advocating but they did strongly advocate for those leftwing positions finally the perfect gift for

that's pound 250 keyword baby or donate securely at pre-born docomo that's preborn docomo yeah well one of the things that I noticed about the more activist types at because I taught at Harvard for a while at the ivy league institutions was that there was a sense of wanting to have too much like it was just too much for me to see when I went to Boston that you had young people who were simultaneously in a position to place themselves among the eventually Elite of the country which is what's really laying at your feet once you're in an institution like Harvard or Yale and who also wanted to acrew all the moral benefit of being allied with the oppressed you know I thought she got you know you're really asking for a bit too much here because on the one hand you're already clearly part of what's going to be the ruling Elite and that's especially true if you also come from a wealthy background and you want all the moral virtue that URS to someone who's simultaneously oppressed or an so-called Ally of the oppressed and the hypocrisy in that I found extraordinarily grating and and mean that's continued to this day and so what do you think that the founding principle of the United States have to offer to workingclass people as an alternative to the utopian Vision put forward by the radical leftists I mean hypothetically communism and these terrible systems that emerged in the 20th century were aimed at the working class right workers of the World Unite you have nothing to lose but your chains well it turns out the chains you're going to be put in by the radical leftists are a lot thicker than the ones you abandoned but we could leave that aside for the moment why do you think that you found the principles on which the US was founded more attractive and particularly what makes them more attractive and useful to people who are genuinely of a workingclass derivation well look there there's a there's a a limited role for government to play and there's a limited role for for ruling these ruling Elites and I think when you look at things like communism you're right the the chains are even thicker for the working class but man the the entrenched Elite Class they do very very well uh and and they live very high on the hog and you saw that I think when we understand what role government has played in holding people back a more limited government provides more opportunity I mean some of that is just what's the proper scope and power of the federal government for example now you have a movement through the bureaucracy not even legislated by Congress to Force everyone to buy an electric vehicle well if you're somebody that that is a that is a truck driver or a plumber making a pretty good living do you really want that type of vehicle how much more is that going to cost you all these other things that seems to not be much of an issue for the people driving these policies they have their agenda and they basically want people to be thankful that uh that that they're able to participate with that agenda even though it's making them worse off that's part of why you see the White House press secretary every day Gaslight the public saying how good things are with the economy when people are falling further and further behind they want people to act like uh that they should be thankful for what's going on even though we know it's not so part of it is uh making sure power is exercised in accordance with the Constitution which it is not right now you have a bureaucracy that is untethered to the original understanding of the Constitution a lot of the most important things that affect people's lives are done not by members of Congress who you can hire and fire during election season but by unelected bureaucrats so I think that's a problem the second thing is is just there's a limit to what central planning can do we saw the the Great Society and the war on poverty in the 1960s where they said look if we just have these these smart people in these government bureaus we put money into it they're going to be able to eliminate poverty in this country and this will just be a great uh great social Triumph well what ended up happening was they ended up creating a culture of dependency they made it more difficult for people to rise out of those circumstances uh and they uh facilitated dysfunction that we're we're still living with uh this very very day so I I I think it's just a skepticism of government being able to to do all these things to change and mold Society in the way they do and also a skepticism about government power being EX ized in big Ways by unelected bureaucrats I was talking to a European friend of mine yesterday and she pointed out that now in Europe essentially 55% of what people earn goes to Taxation and I thought well that's very interesting because really what it means is that people have given up 55% of the opportunity that presents itself to them in life to the to the what would you say to the machinations of the people who are taking their money and now it's more than half of what they make now on the one hand you might say well that's a good deal because look at all the things that the state does for you but on the other hand you might say well every single thing the state hypothetically does for you is um p is power responsibility and opportunity that has been taken away from you that you can no longer exercise yourself locally so that takes a fair bit of the meaning out of your life right I mean if it's on you to do things properly then that gives you something genuine and worthwhile to do and if that's handed down to you from the top down then you're in an infantile and dependent condition you talked about a culture of dependency and that actually Hollows you out so as the state becomes more tyrannical people become more slavish and that's very hard on the me existentially too because it deprives them of of meaning and so so I'm very curious though you know if you look at the situation historically this is how it appears to me people who promote limited government in principle and who want to devolve responsibility back to local citizenry in keeping with their abilities go to Washington but the bloody government keeps growing hand over fist regardless and it doesn't really if you look at the historical data it doesn't really seem to matter that much whether it's the Republicans or the Democrats in control the state just grows and grows and grows and grows at 3 to 5% a year and no one seems to be able to trim it back and so have you had any success in doing so at the local level in Florida and what have you learned apart from the fact that you have to take flak if you're going to attempt it what have you learned about how the procla city of gigantic organizations to keep growing can be managed well we've eliminated two agencies since I've been governor and our uh cost per state employee is the lowest in the country per capita and we have either the lowest or close to the lowest number of state employees per capita anywhere in the United States and it's interesting because when the people flee New York to come to Florida one of the first New York's budget by the way we have millions of more people than New York state does now New York's budget is twice the size of Florida's budget and yet the people that move from New York to Florida will tell me how much better the the services are in Florida easier to get a driver's license better roads all these other things so it is just a fact that a lot of the government is just not necessary to actually perform the core functions so and in Florida we've actually even though we've cut taxes we've run surpluses we've paid down almost 25% of our state's debt now we're proud of that uh but I understand the power is much more intrenched in Washington DC I think it is the case and I think you're right that it's grown regardless but if you think about it we've probably had one Administration since the Great Society who actually wanted to reduce government Ronald Reagan and uh you know he had he had some success in restraining domestic but it was tough but I don't think we've really had very many administrations that have wanted to curb uh the size and part of it is because when you're at the helm of it you know you can wield some of that power and I think that that's attractive to people but I would be one that would that would say we have uh both too big a government in size and maybe even more importantly uh too much government in scope so even if you cut the government by 50% of the employees if the government would still be U getting involved in things through the regulatory state that are far beyond the current scope that would still be a problem so I think you've got to tackle both what you need to do is when you get in there day one you have to have all the Personnel ready to go for ratification uh confirmation in the Senate that's hundreds and hundreds of people on day one need to be ready to go two all the executive actions you're going to take executive orders reversing the uh the previous that's got to be ready and then the legislative Road map's got to be ready with the key members of Congress and day one you just got to go now you have a lot of Leverage that you can use under article two of the Constitution Visa the bureaucracy uh there'll be a lot of things that we're going to do we we've previewed some of it we may do a larger roll out here in the next few weeks uh but suffice it to say there's a lot of authority and leverage that presidents have not used in the past that we would use uh both to limit the scope and to downsize the government so let me ask you some specific questions and then I'll close with some general questions you said that you reduced two departments eliminated two departments in Florida and I was curious earlier when we were talking about managerial strategies how you go about trimming and firing I mean these people that whose whose livelihood you're planning to eradicate have devoted their lives to their service to their country that's one way of thinking about it and it's a very difficult thing to handle decreasing the size of an organization so how how do you justify that morally let's say and how do you go about it practically so that it's actually implementable and works I mean obviously you haven't got enough Kickback in Florida to have had the government shut down by widespread strikes for example or rebellions at the administrative level so how have you managed that and what makes you think it could scale well I think Florida we've just been fortunate because it's it's actually been been hard to to keep people to want to be working in the government because we have a good economy 2.8% unemployment people have opportunities a lot of times in some of these agencies people are making a sacrifice to be able to serve some of them could be particularly at the higher levels could probably make more money in the private sector so we were very confident that there would be opportunities in the State of Florida that really I don't think was as a was a significant of a driving factor and then you do have sometimes when you so for example I've said federally get rid of the Department of energy it's not not been effective all that now there are functions in that department that were being done before the department was established in the late 7s and would still need to be done so some of those like for example with nuclear used to be under defense and so so sometimes when you're reducing a bureaucracy or eliminating a bureaucracy there may be some functions for example the Commerce Department uh We've said let's get rid of that but you have to do the census and there's certain things you have to do so some of that will be will be to to reassign others will just be be to eliminate but but yes we in fact if you think about some of the things that we've had to do in Florida I've had because our prisons it was hard to get people to to serve as prison guards it's not a great job the pay was too low they could make more working at Walmart or some of these other places so we actually did a big concerted effort to be able to give bonuses higher pay for for Corrections Officers and we've been able to to to do that uh pretty well but we still have more ways to go just because there's a lot of opportunities uh in the economy right now in the State of Florida because our state's growing let me ask you this question are you at peace with the Mindless screen time you spend on your phone every day are you gaining that higher quality of life you know you desire if this sounds familiar I have good news starting on January 1st tens of thousands of men all over the world will start 2024 with a 90-day journey together in search of a more purposeful life it's called Exodus 90 and it was built to help men enjoy the freedom of becoming who they were truly made to be Exodus 90 guides you in removing the attachments that are holding you back from a better life and it actually works independent research shows that Exodus 90 men report considerable shifts after the 90 days a dramatic decrease in time spent on their phon stronger satisfaction rates in their marriages a more meaningful relationship with God and true brotherhoods of men on the same path for the past 8 years Exodus 90 has helped more than 100,000 men build their own road map for living with virtue in a culture that offers far too many paths to self-destruction so is it time for your Exodus we start January 1st find resources to prepare for Exodus 90 at Exodus 90.com Jordan that's Exodus 90.com Jordan to start your journey let's talk about the Department of Education now you I'm I'm obviously extremely interested in educational reform I mean I've been shocked for example I was shocked as a professor at the University of Toronto to find out that my secondy year students who'd gone through 14 years of public education basically were entirely ignorant about everything that happened in the Soviet Union and in MA China throughout the entire course of the 20th century and I know that you've put in in um place um mandates for example for that sort of Education to be provided but you've also been very interested in educational reform so I'm curious about what's motivating that and what you what what uh what consequences that might have for your actions on the federal level well what we've done in Florida I mean we've had to really fight Biden because they want to use federal power uh to to coerce us to do do things we don't want to do for example we have women's sports in Florida uh biological men are not are not permitted to compete in that it's not fair to the women athletes and they were Biden threatened to withhold School Lunch Money uh for poor kids just because we were protecting women's sports uh so they go after whatever they can I'm going to get the federal government off the back of the states uh we'd like to just eliminate that department entirely but at a minimum if Congress won't do that I will certainly uh be be able to just peel back all the um it really it's not the proper role the federal government to be getting involved in in this stuff now what we've done in Florida is say okay the State of Florida clearly education is a very important state interest uh we fund a lot of the education uh we clearly have the authority to provide protections for the rights of parents so for example you have a right to know what curriculum is being used in your kids schools unfortunately there are pornographic uh materials that are getting put into education now parents in Florida can blow the whistle and that can be removed uh We've also done Universal school choice so that parents can choose make the the best choice for they for their kid regardless of their income that's private that's Charter that's public uh You Name It We Do It our our test scores have gone up as a result of that because I think students are in in good spots uh We've also said no no to things like critical race Theory and gender ideology that is not the appropriate thing to be doing in particularly Elementary School and we focus on on the core academic subjects uh We've also made a big push to have more American Civics in the classro and part of that is the graduating students now take a test that's modeled after the US citizenship test that tests their civic knowledge but what we we understood is like yeah I can say they have to know the Federalist Papers they have to know the Declaration of Independence the Bill of Rights all this stuff and that's great but you also need teachers that really uh believe in this and are passionate about it so we created a program for teachers they get a $3,000 bonus if they go through it's a 50-hour course and we got professors from like Hillsdale College we got people from the Heritage Foundation to come to talk about the intellectual roots of America what Went into the American Revolution the Constitution so they're learning about the enlightenment judeo-christian tradition British common law I mean everything you can think of they're learning about and and it's been really really good uh to be able to do that I think we have a respon responsibility to graduate students that have a foundation in what it means to be a citizen of a republic if you're just graduating blank slates well that's how you lose uh Freedom when when our Founders created the Constitution Benjamin Franklin walked out of the convention in Philadelphia when it was over he was asked did you give us a republic or a monarchy and his response was a republic if you can keep it because they understood these things don't run on autopilot the citizenry has to be engaged in protecting from preserving Freedom so that's kind of K12 now on higher education uh We've also leaned in and our view is is that publicly funded universities should meet the mission that Florida wants for for its taxpayers and for us we want rigorous academic programs uh we want to prepare students to be good citizens we want the pursuit of Truth we don't want the university to be hijacked to focus on ideological indoctrination so we've done things at like new College in Sarasota where I appointed seven conservatives to a small liberal arts college they've now taken that more of a direction like Hillsdale College in Michigan and the the applications are booming because there's a there there's a hunger to have academics focused more on on the meat and potatoes of what academics used to be rather than than a political agenda and then we're doing the same thing like the University of Florida we now have a Hamilton Center for Public Policy where you're bringing in professor that don't align with leftist Orthodoxy who are be able to present more of um I think a balanced take on things give students access to views that are not necessarily the the politically correct approved views that that that marks Academia so that's been really exciting too but my view is is these are all of our institutions they're not the hobby horse of the political left and they need to reflect uh what the state's Mission and interest are with respect to academics so I'm going to ask you a couple of questions to close if if you would the F the first is what challenges what have you done right and wrong on the campaign Trail what challenges do you have ahead of you on the campaign Trail what are you hoping for with regards to your campaign over the next year and then more specifically what are you hoping to accomplish with your forthcoming debate with Gavin Nome the governor of California well I think it's actually they're they're kind of related I mean I think that you know in a presidential campaign a lot of this is trying to generate information flow to the voters and in a nationwide thing things like the corporate media unfortunately matter more than maybe in a Statewide election even a state as big as Florida uh I really could dominate the discourse as Governor I could go to the markets I these local markets and do that when you're talking about a presidential campaign I mean it's just day after day the media churn narratives and so we knew from the day I won reelection in 22 I Was A Marked Man we knew they were coming after me we knew they did not want me to be the nominee that that wasn't necessarily surprising uh but I do think that uh doing what you can to to get into that flow in ways that are going to be present for voters is really really important and I think we've done a better job of that uh more recently in the last few months than we did in the first month or two of the the campaign and that's kind of the thing with the Newsome he said he wanted to debate me Hannah he asked me to do it some people said well Newsome we know he wants to run but he's not actually running so so why even give him that platform and and my view is this is going to give me 90 minutes on National Television to be able to articulate uh why conservative policies have worked in Florida and why they can work nationally in contrast to the failure of California and how Biden is failing and how more of that would would lead to an acceleration of the country's decline so that's going to give me a good opportunity to be able to reach uh these voters in ways that that'll be meaningful so that's just that's different in a presidential than would be different in these other campaigns um you just do uh so we're going to be mindful of that now I do think if you're out of a primary context the liberal media attacking you I think does help you with Republican voters because they'll they'll get defensive when you're the the nominee they'll say wait a minute they're coming after our guy uh and there is a rally around the flag effect because conservatives just have no trust in the corporate media at this point that that you do have that in the primary it's a little bit different in terms of how how all that shakes out but definitely uh I would say that just the role that that that media plays and being able to get in the information flow is a really really thing and of course there's some people that that that can dominate that uh in ways that other candidates can't so you said that your your strategy has shifted to some degree in the last few months and that you think it's become more effective so maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit so what we've done really I think um you know probably since the end of the summer is is is get involved in as many different media opportunities as possible I didn't really do a lot of the corporate media as Governor because I didn't really need to and I knew they were just trying to distort everything uh we now do that I mean I've done uh liberal shows I've gone on all that stuff and and we're going to continue to do that I think you just get better churn when you're doing it what I've also though noticed is uh we've spent a lot of time in in these early States particularly Iowa which is the first contest Iowa caucus and when you're on the ground there and we visited 98 of 99 counties I'll finish the 99th uh this coming weekend uh you do get good information flow with the local local media and that's the thing it's like you could be in an area you get a couple hundred people to come see you and that's important and when they come see us we're able to shake their hand answer their questions we went them over but you know you're it's the whatever the the media is then putting out to the community that's really what's going to be more influential so so we've gotten in and we've done a lot of that uh and I think that that's been effective and we've been able to really build a big big uh base of support in Iowa and when you're in a caucus situation it's going to be cold you got to show up at night uh on a week night and you got to be there for two or three hours and so that takes a commitment it's not just mailing in a ballot so so generating the type of people that are really true believers that you know are going to show up is key and we've created a really good base of support there well Governor I know you're on a tight schedule and we have to wrap this up there's endless numbers of other questions I would like to ask you I guess the last thing I would like to know from you I suppose is um what makes you think that you among the Republican contenders are in the best position to put to be put forward as the as the Republican candidate for the next presidential election few reasons one I have a demonstrated record of of fighting for people uh we've had a lot of Republicans over the years that that basically just cave at the first sign of opposition to the media uh but I'm also somebody that when I fight I I win these battles and yes win the election we want a historic victory in Florida we'd be able to beat Biden nationally without without question uh but winning on all the policy fights it's one thing to have a a a slogan about something but you actually got to bring it in for a landing so everything I talk about is done with an eye to how would I actually get it done whether it's stopping the Border Invasion whether it's uh uh uh reducing the bureaucracy and taming the Deep State uh whether it's getting the energy production at Max Capacity all these things are things that we're thinking about and the final thing is is you we really need a leader and you need leadership and that's what we've demonstrated and Leadership is about doing the right thing when it's not easy uh when the wind's at your back that's not really a test but when you have the the wind in your face when people are coming at you are you going to stand for what's right articulate that Vision that people can rally around uh or are you going to kind of scurry off into your little cubby and and hope that that you don't that you don't get hit with any incoming and and I have a demonstrated record of leadership so people can know know that with me as the candidate for the Republicans uh when I get in there January 20th 2025 uh we're going to get all of this done and we're going to have two terms to do it uh and the country is going to be in a much better position that winning the election is important but then delivering on the promises that is the missing ingredient that's what we need to get done and that's what I represent well thank you very much for your time today sir it's much appreciated it was pleasure to get to know you a bit more um with any luck we'll have another opportunity to talk at some point during your campaign and best of luck on the trail you they should have you host one of the debates I think it would be uh more informative I think you you'd asked a lot of good questions maybe we'll see if we could get something done yeah well that would be a remarkable opportunity and a genuine privilege so I'd certainly be up for that anyways thank you very much for your time I know you're on a tight schedule I'm going to let you go I want to thank everybody who's watching and listening this is a very important up coming presidential election and it's necessary to spend the time uh required to to inform yourself about the about the candidates and about the issues at hand because it's a crucial election and so thank you to the dailywire plus team for making this possible and for to the camera crew here in Scottdale and um thanks once again Governor DeSantis for your time today it's much appreciated thank you take care [Music]
