hyena UV is an evolutionary step forward in lithography and unlocks a great deal benefits but at a cost asml has worked on high na UV for over a decade right now it is about two years away from hitting Fab floors today we're going to update progress with high nauv after that we will take an irresponsible look ahead at the insanity that is hyper in a UV I note that today's video is a bit more advanced than normal we will also be going over previous work we should begin with a recounting of the attention of high and a and Hyper and a UV lithography the na refers to numerical aperture it is a dimensionless number measuring how much light an optic system can collect and focus there are about 160 euv systems in operation around the world today all of them have an NA of 0.33 which works out to a 13 nanometer half pitch line good for them but 13 nanometers is insufficient for future process nodes tsmc and others are producing their latest three nanometer generation nodes using euv multi-patterning which is not ideal raising the na to 0.55 would shrink the size of the lithography machine's half pitch lines some 64 percent to 7.5 or 8 nanometers at least in theory High and a is scheduled to enter the supply chain in 2025 and its performance is said to be sufficient for the N2 or n 1.8 process nodes as well as the next two to three nodes after that asml is not vertically integrated so there needs to be consensus with the critical suppliers some of the most important of which are those for the photo masks the mirror glass and inspection tools in 2013 semitec iMac and others held two meetings with these guys about what a high-end a UV transition might look like for instance one of the possible scenarios would be to have set the na at 0.5 but increase the size of the euv mask from its current 6 inches to 7 inches the upside of this option would be faster throughput we would be able to print some 70 more pattern features onto the wafer per hour however the suppliers said that they would not pursue larger euv mask sizes without agreement from the chip makers Intel tsmc and the like those guys would be the ones paying for the bigger masks after all the chipmakers declined an invitation to present their views at that first 2013 meeting which was construed as a sign that they were waiting to see how things would shake out with regards to first generation UV at the second 2013 meeting Global foundries presented a cost of ownership analysis they argued that it does not make sense to increase the mask's size this is assuming that a 7-inch mask is 30 more expensive a nine inch mask is forty percent more expensive and a 12 inch mask 50 more expensive so in the end it was decided that the UV mask sizes would not change for high-end auv leading to significant consequences for asml's machine design first things first higher n a means bigger mirrors in an euv system the N A is proportional to the opening angle the angle between the mirror's axis and its surface so increasing the n a means increasing the mirror's opening angle and thus its width all the mirrors have to get larger but the final one is an absolute unit Zeiss reports that it is about 1.2 meters wide and weighs 360 kilograms this is nearly twice as large and 10 times as heavy as the final mirror for the 0.33 na system which was 0.65 meters wide and weighed a mere 40 kilograms bigger is far easier said than done Zeiss had to build a very large autonomous robot just to handle these Mega mirrors furthermore they had to build custom 20-foot High vacuum vessels for running Optics Metrology on the mirrors to fund this Zeiss and asml sealed a deal worth 1.9 billion dollars in November 2016. 1.1 billion of that is for stock and the rest are pledges for Capital expenditures and r d 's mirrors are multi-layer brag reflectors because they have so many layers their reflectivity is dependent on the angle of the incoming Light Beam unmodified this reflectivity rapidly declines at higher angles this restriction plus the need for larger mirrors has several major ramifications throughout the optic system asml discussed two Focus area in particular the first area is the mask the mask itself is a mirror and the higher an a means that the incoming light cone interferes with the outgoing one the obvious solution would be to increase the reflection angle so to put more space in between the two cones but sadly the mass does not allow this not only because of the declining reflectivity with Rising angles but also because the chip design pattern is printed onto the mask using lines of absorbers if the angle of the incoming light cone is anywhere higher than about six degrees then the Design's absorber lines get unacceptably distorted so we magnify the light cone to shrink its width but if you do a full magnification on all axes then this also shrinks The Mask field size to a fourth of its previous size mask field size is the size of the area transferred from mask to wafer in a single exposure to keep it from becoming unacceptably small they use anamorphic lenses to magnify just one of the mask's two axes the major consequence of this is that high and a UV systems have a field size about half as large as that of low and auv this means that chip makers at the start will only use it for chip layers of exceptionally High complexity stitching together print features runs the risk of discontinuities at Borders ameliorating these effects will require new computational lithography techniques the second major engineering Focus point in the system occurs with the last two mirrors prior to the wafer because that last mirror is so wide the light coming from the second to last mirror hits it at an angle that is wider than ideal so Zeiss drilled a hole or obscuration into the last mirror in order to lower the angles again and improve productivity this is a well-known feature used for telescopes to avoid stray light and improve contrast furthermore the higher and a in high and auv significantly reduces the chip Design's depth of focus depth of focus is the vertical distance at which the image quality is still acceptable in other words it is the range at which the chip Design's image remains acceptably in Focus that Focus image has to be maintained throughout the whole resist layer the larger that distance is the better so ideally we want a low resolution limit and a high depth of focus the problem is that if we raise the N A to achieve this lower resolution limit that inherently shrinks the depth of focus the equation dictating this is a second raila equation one not as well known has this more glamorous cousin K2 times wavelength divided by numerical aperture squared where K2 is a function of the process same as K1 with a resolution equation with a 0.55 na that depth of range is 45 nanometers which is over 60 percent thinner than how it was for the 0.33 and a tools this may be made even worse by refraction effects from the resist layer and the vacuum above it depending on the resist material per Snell's law if the resist materials index of refraction is greater than one then it helps increase the depth of focus but so far the tests seem to show refractive indices less than one though pretty close to it this means that we should expect to see refractive effects hurting our depth of focus so this super thin depth of focus has several wide ranging effects High n a UV Wafers must now be incredibly flat to stay within that depth of focus range Focus control will be essential this in turn places tight requirements on the whole semiconductor processing chain from wafer substrates up onwards for instance etching and deposition steps can easily add new topologies to the wafer that push it out of the focus range so we need to do flattening and polishing and within the stepper tools themselves new attention has to be paid to the machine's handling the Wafers even the Chuck holding the wafer inside the machine the exposure tools light source is one of the most commonly cited parts of the UV system and I have to admit it is quite charismatic how can you not be in awe of lasers hitting 50 000 tin droplets each second twice asml is working on new more powerful light sources for high and a it will largely work the same way but with a few modifications first it will increase the frequency of 10 droplets from 50 000 a second to sixty thousand second and more significantly asml will swap out the old 10 Micron laser used for the first of the two laser blasts with a one micron one oh and they also turned it on its side this time to help improve the light transmission so there you go right now the nxe 3400 euv light source which is about 300 watts of power asml predicts that if these modifications work out then they can scale all the way to as high as 800 watts someday in a glorious future it also means however that high n a UV will use even more electricity than the original EV machines which are already estimated to use as much electricity as three Walmart Supercenters in light of this I should note the existence of euv light sources using methods other than laser-produced plasma one particularly interesting approach is the free electron laser here we use the particle accelerator to accelerate electrons to near the speed of light we then inject them into an array of magnets inside they oscillate and emit light we should talk resist now resists have long been one of the limiters in euv technology a critical portion of the euv puzzle UV resists work different from duv resists when a DV Photon hits a resist molecule that same molecule gets excited and that is about it but when an eov Photon hits a resist molecule there's so much energy that the molecule ejects an electron this ejected electron can then go on to create further chain reactions in the molecule surrounding that first molecule causing a sort of blur calculating and minimizing this effect is difficult and it is not helped by the fact that we are now printing features the same size of individual resist molecules nor by the fact that Quantum stochastic effects cause random photons to show up at unpredictable spots leading to errors and with a depth of range being so small the resist layer must be very thin and thus the resist material has to absorb UV light extremely well resist progress is very proprietary costly and time consuming and thus far we have yet to come across one capable of satisfactorily meeting all the requirements the search continues High n a UV is two years away and supposedly meets our goals for five years more yet we are already mulling over the next conceptual step After High n a which would be to raise the N A from 0.55 to 0.75 or Beyond a level known as Hyper n a the first time most of us may have heard of it is during the bits and chips interview with asml CTO Martin Van Den Brink he says about it theoretically it can be done technologically it can be done but how much room is left in the market for even larger lenses could we even sell those systems if the cost of hyper n a grows as fast as we've seen with high n a it will pretty much be economically unfeasible saying this apparently got him some grief but he isn't exactly wrong each of these high na UV machines will cost somewhere in the range of 300 to 350 million dollars even being charitable with the trend a hyper and auv machine can cost over half a billion dollars that is about the cost of one Barcelona contract with Messi there will be substantial engineering challenges associated with the larger mirrors for hyper n a so imagine the massive robots for Mirror handling and vacuum Chambers built for Mirror Metrology but even bigger as well as the resist issues with high and a the depth of focus decline is proportional to the square of n a so it is even worse with hyper we go back to the mirrors at the mask area a larger n a means even wider light cones coming on and off of the Mask but even with magnification simulation show that reflection angles average about 6.5 degrees or 0.75 n a and 7.5 degrees for 0.85 n a at the higher end of the range the reflection angles are about 0 to 12 degrees which is beyond the acceptable reflectivity value so we may have to modify the thickness of the mirror multi-layers to accommodate this but this seems possible if we're just going with 0.75 and a another thing to consider is polarization in other words the direction in which the light is oscillating like as if it were a vibration on a guitar string light as it comes out of the euv light source is unpolarized meaning that it goes in a variety of directions therein lies the issue imagine light going through a grate which is kind of like what an UV photomask is just the big great when the gaps between the grate are wide things are good light oscillating in all the directions act largely the same as it passes through the gaps or reflect off the lines but now shrink the gaps when the width of the gaps get to be about twice the width of the light's wavelength you start seeing strange Effects light oscillating in the direction orthogonal to the Great's Direction becomes much more likely to reflect away and not pass through the grading the scientific phrase for this orthogonal light is transverse electric or te or s the scientific phrase for the light oscillating in the direction parallel to the grading is transverse magnetic or TM or just P for parallel this effect was first observed in 1902 but analyzed by who else raila in 1907. anyway at the end of the day this is what it means for the chip maker in a Chip's design lines going in One Direction will have better contrast and thus print quality than the lines going in the other direction this contrast is measured by a figure known as normalized image log slope or Nils and is dependent on the incoming light angle anyway polarization was already a significant concern with high nauv but it will be a huge problem with Hyper na UV when the gaps between the lines get even smaller asml might consider using a polarizer which filters out light in certain directions but by definition a polarizer filters out some light which weakens power and slows throughput perhaps new light sources like the aforementioned free electron laser which emits polarized light can help with this I've said before that the semiconductor industry is pretty terrible at predicting anything beyond five years hyper n a is just too far into the future for us to know how it will shake out right now there remains big challenges with high and auv while the Optics engineering and light source seem to be on track we lack significant information on other critical parts of the system most significantly the resists and the polarization issues these may have significant effects on high and Hyper and A's real world performance these limitations make me wonder whether it makes sense for a chip maker to Shell out for a future 500 million dollar machine that being said I do see Pathways towards more powerful effective lithography without the need to raise to hyper n a better resists larger masks new and more powerful light sources magic fairy dust from the Martian Moon of Phobos and so on right now there is no wavelength Beyond UV but that doesn't mean we have done all we can with this wonderful 13.5 nanometer light all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the Channel Sign up for the newsletter and I'll see you guys next time
