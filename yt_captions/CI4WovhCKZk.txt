ladies and gentlemen it's currently March 5th 2023 and today is a rather sad moment in chess history today Magnus Carlson played his final game as world champion of chess what does that mean Magnus has been the world champion for over 10 years now being the world champion in chess means winning a head-to-head world championship match against the Challenger who wins the candidates chess tournament you can also be the world champion in Rapid chess and in Blitz chest but classical chess slow chess is the most prestigious of all and has always been the most prestigious of all on uh the 64 squares well Magnus declined to defend his title for the sixth time he has won the title five times defended it uh and he did that for various reasons that he has cited now he still technically Remains the world champion but on April 7 2023 when the World Chess Championship begins between dingler and janipomnishi I think technically he loses it when it's over but once the next World Championship Match begins that is the end of it and so Magnus is currently playing in the Norwegian League which is a team format it's kind of like a leagues or fun formats in chess a lot of uh just like your favorite athletes your favorite football players they play for their club team it's very typical uh for chess players who don't have YouTube channels or don't want to teach to make a living by getting paid to represent various uh company sponsor like in the Bundesliga which also exists in chess uh you may have noticed I have not made a joke in 90 seconds I usually do something very stupid quickly to catch your attention but no today we're just going to take a look at magnus's final two games as the world chess champion so he will play more uh but these are his final two games uh his first one was against his uh good colleague uh and the person who is the same age as him I mean Yoon Ludwig hammer is a beast he is uh he very clearly would be the best player in Norway if there wasn't a guy named Magnus Carlsen uh and this is a rivalry as old as time they have played many many games against each other if you saw my video about Magnus Carlson getting all poisson checkmated uh Yoon Ludwig was the protagonist and Magnus plays Knight F3 E3 this style of Chess became very popular in the last like five seven years the idea is to play like this and really this became popular because after the move Knight C3 uh if black plays like this white doesn't actually have to play D4 so so I've actually won a few really nice games where I just never play this move and I basically just play Rook G1 like your opponent castles and then you just go G4 G5 you put a queen on C2 targeting that diagonal it's a very very fascinating position but if black plays C5 white has to play D4 but normally what white does white has to do that because otherwise black will go here so normally we get Pawn takes and then Pawn takes and then D4 now I have a feeling as I mentioned in my video yesterday when Magnus played against Levi not against me but against Levi taloxin from Norway uh normally uh Magnus will walk with you hand in hand across the street and then push you in front of a bus uh slightly less gruesome but essentially what Magnus will do is he will try to take his opponent out of a comfort zone he will try to take his opponent out of a situation where he thinks the opponent is going to be comfortable if black prepared this more often than not he is ready for Pawn takes and he is ready for D4 now Magnus plays D4 right away this is a surprise to me it's a surprise to me because black can get total symmetry right like and this has happened many times and white will go A3 A6 blah blah blah um so D4 is kind of a surprising move but what you Ludwig plays in response is even more surprising why um because as I said normally black will go here and black will wait for white to move this bishop okay so black will wait for white to move then he'll take and now the bishop moved twice Yoon Ludwig when D4 happened took on C4 right away allowing white to do that now this position technically technically after A6 becomes this position D4 D5 right Queen's Gambit accepted interesting Knight F3 Knight F6 E3 E6 Bishop C4 C5 Knight C3 A6 look at that that's called a transposition so it's the exact same thing so that's basically what we've transposed to that's magic right look at that now in this position white can go Castle B3 bring the bishop back preemptively uh take on C5 uh A4 to prevent B5 there are a million moves in this position you know what move is almost never played here Magnus plays it I told you this is right where the moment where Magnus walked the grandma across the street and then pushed her in front of her he just he he takes you into a position and then he abandons you completely E4 now that move might not be shocking at all oh that's the thing right like in in in uh mixed martial arts it's a knock down knockout oh in football it's a beautiful free kick goal you know in hockey it's a it's a fight in chess it's upon moves oh oh right like we don't but what's the what's the point I don't understand in all these different sports there's this big moment why is that move hype well white already committed the pawn so now he's uncommitting it he's moving it a second time in the first two moves that now gets destabilized and I mean like again if this was a good move everybody would play it but nobody really plays this normally people Castle blah blah the point is that now black can take in the center and White's pieces don't really do a whole lot every square is covered there's no way forward but black would uh White would really love to play this move E5 because that would sort of shove the Knight backwards but nobody really plays this so Magnus basically takes the game from very well-known territory to territory that's been played like three four times uh and after Bishop D6 and queen E2 Queen C7 uh Bishop G5 it's like already totally brand new the idea of Bishop G5 is to Target the Knight and potentially damage the structure you and Ludwig says do your worst go ahead take on F6 right if you do this I'll have damage structure but I will be the only one on the board with a dark squared Bishop so Magnus now plays Knight F3 trying to play E5 julvig plays Knight C6 preventing white from playing E5 white plays Bishop B3 bringing back the bishop away from the line of attack here maybe the Rook will go to C1 kind of a waiting move again if black Castle is now taking here could actually be quite nice uh also you have the Bishops here Target this get in there with the queen so instead of that you and Ludwig now moves the Knight out of the attack of the bishop rendering this guy kind of stupid and probably he will go to the E5 Square also you are preventing white from castling because you will take the pawn on H2 so Rook D1 played by Magnus instead the Knight goes back to E5 and now Magnus is going to bring that Bishop also back to G3 but from the opening look at magnus's time if we go back a little bit like he had 126 on the clock right and now he's he I mean look at 18 minutes to move his Bishop out he knows how the bishop moves he didn't need to spend no 18 minutes on that you haven't thought about anything for 18 minutes in your life that's why you got bad grades in school right so 18 minutes for all of this right it's a very very tense position but all chess games ultimately have uh certain decisions that need to occur what are you going to trade right what are you going to trade what are you not going to trade we have Knight takes this black has many options here black can play Knight A5 which is what he did in the game he can play Knight E5 attacking the queen he can play Bishop E5 centralizing the bishop and trying to get a knight to D4 he can play H6 trying to prepare something like this maybe castles a lot of different options he does go Knight A5 and Magnus is okay giving up that Bishop because if he tries to preserve the bishop he doesn't want to give away the bishop now you got bigger problems and in chess you can Snowball right one problem leads to another problem and if you play B3 that's going to lead to an even bigger problem and you might go here thinking you solved that problem but no no you didn't solve anything you try to defend that it gets even worse Rook C8 so Magnus decides all right how do I clarify the position relieve the tension a little bit I'm gonna play the move Bishop to G3 my idea is if he takes me I'm gonna open up my rook and that's exactly what happens take take black castles now you Ludwig did not have to Castle actually uh the computer was saying he shouldn't Castle it was like just go here and then if Magnus tries to trade Queen say no and if his Queen wanders into your territory just I don't know take a deep breath play Rook d8 the thing is a really really good player such as Magnus knows exactly when to make the right trades and what that means for the long term of the position a lot of you in this position would either Castle which is not a bad move or play Queen H5 which threatens made in one now once you're not for like 20 percent of you your opponent would go here in blunder mate for the other eighty percent your opponent would go here and you would not know what to do some of you would continue the attack with G4 G5 which by the way is not that stupid uh some of you would I don't know play like night here and lose your knight I don't know my point is that one move attacking threats are not how these guys play but also they don't want to take risk that's massive like they don't want to play G4 and and try to play at every Pawn forward like because there's nothing here like they know how to stop these attacks they see this queen H5 step three moves ago you just see it now you don't even see it now right so Magnus isn't gonna do that and he doesn't want to Castle he wants to keep his workout so he plays Queen F4 very interesting move Queen trade 10 minutes to offer up a queen trade now black doesn't have to trade how long did you lose four minutes right it doesn't have to trade now what he shouldn't do is go here why D5 in Chess at this level it literally comes down to one square just one square and white will move the queen maybe move the Knight check and literally just this trade that Knight is so strong now all right that Knight is so good maybe even King takes and bring the king out I don't know there's no need to do any of that instead we have this right he could have not traded a bishop C6 and here uh your Ludwig decides okay I can like keep playing the position I can put a rook on the file but this is a very obscure structure like white has no H Pawn and white has doubled B pawns but the Double B pawns kinda counteract those two pawns right so the what color complex is black week on black has a light squared Bishop dark squares right this Knight is a 50 50 piece 50 50 on both but this bishop is kind of being repelled and if the white king can make it into the position that's exactly what you gotta you know what you're gonna need to to win this Pawn in all end games you gotta you gotta think much deeper than a Checkmate you got to think structurally and you and Ludwig decides let's do it this way because if he takes me I'm gonna start hammering away at these f-pawns so now the structure is very locked another thing to pay attention to in end game positions is what are the potential weaknesses and where are the pawn breaks right so that square is a weakness the D6 square is infiltratable I don't know if that's a word or not but if the Knight gets there black is screwed if the white king proceeds to get to B65 black is screwed okay how many trades does each side want does does white want a rook trade two Rook trades knight from Bishop trade it depends but normally if you're trying to win an end game you want to trade one pair of Rooks that's just like kind of like the magic number you trade too many Rooks your chances of poking and prodding might go down you keep all the roots on the board your opponent might be able to create counter play that's just sort of it varies but that's like a little nugget of information more often than not trading one pair of Rooks will contribute to a victory black wants to play G5 even if he succeeds in doing that you might play G3 however black is the only one on the board with an H Pawn which is something that white needs to pay attention to because in terms of simplification that H Pawn could become an asset for black and very annoying for white to deal with okay clear wonderful Rook d8 by the way you guys like uh being a little bit more instructional this video you liking that you notice that not making so many stupid jokes I had a long day I'm kind of tired I'm gonna record this and take a nap King E2 there Comes The King F7 played from you Ludwig King E3 King E7 and Magnus plays Knight E2 because his Knight wasn't going to make any forward progress from C3 so it's going to make forward progress from D2 and maybe he will also put this Pawn on B4 and then try to gallop in on his horse all right Bishop D5 attacks and now Knight D4 by the way you may notice you Ludovic did not rush with this move uh now again remember I told you trading all the Rooks you see what happens to the evaluation white doesn't have enough targets doesn't have enough pieces to exploit targets probably why it would have gone here and then Knight T4 would have kept the Rook on the board alright Knight here Bishop D5 Knight D4 G6 and now Rook H1 Hammer could have not played G6 okay when he played G6 his idea to meet this was just to create an impenetrable Fortress now Magnus plays B4 right now he plays B4 and the question is if you play B5 are you gonna survive probably not probably not because this Rook is so passive notice how Magnus has kept his pawns very flexible but very annoying annoyingly asking questions of the black position constantly look at this and the dark squared infiltration right we keep talking about this kind of weak collar complex King d8 played there B5 now and you Ludwig brings this King Magnus gives a check and the King goes to B6 but here's the thing white has found his infiltration spot take take Rook C8 even if there's nothing you can really attack yet like let's say black plays rookie seven you can't really attack anything but you have forward progress you have future prospects why do people give up any money now future investment or if they bought Bed Bath and Beyond stocks and gambled like idiots like myself but you know I digress um yeah listening to Wall Street bets on Reddit is good sometimes and awful in other situations so there you go uh rookie seven would have been okay but even though you can't attack anything white still has future opportunities to improve the position and then ultimately coordinate the pieces and start some sort of attack you'll replace A5 and Magnus plays Rook d8 Rook B8 and I think King C5 was a fatal mistake I think basically you and Ludwig had to do nothing he had to play the move Rook B7 here which is a ridiculous move Rook d8 threatens something very nasty it threatens the move uh basically threatens Rook D6 but essentially it threatens this this check and then you win this you have a pass Pawn you're gonna go here here and win the game what Rook B7 does is it stops that why because when the king moves the pawn is hit and apparently after rookie six Rugby 2 rookie 7 Rook G2 Rook H7 like it's a draw so hammer had to find the move Rook B7 he had to realize that he should not be defending this but instead he should be counter-attacking that and probably if he found Rook B7 he would have drawn because it's check and now the King has to go back and if Magnus had played instead of that B3 or something King C5 now and that Rook B7 probably would have held but as Magnus has done his entire career he asked a million different questions and like a very good lawyer he poked a hole in his opponent's story and they they completely fell apart now we have this the bishop is overloaded it cannot simultaneously defend the pawn 96 in the rook and B7 and I told you you don't want to trade Rooks but in this case you're up a pawn and it's not just any pawn it's a pawn that's three squares away from promotion H5 is a little bit too late E6 there's nothing you can do I'm gonna go E7 Knight D7 Knight d395 at any moment Bishop back to A8 Knight check Knight E5 and you Ludwig resigned because the bishop cannot go to C6 typical doesn't matter world champion or not doesn't matter I mean it does not matter he is a buzz saw of a chess player absolutely just I mean what like what do you even want I think this game was like a 100 accuracy or something I mean it was the opening was like a little bit of a gamble you know but uh yeah I mean he made a couple a couple inaccuracies here and there according to uh stockfish but it was yeah I mean what are you gonna do and so Magnus Carlson was set to play his final game this is the final game of Magnus Carlson's career as the world champion not his final game ever I mean he's he could be 70 years old and booting up uh on uh you know chess.com bullet pool or whatever but uh yeah Magnus is playing against his good friend David Howell uh and Magnus plays the opening that he plays all the Time in the World Chess Championship and that opening uh and we're gonna look at it from magnus's perspective out of respect now that opening is the Rue Lopez where you don't move your d-pawn why do you not move your d-pawn well traditionally you play D6 white plays H3 white plays C3 plays for D4 the reason you don't move your d-pawn is because after castles and white plays C3 you have not committed your Pawn to D6 and you can play D5 and D5 is known as the Marshall variation uh Marshall Gambit if you will because after ponte's Knight takes this Pawn is hanging completely hanging and take take rookie five now this is a viable way to play with black you are able to give away a pawn for two reasons number one this is all stuck white is three moves at least away from getting all those pieces out okay uh that's number one and so Black's position is wide open and black can take that opportunity to just go crazy number two uh this Rook is out here and that Rook can very much be a Target so for instance D3 Bishop D6 all right Queen H4 like look at this position this is terrifying stuff this is terrifying guys about to get mated over there right so you use the Rook as a Target so rookie five I told you there's a moment in every game that Magnus drops the opponent off at a bus stop or in the middle of the road now is that moment he plays Bishop to B7 and David Howell spends 10 minutes on his next move just like you and Ludwig right Bishop B7 is not a popular move I cannot speak to the intricacies of this opening uh but C6 is ridiculously more popular and there is a line after Bishop B7 which is really really really stupid looking that line goes Queen F3 painting the Knight and threatening to take now black plays uh Bishop D6 attacking The Rook now white takes this if this than this if this then this so now black goes here what so both things are now hanging The Rook now moves now you take now white goes here and uh yeah it's just this completely ridiculous looking position where black is a pawn down but he has what's called martial compensation he has more space over here and he's really only down a c pawn and let me tell you something right now that c Pawn is not scaring a damn person and black is going to go here threaten the pawn you know you're gonna play H3 G3 and then black is just gonna play like rookie eight and look at this position like she's gonna start firing these pawns down the board and white just never has a moment to breathe and that's why after like 30 moves of theory the game usually ends in a draw here's the thing about top level chess folks if both guys know the top engine move they're going to make a draw because they're basically the engine right so D4 is what uh Howell plays and then he comes back and Magnus plays rookie eight uh and in this position the most common move is Knight to D2 by white black plays Knight F4 attacking the pawn Knight to F3 Bishop takes F3 trying to remove the guard and there's been a few games won with G takes F3 and this King kind of rotating over essentially the structure is atrocious uh and the reason why by the way why that Knight is not just completely hanging uh is because you know you were attacking the queen so Knight F4 Knight F3 and so on and so forth David Howell here takes as you can see from his time expenditure he spent 27 minutes on that move he had absolutely no idea what the best move was because if you don't remember theory in this position it looks very very scary to play 92 like it looks like you're gonna lose my Checkmate okay so he plays rookie eight rookie eight uh Queen E8 now Knight A3 all right here's the thing about the Marshall position at the end of the day black is down a pawn so it's really hard on Chess at the 28 2700 level to be down upon and win you can be down upon and draw so Magnus plays B4 okay David takes Magnus takes all right now David's got to get these companies a couple of pieces out right he plays Knight C4 that's fine uh now this move looks really natural Rogue d8 looks ex but then just Bishop E3 so we have Knight C6 back attacking the pawn on D4 uh David moves It Forward Magnus jumps into the middle Knight to D4 and uh Knight E3 back and now Mike just takes on B3 and queen B3 here's again the problem counterpawns at the end of the day count the Pawns six for white five for black so it's like being up an attacker in football right or in any sport it's a big mismatch big big mismatch and the truth is these two pawns might fall for these two pawns and that Pawn's gonna be left but Max plays Queen B5 it's the best move but uh Queen C2 and uh you take the pawn back but look what we got we got Queen Bishop Rook we got Queen Bishop Rogue they're the same color Bishop it's three and two three and two and uh you know David David Howell is not a Gotham sub so he's not gonna hang a rook in one move so he just goes here and he gives and folks I think you know where we're headed with this bishop comes back to E5 still a little bit tricky but very very solid now it is dead deadly symmetrical completely symmetrical position and uh again short of one guy blundering mate David plays H3 Queen D3 and uh you do not have to worry about a queen trade the only thing you need to worry about is losing that pawn so David plays rookie one because Rook A3 will be met with Bishop C5 winning the game on the spot that is an oopsie so F5 G3 here come the Kings It's The End Game King G6 Rook C1 and David is ready to come down to C6 there's Rook A3 just Rook C2 and you ain't getting that pawn kicks Out The Rook brings his King a little bit forward and actually what's funny is that technically white did not play in the most accurate of fashion look at look at the time difference I mean this is how scary it is to play Magnus it's a completely equal position you are down 57 minutes on the clock all right if I had this with white I would probably find a way to lose even though everything is completely symmetrical David gives a check and now they have made 50 uh they have made the time control you see David's time go up back to 30 minutes they get the extra time and they repeat moves um there is absolutely no way to make any sort of progress here I mean if Magnus really wants he can try to play King D5 but you're not crossing the c-line ever and it was a hard fought game Magnus played an interesting idea but unfortunately it is hard to win on Demand with the black pieces in chess and he ends his classical chess career as the world champion with a draw against the good friend so kind of a nice little anime finish that well I don't know maybe an anime like a bunch of people dying you know histrionics and whatnot uh or whatever anyway that was the final game that Magnus Carlsen played as the world champion of chess on April 7th I would imagine when the first move was played in the next match that means we will have a winner so that technically is the day that uh he's no longer the world champion but probably the day that they crown it it will be the case what a career uh and I mean listen I think that if he ever wanted to play the candidates again it would uh be very exciting but uh he's in my opinion and I don't think it's a controversial one best player in the world I think that uh pointing him to world champion uh is definitely something that fide or the international Chess Federation has had the rights to do but I think we all know who the best player in the world is and uh is this uh gentleman from Norway and until he decides to completely stop playing or maybe enough time goes by that he gets so old that he can't compete with the youngcomers uh it's him but that was his final game as the official classical World chess champion get out of here
