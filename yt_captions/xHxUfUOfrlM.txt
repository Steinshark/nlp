I'm Levy Rosman and I'm joined now by the fourth highest rated uh woman in the world the previous Challenger to the World Chess Championship lating yeah from China thank you so much for joining me uh how does it feel to be in Toronto how does it feel to be back uh playing the candidates a tournament that you obviously have very good memories winning the last time that you played uh it is very great to be Toronto because this is my first time to come to uh Canada and uh also like for me this time uh this time for this candidate should be brand new experience for me because the last time it was like a knockout system and this time we're going to uh play together so I think it will be fantastic tournament for me do you prefer uh playing two times against seven people or is a knockout a little bit better or you don't know yet cuz we haven't really started hard to say you know okay last time I won maybe for me I think knockout system will be better for me but we don't know this time the results so hard to compare but you do have the unique Advantage at least of playing probably going through one of the most stressful experiences probably to any human which is playing a World Chess Championship Match I might be exaggerating slightly there's probably more stressful things out there uh but how has that experience helped you and what was the experience of playing in a world championship match like at some point you had a lead like there must have been some emotions such as I'm so close to being the world champion so can you just kind of take me back to the match and now we're over here yeah I I think uh last year for me it was like how I say like a had a lot of a good memory because for me also I think um I grow a lot from the tournaments especially also I had the final of the candidates and the championship match in the same year so for me I think um the result you know everyone wants to like become the world champion but for me I think losing the match for me I think how to say you can gain a lot of stuff even for chair and also for life so for me like this time for Toronto maybe it's like new star for me so I I will not consider about the past like maybe Lo losing the match like last year I will consider about a lot but now I think I just focus on the candidates right now would you say you're more relaxed uh or excited for the start I think excited yeah because uh you know different uh system and also you know first day arrive here and saw a lot of chess players already like kind of feeling like you excited to play chess when you when you're you know like let's say in the hotel or just around and you see uh fellow chess players is it sort of like when uh two boxers see each other before a fight or is it sort of more relaxed you know is it kind of like intense and you kind of want to to see how people are feeling and whether they're stressed or is it sort of polite and pleasant yeah I think generally like we see each other like uh maybe for breakfast and the lunch and dinner time so I think for chess players just should be like you know very relaxing time so especially I think I think in front of chessboard and then you can feel the tense for me just like this way I'm very curious I wonder also if if fans at home are uh about just the chess culture in in China because I I don't remember if it's the most recent one but I believe they won both olympiads and they have and and both world champions right like it was a clean sweep and so you know obviously when uh when Jan Jun was the was and is the world champion uh and uh ding won I thought it was going to be a really big deal but what is the media coverage like what is the just the general kind of attitude toward chess in China from young age to you know adults I think in nowadays A CH is kind of like most popular sports in China and also some cities put chess in like you have to learn when you got to school so I think it's kind of like good side for chess in China and I think also we won the both World chess champion in this uh last year and I think this kind of things and inspired a lot of uh kids to join us so do you think it's a bold prediction but do you think in maybe 5 10 years we see a similar thing happening in China like in India right now so like teenagers are becoming Superstars that takes time but could we see something like that in China where there's a group of 14 15 16 year olds becoming Grand Masters becoming 26 and 2700 and um are you hopeful for that I think so because I think atmosphere in I mean generally I think just atmosphere in China is growing up and because you know last uh three four years is very difficult for us and uh some people can't play chess you know abroad but now I think everything changed and I also I think they eager to play chess so I think um they will try their best and also like you know they also have their like uh how to say say I don't like thing or Jew and they also want to chase their dreams as they can one thing that I noticed that was interesting with your rating jart because going into this tournament I kind of took a look at just everybody what they've been up to I was shocked that your last maybe three events were World Championship then candidates and there's big gaps in the middle so is that just are you training during that time or is there because so many players are active like once every two months they're out and playing so I'm just curious are you sort of no I think it was a pandemic time and it's also very hard time and okay it's it's obvious that you also like a train at home but yeah I see okay but now at least it seems like things are kind of opening back up a bit more and you yeah like I think uh this year I will play a lot of tournament okay amazing obviously the candidates is is next um but uh and and the world championship after that like I I don't know I don't want to it's called jinxing I'm not jinxing anything but there might be another world championship um is a is another goal for you like ratings based is it 2600 do you have a a ratings goal in mind or is it simply the title generally for me I think uh I prefer to enjoy playing chess so for like this rating or title stuff for me it's not so important to be honest okay yeah okay that is uh that's I I think it's refreshing for people people to hear that cuz I think most chess fans even if they're complete beginners that's all they care about is uh getting from 7 to 800 or getting from you know even at at that level so uh just enjoy yeah playing it I could listen to this advice myself uh by the way I also get a little bit too stressed about that uh I've asked everybody today this question so I will ask it also to you uh you obviously love chess and you're very good at it is there something in your life that you really love but you're really bad at maybe playing some like badminton because uh previous years uh I really liked to play but maybe because you know some knees problem and uh I couldn't do it like very well yeah and also like uh I wanted to like swim very well but really bad but it's it's interesting right to be so good at the the thing that you do the most uh and um and then be completely terrible at something else so I I I do but most chess players who I speak to they enjoy it it's kind of nice and you have less stress when you're just really bad at something it's almost more enjoyable because you can yeah learn much more totally agree yeah last question for you would be what do you see as the do you think at all about and if you do think about it uh what will the future of Chess look like like is it a classical chess is it faster like this fast classical 45 minute uh is it Fisher random is what do you uh think the future will look like I think it will be like very interesting to see like combine CH like because it will like uh how to say need uh the player needs to like uh get to use it like every style it will be very interesting because like you can show a lot of stuff like maybe fissure and maybe classical maybe bullet together and you know it's amazing what is your favorite format maybe blit or rapid I don't know okay well candidates is classical so we'll uh we'll we'll we'll start there and I don't want to get thoughts of Rapid or Blitz I mean it's my favorite too but I I don't play so much seriously anymore uh I guess final thing is if you have any uh any thoughts you want to send to the uh fans watching back home before the tournament starts uh I want to say thank you guys and also enjoy playing chess and U thank you for all following us amazing thank you so much it was a pleasure best of luck in the tournament thank you very much
