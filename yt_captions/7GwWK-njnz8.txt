this is the aorist 15g gaming laptop and well yes it has the brand new Intel tenth generation chips as well as the RT X 2070 super graphics what I'm really excited about is what possibly could be the greatest keyboard ever put on a gaming laptop really the highlight here is absolutely this custom Omron mechanical keyboard and of course gaming pcs have been taking advantage of mechanical keyboards for a very long time however this is the very first time that I've actually seen a mechanical keyboard and a laptop it is something special with 2.5 millimeters of key travel while it is not quite as deep of a throw as what you would get with a sustainable you get all that tactile fuel so there's sort of a progressive click down and then you actually hear the spring compress and you do get the keystroke it means that not only do the keys pop up faster but well I mean come on if you ever use a mechanical keyboard you know the advantages - take a closer look I decided to pop off a key and give you a little bit of an inside look at what the key switch looks like well I can confirm that there is a little spring as well as of course a little plastic mechanism as well as something to kind of give you a nice clear RGB look but the downside is is that I broke the switch so if you would like to confirm that your laptop has a mechanical switch I would recommend don't touch it don't touch I got the key cap it's fine of course there's more to this laptop than just the excellent mechanical keyboard is this is the very first laptop I've had in the studio with the brand-new 10th generation Intel Core H processors now in Intel parlance h-series means that this is their sort of high-end gaming laptop variety SKUs and it's um a little different so unlike tenth generation on something like the XPS 13 that I daily everyday which is a much lower wattage part this is actually a continuation of the ninth generation which means that it is similar I suppose it is very very similar because it's still based on that older sky like architecture now running its due benchmarks it is a clear step up and this is the first time they brought eight cores to an i7 which means that this is actually roughly on par with last generation score I nine what it is not is a major step forward and it really does need to be a major step forward because when you look at it side-by-side with the zephyrus G 14 which I've recently done a video on which of course is powered by the brand new rise in mobile 4000 series it's not a particularly fair fight when you put these two side-by-side while of course they do compete in different weight classes this is a thinner 14-inch laptop versus a much thicker 15-inch design but when the most important things here is just to see how far the Andy has pushed the envelope on the Zen side of things so if I fire up send a bench on both laptops what you'll see is that while yes until does have a single thread advantage they can push up to 4.7 peer hurts pretty much sustained on this design when you but load up both systems with a very heavy 8 core workload what you'll find is that right now the ARS is sitting at did it again with my windows fix which you can see this guy sits at around 3.4 gigahertz on all eight cores with a quite loud fan because it needs a lot of power to hit that whereas this guy is chilling at 3.7 gigahertz with no stress a lot of that does come down to the fact that a and B are of course using a more advanced 780 meter process on the zephyrus as well as well specifically with the 4000 series of Verizon and there's also the fact that this rise in 4000 series is taking advantage of the Zen 2 core which not to get too far into nerd town but it is simply a higher performing core right the IPC is much much more powerful than the skylake base of the 10th generation Core H processor with all that being said this is a step up it is certainly a more powerful laptop and it is certainly a more powerful 10th Jenna than we had last time around and if it was in a vacuum it would be great unfortunately it's not in the vacuum and Andy is absolutely caught up in a big way feel free to check out my video on this Sepphoris if you want to know more about it but this really does put things into perspective it is very very fast however even tension isn't the only brand new thing with this gigabyte laptop is we also have a brand new in Vidia RTX super graphics on board now specifically this is taking advantage of NVIDIA GeForce r-tx 2070 super max Q graphics which I feel like Nvidia took a page out of samsung's book on that one but essentially this is a super version of the current r-tx 2070 cards but the main thing to keep in mind is that just with the original launch of the arctic's series for laptops you can't just look at the label right just because this has a twenty seventy Super Max Q it doesn't mean if you have a guaranteed level of performance because it could be running at 85 115 watts or anywhere in the middle and of course this is nothing revolutionary right I mean obviously you need solid cooling and a good system to support the chips that you have inside however with these art X chips and of course the super being even more powerful it means that you're going to expect to see pretty wide variances in the performance of 120 70 super laptop over another now all of that being said it works have actually done a very good job with this system as the 20 70 super inside actually boosts to at least in benchmarks above 20 80 max Q spec which technically it shouldn't but I believe this is probably running on the higher end of that TDP regardless though it's just one of those things where yes the super chips are more powerful but it's not a huge difference but you should really pay attention to each individual laptop don't just look at it and say oh it has the same i7 and 2070 inside when the actual results and the actual performance may be very different also a side note about the a or a specific tuning with this laptop they're taking advantage of the Microsoft Azure cloud ai which to be completely honest with you I don't know exactly how much the cloud component of this really makes a difference however if you right-click on this little gaming and professional icon here and turn on the learning you actually see a significant performance boost now essentially what this is doing is this is dynamically adjusting none of the power but also the cooling between your CPU and your GPU so for example if you're not maximizing your processor that actually may allocate a little bit of that juice over to your graphics card or vice versa well it doesn't make a huge difference on the processor performance i've actually seen a pretty noticeable gain in d graphics by turning that on and the side benefit of giving you the ability to not really have to worry about switching in and out of like different power modes like going up to performance or battery saving or whatever as it should pretty much handle everything by itself and that's actually ultimately very important because if for example I turn the fan up to the maximum mode you can hear that it is incredibly incredibly about like so aloud to the point where yes this technically should be faster but when you actually turn on the AI mode the fan runs slower and it's more powerful I'm turning that off that's that's just obscenely loud of course there's a whole lot more to talk about what they are s besides just the spec inside cuz it has a really solid 240 Hertz panel I love how that's just become like oh yeah you know gaming laptops with 240 Hertz and of course it's a 15.6 inch display it is 1080p what you're getting here is honestly a fairly well calibrated display so they are really proud of the fact that not only is a Pantone validated but each individual laptop is color calibrated at the factory so of course for the 240 Hertz display I have to try to actually game at that resolution so we're going to give csgo a try which is of course running at full max out 1080p settings we could lower a little bit if we want right now we're getting 170 FPS that is very smooth one of the things about these super high refresh rate displays is not only just the fact that they run at a high frame rate but often times they have very low latency and they have very little ghosting right so as I move back and forth obviously can't see this because YouTube video but it looks very clear and smooth okay well I die the same of course never stayed pretty consistent 183 fps let me actually turn some settings down a little bit and see if I can get us to a locked 240 I'm gonna see with pretty much everything turned down at 1080p oh okay by turning all my settings down and just crash my game cool that that's fine I'm not I will so it's actually kind of hard to hit 240 I guess maybe I could turn the resolution down but the thing is I have a hundred and eighty frames per second so I don't like here this is a really nice gaming experience though it is so smooth and that mechanical keyboard really does add to the experience right I mean obviously with a gaming laptop you never really expect to have like the greatest experience in the world with a keyboard and often times you may even plug in a mechanical keyboard yourself but having that built in actually does make a big difference next up we have a modern game which is truly cutting-edge and demanding on all hardware and that is f1 2019 I'm a liar that's actually not that difficult to run but you know what it is is this game I've been playing a lot lately so I'm gonna try it here I wanna see how close I can get to 240 so it should be a surprise to knowing that this is also a game which really can't take advantage of that super high refresh rate display I might lock the brakes up a little bit but importantly the thing what we're seeing here is a hundred and twenty five hundred thirty frames per second and mind you this is like ultra settings at 1080p right like I could certainly get more frames if I wanted to but I don't need to what I do need is something which is not a controller to drive right now cuz I feel like I have no consistency whatsoever here no gigabyte new yours are very proud of the design of this laptop which is all new for this generation and they will give them some credit it is actually a quite nice looking design I particularly appreciate the aluminum however there are some well certainly some trade-offs so with this larger design comes a fairly large selection of ports which is absolutely a good thing so now that we have the ability to support up to three 4k displays using HDMI mini DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 3 inside note I always like to see Thunderbolt 3 on any laptop but specifically something like this is it actually can be used as a fairly Creator focused system you have the SSDs you have the RAM you have the display which to be fair even though it's color calibrated isn't super high resolution but I mean you even have things like an SD card slot which is really nice that sounds light here though really certainly is just in the actual size of the system 15-inch laptops are fine but I am definitely someone who really values something which is nice and portable I carry on something which is super big thick and heavy all day long so she said but the ars does a good job of sort of straddling the middle it's also what she does have a good blend of features though including a fingerprint sensor built-in as well as a tiny webcam with a cover now I like the idea of a webcam cover built-in but I don't like is the positioning of this one so the webcam was in a normal place this is where I would be looking instead this is where the webcam is right in front of the keyboard so while yes this certainly is better than the complete lack of a webcam on these Zephyrus g14 but beyond that I mean yeah I like being able to just close this little flap open it up and protect my privacy I guess I just look bad I'll take a slightly larger bezel on the top it means that I don't have to look up my nose every time I'm on the webcam I absolutely love this mechanical keyboard once you go mechanical is very hard to go back and now that I've experienced mechanical laptop keyboards it is going to be really really tough to get used to anything else beyond that though they are is 50 G is a solid package those are ticks super graphics are a nice step forward and well the Intel 10th gender petter I still would like to see more there I feel like we're in a very interesting time where there's some legitimate competition in the gaming laptop space which is something we haven't really seen in quite a while so I'm curious would you buy a mechanical keyboard in your next gaming laptop let me know in the comments below absolutely make sure to subscribe for more videos like this and until next time I'm going to continue to try to fix the the key that I broke that was unfortunate
