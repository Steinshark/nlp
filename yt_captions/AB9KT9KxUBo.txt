if you thought this was crazy then what on earth is this that's the weirdest gadget i've ever seen so in front of us right now we've got 15 of the latest craziest smartphone gadgets and each one is going to be more impressive than the last so first up is a wireless charging pad with a twist because this thing is modular so depending on how many smart devices you have you can buy up to six separate modular fives and each one will just magnetically attach to the last cool concept but doesn't it just make more sense to decide how many charging pads you need to start with and then buy a charger made for that many devices as opposed to literally paying thirty dollars per pad if you go down this route i'll give this a five out of 10. but do you want to know what true madness looks like paying 600 for a wireless charger that's exactly what you're looking at right now it's got a frame made of literal solid aluminium the padding is genuine alcantara it's crazy heavy and it does feel luxury plus this isn't one of those pretty on the outside dumb on the inside type deals this thing actually uses a technology called free power which means that you can have up to three devices charging simultaneously and it almost doesn't matter where you put them on it i've even had my iphone partly hanging off and it's still charging but i would say that i don't think a wireless charger is a particularly good match for a luxury makeover like this because this isn't like with phones where you might pay like 10 extra to get the pro version you're paying about 10 times as much all for a device that if you're using it right you may actually never need to physically touch it yourself again but let's test it i'm going to put one iphone on this charger and then another iphone on the 30 modular 5. we'll check back later and see which one's charged up more so next up is the echo show 10 and it's one of the creepiest but surprisingly useful pieces of tech i've ever used at its core this is yet another amazon echo product which means i can use it to manage my smart home devices i can ask it the weather i can tell it to play whatever song i want it to but what makes this weird is that it's a 10.1 inch smart display attached via a rotating mechanism to an actually pretty capable smart speaker and it uses a combination of audio and computer vision to track you around your room i will say though as intrusive as that does sound being able to watch a movie or take a call without worrying about having to prop my phone up somewhere it's a luxury that i didn't realize i valued but it's pretty annoying that there's no youtube app here so you have to mess around with the web browser and that pulls you out of the whole hands-free experience right i think it's fair to say that every year smartphone cameras get just that little bit closer to pro cameras in fact last year was the first time i started shooting not just social posts but also parts of these videos using my phone instead of my actual camera well here's a product that i think is a natural consequence of this progression a motorized slider made with the smartphone in mind and for those of you who don't know that means i can clip my phone in and make this slider basically move it and rotate it however i out however i want to so this means we can end up with shots like this taken on a phone i have found it a little bit cumbersome though you know how we've got used to like everything happening at the snap of a finger this thing spends a full minute recalibrating itself every single time i turn it on still though solid 6 out of 10 over here and thanks to surfsharkvpn for sponsoring this video okay you've probably seen quite a few gadgets that are built to stick onto the back of your phone you've got those pop sockets there's phone wallets we've even had a speaker on one of these past episodes well now we have a gadget that allows you to stick anything onto your phone it's a very simple bit of engineering two pieces of plastic really one goes onto your phone the other on to whatever you want to attach and it keeps them close enough together that wireless charge can still pass between them so your phone can keep your earphones topped up on battery the only thing i'd say is that it's almost too well engineered the clip is so firm that the first two times i installed one of these i accidentally tore the glue off my phone trying to unclip my earphones anyways last one before things get really crazy this is prismo an rgb wireless charger and when i first saw it i kind of had to laugh it feels like the human race will not stop until there is rgb lighting on everything that said as i started using it i was disappointed in myself by how much i liked it it's got a grippy rubberized texture so your phone doesn't get scratched a solid frame and a whole load of rotating pulsing led modes is this an energy efficient way to charge your phone absolutely not is it cool yeah here's something about me i'm a massive tea guy you like i've literally been drinking this jam and toast stuff for about a month now and i think i finally understand addiction and so here we have a smartphone gadget that almost feels like it was made for me probably the most ridiculous mug that you've ever seen i mean apart from the fact that it looks like it's been stolen straight from the queen's fine dining set this is a smart temperature control mug meaning that i can pour my tea in set a temperature that i wanted to stay at and then for an hour and a half or forever if i keep it on the charging coaster it will there's a customizable led to tell you when it's reached your perfect temperature it can turn itself off when it knows that it's empty this thing is so far removed from a normal mug that i almost feel like it could benefit from having a few less features and a slightly more reachable price point but it is really really good almost a 7 out of 10. we'll give it 6.9 and if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be splendid now from a company called slick we've got an entire assortment of super premium smartphone holders which is not a category of products that i thought was missing from my life but they are really well made and they're not as expensive as they look i've got a bathroom stand an adjustable table stand and even one designed to go around a pillow and each one pairs a smooth matte finish with heavy metal construction and they're just generally good stands too i feel pretty reassured that when my phone is in one of these it ain't going anywhere it does kind of look like a dinner tray though let's just see how our wireless chargers are getting on that's very interesting okay we'll get there soon now one of the biggest tragedies of the smartphone market is almost undoubtedly the removal of the headphone jack because it's resulted in a lot of these headphone jack adapters however there's a company called helm audio who are basically saying that they've invented a gadget that turns this annoyance into a benefit basically for the longest time audio has been stored digitally there's a long string of zeros and ones but that doesn't really mean anything to our ears so to convert that back to music again it has to go through a digital to analog converter or a dac every phone has one of these but not all of them are great especially if they're from wish.com so this right here is a headphone jack adapter with a high-end dac built inside of it and as long as you're someone who uses a reasonably high-end pair of headphones and or you use a music service that supports high-fidelity sound it's just gonna feel like your music has more life to it anyways but this is where things get really interesting so about a month ago you might remember i played around with the device called the oppo find x3 pro it was a pretty forgettable phone for the most part but it had this microscope camera that just blew me away but turns out after a quick amazon search you can buy microscopes for any phone so this one here is apparently 100 times magnification a tiny little thing all things considered and it also has a light inside that turns on when you remove the cover and then coming in at at least five times the size this one's an adjustable microscope all the way up to 250 times and they actually work have a look at my desk here this is the closest i can get on my iphone normally but if we put this 100 times lens on have a look at this we can see levels of texture that i didn't even realize existed for perspective this is a side-by-side versus the original but what about this one i've got to say to start with because it's just so enormous the fit isn't as secure and because the barrel is so enormous it does cut off some of your image so you have to zoom in a bit on your phone but this is on a whole new level again original shot versus this so yeah surprisingly good but you know how i was saying earlier that smartphone cameras are improving really fast right well there's one aspect of them that's kind of leveled off a little bit the flash and so what you're looking at right now is the big softie aka smartphone flash done right it is super easy to mount not just on your phone mind you it could be a laptop too it's easy to control it charges with the same usbc cable as most android phones but most importantly it makes an enormous difference so this is video taken on an iphone 12 pro max using the inbuilt flash and this is taken using the big softie but this difference becomes even more pronounced when we move to the front camera because well most phones don't have a front flash module whereas if you're using a tool like this you can just flip it around this feels like definite 8 out of 10 territory obviously not everyone's going to want this fat thing on their phone but for anyone who does not really got much bad to say about it so there was a gadget i featured about a year ago and it's one of those that's just it's kind of stuck with me as part of my regular tech repertoire it's called the nextdoc and it's basically a cheap laptop but it's empty all it has is speakers and a battery but the idea is that you can power it with your phone anyways this is the follow-up the nextdoc touch which is exactly what it says on the tin it's a touchscreen version of that and that sounds subtle but it's the difference between it feeling like a cumbersome laptop and basically just a super sized smartphone and there's quite a lot of cool things you can do because of that for example proper touchscreen multitasking where you're not limited by the size of the display i can type sms text messages using a full keyboard and i have full control over my phone's cameras using this laptop which means that i can take selfies for example using the main quality cameras it's a bit odd but i can even answer calls using that set of cameras plus because it's one of the rare devices with an hdmi in port you can also use this thing as a portable travel monitor for a nintendo switch or even a ps5 my only criticism is that well of course it's a bigger screen it's probably not going to be a better screen than you'll already have on your phone it's only a 1080p lcd it's not special hardware but it is a special concept okay this is the storm 2 and it's quite possibly the most jacked power bank you've ever laid eyes on the one i've got here is a beta version so packaging isn't final but the product itself is ludicrous for starters i've never actually taken apart a battery bank myself so to be able to kind of see the internals like this spread apart big fan even simba likes it can i check the battery symbol oh they've even built their own operating system where you can see far more data than you probably care about and thankfully its performance also lives up to its demeanor this thing has a twenty seven thousand six hundred million power capacity so it can charge an iphone 12 pro max about five times over and it can both charge and be charged at the same time if you wanted to with a hundred watts of power that's crazy fast any more powerful and you wouldn't be able to take this on a plane the only thing is they do say this casing is super resistant against extreme high and extreme low temperatures but it does just feel like quite flexible plastic now if you thought that was crazy i'm about to show you something that that makes it look like a toy for toddlers we're not throwing this on this is the superbase 500 and at 449 i'm pretty sure it's the most expensive power bank we've ever had on the channel i mean at this point it's more like a power station let's be honest so given that an iphone 12 is about 2 800 million powers of capacity and given that a 13-inch macbook pro has about 5 000 million capacity how much do you think we have here 30 000 50 000 140 000 milliamp hours oh also it can power nine devices simultaneously including two through ac power ports capable of sending out 600 watts of power which makes this less about just topping your phone up more about being your entire power solution it's got a display up front to tell you its current capacity it can be recharged in five different ways and you can even plug in two cables at once to increase that speed further you obviously have to be a very particular type of user to need this kind of power but if you want it it's here right we've seen weird on this channel we've had wallpapers that crash phones we've had two separate run-ins with the escobar family we've had usb sticks that claim to create force fields around you this one's up there awesome unboxing experience i guess as you'd expect for close to 300 but you might be wondering what am i looking at here well these are smart shoes that sync with whatever music you're listening to on your phone and allow you to feel that sound through your feet yep now if that sounds ridiculous and kind of dumb then i totally get it because that's exactly what i thought too but then i tried them and oh i literally i meant to go on a 10 minute walk i ended up prancing around my room for two hours straight looking like an idiot if you're someone who is moved by music this feels like having a whole new dimension to it so much so that it kind of now feels like something's missing without them they have a built-in six-hour battery they're surprisingly good-looking and comfortable considering how much tech is packed into them you have full control over the intensity of impact and they even have latency compensation meaning that you can manually offset when the vibrations hit to make sure that they're 100 in sync with the music you're listening to they are heavy shoes but five minutes in i was too busy cutting shapes to really care okay let's have a look at the final scores for this charging test so on the modular 5 the 30 cheaper wireless charger but still not cheap the phone is on 74 charged on the expensive one 51 this is this is why wireless charging just it sucks but the takeaway is that if you do want to use a wireless charger then it's really tough for me to recommend a luxury wireless charger okay here's something to think about for a second your location your operating system every hardware detail of the device you're on right now as well as all your past browsing history these are things that you'd want to keep to yourself right well this is how much information a website immediately knows about you the second you click on it and to be honest if it's a website you trust it's fine but i think it's fair to say that there's a fair few that you wouldn't want to know this and that's where surfsharkvpn comes in as far as i've seen it's the most affordable way to keep yourself anonymous it's just over two dollars a month for as many people and devices as you want because the way it works is you can effectively pick the location you want your device to come from i can pick the us and watch us tv shows you can effectively have the exclusives for every single region without leaving your home like if i wanted to watch batman the dark knight i just switched to canada and i can do that so check the link in the description and use the code boss for 83 off and an extra three months for free thank you so much for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's
