[Music] hey what is up guys I'm cabby HD here and this is the week of CES 2018 me out here it is raining hi if you've never been to CES it's definitely a lot there is tech everywhere people everywhere and just overall a lot going on here in Las Vegas but among all that stuff there is some dope tech buried in there and that's kind of just been my mission this week to find it so one of the most buzz worthy news making things we've seen this year at CES is razor Project Linda and razor they tend to get all kinds of attention at CES for something they're showing every year this year is this it's a concept laptop that uses the razor phone as a brain / trackpad so this actually isn't a totally new idea like we've seen smartphone convertibles into laptops before it's just never really been wildly successful Razer hopes to do itbest no of course because of the razor phone's prowess it's already an awesome phone with great speakers so it doesn't have to have extra speakers and the laptop things like that doesn't need a processor or Ram it's just using the razor phone in fact the only hardware actually in this Lynda laptop are the RGB keyboard because of course the battery a webcam up top and a couple ports the headphone jack USB C for charging and full size USB a on the other side for adding accessories like a mouse bo than that it just pops the razor phone in and out with a single button it sits flush it has the matching color with the Razer Blade stealth laptop has this little notch cutout at the front that uses the fingerprint reader and the power button from the phone I think the design is actually pretty well thought out it's just debatable if this is actually a practical product or not at all now for Lynda there is no price range or release date yet it's a pretty common trend for stuff we see at CES but I do really like the design I think it's really interesting it's just weird to build an entire accessory like that all around a smartphone that's probably going to be updated in a year like in 910 months when we see you raise your phone to is this whole laptop people just bought for their phone gonna work is compatibility gonna work do the dimensions stay the stain that kind of thing that's a tough I'll keep an eye on that now I also made it to senators booth and they were showing exactly one thing that I was super interested in and it's the whole reason I went which is Sennheiser HD 820 so I just showed like the custom HD eight hundreds I've been using for a while bison eyes are in my last video the set up tour but these will allegedly take that to a new level by isolating sound with the glass over the back of the ear clubs you can see it it's this concave Gorilla Glass so basically they retain a lot of the characteristics of open-back headphones like the HD 800 s that big drivers the open nature of it the wide soundstage but it now seals you off from the noise on the outside of your environment for people who don't want to hear all that so this I am definitely interested in I was able to listen to them for a bit I can confirm they sounded incredible but yeah I'd love to actually get these into the studio and put them to work they look incredible they will be selling these and they will be expensive I'm thinking two to three thousand dollars super expensive headphones and then over in a hotel near the strip I also found HTC's set up pretty interesting where they're showing some new announcements to HTC vive la do you might not know I've used the vive headset a lot we have one in the studio and they announced two pretty important things one is they now make a vive pro which is this all built into one headset with headphones and the strap over the top a high resolution display inside better tracking basically it's a much improved VR experience for those who want the best of the best you can also still buy the regular original HTC vive but then number two they showed an HTC vive wireless adapter which sort of looks like this bug antenna on your head that plugs into the headset but this is a game-changer because it tracks just as well but now allows you to walk around completely untethered from your computer normally you're plugged into your computer and you just kind of happen to hope you're not tripping over all the cables when you turn around and things like that with this basically you just have to plug into a battery plus it in your pocket and it'll last a couple hours with something like this a small three thousand milliamp power battery but obviously you can plug into something a bit bigger if you're gonna be gaming for a longer time so that was pretty cool I think people who use the vive will find that wireless adapter pretty great you can use the wireless adapter with the old five or the new vive Pro also I'm aware that using their screen set for that kind of opens people up to mess with the footage but I guess too late to change that all right some other things razor also at their booth head this pretty ridiculous looking pair of desktop speakers and a subwoofer they look pretty badass they of course had RGB again at the base because you know RGB but I have no idea how good they sound because it's way too noisy on the show floor but I'll be interested in checking those out Audio Technica also brought a lot of new stuff that like 10 new pairs of headphones and their booth some gaming headsets I'm open back some of these Wireless noise cancelling headphones that look like they're aiming to rival the Bose QuietComfort series then they also let me try out their top-of-the-line ATX 5000 so $2,000 open-back headphones and don't get me wrong they sound great but they're open back so I'm on the show floor where it's super noisy suppose there's no way I can fully appreciate them quite yet but pretty much all of these are going on sale soon if they haven't started already there's also tons and tons of drones at CES one weird when I didn't expect was in a Yamaha booth it was massive it looked about the size of like three people put together I know about zero other information about this drone other than it looked really cool look like they can go about 200 miles an hour but that's just me looking at it but what was really cool in their booth is this which is a self-balancing motorcycle which didn't really impress me at first when I first saw it until I realized those side wheels aren't touching the ground this bike is completely standing on its own on two wheels and that guy is pushing it around and it's just kind of responding by shifting its weight and staying upright that was a pretty cool demo but speaking of those drones DJ eyes booth also had some pretty cool stuff as they usually do including their Osmo mobile - it's a much cheaper stabilization than the original Osmo something like 50 60 70 bucks cheaper than the original super lightweight but it still does pretty much all the same stuff smart phone control a nice handle a grip for video or an emotes start/stop I can see a lot of people picking this up and this is of course also actually going on sale but so far in the first day I've been here that is what I've seen that looks pretty cool but literally as I'm uploading this I'm probably literally back to the show floor to check out some more stuff so if you see cool stuff that you think is worth showing on video or checking out or exploring hit me up on Twitter send me the link if you're on the subreddit send it there too I'm checking that now and that's pretty much it see you guys back out in vase thanks for watching catch you in part 2 talk to you the next one please
