Unity got a little bit of trouble pretty much yeah Unity got in a lot of trouble okay so Unity is planning a pricing and packaging update now you'd think okay maybe they're adjusting their prices a little bit well it turns out it's not quite that way effectively January 1st 2024 we'll introduce a new Unity runtime fee that's based on game installs we'll also add cloud-based asset storage Unity devops tools and AI runtime at no extra cost to Unity subscription plans this November in other words it sounds like you still get all the same payments you're currently making to unity plus when games are installed you also get a little bit you know what I mean you you get yourself a little bit of an extra little bonus fee as many of you know the unity engine is in fact two substantial software components the unity editor and the unity runtime the runtime is code that executes on Player devices and makes uh and makes made with unity games work at scale with billions of monthly downloads billions we are introducing the unity runtime fee that is based on upon each time a qualifying game is downloaded by end user we choose this because each time a game is downloaded the unity runtime is also installed also we believe that this initial install based fee allows creators to keep the ongoing Financial gains from player engagement unlike Revenue share try to help me here just because I'm trying to understand it so with Revenue share that means you've made re you've made money with charging up front it currently means you've made no money am I correct on this understanding here Net versus well well no no because on a download you could have made zero dollars you actually have no reason to believe you've made any money am I am I getting this wrong keep reading it has qualifiers okay okay okay okay okay okay okay they're saying qualifying yes I've heard this hold qualifying um the problem with qualifying as simple as this there exists some sort of line right in which Unity has made right this is like downloads right I don't know this is time we'll call this time this is downloads this is time and it slowly goes up over time right you hope you have some sort of good growth so typically what they do is they they pick some sort of optimized point for you or they say okay starting here we are going to get a small amount of your of your money made right it's gonna grow proportional to what you've done typically that's what we're going to be seeing here now this number has been optimized the problem with this is that this number if they need more money just goes backwards and so what is a qualifying game this you know these kind of things always worry me because I really like indie games and I really hate how shitty mobile apps have become to just try to make money Revenue share makes sense runtime fees make zero sense that's that's my initial reaction and I don't want to be incorrect here so let's let's keep on reading let's first make sure we understand from Unity what they are saying okay because it also sounds like because when it says this we're introducing a new Unity runtime fee it also sounds like they maintain their previous fees plus a new one all right the threshold games qualifying uh for the runtime Unity runtime fee or after two uh certain oh my goodness okay let me just start again flip edit that out I don't know what happened there I just accidentally the bed games qualifying for the unity runtime fee after two Criterion have been met the games have passed a minimum Revenue threshold in the last 12 months and the game has passed minimum lifetime install count we set Revenue uh we set High revenue and game installs threshold to avoid impacting those who have yet to find scale meaning they don't need to pay the fee until they have reached a significant success okay what is that only games that meet okay let's see let's see what the let's see what it is Unity personal and unity plus those that have made 200 000 USD or more in the last 12 months and have at least 200 000 lifetime game installs I will say that that's actually pretty nice at least that you don't get charged for a good a good amount to begin with but I mean also Game Dev is a horrifyingly difficult situation right and so this is trailing 12 months so that's could be nice uh Unity Pro and uh Unity Enterprise those that have made a million dollars USD or more uh in the last 12 months and at least a hundred or a million lifetime installs the thing I don't like about this is that it's it's upon installation because you know what like the reality is is what's the value of an install well it's not really realized unless if that person actually plays the game I really don't like this idea right flexibility and discounts for Unity personal Pro and Enterprise okay hold on with this new policy as of January 1st okay let's see we will offer Unity personal to anyone regardless of how much revenue they make to provide more flexibility in how creators manage their licenses once a game passes the revenue and install threshold the studio pay let's see the studio would pay small flat fee for each install okay what is that it's a Unity personal let's see what what is it still pretty expensive okay so if you're on Unity personal or Plus you get 20 cents per install so let's just do a quick little bit of math let's say you make a million download game and it happens across that 200 000 threshold in in value met let's just say let's just run the numbers really quickly let's just say you're on a personal plan you created a game that's successful it gets let's just say 10 million downloads you're only on personal and it's made a grand total of two hundred and one thousand dollars you would only be able to net negative 1.8 million dollars I never even thought about reinstalls are they insuring what happened if you switch devices that's just a yet another install so wait a second you could actually you could actually lose money making a game dude I've heard that the gaming industry is hard but damn I didn't think I'd have to pay millions of dollars just to make my stupid Flappy Birds oh Lana Lux is here Lana dude can you join the stream and talk to me a little bit about this my assumption is you probably have the best take on this stuff because you you have the most familiarity of anybody I know when it comes to Unity and all this how long have you been working on Unity for well I've been streaming in full-time Unity for seven years but I've been like using it as a hobby for even longer so I've been really using Unity for like quite a while now so you you you're familiar one could say you're familiar uh how have you put any games out how many games have you put out I've put out a bunch of like small games and I put one out on Steam a few years ago but I've been working on one for three and a half years that's getting close to the end um so but I'm like you know this game has to stay on Unity so I'm I'm bound to Unity right now I know a lot of people are like oh well I continue to use Unity there's it's not really a question for me because I have a game that I I can't just port to something else after three and a half years right yeah don't you have like a really nice uh straight uh strain trailer that's your that's the game you've been doing right yeah I put a few trailers out yeah uh this one from which one would you which one can I take a quick look at so people can see some of your work videos you can just link it in the chat if that's a good one because I think it'd be kind of cool just to see so people understand when you say you're making a unity game you put some serious effort into when when we say this this is not something you can just easily switch over like oh I'm now a Godot Dev right exactly so you want me to drop in the chat yeah yeah you could just drop it uh drop it in the twitch chat there you go all right hold on I might have to turn you down I don't know how sometimes these things get loud this is kind of loud yeah and so what what is this game can you describe it a little bit Yeah so this is the first person single player Survival game with a narrative element so this is like the teaser trailer just to show the mood of the game you know it's like probably played a survival game where you walk around go to collect resources explore fight off like you're in an apocalyptic City so you're gonna find of other scavengers and create a little Bass by yourself there's like building crafting uh all the classic Stuff Plus and their development as well so that's that's the game I've been working on it's called strain it looks fantastic the lighting is out of this world thank you thanks Unity yeah thanks Unity so you you obviously plan to be affected by this or at least you hope to be affected by this policy in some sense because you would like a successful game right exactly yeah it may not apply right if you don't reach a certain thresholds but it is something that is on every dev's mind I think because that's what you reach for that's what you hope for yeah you hope you can reach the threshold so paying Unity was looked at as a success I assume at one point in your life is that fair say that again is before all this was paying Unity meaning that you've actually made something successful no not necessarily because I mean I guess so because you I mean I paid for the plus version even before you put the game out I was paying for it but you only need to pay for that plus version I guess after you reach a threshold so I suppose that you don't you only need to pay before but you there's reasons to pay otherwise okay okay so the game looks great really cool little moment here that by the way that Spinning Wheel I've thought about that scene like 18 times for those that didn't see it that's scene it's just so it just it's just so effed up uh lose a limb I think about that constantly like I have thought about that one scene in this because I watched this trailer when it came out I have probably thought about this a hundred times since then as like this is just the future of Mad Max the future nobody ever wants are you worried about death by bubbles I'm worried about death by bubbles death by bubbles is so grotesque I'm not even sure what it means so I you know it's just like I can't even put it in a box so I'm okay but but the other one I can put I I know what it means and I don't want that I don't want this and I want those either all right so great it looks good now I assume you probably have at least a couple opinions here on this whole Unity thing uh you want to kind of uh you want to give me your thoughts on this yeah sure so I'm I'm just getting in so I'm not sure if you uh I'm not sure what you've covered yet or not we've looked through this I've kind of gone through this and it made me realize that when it comes to install since there's no technical reason why you have to charge on a game download uh it means that on a personal Unity plan you could easily accidentally make negative money yes there is a concern about negative money and that is that is my biggest concern because the the structure is actually not that bad so if you look at it and you compare it to something like unreal I actually think it's it's better if you look at it with the perspective of you pay per sale okay pay per sale that would be actually a pretty decent structure because then if you like let's say a cell strain at twenty dollars a game and I'm paying two cents on each sale and the threshold is two hundred thousand sales that's um that's four million dollars before I pay anything so that's actually not bad and then the amount that you actually pay if it was per sale is better than the five percent that unreal charges so in a way the structures hypothetically not bad but the concern is about the per install because they put out a blog post saying that it is that reinstalls are counted which means not only could people just casually uninstall and reinstall and now you're paying multiple dollars per user per purchase but it's also there's a risk of kind of fear concern for devs of people like um hate installing right or like oh interesting no so and then on top of that there's also piracy which has been raised as concern but the responses have not been comforting right responses were not like okay piracy is not going to be counted if we heard that I think we'd be feeling a little bit better about it but without those concerns addressed this model is very risky and very concerning and um I I just hope that they they backpedal and change it I really hope that they change the per read downloads count re-downloading counts um and I hope that they address the piracy thing but I think the biggest thing that's a problem for a lot of devs is that it just came out of nowhere and nobody was really expecting this and a lot of people feel like really betrayed by it because you like someone like me I've been paying monthly at a rate expecting that that's the amount of paying to use this and to put a game out I'm not working on this game I'm not using a product with the expectation of this and now we don't really like you don't expect your software to suddenly start charging like imagine if every time somebody watched your stream they had to pay five cents now or you had to charge five cents to that or like you know I mean it comes out of nowhere so now you have to like account for it I feel like and it just being like and now we're doing it in just a few months if it was like in a few years we're gonna be we're going to be rolling this or like slow transition into this I honestly don't think it's a bad model I kind of get it I get it there big game company just like unreal and they they need to make more money accessible games yeah I get it but I think that the way it's being done is like very concerning for a lot of devs and a lot of people have lost faith in this yeah well I mean first off like the the personal one just seems high uh in a sense that I mean I would assume that a lot of personal games are these free games that try to make money off of ads they're pretty simple they're tower defenses they're whatever and I don't know how much money you make off of an ad but I assume it's something similar to YouTube where you're making a couple dollars per thousand ads shown something along those lines which is not necessarily that's not going to easily add up to this number quickly and so it kind of feels like they're pushing people towards this this tier at least that's my current initial take is that it's it's a push towards go to your you wanted them on Unity Pro because then the fee is obviously much much smaller which I think a lot of people probably couldn't just start paying more I assume it's a lot more than personal and uh yeah I think it's thousands per year for pro I don't know offhand exactly but it's definitely a lot more than personal which is about 30 bucks a month okay yeah and that's very doable versus obviously these get a lot more expensive but then I never even thought about hate installing like that yeah that's it's weird to give people that power to bankrupt somebody yeah exactly that's the concern i i i i it's as messed up as that whole loser limb on the wheel like I can't now I can't stop thinking of about that because you know there's there's antes aunties are a real thing I didn't really realize aunties could be a real thing and you know you you eventually get some antes in real life and you go oh wow there's actually people that would just do something intentionally to hurt you and so yeah this seems dangerous and reinstalls seem nuts and piracy I mean charging for piracy seems that just seems like such a kick in the gut um yeah because your arms it is you're already not making money and then they take it from you anyways you're like come on you'd hope you hopefully you can because now so I guess a follow-up question I assume all these numbers are post the 200 000. yes so once you hit that 200 000 a year then the next 100 000 would be 15 cents from 100 000 to 500 would be 0.75 cents and then it just kind of goes down as you as you cross like a graduated tax scale yeah yeah so I guess the real question is do you continue to use Unity after this like once strain's completed you feel good you move on to your next game do you continue to use Unity or do you search for other options honestly that's not even on my radar I'm just like what am I going to do with strain because the game's meant to come out within hopefully within a few months and now I'm concerned about the installation I'm I'm thinking if they don't change what they've put out on these blog posts um like assuming if it does really well let's say it's it's about to make two hundred thousand dollars and it's about to reach that threshold I might have to like stop selling it at that point so that I don't risk the over um installation problem that that's the only thing I can think of to not be exposed to the risk of multiple installs and like people are smart they can figure stuff out not to mention the piracy thing unless those things are like really covered well and like I'm not concerned about it then I don't I don't really want to be like because like it could go to millions and millions like and then you're paying for that like I don't I don't know well especially with steam like steam can give you there there has to be some identifying credential that is sent up from Steve being like hey you know Bob is reinstalling reinstall you know there must be a reinstall event or something they could work out here because I mean real talking I've installed uh uh what's called Elden ring six times on my computers I was installed I've run out of room all the time I'll install games reinstall them I've installed singular games multiples of dozens of times like many times I only have a terabyte of computer memory and every now and then I want to play Call of Duty that's like half my memory and so it's like things are getting uninstalled for me to play Call of Duty one time right exactly that's interesting it's very interesting I guess I didn't think a lot about a lot of these things all right do you know anything about uh because I saw someone also commenting on Twitter about uh them breaking some privacy violations you're in Canada right I don't know if Canada is the same um privacy violation requirements as Europe uh but for sure actually that would be interesting are you talking about the privacy rules of installing software that monitors whether or not um even installed it or yeah there's a lot because they have to keep some identify or some some pii some personal identifiable information to be able to track any of these things to know that you're installing it and so I'm also curious about that if there's real concern or is that Twitter concern honestly that's not something I'm even like I'm not familiar with the laws and the rules and I don't know how that would be handled either okay that's EU concern EU concerned we'll let them we'll let them worry about that that's not for me all right last and I think I think most important question is are you coming to twitchcon I'm not no I wish it was too much game development to do you know okay I guess you are technically releasing a game at pretty much the same time yeah what an excuse no okay well it would have been great to have you there but yeah we'll have to meet at another conference sometime next year's 2024. sounds good all right well thanks for talking to us about this yeah nice chatting take care all right thanks Lana bye you're welcome bye all right so this is interesting so now that we know kind of the Unity part of it uh there was some other things let's see if we get let's let's at least look for one more little item in here let's go over one more article I'm gonna look for like the top voted uh comment here and try to understand what's happened sorry I refreshed it twice I mean 2 000 shares come on this is you dude first off don't ever try to put these things these two things together I guarantee you that when they when uh this John fella uh went to go sell his shares first off 2 000 shares he has a total let's see uh in the past year he sold a total of 50 000 shares okay so first off that's nothing but second off when a CEO does this of a publicly traded company it's like there's like a sixth month lead time or something like all of these have been put in to be sold months upon months upon months upon months ago so they don't don't read in too deeply to that uh that that them selling shares is them pre-planning the death Spike like as as yet he owns 3.1 million shares trust me selling 0.07 of your shares the global Elite establishment or time again right exit scam it's it's not it 0.08 yeah rug pull confirmed right don't don't be too worried about some of those things right whenever people get all up in arms about that I I always go okay we've hit we've hit like too much Peak that's called Twitter don't let Twitter rot your brain out right major update for me today about their fees Unity regrouped and now says only initial installations of the gall uh of the game trigger fees okay let's go demos mostly won't trigger fees [Laughter] desert not on the hook for Game Pass okay that last one's really good I love that that devs are not on the hook for Game Pass but you gotta be me demos mostly won't count capitalism was a mistake all right so I I think it's really interesting so I think for our not since we let's see why do they have to uh morons in charge of making these decisions do they not reach out to the community see that's the thing is that okay this is my actual like real thought process of what happens here is that the companies think that if they talk about charging they're gonna you know it's gonna cause a whole problem and they're not gonna be able to do it so instead they just start charging literally that's what I think it is they don't actually just simply go okay we have to make more money therefore we need to find a new way we would like to change our thing and we're thinking along this stuff what are some things that are concerning for you right so write an article seems right yeah like what are the things concerning for you what can we do to make sure that it's not concerning for you really virtue it really is I I genuinely think they they just like you could have avoided all of this like just like Lana said she's not necessarily against it it's still cheaper than uh than unreal which I think is is a good point it is a cheaper version than unreal because five percent adds up quickly at four dollars you're more than the personal plan right so Unity five is very expensive yeah write your own engine um not cheaper than Godot fair but not as good as Godot okay Unity is pretty good okay if my dumbass can make a video game in unity it's pretty good right it's pretty dang good uh uh to me it's pretty straightforward hello Community we are running out of money how can we make this work yes and you can say that I think you should be able to say that without the world blowing up and so for me it's the problem of being a publicly traded company right a publicly traded traded company is a really bad place on this you should get Lana lux's take on this she did she came on the stream and gave a take you just missed it you know it'll be in the YouTube video but to me it seems like it's a really good move to make things make sense and talk to you know talk to people first and then and then go from there and so obviously the re-downloads should have been an obvious one pirating obvious one hate downloads obvious one right you've got to figure out a way to do something with those and so that seems good the whole the rest of it that that demos won't probably be charged that was like the funniest line I've ever seen so let's read this okay let's read this next one right here uh Unity rushes to clarify pricing okay Unity the tech company behind the most popular game engines for creating video games and scrambling to clarify how price increases uh increase for its services will work after its announcement Tuesday morning yeah which broadly yeah made everybody upset all right hold on give me the details okay the new runtime fee announced Tuesday morning is tied to players installation of the game an action that previously didn't cost developers anything yeah I think this is a reason why people really liked you know Unity I think also adding a new charge to something that people paid to not have to pay right they pay for these you know Enterprise licenses these really expensive licenses such that they don't have to pay for this as the you know inverse of the Unreal Engine and then to get that later on probably feels you know it feels like a low blow unity's new plan developers uh who use the unity's free tier of development services would would owe Unity 20 cents per installation like that's a lot and it starts at 200 000. so let's see and 200 000 earned in Revenue developers paying over two two thousand dollars a year for Unity Pro Plan would have hit higher thresholds and would be charged lower fees the new e system will begin at the start of 2024 yes but game developers uh rallying on X began fuming immediately that any game enjoying a spike of installations due to a big sale or say a streamer let's just say me not me let's just say doctor disrespect the real the real deal okay let's just say he decides to play a game like always up right think about always up it went from nothing to like the most downloaded game in a second or Among Us went from nothing to everything in just right like these things like think of the refunds right like there's a lot of there's a lot of things that you have to think about when it comes to this you know vampire survivors right like you make a little fun game that relies on ad Revenue it's kind of cutesy you're making some money oh my goodness I spent a thousand hours and I've made a hundred thousand dollars look at this I've made a game where I got paid a hundred dollars an hour to do this sure probably not as good as web dev when you consider you know 401K matching stocks Healthcare all that stuff but still I did it I made it myself this is amazing and then Unity is like but now Kaboom right so I could see that being a really that's a really tough time uh okay so where's the clarification I don't want to read between the lines where's the clarification game developer okay hold on uh stop it uh development Studio inner sloth makers of the hit Among Us uh tweeted Tuesday evening this would harm not only us but fellow game studios of all budgets and sizes yeah agreed another Studio Argo crab called on Unity to reverse its plan saying that it feared that its next game set for release uh to the 25 million subscribers on Game Pass would occur fees that threaten the stability of our business these are all great things the Intrigue Unity has scrambled to clarify uh and in one key case uh alter what it has said about its policies okay can can we just can we effing just see can you just show us the thing okay the end let's see uh let's see zoom in after initially telling axios earlier Tuesday that the player installing a game deleting and installing again would result in multiple fees unity's uh witton told axios that the company would actually only charge the initial after the or the initial installation okay good a spokesperson told axios that Unity had regrouped to discuss the issue it's a that's a very fair issue this is such a fair issue right you know what I mean so uh he hoped this would uh uh La fears uh of install bombing where an angry user could keep deleting and restarting again to rack of fees yep yep okay good so hate hate installing doesn't really exist uh how do they not think see that's always a worry for me that's always a worry is when you have people in charge who are running a ship and can so thoroughly not understand the thing that they do right it's the same thing with twitch problem right twitch is inundating you guys with ads I love the fact that you guys have given me literally so many Subs so that you don't have to watch uh what's called ads but at the same time it's like twitch also has to realize like that's also a huge drain on users so like pre-roll ads are awful right pre-roll ads make it so that users don't want to watch other streamers it destroys discoverability it destroys raids right you get rated somewhere and you get hit with an ad first like that's really that's like not a good thing right it's like they don't think about these things and it's like you don't use the product and that's what you know just recently I've been seeing the CEO of twitch has started his own channel and he's playing music and singing and I saw him he had like 70 users I went and saw it for a moment I thought it's really good he's experiencing what it takes to build an audience to be able to use twitch to see what people have to say and just be an anonymous Andy trying to build something right I think that that's really good doing that and it's going to help the company overall actually use it uh and I think that's what made blizzard games so good is that back in the day blizzard games were played and it was a requirement that you had to play the out of Blizzard games to work at blizzard that's why early World of Warcraft Warcraft 3 Warcraft 2 they were amazing right they were amazing games and then it stopped being amazing and now they have people on Diablo 4 incoming ad Break by the way uh they have people on Diablo 4 that are showing off the game and they don't know how to play the game and they literally work on dungeons they work on the game and they don't know how to play the game right it's just like what is happening here right like what is happening that like that you can't make a good product if you don't believe in the product itself that's like one of my one of my core fundamental beliefs other than like if you're writing like it's just a belief it's just a blade bite I can't think like it's hard for me not to believe that right anyways he says well pay I pay for Netflix I use Netflix I report bugs I think of reasons why I hate it I'm motivated to improve performance on the Netflix application despite us being the best performance application out there I still want better so that's why we watched wheel of time together that's why we watched wheel of time together baby anyways so this is just what I see is I see a studio that the people in charge don't know their users and it always makes me sad seeing this because I really do think that it just it hurts it hurts the experience all right read between the lines runtime fees will also not be charged for installations of game demos Wynton said unless the demo is part of a download that includes the full game Early Access games would be charged for an installation he noted I mean somewhat fair I guess like if you download the whole game but if it sucks because the person's not actually committing to your game you know okay gray area I'll give them a gray area I'll give them a gray area on that one still hurts it still hurts uh it still hurts I think it would be better by them to Simply only charge for full installations right it still makes it feel like you're on the developers team but hey we also got to make money to pay for all these great Services because Unity is a great it's a great product games offered for charity or included in Charities will be exempt from the fees how do you uh I mean that's some pretty tight integration with um with steam uh Unity will provide a way for developers to inform Unity that their games are being offered that way okay okay as as for Game Pass and other subscription Source Services a witton said that developers like aggrocrab would not be on the hook as for the fees are charged to the Distributors which are in the game pass example Microsoft that just means you you you pay for it that's all that means you now pay for it right that's just what that means you pay for it like I'm all about Microsoft getting kicked in the groin every now and then you know I'm a big fan of Microsoft groin kicking so I laugh for a little bit when I read that sentence but yeah this is me right here oh shoot that poor distributor uh you know what unity's doing right here what Unity is doing is just it's just not okay it's just not okay [Music] anyways game pass price is about to go up everybody that's what that means game pass price is going up it's going up um let's see it's still the best way for hobbyists to get into game death yeah you have to make yeah I know exactly so like it's it's not so what I what I'm reading right now is that it's I think Twitter is probably not a great reaction I think Lana Lux made a lot of good points and I think them turning around on reinstalls is a great thing there's still the whole thing of piracy which I think is a real concern and people should really take that reel um does that affect the bottom line you know what I mean Microsoft just buys Unity boom is the oh my goodness okay bye everybody everybody get in we got we gotta we oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness Alex Jones moment Alex Jones moment people I'm a Pioneer I'm an explorer I'm a human and I'm coming I'm animated I'm alive my heart's big it's got hot blood going through it fast I like to fight too I like to eat I like to have children okay hear me out hear me out on this one hear me out hear me out my camera's crooked I can see that it's crooked but but but but real talk what if this is a play to get acquired by Microsoft I'm just saying there's something going on and I think I'm desynced I am decent we'll fix this in post-production oh I can't even look at myself if I see myself if my lips are not matching up with what I'm saying and I'm gonna throw up I'm gonna throw up I'm throwing up anyways uh I think I got decent I don't know what happened Alex Jones literally ruined this not Financial advice this is not Financial advice this is peer conspiracy again okay this is conspiracy agent everyone's upset about this but everyone's gonna accept it yeah because the Alternatives it's not like the alternatives are better Godot is not Unity Bevy is just not going to be Unity okay trust me you're not gonna get a bunch of people going from C sharp to unit to to Bevy easily all right it's just not a real transition um I don't think a doe is the same level as Unity it's just not you know what I mean it's just not there okay um it has no console support so everyone's gonna probably just accept this but at the end of the day I'm glad that Unity at least listens to concerns I really do hope that people like Lana Lux and other people creating great Indie content that takes years of their life that we literally have the receipts for you can go on Lana's stream and just see just literally thousands of hours of work on Unity okay I mean like literally we can go to twitchtracker.com Lana Lux I mean look at this eight hours six hours four I like this is all work on our game like look at this this is this is literally hundreds of hours streamed all right ridiculous so resurrect XNA that's the option so it's like that's a lot of work that's a lot of work it's a lot of work to make a game and so six point two thousand hours yeah she's a plus and so it's like I want to make sure that like people like her who are putting in and making great content have it you know what I mean games from scratch that's cool I mean I know it's possible but it doesn't include everybody to do this okay writing your own game from scratch is extremely difficult it's extremely difficult hey come on be better all right one last let's let's look at one more uh one more article here Unity wants 108 of our gross revenue at one oh my goodness they're on Enterprise oh my goodness they're literally on on Enterprise they're literally on Enterprise they get one percent and they have all their revenue gone just do the math it's all of your Revenue see I think this is what they needed to do they needed to talk to their most downloaded people they needed to understand who and how much they're making they they had to do something because this just seals like how did you not see this coming right this seems really scary honestly this seems truly scary right here we would owe 109 of our Revenue damn okay maybe how to tank your company in one easy step damn all right well that this is shocking so anyways I hope that uh this doesn't destroy their math is way off no huh their math is way off no no their math is way on oh that's per month oh it's per month oh no oh no you're right it resets every month so you have to pay the first hundred thousand you're paying like 15 cents on turns out I'm the stupid one they probably want more than that uh so let's just say that this is over I think this is over a course of a year right games for kids we don't display advertisements yep yeah great hey what what a nice thing it's a game for kids and they don't put advertisements thank you company what a nice thing this is 2024. so this is this must be money for 2022 I assume that means that literally they restart every month and so just saying that's not beautiful so how many reinstalls are there we don't know but that just seems this just seems really terrifying yeah that's terrifying all right I gotta go the name is I really hope that this doesn't ruin good games because I really like good games and mobile gaming is 99 trash and a couple amazing games so I really hope that somehow this makes it so that good games are made trash games go away and that's what I would love to see again and please stop being so like Unity I understand you got shareholders and stuff that you need to you know appease and you have to make more money and you have to pay for your product and I want to see Unity be successful so I don't mind charging where it makes sense but you got to figure it out to where it's not horrible you know what I mean like this can't happen Okay you can't do this to somebody this doesn't make any sense it don't make no sense you got it you gotta come up with a better a model here okay a jet
