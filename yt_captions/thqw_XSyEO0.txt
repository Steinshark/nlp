I don't know about you but planning and shooting documentaries has always been the fun part for me even the edit process as tedious as it can be has its moments when you feel like your story is really coming together but finishing something like finally exporting it and sharing it with the world type of finishing is something else entirely the roller coaster of excitement emotions and usually a healthy quantity of regrets thrown in that filmmakers go through is for me anyways a huge part of why this job is so stimulating making a film from start to finish is fun nerve-wracking incredibly frustrating and ultimately one of the most satisfying things I could ever imagine doing with my time so in this video I'm going to share some of the key takeaways from each stage of the production process from pre-pro to filming and through to the edit so that you can get some ideas for what to do and maybe more importantly what not to do on your next film and at the end I'll break down exactly how much we spent to make this film happen and let you know where and when you can see the full version but for now let's get into it and explain why I'm sitting out here in the middle of the Forest right away you can probably see I'm not in my studio like normal I'm actually way up north in the Canadian Arctic for the next three months for a shoot hence the radio and bear spray and the fact that I haven't changed my clothes in three days that all means that my videos for a while are going to be a little bit different than you're used to and obviously the Sound and Lighting are going to be a bit rougher than in my office but at the end of the day I'm not a full-time YouTuber I'm a working DP and I gotta make some compromises if I want to keep getting these videos out so thanks for being patient with me and hopefully you're cool with me doing these videos from help behind my desk anyway is you might have seen some of the BTS content from the shoot that I'm talking about I released them earlier in a three-part series but for a quick recap this film is about Jose a former soldier who stepped on an IED in Afghanistan and became a triple amputee overnight he went through some crazy dark times but eventually he started surfing through a veterans program and found something new to live for now he's on a mission to become a serious adaptive Surfer and Inspire others through his journey it's an amazing story and a great lead into the first piece of advice I'd give to anyone wanting to make a film for themselves and that's to start with your character first a character who wants something and then changes over time is so so important for telling a story and one of the biggest issues I see with projects pitched by newer filmmakers is that they have a really interesting topic but there's no story like it's really easy to confuse story and topic but to make your film great you want to tell a story which usually means finding a character who wants something and either gets or doesn't get what they want over time the struggle of wounded veterans is a topic for example the rise of adaptive surfing is a topic but a wounded veteran on a mission to change his life through surfing is a story now I'm definitely not the only one preaching this stuff online and if you like my channel odds are you've probably heard of Mark bones Channel and the Art of documentary film school that he and his business partner micro actually the only reason that this whole film exists in the first place is because aod has started funding small projects and giving out micro budgets to filmmakers like me to actually go out and make stuff so a big thanks to them for putting their money where their mouth is and actually helping us to make stuff and if you have no idea what I'm talking about and you've never heard of the art of documentary they've got a really great thing going on there with courses on everything from story structure all the way through editing the doors opened a few days ago which only happens twice a year so if that sounds like something you'd be interested in I think enrollment will be open for the next two weeks ish they're not sponsoring this video or anything but they've been a long time friend of this Channel and they're giving all my viewers a discount code that will save you 10 percent on any of their modules plus send a little Kickback my way so check out the link in the description and use the code Luke 10 if you want to save some cash and support this Channel at the same time and just in case people are wondering hey didn't you just release a cinematography course of your own how can you also recommend aod the answer is pretty simple we're not competitors we come from different parts of the filmmaking world we approach teaching in different ways and whether you want to learn filmmaking from me or Mark or aod or anyone else for that matter all I care about is that you're actually going out there and going for it so no just because I have my own stuff now doesn't mean I'm going to stop repping aod because we're all part of the same Community here it's not me versus them that's a scarcity mindset it's all of us growing together and pushing the whole documentary Community to do better work sorry I had to get that out of the way before the comments start rolling in like I'm sure they will [Music] the next thing I'd say I learned from this whole experience was just how much can be accomplished with minimal resources now I come from the mainstream documentary industry and it's totally normal for us to spend millions of dollars per shoot like the reason I'm not in my normal studio right now is because I'm out on a long-term show that's going to cost something like 13 million dollars to make I've got nearly 30 people out here in a remote location to make this thing happen and the amount of gear and logistic that goes into making something like this is mind-boggling so when I took on the micro Grant from aod films for five thousand dollars even though that's real money for normal people I knew the team and I would have to be pretty resourceful to pull it off I mean this was an international shoot I'm Canadian and Jose lives in California and we had three crew members including myself who needed hotel rooms and food and transportation paid out of that budget that meant skipping a lot of the things that I'm used to on big shoots like massive rental budgets and big cruise but in the end I think we did a really nice job even while spending very little money relatively leaking and I know five thousand dollars is a lot of money but in the scope of Film Production and considering we had to travel to another country it's almost nothing but you know what I'm really not sure if you can see that much of a difference between the work I do for Netflix or National Geographic and this short film maybe in some back end things like sound mixing and expert color grading but in general I think this scrappy little project looks just as good as what I'd make with 10 times the budget so the lesson is don't let money get in the way you don't need as much as you think you do to make this kind of thing and to tack an extra point on there if you're just starting out and don't have a ton of money for your projects a tip that I really want to stress is to stay local don't plan huge Expeditions for your films pick stories that are close to home that you can access easily and your money is going to stretch a lot further like if we didn't go to California we could have spent over a month with Jose on the same budget so if you do decide to apply for some funding for your film maybe even through aod films then don't do what we did stick close to home because I guarantee that there are amazing stories to tell and your money will go way way further the next takeaway I want to touch on for small run and Gun Productions like this is just how important pre-production is to the whole process I mean pre-pro is always important no matter what size your project is but when you're working with really limited funds in a short timeline like we were I mean we shot the whole thing in four days you can't really just afford to show up and see what happens we could only afford four shooting days maximum so before we got on a plane I had tons of calls with my directing partner arrows as well as with Jose to make sure that we understood what story we were telling and what elements we needed to make it happen like I say all the time on this channel if you want your doc to really tell powerful story you need to think in terms of scenes not b-rolled voiceover and in order to capture enough real scenes in just four days we needed to know what most of them would be in advance we didn't just show up at Jose's house and say okay what should we film today because that would have been a disaster with so little time to work with no instead we showed up with a list of scenes we thought would speak to his story then we talked them over with Jose and his wife we cut the ones they didn't like and then we got to work it's not like we scripted the entire thing because in the end there are quite a few moments that we didn't expect that just sort of happened and made it into the final film like how his wife Lisette braids his hair before he goes surfing and a bunch of other stuff but even though we allowed for some spontaneous moments unfold and you should too we always had a plan to fall back on and we knew what the spine of our story was going in if you've got months and months to work on something then a pure verite fly on the wall approach might work but when you're trying to get a lot done in a very short time don't sleep on pre-production both modules one and two of aod have units on on pre-pro but for my money module 2 goes deeper and the lesson about the character being a co-director is great advice that most film schools gloss over so check those out if you're looking for pre-pro tips okay so the next point I'm gonna make here isn't really something new that I've learned but it's something that I have to constantly remind myself over and over again and that's that you have to be really diligent about setting aside dedicated time for the edit what can really easily happen with small projects like this is that you get super excited for the idea and the shoot then you get back and you've got like 13 hours of footage to come through and the whole thing just slows way down organizing footage and getting your first rough cut done is time consuming and pretty annoying if I'm being honest and then after that there's multiple rounds of feedback and re-edits and then all the fine-tuning things like sound and Grading and if you don't set aside dedicated days or even weeks just to roll up your sleeves and get it done then these things can drag on forever I mean we shot this thing in February and between my full-time time job as a DP and running this YouTube channel it's been way too easy to just push the edit to the side while I wait for a convenient day but there's probably never going to be a convenient day so you just have to make the days happen whether it's convenient or not or you're going to never finish your film and a half finished or even a three-quarter finish film is essentially the same thing as no film at all so just make time and get it done remember your triple F's filmmakers finish films if you don't finish it and share it it basically doesn't exist lastly make sure you're not operating in a vacuum chamber and that you're getting as much advice from people you trust as possible as I was editing this film I sent it to a lot of different people and in the end their input made the film much stronger I had several calls with Mark and Mike as well as my filmmaking friends around the world and without all their feedback I kind of think I would have had a much worse final export filmmaking is a team sport at the end of the day and if you aren't getting outside perspectives the work probably won't hit its full potential so ask your friends reach out to other filmmakers you know or join online communities aod has a great online Facebook group you can access to once you're a member and I see people on there every day getting feedback on their projects but wherever you go for advice you're doing your story a disservice if you only work in an echo chamber of your own ideas so what did this thing cost in the end we spent just over five thousand dollars to make this film the vast majority of it went to travel and accommodation like I said flights and baggage were around 1500 bucks hotels were just over a thousand and food and gas worked out to be 980 for the week Eros and I didn't pay ourselves anything but we did pay our camera assistant and BTS shooter Richard a thousand dollars as a token fee now I know that's a terrible rate for a multi-day international shoot but he's a good friend and he did it as a favor on top of that we also needed to license some stock footage of Jose on big waves because on our surfing day the waves were tiny we did get some really great footage of him in the water and you'll see it in all the Moody shots in there but for all the shots where he's flying down the face of an eight-foot wave we had to buy those off an underwater DP based in San Diego and we spent another 500 to the rights of that footage that brings the cost to just under five grand then I spent another 500 on sound design and mixing which was also an incredible discount from a friend who wanted to help out for a grand total of five thousand four hundred and ninety two dollars and that's US Dollars I'm talking about not the adorable Canadian dollars I have in my bank account that's real money but it's also Dirt Cheap relative to what most film Productions cost and I'm super proud of what we were able to pull off the film is going to Premiere at the second aod film festival in New York which I think is happening in November sometime so hopefully I'll have a chance to meet some of you there assuming I get out of the Arctic in time big shout out to aod for helping me make this film possible and if you do decide to join the next cohort don't forget to use the code Luke 10 to save 10 the doors are only going to be open for the next two weeks or so and they only open twice a year so if you've been thinking about it you'll probably want to act pretty quickly hope that video gave you some ideas for what to do with your own next short film and maybe even inspired you to get out and actually make something the final film is going to launch in November like I said and I'll keep you in the loop when I know the exact dates see ya thank you [Music] foreign
