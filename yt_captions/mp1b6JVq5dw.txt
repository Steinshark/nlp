ladies and gentlemen if any of you have ever gotten into the game of chess then you probably know the name Magnus cross Magnus Carlson is the world champion he is the best player of the last something like three decades and arguably the greatest chess player of all time he is featured widely not just on this YouTube channel but on many many channels because he is an algorithm Buster and he fascinates the most novice of individual that follows the 64 squares now the thing I'm going to share with you in this video you may have never heard of before there was a period between 2018 and 2020 when Magnus Carlson did not lose a chess game in 125 games eight hundred days he did not lose a classical game of chess meaning the prestigious one the long one 90 minute 120 minute the ultra Elite type of Chess that exists and in this video I will be taking you through some of these games I'm not going to do a deep dive analysis on all them because they would require 15-20 minute videos each but we are going to go through this absolutely monster streak 125 games what has that ever happened he won or drew a hundred and twenty five games in a row think about that number that is nuts now this is the game that he lost this was July 2018 July 31st 2018 and we are in Beale all right we are in Switzerland Magnus is playing the Beale chess festival and his opponent is shakrayar mamidyar from Azerbaijan Magnus plays a um King's Indian defense with Knight C6 and then tries to explode the center right away with D5 now mamid yarov is uh is a very very good Dynamic player and in this game it's Dynamic indeed as he seizes the center with D5 Bishop D2 and a very very unbalanced position arises where my midiarov does not have the bishop pair but he has a lot of potential ability to just March down the center of the board so first he pokes at magnus's structure and then here come the pawns and magnus's light squared Bishop never really got comfortable in this game and here you see my major of playing D6 now the computer still evaluates this position as around equal all right but the problem is that since this Pawn managed to make it all the way up the board while Magnus is dealing with it that means yard will be able to play things like rook fd1 and now if you take the Knight he gets this the pawn survives and the light scored Bishop will hunt the rest of the pawns for white so actually Magnus was on the back foot throughout this game and Mommy jar have maneuvered beautifully he was up a pawn for most of the game and normally opposite colored Bishops meaning light versus dark and in draws okay you can be up upon even two pawns sometimes in opposite colored Bishop end games and that will be good enough to make a draw that's not what made you what that is not what mummy jar have had in mind he sent it to a rook and Bishop end game and notice when Rooks are on the board including the bishop it's very difficult to defend and Magnus did his best but mamijarov was just an avalanche in this game constantly moving forward brought his Rooks in to remove the Defenders of the position Magnus fought and he fought and he fought but unfortunately in the 50s move 57 it was my major of promoting his Pawn indeed and Magnus resigned this was magnus's loss on July 31st 2018. and uh let me tell you something right now some some of the Chess World probably wishes that it did not happen on the very next day Magnus Carlson showed up this is August 1st 2018. the first game after he was defeated by mamidyar of little did Magnus know he was about to pop off for 125 games he is playing against the Swiss local player Nico giardis strong Grand Master 25 to 26 would pulverize most of us this man Magnus I'm not this is a real thing he played Knight A3 on this I just resigned at that point like really Magnus is showing up and he is playing the sodium attack Sicilian for those of you that don't know starting the game on move one Knight A3 which Magnus has also done before is known as the sodium attack because you play it when you're salty AF as the kids say all right when you live in a salt mine Knight a3s is ridiculous his opponent was like what do I even do G6 and they just played a normal game Magnus just acted like you know he used this bishop then he played King F1 I mean Knight A3 King F1 I mean what are you gonna do go plays Knight F3 King uh Knight A3 and King F1 against you and uh then Magnus blocked up the center Bishop C4 Queen C4 and I love how his opponents just like dude I I gotta trade the pieces like let's just go to an end game and hopefully I don't lose in the end game and Magnus played Queen B5 Knight E5 and all of a sudden you know black is under some pressure here um and the game very quickly began became a an end game indeed and in end game where actually black has a pretty substantial Advantage I mean hopefully considering the guy started with Knight A3 on the second move so it looked like Magnus was just gonna lose two in a row so what did he do he took the pawn his opponent played King E7 delaying the recapture of the pawn because Knight C4 there is just B5 and now this was the position I mean it's rook and Knight and six Rook Bishop six dead equal position Magnus brings his King Knight C2 Knight E1 his opponent plays C4 trying to restrict the Knight I just plays Knight D2 and the Knight is dancing and black is doing like he's doing okay A3 A5 all right there's still nothing Magnus has said absolutely nothing in this game Rook F1 and now Rook D3 and I mean it's just it's terrible right Rook F3 and all black has to do now is go here here here and he will never lose he will absolutely never lose he will never ever lose Rook D1 Rook D5 Knight comes back the ship's E7 and all of a sudden we might have a repetition King G6 no no weapons no no no repetition moves rookie four Rook D4 take take uh-oh uh oh oh oh night magnus's opponent blundered the fact that Knight F3 wins the game his opponent played this with the intention of going here sacrificing and this but Knight D2 stops everything and I got news for you you cannot defend this or this or this or this his opponent made one bad move one his opponent played 46 moves 45 moves of good chess one move he made wrong he lost he just lost on the spot if you're confused why this is losing there is no way to stop the white knight from winning this pawn and since you cannot stop the white knight from winning this Pawn you cannot stop the white knight from either winning that pawn or that pawn so with one Pawn push his opponent lost two pawns and the whole game I mean you can't script this stuff Magnus shows up to the board after losing to my mediaf plays Knight A3 on the second move is just is just getting dude is putting up a ridiculous fight 320 points lower rated yes they have the same title but I mean come on Magnus is in another another League uh 45 good moves and and Knight F3 in The Game Zone and that was just the beginning of the end folks that was the beginning of the end for the Chess World because 2019 was the year of redempt Magnus one uh he defended His World Chess Championship in 2018 but that you know he didn't he didn't win a classical game uh he lost some rapid and Blitz games but not classical 2019 Magnus shows up look who his opponent is it's January we're in tata steel uh in the Netherlands and Magnus needs to uh build up The Streak by getting revenge dead symmetrical position completely symmetrical I mean with the exception of the rook and Magnus is fighting against mamid yarov he needs to get revenge the man that uh that that defeated him completely equal game but over the course of the middle game mamijarov gets a little too feisty a little bit too feisty with his pawns here and Magnus gets in on the dark squares now the position is still very tense very locked but Magnus picks off a pawn Knight E3 takes takes momijar comes in takes the Rook we go to an end game all right it's very tense still but Magnus has Pawn potential he can move these pawns and the game comes down to the wire as mummy yarovs pawns confidently March forward it's an ocean of Pawns takes takes the king is on the verge of being mated G3 King H3 Rook H1 and a move before mummy jarv can deliver Checkmate a move before there is G3 and Rook H1 mates King to F4 it looks like everyone's come to Checkmate the white king Magnus sacrifices his Knight and mamidyarov resigns because he now no longer has this he no longer has this and if you take the Knight you're too slow a rook cannot stop two pawns like this just cannot stop them you can come back and try to mate me but I queen with Czech so Magnus gets revenge on the man who beat him in 2018. defeating and for the duration of 2019 Magnus was busting out the svechnikov Sicilian all right he was playing uh this is which we'll see a little bit later in this video he was playing this because he played it in his world championship match and folks no one could even get close to Magnus to the point they started playing Knight C3 like Peter Fiddler did in this game to avoid this vashnikov Magnus struck fear into his opponent's hearts on move two two imagine fearing what your opponent is going to play on the second move he played C5 and Knight C6 because he had spent months preparing for the world championship against Fabiano caruana where all he played was one opening the sweshnikov defense in the Sicilian so E5 and in this game against Peter Fiddler Peter decided all right we're not going to play a sicilian I'm gonna play the Ultra Mega bind variation all right I'm just gonna control light squares and drink my coffee and what Magnus was doing to people back then was he was moving his King out of the way and he was smashing them on the king side just playing F5 doesn't matter if you have to give up your Bishops I'm gonna open the position I'm gonna win my Pawn back and we're gonna come here and here and here and we're gonna deliver a mate and it is going to be absolutely brutal he was doing this to everybody he was doing this for I am not just to everybody look at this position for black I mean it's only slightly better but it's just a matter of time Peter Fiddler is an eight-time champion of Russia do you know what it takes to be an eight-time champion of anything you could be an a-time champion of losing your queen Peter's Fiddler was the eight-time chess champion of Russia the country with probably single-handedly the greatest chess culture right now it might be tied with India because everybody in India is just a extremely good chess player but Russia and India are far and away all right Far and Away the two countries with I mean historically is probably Russia modern day it's probably India but it's just ridiculous he brought his Knight Knight G4 Knight E3 rookie eight the Queen's gotta go and here Magnus played G5 the arrival of the night into the white position posing unbelievable problems to the king the bishop is just it just looks nice but it has no value because there is nothing on the light squares the black king is Comfortably tucked away and the Rooks combined with the pawn in the night are just going to rain blows and folks it was just a matter of time Rook f8 Pawn takes Pawn takes and in gorgeous fashion Magnus delivered upon checkmates G2 defended by the Knight H2 defended by the Queen the white king made it in the corner Magnus was making it look so simple and folks when people went into his Sicilian Defense like Sergey kariakin did also in 2019 early this is the main line this is exactly what they played in the World Chess Championship Match they threatened us with a repetition after 10 moves Sergey to his credit did not repeat moves uh Knight C3 G3 Bishop E7 and Magnus sacrificed upon just gave up a full Pawn gave up the whole H5 Pawn and Sergey attacked him on the queen side with C5 and Magnus said Pawn takes C4 to disconnect your queen in your knight B5 I'm reigning I'm raining it down on the queen side B4 get out of here Bishop E4 hello mate is coming Queen F5 you can try to kick me out I got Queen G6 hitting that pawn now in comes my knight Queen slides out of danger and Sergey tried to give up his Bishop to take this bishop Magnus had backup though he had backup plans rookie eight hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello right Queen G2 Bishop D4 he took the pawn and he just brought his Rook and he brought his second Rook and kariakin just resigned in this position now you may ask yourself what why did he resign why is it -10 it's equal material you know why it's -10 because black is about to go let's say white just plays A3 Knight takes F4 Pawn takes F4 Rook takes up four and there is absolutely no way to stop mate if you play Queen H3 I will come here and here and why does paralyzed completely the Knight is a spectator The Rook hasn't moved 40 moves The Rook hasn't moved how you gonna play a game with no rook and Knight look at what Magnus did to Circuit wait why is Sergey kariakin a photo of Peter Fiddler what what huh I I I swear I put in a picture of karyakan okay well that's not Peter Fiddler did not play two games it's just the same photo for some reason funny hey remember this and look what he did he also tried to take Magnus out of a svashnikov he was like nope we're I'm gonna I'm gonna attack him all right the only way to beat Magnus is to attack I'm gonna attack him put my knight in the center all right I'm gonna play G4 look at this now Magnus can't even play F5 got him he can't beat me he can't beat me I play G4 he can't play F5 Magnus is not going to beat me A4 he can't play B5 he can't play B5 can't play D5 can't play F5 that's it I found the ANSI Magnus strategy I'm gonna win [Laughter] Knight D4 Knight D5 and Magnus just needs the tiniest of a knight out of four all right you want to play a closed position let's play a closed position all right I'll play a closed position Bishop C3 now I take now you have a very uncomfortable situation because if you take like this you block all of this and you know what's coming F5 the move that you have spent the entire game preventing the move that the entire Chess World tried to prevent Magnus from playing in 2019 no F5 do not open up the position so he took like this so Magnus said all right if I can't get F5 I'll get B5 just the thought in 2019 of Magnus opening the position against you in a Sicilian Defense was a nightmare because now Pawn takes Pawn takes C4 and he took Pawn takes uh oh Bishop is coming I don't even need F5 I don't need to play the move F5 I have completely forgotten about the move F5 I will not be playing Dear God dear God no no the idea if you take like this queen E3 comes in Bishop D4 comes in and I arrive in down the E file but if you take like this I open it this way and now I'm coming in on crisscross applesauce Queen and Bishop he's in check Pawn takes F3 the second that Magnus got to play F5 in this game against it was over it was over melted like butter F5 was the move that every player wanted to prevent Magnums from playing in 2015 and I'm telling you it when Magnus got to play a sicilian and several moves later would successfully play F5 it was over I mean it was just the game ended you might as well resign right there in this game from the opening Yan looked like he did everything you're supposed he stopped Magnus from playing every important Pawn break that he was supposed to play and Magnus maneuvered and outmaneuvered him and succeeded in playing one break and one second break oh my God I mean and and Magnus beat swiddler karyakan nipponishi folks we're just getting started look at the next name on your screen you all know Hikaru this was from the grand chess tour in Zagreb in Croatia all right this was a Queen's Gambit declined it was a relatively symmetrical game and then the board exploded Bishop takes Knight Rook takes Bishop Bishop takes pawn bishop A4 pinning the queen to The Rook Knight takes Pawn Rook Under Pressure not Bishop Under Pressure Knight Under Pressure Queen everything is interacting with everything Rook D3 Queen B2 and Magnus danced out of the way of danger then sacrificed his Bishop in front of hikaru's King grab this Pawn jumped his Knight into the middle and when the dust settled what what happens in magnus's games when the dust settles he emerges in an end game where he is pressuring it's a three on four end game but it's worse than that it's not a three on four it's a three on one that is the problem the two on one will barely get moving because it's constantly monitored by the superior set of pieces so Hikaru tried his best to defend but Magnus actually went after that side of the board first completely stop that pawn Rook hitting this and now these pawns will just go and before they even had a chance to get moving Hikaru just threw in the towel here because he can't move the Knight cannot come forward at all anywhere it comes it will probably just get taken and you cannot defend this position Rook G5 Rook F5 I will win the pawn your Pawn will not move and I will have a three on zero and Magnus was just he just made it look like I don't know 28.75 and we will get to that later by the way we will get to that later his next game against dingley ren dingly red I mean he's beating the best players in the world in this game Magnus was black he wasn't even playing with the white pieces and it wasn't even a sicilian it was a Catalan Magnus played B5 and Ultra aggressive line he was so confident in 2019 just fighting these guys off like it was nothing inviting danger inviting danger defending positions look at that pawn on C7 look at it and now G5 it takes confidence to play like this with black and when you are vaporizing folks I mean that's what happens it doesn't matter end game middle game it rook in two Bishops versus Rook Bishop Knight it doesn't matter the slightest of advantages is enough and in this game it took two bits it this is the position this is the position that he won Five Pawns a knight in Bishop how do you win stuff like this well you bring your Bishops back and now you try to isolate your opponent's pawns on the right see on the right color complex you know that with the Bishops you can be across the board like this in a private jet and hunting your opponent's pawns King E2 H5 Bishop D7 patience he grabs the pawn yes his Bishop is trapped but hello hello and now that pawn is going to be the difference Bishop F4 and Magnus just comes forward with his pieces walks the king down the center literally just into the center and into the white position and white cannot stop this and the advancement of the pawn and it took a few more moves and dingley ren resigned because he was going to lose all the rest of his pawns and Magnus would promote Magnus winning with black too like just winning with black like nothing and the final game that I would like to show you yet another name on your screen yet another victim of the M Train in 2019 Knight F3 and Italian this time against Wesley so h3h6 totally symmetrical game Bishop B5 and Magnus from the early opening took us to a game that looked like this again I mean folks look like they were getting comfortable positions against them look at this he can't move any pawn his pawns look awful how is he gonna make any progress in this game well first he's gonna try to move his Knight he's going to try to bring his Knight forward and his King all right his Bishop is is going back to its home Square how is he gonna make any progress here Rook B1 rugby I mean how do you defend this position you bring your knight you bring your king you slide your Bishop back you replace the Knight the bishop scored with the Knight now the Knight jumps to the middle Knight takes Pawn takes now you've undoubled your pawns King comes forward Pawn locks the center takes takes black tries to activate his position but Rook B6 the point is that Wesley couldn't just sit there if Wesley just sat there trying to pretend like everything was okay like King F6 Magnus would play something like G4 would play something like Bishop E3 and black is just gonna run out of moves black literally has no more moves if he moves the Knight he stops guarding the rook and Bishop takes if he moves The Rook they take the pawn if you move the Rook there I take the pawn he froze Wesley's position completely from a position that looked harmless completely Untouchable and what do you know Magnus emerges in another end game with two past pawns and Wesley resigns because he's just gonna go E5 E6 D7 and that's it and just make a queen d8 rookie 8 make a queen folks magnus's streak was stopped in October of 2020 in Norway chess when Magnus played against youngstov Duda and I do have a video about that game too which is why I'm not putting it into this video 125 slow games over 800 days slow chess he did not lose he during the streak hit his all-time high rating in August of 2019 of 2882 officially and unofficially meaning in between months because ratings are posted officially at the beginning of every month unofficially he was 2889 he did not lose a chess game in 125 attempts that is so ridiculous I don't think I can emphasize that enough imagine you played 125 games you'd lose 62 of them that's on average 50 percent some of us win 55 60 some of us win 45 because chess is hard because he didn't lose a game in 800 days what again I emphasize slow games did he lose Blitz and bullet games online yes but in the highest level of competition in the slowest form of just possible which is classical in the prestigious type of type of Chess which is classical the highest type of accuracy of chess he didn't lose in two years and two and a half months what yo get out of here
