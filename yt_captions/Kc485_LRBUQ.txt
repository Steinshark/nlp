here we have beautiful C++ written by Guy Davidson and Kate Gregory and guy is today with us um it is still a very popular book and a very good book about C++ and Guy joins us now he it's unmuted that's perfect guy what do you have to say thank you thank you for having me here um yes so beautiful C++ as Yen says it's still selling well um the book came out at the end of 2021 um Kate and I wrote it during the pandemic the book is actually derived from a talk that Kate gave at cppcon in 200 oh I should know this now shouldn't I 2017 I think it was um where she described um 10 of the core guidelines um that were you know really useful and that would immediately deliver some value to your program you know stop following these guidelines your coding will become better that was the principle of her talk and and it was a very successful talk it's very well watched you can find it on cppcon just search for k Gregory on cppcon on their YouTube channel um and the idea of turning it into a book was um you know several Publishers that approached her and said you you should make this into a book this would be great now the core guidelines that we're covering um are very much they're not necessarily the best core guidelines but they're the ones that will deliver um value to your code most quickly um if you have haven't heard of the core guidelines first you should look them up so herb Sutter and ban strw decided that the standard the standard describes what is legal in C++ but that's not enough what we also need to know is what is moral in C++ and the C++ core guidelines and there's about 300 of them um describe lots of these moral issues in C++ you know don't mix implementation with your interface uh you know don't leak your abstraction um don't use Global variables or don't use mutable Global state that kind of thing um and casate and I decided on 30 that we'd write about that we thought yes you know we can we can do this we can we can crystallize some really useful stuff in under 100,000 words um the text is just it's about M 2,000 words into in total of the text and and we released this at the end of 21 uh as it happened I ended up writing most well I ended up writing all the text actually because Kate's life s of overwhelmed her at the time um and it's it Still Remains something I'm extraordinarily proud of you can work your way through these there are 30 core guidelines they're each written as individual blog posts of about 3,000 words so it's the kind of thing you can dip into and decide to read during during a particularly long build or something like that um and you know without spoiling it there's an awful lot of stories and tales of my time as a programmer I've been writing code since since 1980 um which is quite a long time um and it's full of stories that are you know absurd things that have happened to me you know over the past you know 40 plus years of programming um it does astonish me how well it's sold and how many people have decided to buy it and read it and I find that quite flattering and humbling and I'm working on another text now called the game developers guide to learning C++ which I'm hoping to have out in time for the C++ 26 standard um if it sells half as well as this one I'll be delighted um and I think that's all I have to say I'll be in here below I will answer any questions
