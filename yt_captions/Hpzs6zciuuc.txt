the last five years in my pc i have had a gtx 1080 which has been a very lovely graphics card i've used it for everything that i've rendered it's done me very well and it still holds up pretty well today however the time has come for an upgrade and i figured go big will go home so i made a rather whimsical purchase of a rtx 3090. this is the founders edition very excited uh this is going to be going in my pc in about five minutes shout out to jamie my og discord mod he messaged me at about at 10 am on a sunday last week and said there's two uh 3090s in stock on amazon i'd been thinking about getting one for a while but they were all out of stock everywhere so i literally woke up to his message on discord and within five minutes of waking up i'd pressed buy now on the 3090 on amazon another thing that gpus are great for other than rendering is of course gaming and that segues us very sleekly into talking about the sponsor of today's video core core is a new pc gaming platform

do a test render on my 1080 before i take it out so i can compare the two speeds so this has just been sat in its box when i was a younger man i would have ripped this open within about two minutes of it arriving and put it in my pc but i guess i've gained some patience over the last few years but the time has come so let's put it in the computer [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] guess i'm lucky if i left [Music] okay the 3090 is in so i've installed the studio drivers on this instead of the gaming ones which i didn't do on my 1080 so hopefully that will help with the performance a bit for rendering and stuff as well so i'm going to now open up all of those scenes that i just rendered before and we're going to see how it works we go into my settings just make sure it's actually detected the gpu yeah here we go nvidia geforce rtx 3090 that's what we like to see open recent example scene so let's start with the uh treasure planet one that i made so just to recap the 1080 rendered this in four minutes and 50 seconds so i'm not going to change any of the settings i'm just going to render the same frame again so we're looking to beat 450 otherwise we're in trouble whoa that's absolutely flying up so we're a quarter of the way there it's been 29 seconds this is going very quick it's done one minute and 12 seconds oh my goodness so the 1080 was four minutes 50 the 3090 is one minute 12 so that's almost exactly uh four times faster okay let's go on to the bmw scene and see how that works let's just check this is using the 30 90 as well yep okay so previously this did it in um 109 on the 1080 let's see how long it takes on the 30 90. i thought we had done it there just instantly oh my god it's going to be seconds it's 10 seconds [Laughter] no way so that's what six seven times faster oh my goodness ten seconds that is outrageous okay bmw scene that's officially a win for the thirty ninety ah and lastly let's go on to the uh ian hubert splash screen for one of the previous versions of blender so this was a long one um the 1080 rendered this at 250 samples in 5 minutes and 50 seconds and it was still really noisy i should point out that for this scene because i'm using an older version of blender this isn't using cycles x um so this is just using optics i might test what it does in cycles x after this as well because that'll be interesting okay we're off oh my god it's flying is it going to do it in under a minute we're over halfway there and it's just hit 30 seconds it can be it's gonna be like 50 seconds isn't it and it's done 58 seconds 58 seconds so the last one was 5 minutes and 50 seconds this one was under a minute i realized that this isn't actually noise this is um some stuff that ian's done in the compositor so it actually rendered clean before and then uh this stuff goes on like post render i'm also gonna render the same scene with the 3090 in the new version of blender so 3.0 alpha and this is going to be using cycles x so we can see how much time we can knock off the 58 seconds okay so here we go i press render and now we wait [Music] 32 seconds that is outrageous that's just under 12 times faster than the original render with the 1080. i don't even know what to say to that well i'm pretty speechless i thought it was going to be a few times faster but it seems like on average it's like five or six times faster than the 1080. so stuff that would have taken an entire day to render before is probably gonna be like four or five hours now which is ridiculous so there we go i think it's safe to say the 3090 came out on top it is just under four times as expensive as what the 1080 was when i bought it so i guess you kind of get what you pay for and now comes the potentially fun part of the video for you guys so i no longer need this 1080. it's still an amazing graphics card it still really holds its own and i would have been happy using this for a lot longer and i've been using it for all my projects for the last few years it's got eight gigs of vram so it's still very very powerful so i'd like to offer this to you guys if you're interested let me know i can't give it away for free but i am happy to let it go for a very good price so especially if you're someone that's quite young or doesn't have much money and you would really like a good graphics card but can't quite afford it drop me a message on discord or instagram or something and we can talk but yeah this 1080 is up for grabs thanks very much for watching the video i hope you guys have enjoyed and i'll see you very soon also don't forget to check out core the link is in the description it's completely free so if you're interested go and have a look get in my way [Music]
