- What a delicious--
- Oh, cheers. - Thank you very much.
- Oh, I love it. - Mm.
- Mm. - I have no idea what's happening. - You've done mystery tech with me before. Imagine that, except
from things that we got that are slightly sus from Facebook. - Yes.
- I have a buddy, Jake Roper, aka VSauce3 here.
- Hi. - And I think it's time.
- What did you get, Jared? - Oh, it's a Game Boy Advance SP. - Oh, it's a game! That can't be right. - This box looks highly sus. So it's a reproduction box.
- I mean, it looks-- - Is it a legit--
- Oh, that's cute. Is this not real? - I don't think that's the real chassis. Dude, look at that sticker. There's no way this is real. I mean, feel the plastic. That does not feel right. - This feels like 2002 plastic. Honestly, the thing that
seems the most strange to me is the way this cable is wrapped. How much did we pay for this SP? (cash register ringing)
- [Jared] This was 200 bucks. - [Austin] This is a reproduction case. This is basically like a $50 SP that someone put $20 in parts into and sold for $200. - I mean, not a bad markup. Let's turn it on.
(electronics chiming) Oh. (electronics dinging)
- So the screen is also just the original screen, so it's not even the upgraded model. - Is there another SP
that we can compare it to? - Actually, there is
somewhere in the office. I don't know. But look, I've spent
years touching Game Boys. I know the feel of the Game Boy. (crew laughing) - I'm glad you had a game before. - Yeah.
- Years. It's almost like a modern day Z Flip. - Oh.
- Oh my gosh. This is how Game Boys.
- Did you even have a Game Boy, Jake? - We've discussed this earlier. Austin was rich. (group laughs) - Joanna really wanted to make you guys play Drake & Josh for the Game Boy. Absolutely not. But I managed to find my
original Pokemon FireRed when I was cleaning up,
literally this morning. - Oh really?
- I have not played this since I was a child, and I have no idea
what's on the cartridge. - [Jake] What was that, about yesterday? (group laughing) - Yeah, you guys-- - [Jake] Look at that. And you can see now the
backlight, the color display, and maybe, is their volume? There it is.
(cheery music) - Whoa.
- Whoa, Jared, how many hours do you
think you had in this game? - [Jared] I actually have no idea. I didn't even turn this
one... like a hundred. - 166 hours.
- Oh my God. - [Austin] I have another problem. - Was it drugs? - Another, another problem.
(crew laughing) This screen is unbelievably dim. Look, the difference between
the backlight on and off is very minimal. I know the Game Boy
screens were not amazing, but this is a really dim screen. - [Jared] Okay, to be fair, we also are in studio
grade lighting right now. - No. No. - I'm gonna go underneath your desk. - Go ahead. Feel free. - Oh, that's better. - Is it comfortable down there? - I mean, yeah, it's pretty. That's a, that's a difference. I know you're trying to pick
apart the joy of this console, but--
- I'm mad. This was over $200. Do you know how much money that is? - Over $200.
- Exactly. I have a bad feeling about this. I'm happy Jake is here
to be my spirit animal. My guide through my pain. - I'm like your starter Pokemon. - You're my starter Pokemon. - Yeah.
- You're my, you're my Squirtle, and-- - Well, that's not the
one I would've chosen, but that's okay.
- What is, what? - Ooh, it's a wireless charger. - Wait, there's a bunch of items in here. This is all from one seller? - [Jared] This is a box of
new Amazon random electronics worth over a hundred dollars,
for the low, low price of $70. (laughing)
- Okay. That's pretty good value. Jake. Jake, would you like to the
honors, or would you like me? - I mean, I'll do it. I don't trust you. - Let's go in with an open mind. I mean, a real set of
AirPods are over a hundred, so if these are even one quarter as good, I'm sure it's fine. - It does have two to
three hours of talk time. - Ooh.
- Oh, look at that. That's... oh, first of all. - [Jared] That sound. - Packaging, not a big fan of that. Gosh, these are so light. This does not inspire confidence. - I mean, you figure
they're, what? 20, 30 bucks? - Let's see how they fit
in the old ear canal. Oh actually, you know, it's not bad. - [Jared] They look bigger. - They look, the stems are long. - Yeah. The stems are longer.
- A little longer. Yeah. - But boy, does this new
U2 album sound great. Also this, plug in this lightning for me. It feels not great. You really gotta shove
it in there, Austin. - Oh... - [Jared] It's broken? - It went in sideways. - [Jared] What? - You're too strong. - [Austin] Here, look, I'll fix it. - [Jake] There we go. That doesn't sound good. - Let's get the solo
wireless charger outta here. - Do not charge at high
temperatures for a long time, especially in the car, otherwise
it will cause explosion. Oh, it looks very nice. You could beat someone to death with that. - Oh, it comes with one carabiner. - Oh, that's nice. I like, it's such a tiny little carabiner. There you go. Now you're a cool kid. Ladies, watch out. - Oh wow. So there's actually four USBs and a micro and type C, and it says it is a 30,000
mAh power bank. - Let's see. Is that the charge? - It's ready to turn on, right? - Oh my gosh. Technology. - Hey.
- Whoa, it's charging. - Okay. Maybe this isn't terrible. I'm gonna plug in the AirPods then. - Oh. Oh. Let there be light. Man, won't be lighting any
scenes with this, will we, Ken? - [Ken] No, definitely not. - No.
- If this continues to charge and it's decent, that's seeming, that's probably worth
like, what, 40 bucks? That's not bad. Well, luckily we've got the flash drive. - Oh, there's more.
- Dual storage for iOS. - So you can plug it into
your computer or whatever, and then, shink, shoot it
into your iPhone or iPad. Or not an iPad Pro,
because those use USB C. - Ha ha.
- I know tech. - By the way, don't try this at home. It'll definitely (indistinct). - I wanna do it to your phone. Okay. There we go. - Okay. We're plugged in. It says it wants a app. - You need to install an app? - Y disk? What is Y Disk? A thousand ratings. Two stars.
(Jake whistling) - I don't believe that. It says on the package,
"Security edition." - Oh wait. I just realized. - Oh.
- It's a micro USB inside the USB A. - That's actually kind of fun. - That's actually kind of cool. - I need to stop spinning this knife. - You're gonna stab yourself. Someone definitely spent
$20 on Ali Express, got like a bunch of this stuff, tossed it in a box from Amazon, and called it a day. - This one's for Jerome over there. - That was impressive. - Oh, I forgot about this one. Sorry, new studio wall. - I'm just real excited for the new dent that's gonna live in the
wall for the next 10 years. This video is sponsored by Click Up. Productivity is broken.

Up for sponsoring this video. - Pop her open, Austin. - [Austin] Oh, night vision binoculars. - That is a nice carry case. Kind of looks like a Switch carry case. - It's 1080P. Oh wow. - You just see yourself right there. - Yes. - Can you see yourself? - Oh, and it also comes with
a 32 gigabyte micro SD card. - Does it come with batteries? - It does not. - It requires quite a
few... eight AA batteries. - [Jared] What? No (laughing). - AA batteries. Thank you very much. - [Matt] Jake, you got
a good view back there? - Oh, I was gonna scare him. But yes, I am also just staring. (group laughing) I did come here to, the
intent was to scare him. I do need the binoculars, though, so I can actually see his ass. - [Group] Oh. - We had this beautiful new studio. So what better should we do than turn off all the lights, and enter the night vision. - Is that going the right way? - Enter the night vision. (night vision squealing)
- [Jared] Huh? - [Austin] Oh wait, is this it? Wait. It's just black. - [Jake] Well, that's all darkness. - Here. You try.
- Yeah, sure. - Before we go any
farther, how much was this? - Hi.
- I mean, this was 120 bucks. - It's not horrible. So let's just get in focus here. I mean, this is like a nice
camera for a binocular, I guess. Let's let's shut off the lights, Jerome. - How well can you see me right now? - [Jake] Pretty, pretty good. - Yeah. How about here? - [Jake] Yeah, that's,
that's like, uh, ooh. Yeah, that's like "The Purge". - [Jared] They said there's
infrared adjustment. - IR up. - Oh wait, were we hitting IR up? - Oh, IR--
- Wait, turn off the lights. Let's see.
(night vision squealing) - Oh!
- Does it work? Are you recording?
- Oh my gosh. - Dude, I just have like
Terminator eyes looking at me. - Oh, I see like--
- I see. - How many fingers am I holding up? - [Jake] Oh. (group laughing) That is so creepy. That's... that's... that. I don't like this. Jake, stop. (group laughing) Jake, stop. - Okay, now that we know
about the IR... good call. - Yes. This, actually--
- Julian. - Totally, totally legit. We didn't get scammed on
Facebook for one item. - [Austin] Do you wanna try to do one more? - Let's do it. - You, you sure you wanna do it? What's next? - Right in my face.
- Aw man. - Oh.
- Did you hear that? - [Jared] Might wanna
be careful of this one. It might have anthrax in it. - It's looking good. - There's some kind of
white stuff that's not-- - Did you, did you buy anthrax
from Facebook Marketplace? - Oh, no. Not this.
- Yep. - Oh, nice. Furby.
- Yes. - I don't even wanna get
into the description yet, but the title of this is Evil Furby, 1993. I'm sorry, 1999. - [Austin] Jared, you
need to read the listing. These guys do not know what we've got, what we've unearthed here. - What is this? Is this actually salt to
like keep the demons in? - This is actually salt to keep the demon. - Did you ever think that maybe the Furby did the listing itself? (night vision squealing) - [Austin] Yeah, they're
out now. It's turning on. Okay. Oh, good lord, this is horrifying. - [Jake] Feed me, mommy, feed me. - [Austin] I don't like this. Jake. Where is it?
- I don't know. - [Austin] Where did it go? (Jake screaming) - Feed me, dad. What do you want eat? Joshua. (group laughing) - This is, this is not okay. - I thought I was just coming
over to get lunch today. - [Jared] It's alive. (Furby groaning) - [Furby] Dada, I'm dead. - I'm dead?
- I'm dead. Is that what he just said? - What did you say, Furby? (Furby speaking in tongues) - [Jared] Is he speaking in, in code? - No, Furby's hungry. What do you want to eat, Furby? Furby... Oh no. Furby do you sense a threat? (Roboraptor growling) - Roboraptor will protect us. Get it, get it. (Furby speaking in tongues) - I don't think the tongue makes it real. (group laughing) - If you'd like to take evil Furby home, I'm sure it will be great, and-- - I wanna keep living
for a little bit longer. Oh, the salt worked. - It's keeping the evil at bay, for now. We need an exorcist. - Did you get one of those
off Facebook Marketplace? - Sadly, Facebook Marketplace
was out stock of exorcists. - Okay buddy, I'm gonna just... (Furby wailing) It's like it knows what's about to happen. Rest forever. No, shh. Rest. Rest.
(group laughing) - It's been dead for 20 years. It had three minutes of life and you immediately took it away. - Yeah, but in Furby time,
that was like three years. You know, it's a different time scale. But it was very, you
know, it was like, "Dada." How it chose... Why not mama? Hmm.
- Oh, that's a good... Oh. It knows. - 'Cause the first thing
it saw when it was awoken. You've been imprinted. Move over, Carston. Carson. What's your kid's name? (group laughing) Is it Joshua?
