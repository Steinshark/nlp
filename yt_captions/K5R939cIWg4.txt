say that Divine Comedy is I think as you pointed out at the beginning I just want to restate it's really really important to our Universal history project because it integrates essentially everything that came before it it brings in the Greco Roman World it brings in mediable cosmology and Theology and Science and the old Jewish and early Christian apocalyptic traditions and all of the Apocrypha brings all of that stuff in there are giants there are I mean it's all there in the comedy and what's more is that it doesn't invent but it's probably the best example for modern readers of the idea that man is a microcosm that every every human being is actually a cosmos Dante's descent through the Earth and his descent through the Spheres is a deeply personal journey and it's one that Bridges perfectly I think the medieval modern worlds because it it shows us how this vision of the cosmos this medieval model is not merely just an external vision of things that will fall apart as soon as you put it under a microscope or into a telescope or whatever it doesn't just adequately describe our experience of reality on a day-to-day basis but it is also a map to [Music] ourselves this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] hello everyone I am back here with Richard Roland for one more Universal history episode and this week we are going to talk about Dante's comedy and the reason why is because as many of you know we are getting ready to embark on a long journey through hell up purgatory and into heaven uh Richard and I love the comedy so much and so we've decided to do it as three classes for the symbolic world really going into it and the classes will be longer than the ones we've done before because we we really want to take the time both of us to make our commentary on this wonderful text how it is of this powerful map of symbolism and how much Insight Dante seemed to have into reality and so uh so Richard is going to be our guide in this he's going to be uh maybe my Virgil I don't know I'll take it I mean you do have to have a guide that's for sure and uh even even Dante needed a guide and uh but the comedy is is about as confusing as afterlife itself in certain places um there's just a lot of illusions that are that are difficult sometimes it's a little difficult to cast your mind back into the frame of why are things important to Dante that are not important to us anymore by the way this is this is the right question to ask almost no matter what you're reading um I've been reading some other stuff in preparation for some other Universal history videos uh that we're going to be doing in the future um and I will just say by the way guys Jonathan said we're back for one more Universal history it kind of sounded like he was saying this is the last one not the last one not the last one they do this as long as you they stomach yeah that's right that's right but I've been uh I've been reading through a bunch of Celtic stuff I promise we're still getting to that symbolism of Ireland uh but currently I'm stuck in whales so it's a whole thing but uh I've been reading through a lot of Celtic stuff lately and rereading stuff and kind of refreshing my memory a little bit and and looking for certain patterns as they occur and reoccur throughout Celtic literature and one of the one of the great questions to ask yourself whenever you're reading something especially something that feels so in a way like deeply foreign um like some of that really old stuff is uh why do they care about something you know the things that they care about aren't the things that we care about in our world today at least that's how it seems on the surface you get the same kind of feeling reading something like the ilad like actually the whole premise of The Iliad which is this you know uh Achilles decides to go and and sulk like see like to us it all just sort of seems like he's being a big baby like why is he doing this and why is this like a reasonable thing for him to do is a is a is something that you have to Grapple with if you're going to take the poem seriously so anyway all this to say uh Dante has concerns and uh he has uh interests and uh that are very different from ours today if we were going to write the comedy today God forbid that you know it'd be very different in these ways so um yeah I'm really excited at getting into all of this uh looking at it together I thought what we could do for today would be to kind of give an introduction to the comedy and uh this is going to be based a little bit on the introduction that I give uh when I teach when I teach the comedy and um and then we can just kind of talk about it and um obviously there'll be a little bit of repeat but the class as you mentioned is going to be pretty long we basically are going to have five three to four hour classes right so if you want to just sit and discuss the with me and Jonathan for four hours I mean this is going to like bring some coffee and then maybe something else because it's going to be this is going to be some sessions and I'm really really really excited about it um it it might be it might be more than anybody can handle but I'm just really really excited about it of course if you get the course then you have the videos so you can always go back always rewatch you don't have to watch rewat certain sections and uh yeah but I'm really really excited about it so let me say a few words about Dante who he is when he lives um not going to spend too much on this uh uh too much time on this kind of stuff uh what I try to give my students when I teach the comedy is just enough information that when come to all of the political stuff in the comedy and there is a lot of political stuff in the comedy people people at least have some idea of like who the major players are and what what does this actually have to do about Dante's spiritual journey which is really what the ComEd is about yeah and it's important for people to understand that the comedy itself the way it's structured it in some ways needs to have his personal story as part of it because what Dante is doing is linking his personal story with you know the national story and then ultimately the cosmic story and that's actually how symbolism functions he's showing analogies between the different levels of reality uh but in but for us sometimes the particular aspect can be difficult because you're like why is who are this who this count of so and so like the GS and the gibin and what's all this about yes uh so you skipped to the end a little bit of what I wanted to say but that's that's okay that's great um yeah that that uh the way that all of this becomes personal you know this is this is what's really important about the comedy so Dante aliri uh he's born in 1265 so he lives at the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century uh he's a Florentine poet uh we it's it's important to say he's Florentine because at this time the nation of Italy does not exist um actually the nation Italy is younger than the United States um which is pretty pretty dang young as Nations go up till that time um I don't know something happened somebody unified Italy all the trains ran on time I I I don't remember but anyway um I'm sorry um yeah yeah uh I'm not saying muscolini unified Italy but anyway it's it was a whole thing um Italian Italian politics and history actually the last 200 years really interesting and very yeah very spicy uh but uh uh so she he's a Florentine poet um he lives in the second half of the 13th beginning of the 14th century and as a poet he's primarily famous for a work called The Divine Comedy and The Divine Comedy is essentially what's a lot of things but really at its heart it is an apocalyptic Vision yeah um it has three parts the first one is called Inferno or hell the second one is called purgatorial or purgatory and the third one is paradesio or Paradise now Dante is part of a movement um which we'll talk more about in the class uh you could even say he's the leading light of this movement that wrote poetry in the vernacular um at a time when everything important in Western Europe was still being written in Latin um and this uh Dante very consciously in this ties himself to Virgil the Roman poet who uh wrote his great Epic in Latin at a time when everything which was the ver vernacular for Virgil at a time when everything important in Europe was being written in Greek right so there's a there's kind of like a an analogy between him and yeah I think that for us I think probably for you as well but I know for me Dante is one of the reasons why I wanted you know that metsu and I wrote God's dog as a comic book or as a movie like we we had this Vision that in some ways the these Great Moments in transition or these Great Moments in kind of symbolic capture recapturing they happen in a way that tries to inscribe it you know in the lowest possible form you know as it's alluding to all these higher forms as well well and what's really interesting about this is that Dante sort of invents Italian as he's doing this like the dialect of Italian that he's using I mean there's not there's not a single Italian language at this point right there are all these local dialects that are more or less I mean like Italian is is you know it's like bad Latin hold on I just said some po read There we go so's French you know it's yeah French French is worse Latin and then no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding actually guys just so you know like one of the most fun things about hanging out with Jonathan is that somebody will call him on the phone and he'll start speaking French and it's just like what is this this is so yeah it's it's uh it's really it's it's it's really cool I I really um as somebody who loves language but mostly spend spends most of his time studying dead languages um whenever I meet somebody who's like legitimately bilingual and I I know lots of people who are but but people who can just like switch back and forth you know uh it's just amazing it's amazing so anyway it's very very fun to watch um okay so Dante sort of invents the Italian language this is what I was trying to say and what I mean by this is that the dialect of Italian that he uses is kind of a it's a it's a literary dialect he's pulling in pieces from Latin he's pulling in pieces from his own Florentine dialect he's actually also pulling in other pieces from other parts of Italy and this goes a long way to sort of establishing the Italian language and there's nothing unusual about this by the way um obviously in English we have Shakespeare uh and and the King James Bible B basically the idea is that you know if sometimes a defining literary work in your language you know especially anything that was written right at that time when things were moving from the medieval to the modern yeah right that little Handover right there that is when uh that's when your your uh that's when your great lit literary epics tended to have been written and then that in turn kind of uh defines your language in certain ways all right so Dante lives in the midst of an incredibly tumultuous political time there are basically uh let's say two primary political factions in uh the Italian Peninsula they're the gelf and they support the papacy and then there are the gibin I'm not even going to try to say those in Italian uh and they support the holy Emperor um and what happens in Dante's lifetime is that the gelf party which uh so which is pro papacy in which Dante uh is a member of um because his family is a member of it um after they drive the gibin out of Florence they split into two far further parties there are the white gelf and the black gelf and uh essentially uh the white gelf which is the party that Dante is going to end up belonging to they want more freedom from Rome and the black elves uh take a really hard line on papal control um now all of this the reason this is happening is it's all tied up with something called the investure controversy yeah which basically has to do with uh uh kind of the Holy Roman Emperor and the pope of Rome being basically rivals in terms of who can appoint Bishops who can uh do you know which is what the controversy's name refers to but who can do other things in in the Holy Roman Empire and so one of the things that happens uh in the Italian peninsul is uh the Italian Peninsula you know all of these city states you know Milan Florence and so on are part of the Holy Roman Empire but they're going to start pulling away from the Holy Roman Empire over the course of of uh you know the next couple of centuries and that's all part of what's going on in Dante's time politically and let us just say that when I say that there was uh this was a an incredibly tumultuous political time what I really mean is it's an incredibly stabby political time like you can really see how you know these people's descendants eventually become like the mafia like it's it's it's it's an incredibly violent period uh incredibly violent period uh violent in a personal way um you say human history's always been violent uh but nowadays we're violent from a distance right and so we have the ability to kill large numbers of people from a distance without really getting our hands dirty um this is more the kind of like invites somebody over to dinner and then stab them in the back kind of violence right you know and uh so all this to say um um we won't get too much into this except to sort of explain who the major players are so that you understand theion I think for people to need to understand the investure controversy I don't know if I've talked about it a lot in my videos it's very important in terms of let's do it yeah in terms of understanding kind of the the structure of the world and and how things lay themselves out and how is what's the difference between Authority and power and how these things function because one of the the one of the the issues was that you know the Pope in theory is the one who crowns the emperor and this is something that you know started with Charlamagne but also started you know is I think is also real at least ritually in the Byzantine Empire that is that that that the patriarch is the person who ritually will Crown the the emperor now in the West this became a serious problem because it seems like in the west there's a confusion between Authority and power and this has to do with the fact that the pope is in many ways left on his own and has to have an army and has to act almost in some ways as often as a civil Authority and so because of that there's this weird confusion of what who has the power to do what um and so the the uh the bishop of Rome what he would do is use the fact that he could crown the emperor to obiously tried to get the emperor to do what he wants and then the emperor would use the fact that he has a lot of people with weapons to be able to get the pope to do what he wants and so you have this this tension that is not only in the Holy Roman Empire but Empire but also ends up happening in France with the King of France and these different characters where you all you have this tension between what we could call Spiritual Authority and temporal power that that it's not clear what one is supposed to be and how it relates to the other person this is the this is the defining conflict of the late Middle Ages um and and when I say it's it's actually not even correct to say the investure controversy as though there was only one yeah because it really happened in waves right so there is a the investor controversy that happens in like the 12th century but then but then that continues to have these Ripple effects all through uh especially German and Italian political life which is part of the reason that that neither one of those uh areas even forms a cohesive nation state until the 19th century the Reformation goes back to this right uh what do you think those German princes you know who backed all the reformers about what they really wanted yeah well I mean you didn't even have to be cynical about it like you you could just say that there's like a uh uh there's already this precedent set right there was always already this Push Pull like and so what they sort of Saw themselves doing is sort of continuing this let's let's continue to neuter the power of the church let's continue to to elevate the state as the right but that's already the controversy that controversy has already been going on for hundreds of years before the Reformation yeah and so and you can look at it like if you take the Bible as an example to kind of understand the relationship between the two in scripture the way that God sets up the Covenant with Israel is that those that are the spiritual Authority in the sense that they hold the ritual power and they are the ones who manage the sacrifices and all that they do not have land they do not rule over over over a land in Israel and therefore they're there the their function is To Be A Spiritual Authority and that means that they have certain ways that they can influence the world but they're not meant to influence them directly towards mechanical with mechanical causes that they're not supposed to beat up people you're not supposed to fight you're not supposed to do that and in that way and when that happens then ultimately what you want is you want then the temporal power to submit to that Spiritual Authority and then be in some ways the arm of the guiding principles that are held by the Priestly cast and so they they're the ones who enact the laws they do the things they you know they have to put people in prison they do that and in the in the west there there is that structure like it's there implicitly right so for example when you hear about witch burnings like the church has never burned anybody in its entire life never happened what it always did if it had a problem with someone it was it would judge them with their spiritual reason and then it would hand them over to the state for the state to do the action that's the usual relationship right but what happens in in the west is that you start having this problem where there's a confusion at first I think with the Pope trying to act like a king and when that happens like when there's this when there's a confusion of levels this is the whole by the way sons of God Daughters of women thing like that's right when the the the authority when the people stop try to take what's from what's Below in a an in a legitimate way then it creates a a destabilizing force and it leads to Revolution ultimately yeah anyway that's that's the way to think about it well actually I mean I think that this is all really important uh obviously for Dante it's the main thing it's the whole enchilada and and Dante comes down eventually he comes down on the site of the Holy Roman Emperor in all of this and so he keeps oh yeah he's he's really looking for the Holy Roman Emperor to bust into Italy and clean house this is what he really wants and this is what he tries to prophesy and it sort of never happens and anyway we'll get into all of this but this is what Dante really wants eventually um because what he sees um uh uh and and actually uh just just just for fun since this is universal history Dante blames Constantine um you know but you know which is kind of a meme these days but the reason that he blames Constantine is because there was a fraudulent document yeah that was forged by the papacy or by somebody in the west uh uh called the Donation of Constantine and and it was used to support the papal claims of uh uh of the the pope as sort of the the ruler of the West over the the Emperor of Constantinople and the and the Orthodox church and anyway it's just a whole thing and uh but but but I and I'm not trying to be pmic about this everybody knows it was forged the the West figured out that it was forged in the 14th century so like everybody knew this document was forg but in Dante's time they thought it was genuine um and um uh in the Donation of Constantine you know what the document basically said is that the west empire the Western Empire was left to the pope upon Constantine's death and so the popes were using this document to support their claim not just against the East but also against the Holy Roman emperors to say actually we're the ones who should sort of be running the show so upon Constantine's death yeah upon constant they should have known this was a fraud well yeah I mean it took him a little while to figure it out to again to be fair they it was even it was still like pre-modern times when they figured out it was a forgery so U but but at Dante's time they still think it's genuine and Dante uses the Donation of Constantine um it's something he talks about more than once in the comedy as we're going to see he uses it to directly blame Constantine for you gave all of this temporal power to the church which has corrupted the church and so this is Dante's one of Dante's major themes is that when the church holds large amounts of temporal power that it it uh that it corrupts what the church is supposed to be which is the bride of Christ right so Dante uh Dante is let let me just be very clear he's a very faithful Roman Catholic he's a faithful son of his church um but he also as a faithful son of his church sees the way that it has been corrupted by everything that's going on in in Italy and in Germany and in that area that's really that that they used to call uh the Holy Roman Empire so we'll talk more about all of this stuff but I do want to kind of point out one of the reasons that it is important is because Dante is living at a time when uh the world is falling apart um you can say the medieval consensus is about to start breaking up uh in certain ways and um all of this is is kind of uh endemic in the political Strife that's going on in Italy at this time and what Dante shows us is a way that uh you can take this cosmology right that you can take this model this what C was called the medieval model and integrate it into your life as a way of sort of making sense of things when you see the world falling apart and I'll I'll say some more about that in just a moment um basically after the black GS seize power in Italy Dante is is specifically in Florence Dante is exiled and he's exiled and he's actually condemned to Death In Absentia by his own city um and this is a uh a death sentence that the City of Florence by the way officially revoked in 2008 so relatively recently they actually revoked the death the death sentence on Dante that's hilarious who is certainly their most the most famous Florentine who's ever lived probably um but uh uh yeah finally finally uh finally uh keep their grudges very long yes yeah right exactly yeah yeah uh some kind of a stereotype there sure so while he's in Exile Dante uh who up to this point has been a successful poet of love poetry and also a relatively unsuccessful politician he goes through a crisis and it's in this crisis in this what he calls the midpoint of his life that he writes The Divine Comedy so the Divine Comedy I should start out by saying is a comedy uh not because it's haha funny although there are some haha funny moments in it especially in Inferno yeah where obviously you would put all your jokes in hell that's right um there are no really there are no jokes in Paradise so uh actually they do put all the jokes in hell um and I will just say the jokes I mean this is like quality stuff people like if you were if you were hoping to read the greatest work of Western literature which I I do believe the comedy is uh in which um uh demons fart out of their butts like trumpets uh you I mean sign up for this class we're gonna have they're going to be butt Trumpets like like um people in the Middle Ages like these are their only two registers right it's like let's contemplate the mysteries of the Divine Trinity or but trumpets and there nothing nothing in the middle there's nothing in the middle so uh so yeah it there there are there are some jokes in here it's mostly kind of body humor but uh uh but a comedy or Comedia right means that it's a story that starts low and ends high so it starts out bad but it ends happy right that's the and then there's the Divine is the modifier to that right that this is not just a comedy about some kind of Earthly life but this is the Divine Comedy so it's the comedy of uh this the whole story of redemption the whole story of Salvation as experienced by one man right as experienced by one man so the comedy has its roots in kind of three sources the first is uh the Romantic poetry of the trador and the courtly love tradition and this is where beatric comes in Dante is actually part of a whole new movement uh called the sweet new style which uh makes me feel like they're all wearing Berets and smoking French cigarettes uh but anyway um you know or they're or they're like hip-hop artists or something I don't know but uh uh uh he uh this is where beatric comes in so beatric is a very important figure for the comedy I'll say a lot more about her actually in the purgatorio class we'll do a small introduction to her in Inferno but she really becomes important in purgatorio and Paradisio so beatric is this girl that um that Dante meets when he's uh he's nine years old and she's eight and Dante claims uh that they only ever met twice they might have met more than twice but they the point is they didn't meet often uh but Dante writes about two the two times that they met once when he was nine and the other when he was 18 so nine years apart so they only ever meet twice and actually one of the times that they met in person like his conduct had been so bad with like other young women in the city that she wouldn't even speak to him in she wouldn't even speak to him in the street so uh so when we say that it was love at first sight obviously we're not talking about boy meets girl you know kind of a it's something something a little different here um you the way to think about it is that beatric is sort of his great Muse she's the impetus for the events that kick off The Divine Comedy uh but their love was never it was never Mutual there's nothing to indicate for instance that beatric ever knew reciprocated or even knew about Dante's affection for her um they both married different people she dies when she's 25 um and um as we're going to talk about in the more in in the class there's uh this element of being unattainable is actually a key feature of the courtly love tradition so it's actually it's actually like part of why it works and uh what Dante is going to do is take this courtly love tradition which is which is a a weird and almost non-Christian part of the medieval tradition um it's like very well it's very problematic if you will it was actually declared heretical at some point oh yeah especially especially when it was when you get into the more like the religion of Love kind of thing stuff where basically you're worshiping OS as a God and whatnot but Dante is going to take that tradition and integrate it into the greatest Christian epic he also does this with a Greco Roman epic tradition particularly Virgil zad we already mentioned that the anid is uh is one of Dante's Main touchstones and you could almost say it's one of his main justifications for why he can tell a story in this way um because Virgil already did it yeah and of course the nead like the odsy has a descent into the underworld um and uh and Dante will use elements of that descent uh anas's descent into the underworld he'll use elements of that in the comedy to kind of tie all those things together and then he'll just make other references to Greco Roman mythology if you want to uh if you want to get a sense of how people in the Middle Ages freely made use of and references to Greco Roman mythology in a way that freaks out you know like I don't know homeschool parents now um uh you can yeah uh the comedy is is is really the best example that we have going um it's also such a counter example to the way that people imagine what Christianity has always been that's right this idea that Christianity was this this this this closed-minded thing that they got ridden of all the old stories that you know they were just uh you know they they really Dante is the best example of universal history that you can find in the sense that he really tells the story he had the story of his own people and you know going all the way back to the to the Greeks in a manner that is completely conjoined with his Christian Christian faith so it's it's pretty yes and to the point that he will I'll just scandalize people a little bit ahead of time like he'll he'll especially especially in the comedy or in The Inferno especially in The Inferno which is where most of these reference you'll find most of these references because in hell you meet people from Greek and Roman like mythology and myth like you meet people from the ill and the odysey and seven against thieves like you meet those people in hell right so they're in hell why because they blasphemed God but if you go back and look at the story of this guy who blasphemed God it's he cursed Joe he cursed Jupiter right and so so it's it's uh it's um yeah it's it's just really it's really interesting um uh so we'll talk a lot more about that and look at how and why he integrates these things and why what he's doing is is okay but the the other Touchstone so if you if you studied the comedy in college you were probably told about the Romantic poetry and the GRE Roman epics but you probably weren't told that there's a third Touchstone uh a third uh launching point for the comedy and that is the the judeo-christian apocalyptic tradition yeah so in the ancient world in Ancient Judaism especially second second temple Judaism and then um and then uh uh starting with the Book of Enoch and then into Christianity um the most important Christian apocalypse is of course The Apocalypse of St John like the Book of Revelation U there is a tradition of of a story and the story always starts in the middle of something really bad right always starts in the middle of something really bad so uh your people are being persecuted or you're in Exile or what right St John is on the island of Patmos the Church of God is being persecuted but he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day right and then he has this vision and so then what happens is is you're given a vision of uh let's say like the eschatological reality of the cosmos so that is the say sometimes it's the afterlife but it's more than the afterlife because I mean for instance The Apocalypse of St John is is doesn't really show you the afterlife per se it kind of shows you the the way that everything wraps up and comes together so it's the eschatological vision of things U but it's I mean the word apocalypse means the pulling back of the curtain right um actually if you've ever gone to an orthodox liturgy all Orthodox liturgies are apocalyptic because of the moment when we pull back the curtain and Christ is revealed yeah right so um uh what of the defining features of the apocalyptic tradition uh let's say there are two defining features that that almost every apocalypse has in common there are variations on this but they're pretty it's pretty standard across the board one of the things that is done is that the person who is being shown the afterlife or being shown uh the eschatological reality has a guide um the the guide is usually an archangel in some later Christian apocalypses the guide is also sometimes St Peter or the Virgin Mary yeah Dante takes this uh tradition and turns it on his head a little bit because he has his guide be a pagan poet not just a pagan poet a pagan pre-christian poet yeah um but it makes so much sense it makes so much sense because obviously this this guide is the one who brings him through that which is not in the let say that's not contained in the identity of Christianity right everything that is outside or below or or ambiguous is is being brought about by Virgil and then as soon as he gets to Purgatory Purgatory is really the beginning of Paradise by the way it's hard for people to think that it's like because whoever then Purgatory is going to is at some point going to make it up the mountain yeah well Virgil leaves at the end of purgatory but right before he gets into the the Earthly Paradise which is which is pretty amazing yeah yeah I mean that's the crazy thing like ver Virgil leading you through hell okay that kind of makes sense to me but then you get this idea that Virgil is not not only is Virgil leading you through Purgatory but the entrance to Purgatory is guarded by KO who is a Roman philosopher who committed suicide so yeah there's all kinds of crazy stuff here guys and I'm really excited to talk about it um yeah like the fact that even that even Virgil can hear the voice you know because there's this succession of intermediaries that yes that kind of invoke Virgil to come to Dante you know it starts with the Virgin and then there are different Saints and beis and then there's this really this beautiful image of kind of divine procession you know kind of Grace coming from above through the different levels that can handle it up to the up to this encounter with with Virgil it's very a very beautiful image of reality and a very powerful so that comes down because basically Virgil is sent by beatric and beatric is moved to send Virgil by the Virgin Mary and St Lucy yeah um and this is getting a little bit of ahead ahead of ourselves but let's say St Lucy is is very important she's one of the she's one of Dante's Heavenly patrons St uh St Lucy is uh who's actually one of my family Saints she's the saint uh she's the patron saint of blindness and blind people but also the patron saint of poets or one of the patron saints of poets so Dante is a poet but he is also struggling with a certain kind of blindness and there's a theme of blindness and the recovery of sight the strengthening of sight is one of the main themes of the comedy and so there's this procession down from the Virgin Mary St Lucy beatric who's also a saint uh uh in the comedy down to Virgil who's then set for Dante but then Dante he predes down through hell up the mountain of purgatory he gets up to the top of purgatory Virgil hand him off uh to beatric beatric will later actually hand him off to St Bernard St Bernard right and right because because there's like somewhere that even actually beatric can't take him right so now he's got to go now now he's got to to rise Beyond even the idea of love as Dante understands love and into the realm of pure contemplation so anyway this is this is really cool stuff actually Paradisio is probably my favorite one uh uh book of The Comedy to go through because almost nobody has read it uh that's not the only reason but almost nobody has read it people read Inferno usually in high school and then they never get farther than that a few people might have read purgatorio but but not a lot of people have read Paradisio I think because Holiness is less interesting to most people than than wickedness is right like there's a certain like math in The Inferno that kind of makes sense to us but then when you when get to paradesio people suddenly start getting very offended by the idea that there are also levels in heaven like there are also tear in heaven and that some people get more of God than than other people and by the way this is one of the key ideas of the comedy is that everybody gets as much God as they want yeah exactly yeah this is one of the key ideas yeah and this is I mean this is something you see you know taken up all the way into CS Lewis or even into a lot of Orthodox visions of of uh of the river of fire and all these ideas which is in some ways you are where you want to be you're always where you want to be you're not you're not you know if you're in hell is because you actually want to be there there and that's definitely the case for Dante's actually what leis says about Dante's uh version of hell is that it's locked from the inside right everybody everybody that's in there is in there because they want to be there because they denied God and really what it is so let's talk a little bit about the uh each of the three books um so each of the three books has uh 33 kantos and then and then uh there's and then Inferno also has a prologue so to make it a total of 34 so that means there's 100 kantos total um um so Kanto is a Italian word means like a song um but basically think of to like chapter divisions or something if that's helpful um and uh in Inferno Dante uh begins a descent into the abyss on Good Friday and this is after basically coming up uh a face with his sin and also the kind of the sins of the Florentine and Italian people um uh are allegorized as these three beasts he can't get past them and he's lost in a dark wood as he says uh definitely know that feeling and um and so do so Virgil is sent to guide him but in order to save him in order to recover him he's got to actually go through hell first and this is a very deep uh Christian understanding that you always have to go down to go up yeah and uh to you to you always have to descend to ascend and so he goes down uh uh descends into into the abyss on Good Friday following the path of the heroin of Hades the heroin of Hell to finally emerge on Easter morning um um out the other side of the world literally and The Inferno is really about confronting sin right sin uh ultimately it's about confronting Dante's own sins right sin in the city of man the way that the way that hum sin and there's a very particular ordering of sin uh in The Inferno that we're going to talk about but one of the main IDE uh about Sin in The Inferno is that sin erodes our personhood so that Dante's Hell is full of people who have ceased to be people they are people who have chosen to identify so strongly with their sins that they have essentially ceased to be human persons and this is what we mean when we say that it's locked from the inside right these people have effectively become their sin and this is the whole idea of you know there all these gory horrifying punishments in The Inferno um uh but uh none none of the punishments are arbitrary every single one of the punishments in some way sort of shows what the person what the person became all along and so uh and this is a this is a feature of the of the uh this is a feature of the uh uh the Christian apocalyptic tradition this idea but it's more than just let the punishment fit the crime right it's more than that what it really is is the the punishment is really just the sinner living with themselves self right and so so you can you can very clearly see what they became right um or sometimes living with other people if hell is other people I mean some of the people in hell that's definitely being stuck with those people until the day of judgment yeah is a bad time um but I want to ask you just one question though like this is because you know we we mentioned that this is part of the Christian uh apocalyptic tradition the Jewish and Christian apocalypse tradition you know so we have all these images you know whether it's the book in in is it Enoch 3 I guess is that the one where they he goes up first it's in first it's first Enoch in first Enoch you have this descent he goes up he sees the the processes of the of the heavens you see that in many texts but you know where is there precedent for the descent into Hades I think you mentioned third Eis well well he he he does see it in he does see it you do see where the wicked are punished in actually you see in in first Enoch going all the way back yeah you do see where the rebellious stars are punished okay yeah and in and and uh and actually the word that's also used in uh in Jude in judee's epistle uh that's also that's used in Enoch for the stars who abandoned their right the Angels who abandoned their proper place for the stars the word is planet by the way a Wandering Star right that's a anyway uh which is which is fun to think about because then you think about the fact that the ancient like uh Romans and Greeks identifi the planets with the various Gods yeah right who who are sort of like in the enoan tradition are actually Fallen Angels anyway it's that's all very fun and interesting we'll talk about that one of these days but so he in in Enoch he sees the place where so he sees the place where he sees the place where they're being punished and he also sees a place where the wicked are being punished and by the way it's freaking like it's it's weird like it's like he's describing like a gravity well or something like it's a really it's a really evocative description in first Enoch so but yes in in in our last video I said third erris but I I was wrong it's actually fourth Eis or second erris because those are the same book for various reasons um so you can see how one bite confus these things so in fourth Eis uh or second a AKA second eus and some numberings um you have a very clear descent um as as Ezra is taken down into the underworld he's taken down into shol and he's shown very clearly the uh uh uh famous Sinners and the ways that they are punished right and I I've sort of uh I I sort of situate the beginning of that particular tradition with that book yeah um and uh then it there something that gets rifted on um especially in the uh there's some later Christian apocalypses that were very popular in desert areas let's say uh because people who live in the desert seem to like extreme stuff I don't know what's going on with that but uh it's one of those one of those things is like Yeah The Most Extreme forms of Christianity always came from people who are living you know just like you know in constant danger of of starvation and and being killed by wild beasts and whatnot but um so there's a a The Apocalypse of uh some what's sometimes called the the The Apocalypse of St Paul or the viop paully U but it's also Rel that text is is part of like a whole cluster of similar texts that are related to each other that were very popular starting about the 2 Century ad so anyway all of that to say um we actually talked about one of those we talked about the theop in uh in the b class um but it's also related to Dante so see it is all connected it's all all connected yeah so there so I what what's important is to understand that this this image of descent is there's a precedent for it there's OB obviously a precedent for it in in the in the Apocrypha the the gospel of Nicodemus like the Apocrypha that shows Christ going down into sending it to Hades and kind of freeing the the the the people there so I have a big question for you because actually I don't know the answer to this like go go for it know in we often in in Orthodox thinking will say there's a difference between sh and geha right so it's like there's a difference between the idea of of the the realm of the Dead that does have some seem to have some aspect of of suffering of you know of lack of personhood like the way we describe it then there the image of the the fire that comes from the Throne of Christ at the end of time so one of the Impressions that I have when I read when I read Dante was that that all gets that all gets kind of joined together like it's just all the same I don't know if you have that so sort of if Dante makes it very clear throughout the comedy that everybody in his afterlife is still awaiting the general resurrection and and the last judgment so these these people are still awaiting the general resurrection and the last judgment um and this actually comes up in particular because there's some sense that maybe suicides um won't get their bodies back at the general Resurrection because they've already rejected their body um and so this kind of comes up because Dante's like asking about well what happens to suicides at the resurrection if they've already yeah so um so everybody in Dante's version of hell is awaiting the general resurrection and some other fate um so he still he still has thata like especially important slash troubling when you're when you start talking about limbo right so the people in limbo are the Righteous pagans also unbaptized children and and the righteous Muslims even not just ancient pagans right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um not that not which is a big deal to me not that Dante is at all soft on Muhammad by the way we yeah we're gonna see what happens to him and I think it was it is it Saladin Saladin Saladin yeah which who everybody uh really just like had a huge crush on in the Middle Ages um he was a better he was like a better Knight than the Christian Knights like he was more virtuous right yeah very very honorable man uh by you know at least you know uh according to the standards of his time and the way that people in Western Europe thought about him um that's a very interesting actually that's a hugely interesting uh study somebody wants to do uh like a master's thesis or something look at the ways that the Crusaders wrote about saladan but anyway um okay so uh You' got these sort of like righteous pagans and uh these other categories of people basically people who were not baptized people who didn't have an opportunity to be baptized Etc um they're in limbo which is the first circle of hell but it's pretty nice like there's no torment yeah their only torment is that they don't have hope and when we say hope the Christian virtue of Hope is in it is not I just we're going to talk about the virtues in the class because the the there are certain things that you need to understand to read medieval literature I have a little list it's almost like a little catechism that we're going to go through and one of the things is these are the seven medieval virtues right and here's the deadly sins and here's the stuff like this you got to know these things at some point this was part of everybody's education like religious academic whatever and then at some point people stop stop learning about this but the Christian virtue of Hope is not a vague I hope things will get better it is a hope in the resurrection in particular actually Christians we don't expect things to get better in this life not really right um uh but the thing that we're looking forward to is in particular I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the age to come that is the Christian virtue of hope so these people live in relative ease um it's basically it's basically the same place where the righteous or the let's say Where The Virtuous are in um in Virgil's andad like when when anas goes to the end world and he meets his ancestors and they're there and uh they they they get sort of like they they've forgotten the their Earthly sufferings and things like that right so that's where they are that's what limbo is but um they don't have any hope that is they have no hope for the resurrection so what does that mean what are the long-term implications for those people U that's one of the things that we're going to talk about in the class yeah um and and uh uh I'll just say like obviously Dante is a particular person writing at a particular time and a member of our partic of a particular church not all of Dante's theology is my theology obviously I'm an Orthodox Christian we're going to disagree on some things we agree on more things obviously but what I W to what what I want to focus on is what is what does Dante think what is Dante saying about the world um I also think that there are some really interesting images that he uses so he says certain things and then he also alludes to other things uh by some of the images like in limbo there's this is image of them going up a little like they go up a little and then there's like they have some light that comes from above and I'm thinking yeah that's a very interesting image that he's using right there in the at the portal of hell you know as he as he talks about there are also so many weird exceptions to even Dante's own rules you know uh where where D where where Dante is like and what it really is Dante is wrestling with things in the tradition that seem to be in congruous and he's trying to put it all together yeah so I'll just like a little spoiler you're going to meet Tran who's a pre-christian Roman or was not pre-christian he he persecuted Christians right in fact the emperor Tran's daughter is a saint and he killed her because she was a Christian right so uh you're gonna meet him in Paradise yeah well because of that story yes don't tell people they sorry sorry don't tell them spoil it yeah no there's uh uh uh so anyway there's there's a there's a we'll we'll leave that one as a teaser obviously people can just go that up but um uh you can't actually spoil something that's more than you know a thousand years old yeah exactly but but the the the the my my point is that Dante is wrestling with in congruous things in the tradition and so sometimes and the important thing is for people to understand is that Dante is not writing a manual that says the afterlife is exactly like this um he was so successful and this often happens with it happened in the English language with Milton um as well where where um something is so artistically successful that it just takes over the imaginations of everybody right and uh and this causes all kinds of weird things Downstream uh uh especially when it comes to Purgatory yeah um which we'll talk about when we get there um uh I everything almost everything that modern people and here I'll say Orthodox Catholics everybody thinks about purgatory would have been completely unrecognizable to people in the Middle Ages yeah and even Dante's version of purgatory is like very Innovative in certain respects and it's because he's got a particular purpose he's not saying Purgatory is actually like this he's he's got a particular purpose to what he's doing because he I mean he is he's actually making a map of of reality and of the process of transformation but then also the way that things lay themselves out in terms of of a hierarchy of Virtues you know and then ultimately as vices as their kind of as their flip side but but that's it's so it's more about the ontological structure than it is about the idea of that he's just accurately describing the afterlife although he's obviously talking about the afterlife the way that he places beings at different levels yeah more to help you understand this anthological hierarchy of being and the way that kind of God manifested himself at different levels uh in reality mostly what I mean by the way when I say this is that Dante's version of purgatory is the nicest one anybody ever came up up with in the Middle Ages um previous versions of purgatory and I will read some excerpts all right are pretty R-rated they're pretty horrifying um and uh just really terrifying stuff actually Dante's version of purgatory is very nice it's very very kind of fluffy compared to not that not that it seems great either by the way like some of the some of the things that people are dealing with but also it is great because everybody so here's the thing everybody in hell wants to be there also everybody in purgatory yeah wants to be there yeah um and so they're all happy to be going through what they're going so that they can be purified from their sins but anyway we we'll talk about all of this but um uh I think one of the things that I want to point out that we'll talk a lot more about is the is the uh the different ways of thinking about Sin that you get between Inferno and purgatorio so as you mentioned there's Dante is giving us a vision of the way that the world lays itself out or the way that reality is structured um but sin is you sin is kind of like an anti-reality and so it has its own uh hierar there's there's a sort of a hierarchy to sins in the way that they that they destroy or DeMent um ontological hierarchies and so in Inferno um sins are uh that you could say that the defining metaphor for sin throughout the entire comedy is that sin is weight the worse a sin is the heavier a sin it is the more it pulls you down right you don't want to go down you want to go up right so the heavier a sin is the worse a sin is the more it pulls you down well in Inferno the heaviest sin is is treachery to your lord right and so at the very bottom of hell you have the devil and the devil has is chewing on the heads of three famous traitors right um the least worst sin for Dante is actually like adultery now I always like to ask people like so if you were like in hell where would you put adultery obviously right down at the very bottom because we're hyperfocused on these sorts of sins in our society right and it's actually because of the dominance of the courtly love tradition by the way so the idea that you would yeah anyway so um uh so Dante and the Dante arranges all of these other sins like somewhere in the middle there and basically there are two categories in Inferno the first category is is uh sins like animals if you sin in this way you become more like an animal right and the second category is sins like a demon if you sin in these ways because you're using your rational self you become more like a demon um all the way down to Satan well in in in purgatorio Dante uh does a totally different scheme sin is still weight but now he's he's just following the seven deadly sins but if you take a look at so there only seven there there's seven tiers to the mountain of purgatory whereas there are nine layers to hell right but as you ascend the mountain to Purgatory what you start to realize is that the heavy your sins are still like the more demonic ones so Pride's at the very bottom it's the first tier of purgatory is because it's the first sin you have to be purified from and it's also the worst sin it's the sin that makes you the most like Lucifer it's the sin that makes you most like the devil right so you so so he actually keeps the same schem in both places but but you know you're you're you're encountering it in two different orders in two different ways it's it's one of my favorite things um and the big the big focus in Inferno is Dante has to confront s so at first in Inferno Dante the character feels really bad for all the people in how and he keeps like fate swooning like fainting because he feels really bad for how they're suffering and he he he's and eventually Virgil rebukes him we're going to see this Virgil rebukes him and he makes a great pun in Italian uh on the words pity and piety which are the same word in Latin right um uh in Virgil's great epic the anad uh anas's dominant heroic trait is his patas um which is which you could say is in in the Latin mind is something like his right attitude towards uh and understanding of his responsibilities towards the gods towards his family towards his people so he's frequently in English translations you'll usually see him referred to as Pious anas Pius anas right but that word pious p can mean that but it can also mean but it also comes to have a connotation that we think of when we think of pity um or or or I mean uh depictions of Christ you know in the arms of his mother being taken down up across are called that P right and so it's it's it's all it has all those images contained within it it's a really robust word and Virgil will say uh if you had real pity you would actually be glad that these people are in hell and the reason he says this right is he's making he's puning on this word he's saying actually if you had the right a rightly ordered relationship with the cosmos so there's something wrong in Dante's soul and that's why he's here in this in this dark wood to begin with there's something disordered in a soul where he can't where like he hasn't been able to turn away from sin he hasn't able to become a holy person right and so what so what Dante what Virgil is saying is that basically if you really knew what sin was if you really knew what sin was you'd be happy to see it punished um this is a hard pill to swallow for modern people we we'll talk about it when we get there but then so in ferto is about rejecting uh is about is let's say confronting our sin and seeing it for what it really is and ultimately seeing ourselves for who we really are purgatorio is about rejecting that sin and becoming purified and uh there's this beautiful beautiful uh sense in as as Dante is uh as Dante is descending Mount of the Purgatory he has seven P's inscribed on his forehead like burned into his forehead by an Angel and they're uh for Patu for sin the word for sin in Len and as he's ascending the mountain of purgatory um uh they they start to fall away and one of them Falls away just like it's like brushed by an angel's wing and it just like it's just oh it's so beautiful it's heartbreakingly beautiful and then Paradisio is about something which is almost impossible for any of us to even get I think it's even a struggle for Dante like the final kantos of Paradisio are going to become like increasingly difficult for us to understand because Dante is trying to wrestle with with I think a very real vision of of co co of cosmic realities and of Holiness um and uh basically it's about Dante's sight being strengthened so that he can be prepared for this Ascent so that he can finally achieve the vision of God um and that's what parodu is but we got to go through hell to get there so um just to kind of wrap all this up maybe we say that the Divine Comedy is I think as you pointed out at the beginning I just want to restate it's really really important to our Universal history project because it integrates essentially everything that came before it it brings in the Greco Roman World it brings in medieval cosmology and Theology and Science and the old uh Jewish and early Christian apocalyptic traditions and all of the Apocrypha it brings all of that stuff in there are giants there are I mean it's all there in the comedy and what's more is that it doesn't invent but is probably the best example for modern readers of the idea that man is a microcosm that every every human being is actually a cosmos Dante's descent through the Earth and his descent through the Spheres is a deeply personal Journey um and it's one that Bridges perfectly I think the medieval and modern worlds because it it shows us how this vision of the cosmos this medieval model is not merely just an external vision of things that will fall apart as soon as you put it under a microscope or into a telescope or whatever but that it's actually something which it doesn't just adequately describe our experience of reality on a day-to-day basis but it is also a map to ourselves and to our movement through reality right um uh our struggle to become holy people yeah so I'm very excited to be able to go through this with you and with the whole symbolic World community yeah this is going to be this is going to be great I I can't wait and we're really going to be uh can I say this we're we're not gonna We're not gonna hold back we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna take our time and really enjoy the you know I been now obviously I'm diving back into it I haven't read it in a few years H and I just can't believe it like the first contos is just I'm thinking we just teach a whole class on the first like three contos well we have to get through eight in the first class so you the analogy that he's a ble to bring together like these powerful analogies of all that which is low in scripture right so like the the Wilderness the the waters the the animal aspect of it like all these images that you'll find for example in St Gregor OFA or in in you know in the spiritual descriptions of what it what it means to be low uh as analogies but also just e as a like as a story as a story Trope of someone who's going through this through this is I mean I can believe it like all the lines I was like underlining every word like you can't underline every word because then what's the point of underlining so so I can't wait to get into this it's going to be wonderful yeah all right so people sign up join the class um I think that for people who wanted it this is something people asked for last time in the baywolf class uh there are like payment plans and things like that so we we we've done our best you know to make it accessible unfortunately to do something like this at the level that we're going to do it at we do have to like have to char money because because so much time so much time but I promise it'll be worth it and like I said we've done the best that we can to make it accessible to everyone even if you can't join for the live classes if you uh buy the course you'll have access to the videos and the discussion boards in perpetuity so there's there's absolutely no rush uh to to to like feel like you have to be there present for every single class but but uh sign up as soon as you can join us and uh I'll see you all in hell all right everyone and uh and then for us I think we'll see everybody after PCA so it'll be a weird Paradox we'll see you the Dante class and we'll see you IDE the ideal way Jonathan would be to start Inferno during Holy Week itself and then finish by the by P the whole thing but but that's essentially impossible to do for people who don't know Orthodox Holy Week is like 40 something hours of services yeah and it's just it would be impossible for us to to to to be able to do it but yeah so it is going to be a little weird uh but also I'll be I'll I'll at least be in the mood to be like oh yeah we totally we totally harrowed this place yeah exactly don't worry folks we're out of we're we're out of there we're just this is just back yeah that's right that's right that's right all right everyone so we'll see you there looking forward to it bye bye
