okay so I just discovered this um going around on the old uh twitters right here this was just from a few days ago this guy just Jake right he's Jake just him right here he's a conductor at Railway hiring okay and he says uh Beyonce you Google Cloud okay from Google Cloud literally never seen this before in my light they automatically lowered our quota causing an incident and then refused to automatically upgrade we had such a Litany of issues I don't know how anybody uses this product so as you can see they're making a few requests then they're making zero requests Google just turned off a service that's just turned it off Tom's a genius but Tom can't solve the zero computer problem right if there's not a computer for him to be a genius on he's just like the rest of us so anyway so it goes on quite a bit uh he obviously throws in a couple uh insults and then also says he's gonna do something with dhh nobody nobody likes that plan okay dhh stands for a dummy okay uh from the call with Google just now them you exceeded the rate limit us we did 5 000 requests per 10 minutes the quota was approved at 18 000 per minute then that's not the rate limit us what's the rate limit question mark not sure have to check with the team can you imagine getting this oh doing 5 000 requests per 10 minutes right and then just having it turned off right like it's not even a huge amount of requests that's 500 per minute what is that 10 per second 10 per second and they're like no by the way 5 000 requests per uh per 10 minutes you should be able to serve that off a single machine using rust and leptos okay that'd be easy peasy pumpkin seeds you stop using JavaScript already okay but real talk what's your scaling issue should be just a single machine but but I'm just saying but this is insane well I love the Jerry Seinfeld reference right here that's super awesome I'm not gonna watch it look at this this is even better he's waiting for the premium 15 minute support imagine having your product completely shut down and then you have to wait for premium support you paid them money to support you better and they crushed you and so then it keeps on going right here which is it turns out this guy right here uh Hashi Corp guy right right hashicorp oh my God that I got that right I thought he was hashicorp no pragmatic hinge I thought it was hashicorp okay I'm stupid my bad my bad on that one sorry uh gurgly this is my bad uh anyways uh he stayed away from Google Cloud since this time and check this out look at this email look at this email this he's sending it to Google this is a Google email all right I understand Google's racing behind the change of pricing however you're going about it uh is completely amateur and the perfect example of how to alienate your customers here's the main reasons one early adopter we've read the frequently asked questions in the docs uh when signing up and chose uh Google app engine because of the lucrative CPU time-based billing I learning python only to be able to take advantage of this this was the core of the service which you're now throwing out the window by the way I love the fact that they learned a python just to use Google app engine but if you don't know Google app engine largely supported python for a long time I think they made the switch over to go in late 2013 if I'm not mistaken I trusted Google enough to build and scale on Google app engine of course it was in preview but Gmail was in beta for three years and nothing changed after that oh uh when stable how was I to assume that leaving preview will include dramatic changing in the service offered CPU time and pricing now up 400 percent on my side oh right should have probably not put trust in Google transition time after three years of preview you've suddenly given us two weeks to adjust to the new environment by the way I hate this Inc of companies Twitter did this other companies do this they come up with a new plan Reddit just did this right they make a huge huge huge change in which you've built up years of product on and they're like by the way you got you got four days no no I understand it took you years to get here you got four days you got that's what you got you got four you know one two one two three get it done do what it's just like insane that this is okay just crazy except the new environment still is false no python two seven and the scheduler buggy that's that's even better you have to upgrade but by the way it doesn't work uh today you've got you've extended this by another week and a half this is completely unreasonable time frame and the fact that even Google app engine team doesn't have a set date implies there's uh quite some chaos going on on your side as well communication all you've provided as guidance is a few liner a few liner pricing range a blog post and a really short frequently asked questions all that barely got into any detail guess we'll have to figure out how to optimize for the new system it's pretty clear from this form that either Google doesn't care about a the few hundred percent of price increased that its customers will have to pay without investing heavily into Optima optimizing their app or that it was actually uh the motive I remember Google starting out as don't be evil but that was a while back again a great idea to never have a slogan that has no concrete definition behind it uh I have been very much disappointed in how the situation is being not communicated and handled I've completely lost the hard-earned trust in Google I'll try to optimize my app as much as I can and at the same a point make steps to migrate to a more viable platform This Bitter lesson is also alienating me from using other Google developer platforms and services if you ask me you've just gained and tested uh Enterprise a great Enterprise cloud service congratulations for that and slapped all the early adopters for using it in the face degrading them to guinea pig testers congratulations for that as well I would call this a short-sighted move but then again that's probably why I'm not running the GAA the the Google app engine team now an 11 right look at this Google's been screwing people over for some time but this just has to be the biggest screw over of all time right here I just can't believe like how is this how is this even legal right I would assume as part of the terms and condition you I guess as a company I mean I know I know I I'm positive larger companies have deal with Cloud providers saying like hey we get this much amount we have these kind of terms and conditions but man like how could you ever use Google under that and so then of course I checked okay because this is a pretty big one right uh you know 1.1 million people saw it all that so I'm thinking Okay Google Cloud probably at least made uh at least like one you know they probably said something around June 10th right moral of the story never ever ever ever ever use Google Cloud I think that that is just the general lesson you should learn here use anything else digital ocean lenode AWS like just imagine this happening to you because I I actually really enjoyed my experience doing Google app engine in 2013. I really liked it I developed on it for a year and a half I loved Google app engine the name is don't use Google cloudigen okay ever
