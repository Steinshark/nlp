this is the vf390 a 390 millimeter fan that is by far the scariest thing we have ever attached to a computer it is made entirely out of carbon fiber it spins at a whopping 10 000 RPM blowing wind out the back at 450 kilometers an hour and guzzles a potentially lethal 250 amps do you remember our last highest airflow PC the one that literally blew the top off our computer case those two fans combined were two horsepower the vf-390 is 60. I don't know how long I'm going to be alive so before I go I'd like to tell you about our sponsor go to resolve the Legends are true simple easy to use yet effective It software does exist humanity is safe go to resolves remote monitoring and management capabilities allow agents to protect and secure important it assets check out go to resolve at the link below go to their link here come with me this is our problem see that Transformer back there even if we took the entire power allocation of this industrial unit and powered the fan with it it wouldn't be enough to do it legally and even if it could What Mortal power outlet and cord could carry that kind of current for context a standard North American Outlet will do just south of 2000 Watts our tormac can pull up to 4.8 000 Watts out of the outlet behind it this fan calls for nearly 10 times that 45 000 Watts which left us with only a couple of potential options for powering it option number the first was to build a Frankenstein battery out of 18650 cells we've actually done that on this channel before but frankly neither Kyle nor Alex trusted me building a come on with a lithium battery with it 240 cells okay that would have been a pretty bad idea a second option for powering the fan was to buy the battery from a Chevy Volt it's a little on the high side at 360 volt but because of how GM manufactured it having the voltage to something that would be usable for our fan is actually relatively simple the problem with that solution is that for one a volt battery is darn expensive and for two once we fiddled with the pack charging it could be difficult and or dangerous given the short timeline for this video then we decided to go the simplest route and spend 2500 dollars on high current LiPO batteries but we won't be using them all at once instead we're going to be doing this this is flammable isn't it oh good we've wired up six of our battery packs Each of which is four cells in series making a total of 24s that gets us up to the voltage that we need and given that these are high performance 130 C packs theoretically they could handle up to what 700 amps but we need about 250 meaning this should be perfect as long as we don't want to run it very long you see we haven't run any packs in parallel which means at Full Tilt we're going to be looking at about six minutes of run time even if we account for our Reserve packs here that gives us 12 minutes of run time meaning we better get this right on the first try we just connected it to the battery though Alex and Kyle over here needed to make sure that it worked the plans that we hopefully don't blow up something if something's not working correctly is to use this power supply and a boost converter so that we can have 48 volts coming out of this into our fan and we'll have current limits right on here so that if something's incorrect nothing goes super bad this is the ESC for any of you that don't know what an ESC is it takes DC generally from a battery and converts it to three-phase AC which is plugged into an induction motor of some kind so if this right here gets to about 80 85 degrees or so we're going to have to cut the fan turn her down a bit so notice that it's a capped on taped for isolation it's a bunch of capacitors all the actual business end is underneath you that's where all the fats will be uh that do all the switching to get your three phase out um and then there's your control your logic board one thing we have to be careful of with this is the inrush current so you don't want to just connect all of your batteries to this at once because these will briefly act as a short circuit ah yes but they thought of that may I introduce you to Mr Spock lead so inside here this lead is a resistor when there's a resistance between this lead and that lead if you attach these two points together it will slowly charge the capacitors instead of charging them really quickly so all that we're doing now is plugging plugging it in making sure nothing explodes you plug the hot side in okay then you plug this in no spark let me plug that in okay now we smell for Magic Smoke the easy way to test now if it's actually getting power is to probe the pwmly or you can probe this lead here oh there is a pwm signal oh yes you you can see it yeah this is a very good explanation of what pulse width modulation is you have a period which is the frequency at which this is switching and I think this is 50 hertz which is what comes out of a standard RC and what you're changing is the amount of time that the signal is on right so if this is when it's off and that's when it's on so right now I have the channel which is this little potentiometer set all the way to zero so fan is no no going right now I am going to slowly rotate this potentiometer and you will see how that line reacts to that small distance between there and there is the difference between that fan not moving and then blowing the computer away we're going to bolt this Frame to the Welding Table so we don't send both of them into the stratosphere oh hello hello sir [Music] yeah like that's ten percent power foreign it works we didn't blow anything up that actually went way better than I thought it did so Alex I know Linus is going to want it but every fiber of my being does not want to hand in the remote yeah that'll be dangerous oh no I want to do the throttle no no I want to do the throttle well we have tested before is running this off of a single boost converter and it worked well enough and that was great because we wanted the current limits and stuff in case something tried to blow up yeah now I've put two of them in parallel so we can hopefully get about 60 amps out of it something like that sick so we can play with this for a bit and not drain our batteries oh okay but maybe these will explode we'll see okay so can you power it on okay and I should be holding this down right is the output on uh yes so I'm connecting the hot okay hand me the spark lead yep whoa it makes a sound when you power it on it'll make six sounds just give me a sec just give it a second I know you like to send it but okay I I will be gentle so it's not the trigger it's not the trigger it's the pot over there just because the trigger's too way too sensitive so you're going to turn that pot and it's going to automatically just kick on it 40 the amount of concern I'm seeing from you one who is normally kind of Reckless actually really makes me worry because you have the remote [Music] a little bit more it doesn't sound quite right there we go [Music] wow it's actually surprisingly quiet we're drawing eight amps at what voltage and 48 volts at 48 volts so that's what that's wait this is two percent power yep what the hell is going on here gentlemen wait how many amps can we do at 100 volts we do up to 250 amps what what this is this is not that much this is unbelievable what the actual heck is going on here okay so hold on how many watts is this uh 24 times 12x so this is 250 Watts this thing will do 45 000 Watts what's the difference between this and a jet turbine uh do you do you know how much thrust this has no 60 kilograms so if you had a person that weighed 60 kilograms they could ride it yeah dear God and Heaven do you understand do you understand what's going to happen to the computer that we put here all right okay let's get the duct tape this is carbon fiber reinforced patchy which I'm pretty sure is going to be fine workers comp wants to know your location do not try this at home actually though like seriously I'm not too worried about people trying this at home this is an 8 000 Euro yeah yeah so let me get this straight this is the adapter from the  of the fan as Kyle calls it how do we to the computer yeah how how is this supposed to work just just relax trust me basically the concern is that with that amount of airflow going through here not only can we not have any fans in its way because they're going to overspin and blow out the headers on the motherboard it may actually like lift things away from each other like to put it in context 450 kilometers an hour that's what double the speed of a category 5 hurricane yeah there's gonna be a double hurricane inside this computer you're duct taping the Shroud to the fence no better idea that's not gonna do it Jack you guys this is a duct it's called duct tape the force of the computer pushing against it with the cross brace is going to hold it in place does the cross brace come up because it's just going to blow it off that's what the tie downs are for it's going to tie it down we have thought about this where's the hammer we've settled on a core I9 11900k and this is an RTX 2070. I sincerely hope they survive don't worry good catch new guy that was very close to shattering earlier than we expected I really think that we should french rally car all of the glass panels I don't know what the freak that means does that mean they normally tape up their headlights so if they shatter the glass doesn't go everywhere you know people often walk up to me and say oh it's so cool to meet you I'm your biggest fan now that will never be true ever again because this is my biggest fan um I forget how these work seems pretty stable right okay cool um hit me with okay she's on okay she's on it's reply okay let's do it treasure test yeah small fft there we go there we go okay okay CPU attempts are immediately a hundred we need to do something here we ready [Music] okay so we're still at 100 degrees though oh 98. our main issue then is basically just that we don't really have fans directly on our heatsink the biggest problem is you have too much back pressure into the fat it's not liking it oh really yeah we don't have enough throughput actually more power yeah I think we need more power so I turn it off now yeah [Music] foreign that was two percent power right okay I'm just about to hand you the remote for the full percent power nice we're going to put a current clamp on here you cannot go over a hundred because a hundred amps is all that we can measure wait are we not going to talk about the fact that that door is open uh and that garage door is open because we are going to be generating enough airflow through this room that that's a legitimate concern we bent the doors when we had the doors closed we blew the air out of that door and these ones right here went whoop and we're like oh let's not do that okay we ready okay that's 5x 5 amps yeah and we can do one ex this yes okay that's seven amps we're already down not thermal throttling anymore let's try to get to ten wow she's real touchy okay we're at 96 degrees temps are going down you guys want to go to 20 amps it's cool eh that's for sure okay 30 amps she goes boys 40. oh our attention how hot are the batteries they're fine 40 43. it was wrong 300 bucks on an air cooler and it was only hitting 94 degrees okay round two without the computer okay whoa and Logistics was so concerned about this CPU so can I pitch a crazy idea yes can we put the battery pack here in the flow of the air yeah in the path of the airflow rather a hundred amps then that was like a third power um a bit above that yeah about that what the hell [Music] okay what are we at that's 10 amps wow without the computer in the way see go [Music] flow for static pressure this this is clearly all about that airflow no treble okay now here's something I want to know oh you guys lied I can feel it a hundred percent coming through here can you see my hair moving hold on I'm gonna give it a little more four whatever that's only 6 p.m wow I have never seen anything like it how high did we get 60 yeah that's a fifth of full power okay we going again you guys want to go full bore yeah I've been informed that when we're running at full bore I am not allowed to stand behind it something something key man claws something liability anyway I mean the point is I'm gonna put this wig on my mop head here and see if I can even hold it in place I mean that's basically Linus right 10 ounce 20. 30. that's a hundred [Applause] wow foreign you can't um smell through the camera but I assure you it smells a lot don't do what we do yeah please don't especially don't tell you about our sponsor circuit specialists they provide electronic components tools and supplies to the stem community at competitive prices we're talking resistors capacitors soldering stations oscilloscopes add more you know computer stuff they got it all circuit specialists have chosen to use their expert part sourcing abilities to give customers access to tools and components they may otherwise not have maybe they're unavailable maybe they're too expensive think Robin Hood but for Tech their commitment to Quality ensures that you receive reliable and High Performance Products suited for your needs let circuit specialists help you upgrade your electronics toolkit by checking them out at the link below and using offer code lmg for 10 off if you guys enjoyed this video you might enjoy the one where Alex and I used a different fan to cool a computer and it blew the top off or you might enjoy the one where Colin and I tried to make a battery out of 18650 cells that one also involved fire and that door and disposing of batteries
