good morning everyone i feel like it's been whoa that's bright a minute since i've done a come on a day in my life with me for those of you who don't know i am a full-time soccer developer uh i work from home right now i can go into office but i haven't for for a minute actually um but i'm going to take you along today we're going to really talk about time blocking time management how i organize my day what else we're going to be doing today oh i'm going to take you to my co-working space today i feel like i need to get out of the house and work and lots of other fun stuff so let's just go first things first before we do anything anything what do you think i'm gonna say what do we need to get leave in the comments you know what i'm gonna say coffee [Music] success okay i just got dressed i felt like i needed to oh this lighting is just not happening better here you can see all my filming equipment from when i do actual videos well this is an actual video but you know what i'm saying uh one of the most common things that i get asked through for out my day i was looking at the questions that you left for me and one of the most common ones is how do you time block block or plan out your day so i'm going to share with you the steps i use it might be a bit excessive to some of you but it's what really helps me stay on track throughout the day organizing between time for coding meetings tiffin tech life you know everything so i'm gonna share with you that now i start actually with pen and paper tiffin tech tip not in tech i guess okay so i'm gonna start a new day here um sorry don't mind all the mess this is real life here so today is wednesday and you might not be able to read my writing but that's what it is then i will start by just writing out my priorities for the day so for me today i need to finish a feature so finish feature um 1 8 2 nine four that's the code of the feature i also need to email back um two different companies uh for tip and tech so back companies uh tt means tip and tech and then i also have some meetings for ibm today ibm meetings usually i'm a bit more specific but i can't you know share everything i do for work on years obviously so we're going to keep it kind of generic okay once i have the main few things that i need to achieve for the day i will start by time blocking so what i did this morning for example was from 7 30 to 9 i did tip and tech work with paul uh emails and the business side of things this usually will be either tip and tech business stuff from this hour and a half or it will be a workout today it was emails though and then i'll work out tonight then at nine i open my ibm computer and i literally with time blocking will write down everything i do from opening like sending an email to uh walking the dogs anything because all this like small amount of time is really i take it it adds up quickly okay i feel like we're going to be here forever so i just quickly wrote some what my day consists of so as you can see 9 to 9 30 is ibm emails 9 30 to 9 45 is stand up where we talk about what we did yesterday what we're doing today in any blockers the 9 45 to 10 is read over the ticket i'm going to be working on then 10 to 11 is actually coding it and then 11 to 11 30 is pr reviews which if you're not familiar with what that is it's essentially reviewing other people's code before it goes into production leaving comments feedback all that okay so that's kind of how i plan out my day as far as being very very specific as to what i am doing and i know some people might find that a little excessive but it's the only way i have found that i actually get things done otherwise i say i'm going to do all these things and then life happens you know things such as get a coffee go for a walk if i don't schedule that in but i do it then the time accounted for other things is gone and it doesn't they don't get completed i don't know if that makes sense but anyways that is my uh my progress okay it's gorgeous outside right now and i really want to go get a coffee speaking of coffee and head to the east room [Music] okay okay it is so bright out um i honestly didn't know if i was gonna share this with you or film this even because i don't know i just this is not what i thought this video would be but here we are um i was trying to be very honest and real with you and i shouldn't get to the point but lately i've been experiencing such terrible imposter syndrome like just to the point where i am moving my seat back i have been crying pretty much every day breaking down um and just having very i'm just feeling very anxious and um it's been really tough and it sucks and it's been a lot of because of professional stuff like just feeling as though i'm overwhelmed or not good enough or anything like that and it's been really really tough to navigate and i don't know i don't know how yeah when you're in imposter syndrome or you feel this way it just feels like it's never going to end and it just feels like it consumes your life from when you worked after you worked when you're sleeping to everything like it's all i think about like i had a long weekend this weekend and all i thought about was work and it was just not what like it's not what i wanted to i don't want to think about work when i'm you know trying to relax or enjoy myself and it was really stressful and i'm just trying to get better at navigating that and finding different ways to because you think you're going to get through it you think it's going to be okay and it's tough sometimes i know i'll come out stronger on the other side but it doesn't mean during these times it doesn't make it easy and um i just really wanted to share that with you because i think having these feelings and feeling a little overwhelmed or like these really tough emotions um that happen at all stages in your career you're not alone we all go through them to varying degrees and that really helps me even just knowing that other people have felt this way and it's gonna be okay and we know more than we think we do maybe i'm just rambling now but i just really wanted to share that with you because it's just been it's been really tough and um i know it will get better but it doesn't mean in the meantime it doesn't um it does not make it easier and i think the only way to get through it is just doing things for yourself giving yourself self-care like for me it's been going on walks and things like that and i feel like i'm rambling but basically imposter syndrome can suck and feeling like you don't deserve stuff can suck and you need to i need to really work on flipping that around and taking time for myself to to to get better at that i guess anyways i just finished a huge crying session so i feel like i'm a little ugh okay we got this we can do this look at these muscles we're stronger than we think okay that was so weird but ah anyways okay let's go to co-working space hello okay we are home i feel like it's been quite the eventful day you can see we have some clothes i need to put into storage and then i have a half eaten sandwich still that i'm going to enjoy but basically um i felt very therapeutic honestly just to have a moment to like you know when everything is just piles up and just feels like a little too intense so anyways i'm i put tomatoes on i'm not a huge tomato person i don't know tomatoes um i'm just gonna try talking and eating but it's not gonna work it's not gonna work [Music] no okay we are not going to eat and talk at the same time because i don't know how people do that you see people on like youtube and they're like eating and talking it doesn't bother me but i feel like i'm not good at it i'm not an eater and a talker um today this afternoon i didn't film really in the east room because there was a lot of people and i was just like this is not happening right now but what i worked on today was i am working on a feature for the front-end side of things that require some information from the api from the back end team and it's not coming in right now so i'm kind of waiting on that and then in the meantime i always just switch to working on something else so for me right now that means helping others with their tickets working on pr reviews um looking into different defects defects meaning like bugs that have been created uh from features so qa always always finds that so if you are qa watching this i love you but i also you also drive me nuts sometimes with the defects um yeah so i'm just waiting for on my feature to get unblocked by getting the information required from the back end i'm going to continue on that for today today's pretty light on meetings which is nice um so it's really just work i wish i could show you what i actually do but i can't so if you have any other ideas of how to make it more interactive to show you different things let me know let me know what other questions you have and okay i gotta finish this sandwich i get back to work okay i just finished doing work for the day and i think paul and i are going out for dinner i'm not certain though we are going to and then now it's getting late and he is still stuck in traffic so i feel like it might not be it might be taken tonight because i did not make anything and it's getting late um i hope you enjoyed this i hope you found it valuable and helpful it's really strange for me because i can't show you exactly what it is i do you know i can't show you the code or whatever but i'm trying to share with you as much as i can about what it is to be like um you know a software developer my day to day what it looks like and uh just give you as much insight and advice as possible i think someone wants to say hi what is this hello come say hi you are such a little oh my goodness you're so big oh i don't want your treat in my face oh okay now it's puppy snuggles so anyways i hope you enjoyed my video [Music] you
