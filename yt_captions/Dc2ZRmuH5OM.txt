- This is a giant $100,000 diamond, and protecting it is the most advanced security system in the world. And these guys are each gonna be trying to steal the diamond. Turn on the lasers. This one is hard. All right, Chris is going. All right. All right, Nolan's going. - [Chris] Oh, that side's easier. - [Nolan] I'm following Chris. - [Karl] Go, you go first. - [Nolan] No, you go first. - [MrBeast] Chris, are
you about to lose a life. - [Karl] Oh my God, yeah! - [Chris] We did it. - [Karl] Jump, jump. - [Chandler] This is terrifying. - [MrBeast] It's only $100,000 for your brother or sisters on the line. - [Karl] Oh, he's going,
he's going, he's going. - Oh no, he did, he did it. - Let's go. - [Karl] Oh my gosh, I'm
gonna lose a life here. - [MrBeast] Let's see it, all right Nolan, Nolan's going, Nolan is going. Yeah. - [Nolan] Let's go. Karl, get ready to lose a heart. - [MrBeast] Karl, in front
of 20,000,000 people, let's see it. He's going, he's going, he's going. He didn't touch a laser. There you go. All right boys, come on in. - [Chris] Whoa. - [Karl] No chance. - [MrBeast] Whoever
finishes this course last has to do the next one on one leg. - [Karl] Ooh, this is gonna be tricky. I'm just gonna follow
Nolan since he's safe. - [MrBeast] Oh. - Boom, I'm first. - [Nolan] Oh, oh what's up? It's Karl. Karl hit it first. - [Karl] Yes!
- [MrBeast] Karl hit it first, which means Chandler you have
to do the next one on one leg. - [Chandler] Oof. - [Karl] Lasers, initiate.
(electronic beeping) - [Group] Oh. - [Karl] There are two colors this time. - [MrBeast] Wait Chris,
oh, Chris is going. Chris. (group exclaiming) - Ow. - [MrBeast] Go through the
door to the next level. Chris is down a heart, Chandler you have to do it on one leg. He's struggling to stand on his own. - [Nolan] Chandler man. Oh. (group awwing) - [Nolan] All right. - All the boys be losing lives. - [Karl] It's so hard. - There we go, I'm sorry. I would go strategize of how
you don't lose those lives. And then there was two, what are you guys waiting on? - [Nolan] You were filming stuff. - [Karl] Yeah. - [MrBeast] No one has
been able to do it so far, will Nolan complete the impossible? No, watch out, watch out. (bell dinging) Get out of here. (Nolan sighing) Karl, everyone has lost a life. - [Karl] Watch this, ready? - There's no way he does this, no way. Oh, oh. Oh, he hit it.
(buzzer sounding) You hit it. I'm sorry, but even if
you are actually dead, you lost a life. And all four boys lost
a life on this course. Since they all just lost a life, I'm gonna put an extra life
right here and not tell them. Shh. For this next stage you can
go the second you walk in. Start whenever. - [Chris] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. - [Nolan] Doing this fast
now, no more waiting. - [MrBeast] Congratulations,
Chris got an extra life. - Yeah, woo. - Guys, you gotta be on your toes, there's surprises. - [Karl] I'm going to the next stage. - [Chris] All right, bye. - I'm going to take the giant diamond, and they won't see this coming, watch. I'm going to put it above the door. So technically they could
just reach up and touch it, but they won't. And to distract them even more I'm gonna put an extra life right here. So they're gonna be focused on this, and not even realize
the diamond's missing. - [Chandler] Hello? - [MrBeast] All right, come on in. You can go whenever you want. There might be something
on the ground over there. - [Chandler] Oh my God, he did it. - Boom. - [MrBeast] Don't touch the laser. - Get skinny, wait for them to go down. - [MrBeast] Be careful,
don't touch the laser, touch the box. - Oh no, I'm stuck. - [MrBeast] Wait, Karl join them. - [Karl] Okay.
- [Chris] I'm nervous. - I touched it. (electronic dinging) - Think about your sister,
this is more than you. - [Nolan] Is there any
punishment for touching it last? - [MrBeast] No. - [Nolan] Oh, you just
wanted to waste our time? (group exclaiming) - [Karl] Oh, he's good. - [Chandler] Touch it. - [MrBeast] All right,
congratulations, you all passed. Check it out. You guys have to jump
on this, jump on this, through this, onto the padding. - Okay, so we're all losing a life. - [MrBeast] Wait, Chris are you ready? - [Karl] He's going. - [Group] Oh.
- [MrBeast] He did it. - [Karl] No, he hit the top for sure. - Oh no, play it back in slow mo. (melancholic music) - There we go. - [MrBeast] I'll take that. - There you go.
- [MrBeast] All right, see you at the next level. All right, let's see it,
Chandler's going, boom. Boom. (group awwing) He touched it too, dude you
guys keep kicking the top one. - What? - [MrBeast] Chandler go
ahead and take a heart off, Nolan let's see you do it, let's go. Boom, boom. Pow. I think he got it. - [Nolan] Yes!
- Congratulations. - Let's go. - [MrBeast] Let's see if Karl's
an athletic freak of nature. - I love both these hearts equally, and I'm not gonna lose either. Let's do this. - [Chris] No, he hit it. - [MrBeast] Did he?
- [Chris] Yeah. (bell dinging) - Karl your leg hit it. - Here, I got it. (Karl exclaiming) - You only have one left. - [MrBeast] The next time
you two mess up donezo. All right, go to the next level. - [Chris] Right through here. - [MrBeast] Congrats
Nolan, you're doing good. Nolan lost an $800,000 island, and he lost $100,000 in this video. If you lose again today, you've lost $1,000,000
in videos, congrats. (electronic beeping) This next one is insane,
look how beautiful it is. - [Karl] It's actually gorgeous. - [Nolan] It's pretty nice. - [MrBeast] One of you might
literally lose right now, and don't forget who you're playing for. - I found a heart. - [Chris] And go. - Hey, wait, wait. Chandler you are quick, I hid a heart over there
and Chandler found it. - Go Nolan.
- Let's go! - [Karl] He absolutely hit his noggin. - We're watching the footage back to see if the laser touched
Nolan before he touched the box. - [Karl] It hit his noggin. - See that little spot of
your head where it hit? See your head where it's purple? Barely half a second. Here we go, all right,
welcome to the two heart gang. Karl is the only person with one life, if you touch that you're out. - [Karl] Touch this? - [Chris] I hate you. - [MrBeast] Oh, he's
starting on the safe side. - Yes I am, I have one life. Oh, that got closer than I thought. - [Nolan] Lay down. - I think I might go. - You going? Go for it. - [Chris] All right, he's doing it. - Oh Karl's in, Karl's in. And Chandler's in, you both made it. - [Chandler] Let's go. - [MrBeast] All right
Chris, you're the only one. - I'm scared. - [MrBeast] All right Chris, let's go, what was that? Oh your elbow hit it, your elbow hit it and your head hit it. - [Chris] Did it actually?
- [MrBeast] Yeah. - Does it drop down? - [Nolan] Yeah, it does. - Oh, oh wait, it's way taller now. - Yeah, that's what they were waiting for. - Oh. Oh. That's how my heart is right now, and I'm sure that's how
my brother's heart is. - [Karl] I thought this
was the next stage. - For this next one I have
LazarBeam himself on the line, because we're using lasers, ironic. - I get it. - Is there anything you wanna say? 20,000,000 people are watching. - Do I get money for
appearing in this video? - No. All right, so boys, come on in. For this next course guys
I let Lazar pick it out, he said he wanted it hard. Turn on the lasers. - [Karl] What? - I'm also gonna let Landon
decide which two of you are handcuffed together
for this next stage. - Wait, what?
- Karl and Chandler. - Yes!
- [MrBeast] Karl and Chandler, all right. - Lazar, see what you're doing to me? - Thank you LazarBeam for coming out, we're gonna go back to
playing with lasers. All right Nolan as the
man with the most lives-- - Go.
- Technically go. - [Chris] Nolan, Nolan's doing it. - [MrBeast] Nolan's rolling. - [Chris] No way he just did this. - [MrBeast] Oh, he did it. - Congratulations. Oh, that one just appears, and that one disappears. - [Chandler] Oh Chris, Chris. - [Chris] Ooh wee. - [MrBeast] All right, will
he do it, will he do it, will he do it? Oh my goodness, he did it. Now onto the handcuffed people. - We're gonna step, step, step, once we make it to the corner, shimmy. - [Chandler] Come on, come on. All right, watch out for that one that's gonna appear. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. - [Karl] Go, go, go, go, go. - [Chandler] Stop.
(Karl screaming) Oh, oh, oh, oh. (Karl screaming) - Yeah, that's gonna need a replay. - That's a photo finish. - If somebody touched it it was him, but yeah, we killed it. - Yeah, yeah, wait what? - Hand on. - Yeah, theirs is good. - Hands on, take that LazarBeam. - For this next one whoever finishes first their sibling gets $10,000. I'm pretty sure they heard
me talking about the 10 K, come on in. - Yes I did, I will be going now. Whoa. - If I hit a laser do
I still get the 10,000? - Yes. Wait, all right. All right, well Nolan
you won the 10 grand. There we go. You didn't even let me explain the level. The lights actually flicker. - [Voiceover] Huh? - All right, go ahead and do
what they were supposed to do, start flickering them. - [Nolan] What? - Yeah, see? (Nolan laughing) So if you would've waiting
literally two seconds you could've got the 10 K
without giving up a life. Now Nolan's only on one life. Bye Nolan. - [Nolan] See ya. - Nolan, Chris and Karl all have one life. Chandler you're the
only one with two still. - Yep, I'm beating everyone. - [MrBeast] Oh, he's
doing it, he's doing it. Did he touch it?
- Did I touch it? - [MrBeast] Karl, he did? - [Karl] Yeah, he did. - Oh Chris. - That is not enough time, I sprinted. - But you sprinted just to lose a heart. - Dude, there's no chance
you guys are gonna make that. - Wait a minute, Chris
this was your last life, you're out of lives. - I've been losing so much recently. - Bye. - [MrBeast] Now only three people remain. Oh, oh, oh, oh. He did it, he did it. - I did it, holy crap. - Congratulations. You still have two lives. - I'm trying to learn the pattern. - [MrBeast] Oh, no way you just did that, no way you just did that. - Yeah baby, yeah! - [MrBeast] Oh my God. You literally jumped before it turned off. - [Karl] Yes I did. - Oh my gosh, Chandler
you should've saw that. - [Chandler] What just happened? - Oh my God. - This is Chandler's
sister, Nolan's sister, and Karl's brother. And we're gonna let them
watch in the corner. - It's gonna be me guys. - I don't know about that one. - Come in to what might be the last stage of the competition. We have a balance beam here, where you must cross without
falling like I just did. By the way Karl and Nolan your sister and brother
are on iPads over there. - [Karl] Hi Sean.
- [Nolan] Hello. - All right, here we go. - [MrBeast] All right, Chandler has begun. - Whoa, why is it so wobbly? - [Chris] Chandler, Chandler, no, no. - [MrBeast] Chandler has two
lives, he can afford to fail. - [Chandler] Just stop wobbling. - [MrBeast] Oh, this is not looking good. - [Nolan] No Chandler! - You can play dead as long as you want, but I've still gotta rip a heart off. (heart exploding) All right, Cassidy he
only has one heart left. If Karl and Nolan lose here
though Cassidy you win. Nolan all you gotta do is balance your way to 100 grand for your sister. - [Karl] Don't think about
falling Nebraska boy. - [MrBeast] Oh no. Oh, oh he did it, he did it. - Let's go! You got it, lose. We going for it. - All you have to do is just balance, it's not that hard.
- Oh, oh. - Just get good. - I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. - [MrBeast] Oh.
- [Nolan] Oh look at those... - [MrBeast] He's out, he's out. - [Nolan] Let's go. - Karl. I just need to make
sure I strip your heart. - [Chris] Oof. - I'll do it for you. - Just take the shirt off. All right, yeah bye, goodbye. - [Sean] I'm so sad. - Yeah, I would be too. All right, I'm gonna hang up (laughs). You each have one heart left, either your sister or your sister is winning $100,000 diamond. - You're going down. - No, you're going down. - Let's proceed. - Natalie, it's down to me and Chandler. - [Natalie] You got this, I know you do. - It could be the final round, we both have one life left. I'm gonna try my hardest to
win this 100 grand for Cassidy, hopefully she'll gimme some. All right.
(Cassidy laughing) - And now the moment you've
all been waiting for. Come in gentlemen. Chandler these are your two stools, Nolan these are your two stools. You got have to get to the diamond using only these two stools. First to grab it wins
their sister 100 grand. Think of your sisters. - I'm thinking. - [MrBeast] Five, four, three, one, go. All right, if you touch
the floor you're out. Once you get on your stools, Nolan has started. I never said you couldn't-- - [Karl] Whoa. - [MrBeast] Here Nolan. - [Chandler] I misclicked. - [MrBeast] No sabotage, I helped him. That's where they are,
and here's the diamond. First to touch it keeps it. - [Karl] Oh Nolan, he's going. - This is insane, oh my goodness. - It hurts my knees so bad. Cassidy, you gotta buy me a new knee cap. - [MrBeast] Nolan is clearly out in front, they're closing in on the diamond. - Yes, I'm gonna win. - No, you're not. - [Karl] Oh, oh. - [Chris] Go Chandler. Chandler you gotta go fast. - [Karl] Chandler it's do or die. It's do or die Chandler. - [Karl] Chandler go. - [Nolan] We got it. I had it, I had it. - [MrBeast] Nolan congratulations. - We got it, we got the (indistinct). You just won not only 100 grand, but 10,000 on top of it,
we can't stop winning. - He just won her $110,000. That was two times in a row you almost won your sister 100 grand. (melancholic music) - Sorry Cassidy, maybe next time. - It's okay. - While you're catching your breath I just wanna say this is actually fake. That costs like 20 bucks, the real diamond is in my pocket. Legit, this is $100,000 diamond. Here, look at it. I'm gonna put the real
$99,000 diamond in here, and then we are gonna
ship it to his sister. You just won $110,000, what is going through your mind? - Honestly, I don't even know what to say. This is absolutely so freaking crazy, and I am literally shaking. You're the best brother I could ever have. - Yeah, I hope so. - All right, thank you for watching. ♪ Mr B 6000, oh, oh ♪ (loud explosion)
