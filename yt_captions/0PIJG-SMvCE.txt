ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Champions chess tour finale it is the final four and it is the last day of the semi-finals after today we will know who first and second are well rather we will know who's playing first for first and second and we will know who is out in a tie for third and fourth place winning $50,000 going into today Magnus Carlson leads against Fabiano caruana so Fabiano has to win the second set to force a tiebreaker and nir be Abdus satov leads against Wesley so so Wesley needs to win the second set against ner Beck to force a tie break and then ultimately win that tie break and that is all and there is a massive amount of money up for grabs uh today was a really long day for me I'm actually uploading this almost at 10:00 at night so Americans you will maybe see this in the morning uh folks living in other parts of the world will either wake up at 4:00 a.m. to see this or we'll see it just whenever they do uh and uh yeah today was a really nice day today I woke up very early I was actually on three pieces of media uh I was on Canadian radio with Matt Turner uh I was on uh I was on two morning programs here in Canada and then I did commentary and I mean it's it's just been a very very long day and I'm I'm feeling very grateful I also had a chance to sit down and interview Magnus which uh very much looking forward to publishing that was a cool conversation some goofy questions in there but actually was a very nice interview and uh definitely got over some of those uh first time meeting Magnus Jitters Fabiano Carana Magnus Carlson here we go Fabiano needs to take down probably the greatest chess player of all time and he needs to do it in Rapid which is probably the worst format uh for Fabiano to play against Magnus I mean he has his best Chance In classical we know their World Chess Championship was extremely close and in this game Fabby provoked an aggressive uh G5 but instead of getting G5 Magnus went back to the E7 square with his bishop and sort of played a kg approach Fabiano took some space on the queen side from Magnus we traded Bishops and then we had castles and Magnus played this move Pawn to B5 just trying to seize some space and also trying to induce Fabiano into playing the move on passant now Fabiano is a cultured man he knows that on passant is of course forced and now the uh Rooks have a staring contest on the a file because nobody wants to trade because if you trade then you are going to give away uh some control uh to your opponent now Knight to D4 is played by Magnus we have Knight takes Pawn takes and the Knight going back to the E2 Square uh targeting the pawn on D4 and now Magnus creates this impregnable Pawn Fortress with all of his pawns on dark squares literally that is not an exaggeration this bishop definitely feels like an imposter but the position is actually completely fine in traditional circumstances you really don't want to play like this it's actually really really not advised uh but uh you know that's only if white is actually able to take advantage of the light squares like for example if white can go here here and teleport the knights to D5 Square white will of course have a fantastic position uh but do keep that in mind because Magnus certainly has some light squir weaknesses and he's a very sound positional player and but he he definitely knows the dangers of what he's doing now Fabiano immediately fights for those light squares he puts his Queen on a light Square diagonal now he trades the Rooks because the a file has lost a little bit of its Allure it doesn't matter that Magnus can control it and now we have Pawn to F4 and Fabiano in the span of three moves obtains not just a better position against Magnus but a fullon completely winning position it is plus 5 and a half and out of nowhere Magnus is busted and I think it all kind of started right around here they'll notice magnus's clock management he thought for a while he thought for nearly 2 and a half minutes if not about that on this move and suddenly came some problems as the entire impregnable Pawn structure that he had created is quickly going to crumble and this trade is bad I literally just mentioned to you that the Knight versus Bishop Dynamic will be really nice for white because white will be able to take advantage of the light squares if the Knight landed there but also there and there and within the span of just a couple of moves the game is virtually over now I don't know why Fabiano did not play Knight H5 right away uh because Knight H5 first would force the bishop back but now he has yet another chance to play Knight H5 and and Knight H5 is crushing because you threaten Knight to F6 which would force the king back but it's still not you know it's not completely trivial for example it looks like this is a good move but suddenly Rook C1 and white actually has to go here because if King H2 there's Bishop D6 which pins the queen to the king and that would be a really big problem so instead of all of that Fabby goes here which apparently is a uh is a is a mistake uh because suddenly Magnus gets counterplay Magnus can completely abandon his Bishop because now the Knight cannot come to F6 with check so the king doesn't have to go there so if you play Rook takes Bishop you actually get hit with Queen F4 and some very violent counterplay because G3 Queen F2 is actually mate and Knight G3 you lose your Rook so that is all to say that suddenly Fabiano caruana is grinding down an endgame and and uh and and he is no longer completely winning now he is still being very clutch and he does get two connected pass pawns as both guys with less than 10 seconds makes some really catastrophic mistakes and he is back to being completely winning as fbby because he has two pass pawns so a lot of drama a lot of chaos but now Fabby going to start the day really really well exactly like he did yesterday winning a couple of very nice games against Magnus before Throwing It All Away with one night check that's what happens when you get 10 seconds on the clock in this position apparently white needed to play Rook C7 and then D7 that is or or or or King E4 followed by trying to play E6 so for example King E4 uh and there let's say you know King H7 and uh now white can maybe walk the king in or something like this I mean yeah supposedly there was a better way to do it this is not the way this is not the way because all of a sudden the move G5 becomes viable you can actually not take the the the the the piece here because this is hanging and suddenly Magnus gets the pawn you cannot take the pawn because Rook takes Knight and this game ends in a crazy turn of events as Fabiano uh is threatening to win by blocking The Rook Magnus has to sack his Rook for defensive measures oh my goodness absolutely chaotic game that ultimately ends in Kings and uh and this is just the story of the match I mean Fabiano has played exceptionally well against Magnus he just cannot put him away he just cannot put him away I mean he's just at all like I at all is a bit of an exaggeration but yesterday he was up a queen you know yesterday he was up a queen in that game in the first game of the match and he ended up losing so this one hurts um and and uh Magnus is about to really make sure it hurts because we go for a queen Pawn opening Magnus deviating from E4 not getting anything with the white pieces there and this time Fabby plays cdcd now cdcd is a line that became popular about three years ago not that you have to know this but you can use it to win your local trivia night uh this line is a very forcing line in the semi taraj that is basically killing the game for black meaning black is no longer longer uh worse uh and and and basically can try to equalize by trading many pieces Magnus plays the most forcing way you trade the Queens uh but then instead of Knight G5 you actually play Knight E5 Knight G5 would attack two pawns Knight E5 just attacks one so it actually looks pretty stupid it looks like why would you put your knight here well apparently the idea is very quick development and I mean Magnus does play these lines I think a bit more than Fabiano actually if you check the database I might be wrong but I don't know if Fabby has ever played cdcd I mean I really don't remember I could be totally mistaken but I Fabiano does not strike me as a cdcd kind of guy uh just uh you know just a cassette tape kind of guy so Magnus is probably digging into his uh you know tank of of memory and he is trying to find some lines and he plays Knight D5 check and and he gets the bishop which is very important because White's position is so strong that despite being a pawn down Black's King is in the center white will probably win this Pawn back and it's just really a matter of time Bishop to E1 is a ridiculous necessity otherwise the bishop is trapped and then you play Rook E5 and then you're going to win a pawn back one Pawn has been one back now white probably there we go and this is what Magnus has to work with which is essentially the absolute worst thing you can give Magnus the position is very slightly imbalanced he has a potential to play essentially forever with his two connected pawns against the two separate black pawns could stockfish draw this game with black yes likely but white can play Forever Magnus gets the king away Rook C5 and he also has more than double Fabiano's time Rook F1 forces the king back and now Fabby trades and we have this endgame again probably holdable but it's Magnus and it's really not a situation you find very pleasant Fabiano creates the structure of Pawns again Magnus wants to avoid quickly trading too many pawns uh he wants to hunt these pawns as much as possible he also might want to avoid trading both Rooks a bishop versus knight end game he has to guarantee he's winning at least one of the pawns G3 Rook E4 Bishop C4 putting pressure okay solid right Rook H4 all right we're looking maybe we're going there maybe we're going here what are we going to accomplish B5 yeah Fab's doing a really nice job this is excellent defense from Fabby he is completely pushing Magnus backwards yeah Magnus I mean you got to give credit where it's due just an exceptional job here by Fabiano Rook F2 okay he goes for a rook trade Fabi trades but you know that pawn on H5 is a little bit weak but you can just play Knight D4 okay the idea is of course Rook H5 Knight G7 so that pawn is still protected Rook C5 Bishop F this is getting a little bit dicey now he's poking and he's prodding and he's Rook e five but he still can't win anything somehow he does grab a pawn now Knight C4 apparently the evaluation is still equal but Rook E3 is a little bit of a misstep um I think the computer here uh preferred something like just keeping the Rook on C5 but the second time Fabby played a rook back to E3 was a huge mistake um in this position after Rook E1 Bishop F3 something like Rook F1 or F F5 preventing this would have kept the game going this unfortunately allows a rook trade or fortunately depending on if you're a fan of Magnus and uh the pressure pays off we go to this and I told you Bishop for Knight only works if these pawns are going to go but it's worse than that because actually these pawns are now on light squares which was nice in a rook end game when the pawns protected the white uh restricted rather the white position but this game is a vintage Magnus end game grind where the opponent SL s sadly makes a slight inaccuracy and um Agnus wins and the match is all but over it is all but over uh because Fabiano is down two to one he's down two to one and he lost the set yesterday so all Magnus needs is a draw and he is going to put Fabiano away E4 from Fabby all right E5 from Magnus you play not to lose this is what you play we have an Italian we have D3 Bishop C5 and Fabby again playing this provocative line Magnus going back to something that worked well in the last game actually we have essentially the exact same position and B5 the same exact approach from Magnus uh on passant possible but this time we have Queen B3 that move uh is actually a fork but uh you are not in any way shape or form intending to take this Pawn because all of a sudden you are going to create crazy stuff over here for your opponent but now Magnus defens this pawn and attacks these are perhaps the two most surprising moves in the entire game for me I mean I'm not sure there's much else you can do when you play fe6 you probably make a declaration that you want to create an attack but Knight H5 G5 keep in mind this is not a must-win game Magnus Carlson is not the one that is playing this for a win he doesn't have to win the game he just has to not lose and I I was brought in the broadcast uh right around here uh to get my thoughts on the game and I thought well this is really interesting that he's playing like this and apparently he should have been patient apparently he could have played here and he could have went here and then you know prepared a little bit but instead of that he went straight to F4 now Bishop takes and this looks really good for white uh for black right I mean just as a human being I'm looking at this this this and I'm thinking oh my God white is going to get check baited I think most of us actually here would prefer to play the Black position but as it so happens the best way to meet a strike on the flank is to strike back in the middle you see an attacking side really likes a closed center that is very difficult to bust open with Pawn or pece trades because if you open up the center of the board when you're getting attacked your opponent now has something to deal with and in this case uh yeah that is very much what is happening all of a sudden Magnus is like how am I actually going to attack Fabiano but Magnus is extremely confident he just won that that other game and you know Fabby and and and look at this just H5 and Fabby has misstepped he is now definitely not any better Magnus has completely arrived on the king side and he's getting pushed back and Magnus goes grabbing a pawn which apparently is not a good decision apparently it was better for black to go here lose the pawn on G4 and then just take this one and just apply pressure which looks loose I mean that Rook looks real loose but but he took this pawn and then he went back and he thought well it's just a matter of time I'm going to take I'm going to hide my king I'm going to get my pieces in the game and Fab's cooked Fabby is completely cooked and then here Fabiano caruana said I am the freaking man and if you think I am cooked boy do I have news for you Mr Magnus Carlson that sounds like a guy standing up to his bully that's not really what Fabiano sounds like or says during games Pawn to C4 if you are being attacked on a side of the board you start striking back in the center and suddenly it becomes very clear that black is ill equipped to stop the transformation of the queenside pawns and white is going to push the a pawn all the way which means Magnus has to go here but as it turns out Magnus didn't have to go there he could have kept attacking the other hidden idea of Pawn to C4 was not not Pawn takes C4 Queen takes C4 which is kind of nice Pawn to C4 opened the door for White's Queen to go that way and as it turns out who is attacking who this entire game Magnus marged down Fabiano like a mafioso whose rent money was 3 months late and as it just so happens there was a trapo in the store and uh we're in big trouble now if you are Magnus Carlson Queen H3 check and Magnus is tanking 42 seconds on the clock oh my goodness Rook to G3 Knight back to F3 suddenly those those little Knights that were pushed into the corner as White's kingside was getting ravaged are opening up Magnus has to sacrifice his rook and start running his King but it's too desperate Rook C1 played by fabbi by the way that is not a blunder of a rook because the bishop is pinned to the queen but there is Rook takes F3 in in this position which is a pretty cool tactic Rook F3 there is Bishop C1 both guys got two low time Fabiano completely chops down Magnus Carlson's position and Against All Odds defeats Magnus to force an Armageddon oh my God oh my goodness you can't ask for more in this match Fabiano has beaten Magnus as many times in Rapid chess as Magnus has beaten him you cannot ask for a better performance now the Armageddon bids to play with the black pieces were 10 minutes and 0 seconds for Magnus and 9 minutes and 58 seconds for Fabiano Carana two seconds of difference and I you know I I thought well Magnus bid 10 and he had a feeling that Fabiano would bit a little bit under him so he's fine playing with white but having a five minute and two second time Advantage as it turns out uh Magnus said in the postgame interview the postmatch interview that um or actually he said it not he said it in the Armageddon interview which they do you know before the players reveal uh Magnus said he was just kind of like tired he had no idea what to bid so he just bid something which I just I just find that very funny like all as commentators we have to sit there going oh my God the psy and like these guys are just like exhausted and just you know submitting bids so Fabiano has the black pieces Fabiano has 9 minutes and 58 seconds and Fabiano has draw ODS so Fabiano wins this game or rather doesn't lose this game uh we go to a tiebreak match between Magnus and Fabby which is which is just absolutely Sensational and what everybody wants a Spanish a Mainline Spanish and now Fabiano surprises Magnus he does not play B5 and Bishop C5 which is what he has been playing recently that is the arhangel variation he doesn't play the classical line with Bishop E7 D6 and B5 Etc he plays Knight takes pawn and you might be wondering how does black not do that more often isn't that just a free Pawn this is just called the open Spanish it's called the open Spanish because it's a real thing that has been played many many times and with good play White will win that pawn back but white is not going to you know be down upon D4 Rook E1 B5 D5 now yeah D4 is the uh is the main line Bishop B7 uh is a move for sure I think actually B5 and and D5 uh first might be but it doesn't really matter because B5 and D5 is play and we have a a Mainline position and now we have H3 and H3 is apparently a sideline I think it is more common for white to play Bishop E3 Knight bd2 go after this Knight and play something like Bishop to C2 but Magnus plays this and then this and from the opening uh Fabiano is completely fine like Fabiano has a completely fine position in fact if Fabiano had played F5 here he might have just straight up been better with black that Knight is extremely strong and actually after ef6 Rook F6 white has very very ve black excuse me has very real attacking possibilities and white which is what I said first has very real problems but instead of moving his F Pawn I think Fabiano played a little bit tense and Magnus did mention he felt Fabiano was definitely tense in the Armageddon and and and trying to trade a lot of pieces as you can see here you're trying to just get a little bit of stability in the position but Magnus very very clever idea trading the Queens not a move that a lot of us would consider or play but it is what he does because he just needs the tiniest of microscopic advantages uh he has achieved that in this position and now he can essentially play the position until uh you lose your mind uh ideas like E6 exists right Bishop C7 I mean maybe A4 to poke at the queen side B4 to fix the pawns and control that square Fabiano tries to solve everything forcefully with the move Pawn to D4 Rook C1 anticipating the opening of the position DC3 Rook C3 if the pawn marches into D3 it will be promptly apprehended by both Rooks and the Knights so you can't do that DC Rook C3 Knight B4 and Rook C7 and in the Skirmish Fabiano has lost the pawn but he has still eyes on this Pawn he is eyes over here this is a potential Fork that wins material Magnus bulldozing his way through targeting the bishop on E7 Bishop G5 Knight G5 and in this position in this position Knight D3 is the move and after Knight D3 which is a triple Fork White has to play E6 which is a very interesting idea the idea being that if Knight takes you take and then you can actually promote and that's a major problem but after Knight D3 E6 uh the best move is F6 and then and then the play goes on and the game is equal but that is Fabiano's chance he needs to start with Knight D3 instead of that Fabiano starts with F6 that is a problem he needed to play Knight D3 first because then he would have had eyes on multiple targets clearly he didn't like something otherwise he would have played it but he plays F6 and suddenly he is in bad shape because now Magnus gets in magnus's Pawn is now two squares away from queening The Rook controls the entire seventh rank Magnus can actually lose both of these pawns because he can invest fully in The Rook uh the the the the pawn that is currently being blocked by The Rook Fabiano creates a little bit of breathing room for his King but Magnus is just ready to sacrifice those pawns another very important detail you might be overlooking is magnus's King is completely safe otherwise the back rank could not have been cleared and actually Magnus uh allows a little bit of counterplay here which does look a little bit dicey this hanging n this hanging rook and this hanging Rook but the bigger idea is actually to trap the king in a cage if you play this I'm not going to take your Rook I'm going to force a draw I'm going to keep your king in a box which is which is real nice but key detail and you now now are no longer in a box but more importantly you are just headed for a winning night and Rook end game and this one ends with a brilliant move Knight takes G7 Pawn is queening defended by the Knight but if you take the Knight it's a discovered attack and ladies and gentlemen that is the end of Fabiano Carana Journey here in the Champions chest Tor finale two Armageddon lost to Magnus Carlson one with white one with black absolutely brutal he wins $50,000 but he surely would have wanted more this is the number one and number two ranked chess players in the world this is a rivalry that has been at the top of chess for over 5 years at this point and um Magnus Carlson himself thinks that the second best chess player on the planet is Fabiano Carana out of his own mouth so that's special that's pretty cool but it's not cool for Fabiano Magnus Carlson is the first finalist and he awaits the winner of the match between Wesley so and nir Beck abdulov don't go anywhere I'll make make this quick Wesley so lost yesterday to Nock and he Trails one to nothing in the sets and um this match was absolutely nuts All Right Wesley so showed up today and played B3 he threw all conventional openings and wisdom out the window nerre was taken back he was taken a little bit of back he plays E5 he's G he gives uh Wesley the developmental Target and Wesley plays a very obscure Line This is if you've never seen this before it might make you very very confused why top chess players are putting their pieces out on the edge of the board like this but you are trying to apply pressure to the black position with Knight bishop and Bishop in the corner I promise all of this has been played before Knight to A3 Knight to C4 both fighting for that square uh then the bishop Retreats voluntarily black plays A6 to prevent the knight from replacing the bishop C4 now I have actually had this position myself many many times uh I I think one of the best moves after C4 is to play like C5 maybe castles and then in this position um yeah C5 to stop white from playing D4 or if white plays D4 then you need to play Rook E8 and keep the tension and Rook E8 at least if the move C5 happens you can go out of the way this looks really nice for white but it's actually horrible it's completely horrible you put the Knight on F5 or G6 and you know so e takes D4 e takes D4 is a major mistake you notice NRE is down 10 43 what H what happened well he's thinking a lot I think this opening completely caught him off guard Wesley came started doing unconventional stuff started going at the chess board started blowing raspberry and nck was like what the hell is this guy doing that's not actually what happened but the equivalent of that but playing certain chess openings and it caused him to make a couple of dicey decisions like leaving his pieces in front of his pawns we learn as beginners we don't want to do that because we block the other pieces from getting out and I'm not calling Nock a beginner but I am saying that moving multiple pieces in the opening multiple times without using your Center Pawn sometimes it really is just a matter of Back to Basics and look at Wesley Just sh just shutting off the lights of the black position the black position is not able to move forward look at this forcing the bishop to take and when the dust settle from the opening Wesley had a very pleasant position now he could play Knight F3 and just Castle short and Slide the queen out of the way but no no no no no no no Wesley lost yesterday Wesley wants to make a statement and he goes age four Wesley so wants to bury the 19-year-old who won the world rapid championship in 2021 did you know that nck Abdus satov is the second youngest chess player in history to win a world championship title at the year of at the 17 years of age World rapid Champion the only person that has won a World Championship at a younger age is the Chinese woman oan she won the world women wom's championship at the age of 16 teenagers watching this that's pretty big shoes to fill you don't got to be a world champion but definitely stop spending so much time on your phones get more sleep and do well in school H5 I feel like all teenagers just do Drop Shipping now like they get all those Instagram reels that are like here's how I drop ship stuff so maybe it works I maybe I'm just a hater Queen D4 Rook E8 and uh and in case it's not clear uh this first game was an absolutely rejuvenated Wesley so Knight C5 tricky idea to Fork there and if you go here there's Knight to E4 but uh this doesn't work it took Wesley about 15 moves of game number one on day number two he's going to win a piece he does Checkmate is still borderline unavoidable this game becomes a little bit weird like it looks like whites King is under attack it's not he's just up a piece nobe sacrifices a little bit of material and gives a check that like looks like it's going to be made it's going to be made if you don't know anything about Chess but if you know a little bit Queen to D4 and Wesley is just that's it I mean Wesley is just Unstoppable but if you thought that was going to be the whole story you don't know anything about the top players in the world Wesley so is looking to put the match away he won both games he won that game and then he won the next game and then he tried to put nck away and nck sacrificed a pawn with Czech in the opening lost his right to Castle and then nck brought out his Queen and his Knight and this man is about to R rain absolute hell on the white position this is crazy crazy line by Wesley to play Knight F5 wow now watch what Wesley has to do in this position Wesley is completely lost unless he finds one move that one move I am not joking is to pick up your Bozo of a king and go King to D2 that is the only way that you don't lose Wesley goes running King to D2 King to C2 and then Wesley in this position after building that beautiful shelter rather than playing Knight D2 and waiting for NRE and trying to defend himself Wesley starts fighting back which sometimes is recommended but not in this particular case and now here comes nck and it is bad here comes nck but I got news for you this is anything but the end of the game because after bc5 de4 ner Beck blunders a tactical Skirmish takes takes takes sacrificing the queen a big mistake Rook D4 and all of a sudden Wesley's Pawn is queening nck takes the bishop Wesley Queens with what what should what just happened Wesley brought a Queen back from the dead Wesley just hold up can we get an instant replay of that Wesley lost his Queen and that might be one of the fastest turnarounds I have ever seen five moves later he monster Reborns it and it's just back and then he runs his King off to the corner there he's going to run his King to B1 and I told yall this game was completely insane both guys go under a minute Wesley hides his King on the edge of the board noer Beck is up a pawn in an opposite colored Bishop end game with some Rooks and knights and what ends up happening is Wesley tries to attack NRE so bad and then tricks him on the first rank with the move Rook to G2 if you take it's a fork but if you go anywhere I take the Rook so nordbeck has to repeat moves but that would lose him the match so instead of that he sacrifices The Rook completely and he sacrifices The Rook because now he has two pass pawns while Wesley now begins walking his King up the whole board to win the B Pawn this is completely insane guys have less than 10 seconds on the clock we get a queen trade but nb's pawns are too strong they're too strong but they're a little bit too far apart Wesley indecisive instead of going for the B7 Pawn starts bringing his King back and it's simply too slow but wait a minute White's Rook controls the entire first rank how are you going to Queen two pawns on a first rank if the Rook is going to eat them well you're going to shuffle you're going to get a little bit nervous if you're n your back and then you're going to realize oh the Knight should not play defense the Knight should play offense E1 Queen Knight shield and nck won but it was Wesley it was Wesley who won the second set and it was nck versus Wesley so in an Armageddon tiebreak playoff they went to the third and final set they made two draws and they bid Wesley so bid nine minutes and 20 7 seconds and no B bid 919 here we go this is a $50,000 game of chess if Wesley wins he joins Magnus in the finals guarantees $100,000 Wesley loses or does not win he gets third and fourth with Fabby and nck goes to the finals we have a in English all right we have a a reverse grunfeld kind kind of type of structure maybe a reverse Caro Khan type of structure we have DC going for an isolated Pawn norer 9 minutes and 19 seconds which is what he bid and now Wesley just expanding and playing solidly against an isolated Pawn Nock creating a weakness on the C5 Square which is's he's immediately going for and then he gallops into Wesley's position puts his Knight on C4 now Wesley is only up three minutes remember he started the game up five minutes and something like 30 seconds so so far this is not a good turn of events but you'll notice nerb spent a lot of time putting his Bishop on D7 that was the first sign of hesitancy he might have just played Bishop F5 or Bishop here and been completely fine but he goes here and then he puts his other Knight here all right Rook D1 the play of the man who's playing against the isolated Pawn is a little bit easier now Wesley plays Knight B2 he's looking to trade but he's keeping that four-minute time advantage on the clock and he's creating a nice shelter for his pieces Knight on D3 lot of pieces on the board very intertangled very messy position Rook going to C8 the 4-minute time Advantage is still there there Bishop E5 the queen goes to B6 Queen B2 we're getting a bishop trade which is apparently a mistake but then here Wesley goes here he loses a lot of his Advantage but he's still up three minutes on the clock and the players only get a bonus time on move 60 and we've only played 24 moves Nock has 3 minutes and 20 seconds to play 36 moves that's 200 seconds to play 36 moves that is basically I don't know 6 seconds per move for 36 moves is the accuracy going to sustain when bre starts thinking he is now below 3 minutes Knight F1 a rook trade on the board and in this position NRE spent 1 minute and 12 seconds that is nearly 50% of his time he froze and he could have gone for Rook here the best line after Rook E8 is E3 Knight F3 King here and then Knight to E4 which just creates I believe it's no Knight E4 blun ERS Knight D5 maybe you play G5 and and you go like aggressive but noback could not come up with the decision and instead of that he went into the tank played rook d8 and now he has a minute and 24 seconds to play 32 moves and my friends you can be one of the best players in the world but that's not enough time after all of that he loses his Pawn on D5 he tries defending himself he puts a lot of pieces on dark squares we could be in for a very long end game Wesley poking at him Queen E4 but in this position the best way for black to play would have been G4 and try to restrict the position but nybeck blunders his Pawn thinking he has counterplay he does not and a few moves later no Abdul satov resigned Queen takes C6 if you take I make a queen Wesley so joins Magnus Carlson and is another finalist in the Champions chestor finale they will begin tomorrow 100 ,000 is second place one uh $200,000 for first place I can't wait commiserations to ner be Abdus satov and Fabiano Carana on exceptional tournaments there is no bronze medal match see you all tomorrow get out of here
