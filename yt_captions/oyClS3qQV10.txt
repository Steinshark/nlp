this [Music] is the best gaming laptop in existence and all that money nothing will top it in 2022. there are great gaming laptops and there are great laptops period the asus zephyrus g14 hopes to be both but have they done enough to justify the sphincter titling price tag and can i justify using the word sphincter in my segway to our sponsor thank you true coders for sponsoring this video with their coding bootcamp you can go from flipping burgers to flipping bits in nine short weeks join the other true coders graduates who have started their new career in the lucrative and stimulating field of programming at truecoders.io ltt [Music] inside the 2022 zephyrus g14 we get an amd ryzen 9 6900 hs 32 gigabytes of ram a terabyte of storage and most interestingly an amd radeon rx 6800 s compared to the outgoing g14 the 2022 model just shreds it not even fake in fact i'm stopping the graphs right now because you don't need to see any more of this beat down the new one is faster big whoop but to really show off what an excellent job asus has done with this whole package we need to compare it to a laptop that is faster this right here is the alienware x15 and it is an engineering marble it is just 15.9 millimeters thin but it's able to cool rtx 3080 and an intel i7 even rocking the last gen processor the x15 was able to consistently beat the g14 in gaming benchmarks the x15 took enough of a lead for you to notice the difference not just by the numbers but in game play too how was alienware able to achieve this thermodynamic wizardry one moment the whole laptop is designed around the cooling solution so it has a small motherboard to make room for these four fans the keyboard was lowered so that we could have these fin stacks up here and they even went so far as designed their own special liquid metal called element 31. we've showed that that significantly outperforms another liquid metal and uh too bad using it sucks like look they lowered the keyboard and now my hand falls off the edge i can't game on this comfortably for more than like three minutes sharp stupid yes in any design there will be trade-offs but the g14 balances them all perfectly instead of making it wide to accommodate intakes they just lifted up the chassis the hot air does blow directly into the screen but i'm not concerned about the temps it reaches it's clear the keyboard trackpad and screen were the priorities here aka the bits that matter most when you use a laptop in fact the screen is just a great example of the g14 targeting what you actually want sure the alienware has three times the refresh rate but most of us aren't professional head clickers with the g14 we get a 2560 by 1600p screen that's fast enough for most gamers while being bright and color accurate enough for video or photo editors i can do my job writing scripts on it and not wish i was using a professional laptop instead oh and on the top they even added a webcam with windows hello facial recognition very glad you finally yielded to me yelling about not having webcam aces it's actually not half bad the user inputs on the g14 are exceptional this trackpad just just look at it it's just big accurate and it feels great in my opinion this is the best trackpad on a gaming laptop and an easy a i barely wished i had a mouse when i was doing non-gaming tasks the keyboard is also a standout with key travel that's soft and doesn't require too much force so great for gaming but it still retains enough of a tactile bump to be functional for very quick typing awesome there's almost no deck flex thanks to magnesium chassis in fact the whole laptop is just super well built the keycaps have this sparkly color shift you can only see at certain angles the animatrix on the back got comments from everyone that passed by my desk and it is white wow that was actually really anti-climatic i was expecting the cheeto dust to stick but you could like oh my god this is so stupid mark why did we do this it's just gone oh that's really gross anyway audio test okay here we go sound test versus the king of windows laptop audio xps 15. it's kind of lacking in bass let's see here [Music] yeah the dell's better but at the same time this right here is pretty impressive [Music] it's not as loud not as much bass but it's clear and i don't hate it great laptops also need great i o and on this while you won't be in dongle hell it isn't perfect either on the left we get a headphone microphone combo jack usb c type 4 and hdmi 2.0 b on the right we get microsd another type c and two really good reasons to get a wireless mouse because this is terrible one thing i was really curious about is if the usb4 ports would work with thunderbolt devices thunderbolt 4 is essentially the same thing as usb4 but with all of the optional boxes checked off this thunderbolt dock right here from dell plug it in okay awesome everything's working great come over here we have got this 10 gig network adapter and uh no such luck basically if you get this message right here you're screwed in my testing it's a coin toss if thunderbolt devices work or not so if you've got a couple already around best of luck in my review of the amd ryzen 9 6900 hs the battery life results of the g14 were a huge improvement over last gen nearly doubling from 5 hours 42 minutes to 11 hours 11 minutes other reviewers though didn't see as much of a jump and it turns out that's because amd has new av1 decoders these basically allow the integrated gpu to playback supported videos using hardware making the whole process way more efficient office tasks don't see quite as big of an improvement so depending on your use case 11 hours isn't reasonable to expect but like eight hours from a gaming laptop is still super impressive one thing that intrigued me though is the sheer power of the integrated gpu in this laptop already in a2 being from nova scotia it takes eight hours to fly home and it would be really nice to be able to game on the plane if i could use the apu on this is it able to game for multiple hours to test this i disable the dedicated gpu set a frame limit to 60 fps have the refresh rate and turn down the brightness how long can it run f1 2021 at 1080p on low settings surely longer than the old model with rtx 3060 enabled right no the old zephyrus won the battle with a staggering battery life time of 59 minutes i'm disappointed but uh at least you could buy a 60 watt type c charger to trickle charge on the plane stock power bricks they use too much power and just shuts off keeping up the disappointment train pricing the 2022 g14 starts at sixteen hundred and fifty dollars fifty dollars more than the top of the line 2021 version and the one we've been testing right here 2500 us dollars asus has a number of good reasons the new model is more expensive and the bump in gpu performance is pretty extreme but damn and it's so expensive to get more than 16 gigabytes of ram with that in mind how easy is it to upgrade or repair yourself i don't normally do this but i'm actually going to put on an anti-static wristband today there's been a cold snap and i have been shocking just everything i touch and it would really suck to kill this strike number one are these little rubber things that you have to take out to get at the screws that sucks because these never go back in properly oh wow that vapor chamber is so sick no this is this is all vapor chamber yeah like from here all the way over this thing's so cool here's our 76 watt hour battery i have been having issues with it just turning on for no reason i'm sure that'll get fixed soon but i am just going to remove that before we go any deeper right here we have our sodium slot so this right here is a 16 gigabyte stick the other half of your memory is soldered to the board that means that if you get the 16 gigabyte version you get 24 gigabytes of ram not 32. here's our one terabyte ssd it looks pretty generic but it does have a fizzing controller on it so it is pretty good i think along with the ram and the ssd it looks like your wi-fi module a battery speakers and fans all can be pretty easily replaced with minimal you know invasion into the laptop let's go a little bit deeper though and see what we can find getting this vapor chamber off is not particularly easy although because it does come with liquid metal from the factory i don't really know why you would ever need to what an absolute chunker of a vapor chamber what we also see here is that they use thermal paste on all the vrms which means that you don't have to worry about like thermal pad thickness i'm surprised they can cool this much with these small little fins like vapor chamber very impressive but there isn't a whole lot of heat sinking wow liquid metal jobs kind of gross you can see they have it taped off all around the die so that liquid metal can't spill but if they didn't have that this would be dead because there's liquid metal just all over the place around it there's the battery out what i'm curious to see is if the keyboard and trackpad are replaceable those are two things where like if you have a child they can pretty easily ruin your day by spilling a drink or something on there one thing i really wish asus would steal from alienware is that alienware has been putting little markings just beside all of the screws inside of their laptop so you can very easily find the screw that you need and put it in and know for sure that's the right one and you're not going to accidentally like put a screw through your keyboard or something okay there's the main board out not looking good for repair ability after that so track pad oh can we haha okay the track pad comes out now i don't know how easy it will be to get these but if you can it is possible to replace it awesome so it looks like the keyboard is able to be removed so you could theoretically just replace the whole thing this is actually quite a repairable little laptop as long as there's parts available you can replace most of the bits and not have to throw the whole thing out which is awesome to see a couple more interesting things while we're in here on this laptop they actually included dust filters right beside the fans apparently they work pretty well asus has this hilarious picture of a laptop just caked in dust they did two tests with and without the dust filters and they do actually work the fans also have this really funky sort of dual pitch wave design apparently it helps a lot with the turbulence of the air coming out and makes the heatsinks more effective so the new g14 then on one hand i'm kind of sad that asus upped the price by so much like i know amd aren't our friends and it was only a matter of time until they started charging more for really high quality mobile processors but it still does sting on the other hand if you have the cash it's also just a great laptop it's portable awesome to use has a strong battery life and i just play like it easy recommendation just like it's easy to recommend this segway to our sponsor freshbooks thanks to freshbooks for sponsoring
