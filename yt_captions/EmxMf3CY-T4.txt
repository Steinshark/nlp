welcome to my day in the life self-teaching computer science [Music] my days usually start around 6 30 a.m and no i'm not doing this because i think it's some hack to wake up early i just happen to really enjoy the mornings i find it my most productive time on today and also i like to get ahead of the day before all the peasants were still sleeping a cold day again after grabbing some breakfast i sit down to get started on the work of the day the first few hours of today i wanted to focus on maths the current course i'm doing is mathematics for computer science from mit learning where i learn the basics of discrete maths probability and other maths that you need for computer science this is all part of my self-talk computer science degree system i built for myself in notion you can watch more about that in this video then i remember that earlier i didn't do what i usually do in the morning which is set goals for the day after working hard for a few hours and definitely not string to watch youtube videos at any point i allow myself a brief break of browsing reddit and watching youtube videos after that i tackle the second task of my day which is to finish my notes from the programming languages b course after that around noon i have some leftover lasagna from yesterday for lunch around logic when i allow myself a break to watch some netflix you know besides all the other breaks i'm taking of course so usually i will start an episode of netflix during lunch and then i will be allowed to finish it afterwards so that's time when i don't have to be working by the way make sure to follow me on instagram there's not much content there yet but i'm going to be posting there very regularly so definitely follow me on instagram if you want to stay up to date on what's happening on this channel after finishing my netflix episode and watching some youtube videos i decided it was time to edit one of my own youtube videos namely this one where i talk about what i believe to be the best computer science course for beginners to get started learning computer science and if you're wondering why i have two computers for any coding related activities as well as any internet browsing i do using my macbook because i prefer the mac operating system and that kind of stuff doesn't really require that much power but for any power intensive tasks like video editing what really matters is getting the absolute highest amount of raw power so for anything like that i use my big pc computer and in case you're curious here's what my setup looks like we've got the keychrome k6 keyboard and the logitech ms master 2s i believe it's called i'll have all of them on the screen and in the description below this uhd monitor which i have no idea which model that is the light that i use to like my videos a gimbal drone and the machine that powers this set up i just got the best idea for the thumbnail for this video [Music] before we go back inside i wanted to briefly talk about my favorite topic me more specifically why did i decide to make this youtube channel so in short my channel is dedicated to my journey self-teaching computer science and also my life as a self-taught software engineer which will start in around six months because i've signed an offer to join a big company in london as a software engineer but mainly i wanted to make this video because i want there to be something in 10 years when i know all about computer science maybe i'm the next mark zuckerberg i found out the new big tech startup probably not by the way but i have big dreams okay i want to be able to look at this moment and say oh there he was in some random forest in finland basically not knowing anything and i think it will just be really cool for me to be able to look back on my journey so where if someone finds value in this that's amazing but even if no one ever watches these videos i still want to have them out there because i think it's cool to document your journey i think more people should be doing this i think this is really cool anyway it's pretty cold in here so we're gonna get inside i'm probably gonna end up being a lazy piece of for a few hours before i continue my studying after indeed wasting a whole bunch of time doing absolutely nothing i finally got back to work this time coding my website so i'm building a website for the internet made encoder brand or i don't know if you can call it brand or not we're going to call it that because it sounds cool yeah anyway the website's going to have probably a blog where i'm gonna essentially make blog versions or text versions of these videos it's gonna house any resources that i end up creating in the future and possibly some other stuff but for example it's gonna have my free notion template for tracking your progress you can go to www.internetmadecoder.com you can get this template for free after getting hench as hell at the gym i was hungry again so it was time for dinner aka my second break of the day besides all the other breaks of course i finished another episode of ozark wasted some more time and then got into the last work session of the day at this point i started the programming languages c course and by the way this is a part of a series of programming languages courses i'm doing my coursera from washington university they teach the fundamentals of programming languages in several languages so you learn the general principles of how programming languages work and you learn to contrast the different styles like functional and object oriented programming as well as different features like static versus dynamic typing and that kind of stuff so what is the moral of the story of this day well as you can see i'm definitely not constantly working i'm taking breaks all the time and i'm sort of allowing myself to be a lazy piece of  from time to time and i still get a lot done actually because it turns out that the quality of the hours that you put into your work are a lot more important than the quantity of those hours if you utilize what is called deep work and you focus on working in a way that when you're working you are fully focused and immersed on your work and then outside of that you can do whatever you want it turns out that doing that for just a couple of hours a day you're gonna get a lot more done than doing 10 hours a day of really inefficient what's called shallow work and it turns out that the human brain can really only focus for around a maximum of four hours and or even less if you're a beginner but that's okay because if you're actually doing deep work you're still getting a lot done without actually putting in that many hours so focus on getting those around three four five hours of deep working a day and making sure i complete the tasks that i set for myself each day which on this day i did so thanks for watching if you found it entertaining please leave a like because it helps the channel and bye
