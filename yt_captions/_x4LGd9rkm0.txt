okay so we used to think AGI was years away I mean we'd even be L lucky I guess lucky lucky and also kind of nerve-wracking to see it in our lifetime but then recently we started seeing Tech Founders I mean for example nvidia's CEO starting to say that AGI was around 5 years away so naturally I decided to sit down with stie who is a Founder in the AI in data space I mean she has been working in this space since 2014 she's years of experience and was in this space before honestly it really took off over the past few years so I wanted to sit down with her understand her thoughts around that but also so much more I mean let's dive into the ethics around AI should you if you are looking to get into this space become a generalist or specialist and so much more all right but first let me share with you a bit more about saie so Sadie is the founder of an international nonprofit organization called women in data and she's currently in the process of building an Institute called the human machine collaboration where they are working on Bridging the Gap between humans to be able to easily or more easily work with technology I mean Tech is moving so quickly we need a way for us as humans to be able to work alongside it so I sat down with her to really cover everything around AI asked all the big questions I had the first one started around ethics I mean it's a Hot Topic within artificial intelligence who and how are we going to regulate AI especially at the speed it's going I wanted to learn from her what were some of the biggest improvements that we have seen with ethics and regulations where we see it going and all of that and one of the biggest takeaways I got from listening to her on this is the one of the biggest improvements in this area is around information listen to this just to see the improvements on misinformation that we've seen in upgrades in common models like chat GPT and GPT 3.5 to version 4 let alone from Cloud's first model to Claud 3 so I don't know if for those early adopters if use like GPT 3.5 you notice that it hallucinated quite frequently and while it was useful it could really deceive a lot of people with misinformation okay I couldn't agree with her more also I want to share with you a clip of an example she gave around Ai and the challenges with sharing about history so in this example she goes on to share around how when a user prompts AI such as chat GPT or Claude to learn more about history here are some of the challenges a lot of these companies had initially faced you can tell by the news cycles that it's really hard to align it with human values from what we saw with Google Gemini where they were doing the right thing and trying to overcome bias with how people were described in images some people felt like it went a little too far right when you're looking at historical figures um from World War II not being represented with how they actually were and so while we've made progress in hallucinations we still have a lot of progress to make in terms of that alignment space of what needs to be true historically but also where do we reduce biases and project those moving forward and how do we align those to individual human values as well I mean you can tell even by listening to Sadie she has been in the AI space for a long time as I mentioned earlier in this video for since 2014 she's been in the space and I think it's so fascinating to learn from experts within this field who have really seen the the change from starting when it AI artificial intelligence wasn't as widely known I would say or as commonly spoken about to what it is today to where it is now and here's what she had to say so in awe that we're even where we are here today um I know almost five years ago I built my first chat bot and it was you know still had to be very almost even manually programmed and just wasn't very fun to talk to right now we're working with tools like Claude or Chachi BT people get actual like Delight from talking to these which I think is so surprising and so you know what was the big change in all of that was the introduction of the Transformer and most importantly if you want to dive into the details you can read it in a paper called attention is all you need it's a great paper I love that example she gave around chatbots as well back building them back in the day to now where they are today individuals and thinking about like should should I go into more of a specialized AI or like a should I start focusing on AGI research again this really comes down to your preference and what interests you again when there's so much opportunity in the AI space I would just say dive in for me like one of the areas that I'm really interested in is how do we help humans use these tools and adapt to these tools from a like psychological perspective but there's a ton of opportunity let's say you're a ux designer and jumping into AI could be a great place to be because it would allow you to look and design like how do we have the system interfaces to talk to an AI agent is chat really the best do we do we speak to it are there other ways that would be better to interact what happens when we change those features so that's just one very small example of like there's so much opportunity for people in this space I try and think of it less of like AI as a subset of Technology but more as like this is a technology that's going to change all of humanity what role do you want to play in it because there's space for you in this space I love that she shared so many different examples as to how we can get into AI there are there's so much space for everyone you don't have to have a particular background it's artificial intelligence feels like how Tech as a whole the industry felt a few years ago where even if you don't have a particular background there's still a space for you there because it's touching every industry which is pretty exciting okay this is probably my favorite part of the conversation with Sadie which was around the future of work and then of course covering AGI I really wanted to know someone like her's take on it who is such an expert in the field and here's what she had to say this is one of my favorite subjects I'm currently writing a book about AI for knowledge workers so my description for knowledge worker is if you work at a desk then you're a knowledge worker right if you use a computer you're most likely a knowledge worker and so I think first starting off AI is going to have a massive effect on knowledge worker just because so much of the work that we do is already through a digital space and so if you're working in a digital space AI can come alongside and make you what I think of is either more productive or more creative which is something I think all of us as humans are trying to do but AI will not just affect knowledge worker it will also affect you know some of your more blue color jobs right now where I think we're had it with an AI is we're building essentially the brain right which I mean that's intelligence or where intelligence is hosted but we also have alongside of us Robotics and so they're building the body and soon we're going to combine this brain and this body together to have a really intelligent machine and that's when it will start to affect more of the blue color manual labor type of job as well right now we're seeing it heavily affect um knowledge workers but I think it will soon be for kind of all of us in in terms of how we work and so how we've scoped this out at The Institute is from now until the next five years we really have to train humans how to work alongside AI right how do you use it for your productivity for your creativity how do you change kind of your common ways of working and your work streams to integrate it in into those so that you can be more productive and creative okay I'm on vacation but I realized I didn't include this next part or intro this next part so here are s thoughts around AGI and I think this was so interesting we hear people's thoughts around AGI from you know either Tech leaders who might be trying to get some Buzz behind them and then also to uh different people who are trying to get a reaction so to hear it from an actual expert who has been in this industry since 2014 was pretty incredible what she had to say okay now I need more coffee watch this even 3 years ago the thoughts of AGI were like 20 30 years out for people in the space and you can read reports now in terms of like pulling industry experts and how fast they think AGI is coming and now it's cut down all the way to like you know 5 to 10 years which is quite incredible right so most of us thought that like AGI was like yes cool hopefully we'll get there hopefully I'll see it in my lifetime but if it doesn't happen I wouldn't be surprised to like oh we're definitely going to see it in our lifetime and we need to be prepared for it right all right we covered a lot in this video I am so grateful stie sat down with me to really uncover where artificial not only is at today the opportunities within it but also to where we are headed and how we can better prepare ourselves for that with the first step being knowing where we are headed and that's what I hope this video gave to you today thank you all for watching I linked down below s's accounts so make sure to go check her out if you haven't already she has incredible content and shares so much wisdom and knowledge with us so thank you Satie for being part of this video if you like the style of video where I interview individuals and experts in their fields let me know in the comments and I will continue to do it thanks [Music] [Music] all
