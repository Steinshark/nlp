I mean and and the interesting thing is you know I wrote the book it got published in September 2023 but even since publication there's been fascinating new examples of this so Ayan her Al who I'm sure you're aware of the story of who basically wrote that that Viral article for unheard as a former New atheist herself who had come from a very you know come out of a very fundamentalist Muslim background in the past just saying it turns out atheism cannot sustain a meaningful life and I I've decided to embrace Christianity and that's just such an interesting example of I think the the thesis of the book kind of happening in real time because it feels like something's changing you know secular intelligent thinkers are giving Christianity another look and I I find that quite [Music] exciting this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] so hello everyone I am very happy to be here with Justin brle uh most of you will know his work you know for many years he was the host of unbelievable and uh he is now working on a new podcast coming out of a book called The surprising Rebirth of the belief in God and it is completely in line with all the things that we've been doing he's talking to everybody that is around this Resurgence of the belief in God the end of the new atheist the the the surprising uh characters that are converting to Christianity are coming close to Christianity uh and so Justin it's really great to have you with me oh thank you it's it's an absolute pleasure to be on the show Jonathan as a as a regular listener myself so so thanks for having me so tell me a bit about this this this new project I mean it's not that new it's been going on now for more than a year I think or yeah well the the book itself was published last September so it's it is fairly new um and uh the most recent thing though is is a new podcast documentary series that is really based on the book and and that's been going for just a few months um and that's really a much deeper dive in a way because I get to talk to all kinds of people feature all kinds of voices weave it all together with some narration and music and and really tell the story really of of what I'm calling the surprising Rebirth of belief in God and the subtitle of the book and the podcast is why new atheism grew old and secular thinkers are considering Christianity again and in many ways it's it it does come out though of those you know many years you know over a decade and a half hosting conversations between Christians and atheists on unbelievable and the way that I saw those conversations changing in the last several years and and that was really what what prompted the Genesis of the book and and then the podcast so tell me a bit about that because I mean it's true that in some ways you would be the perfect person to notice the transformation so maybe help us see what it is that you started to notice and maybe about when you started to see it and what what was different in the way that the the atheists and the Christians were engaging with each other well I started hosting these conversations on this this unbelievable show um around 2005 this was before we started podcasting it was just a radio show to begin with but once we started podcasting we started to to grow you know pick up a lot of listeners not just Christians but also non-christians atheists who were tuning in for these discussions between atheists and Christians that I was hosting and and it was around the time that new atheism was building up ahead of steam so it was just around the time Richard Dawkins was publishing The God Delusion you had a real growth of that kind of online atheist scene in the UK not long after we had the atheist bus campaign where we had buses rolling around London saying there's probably no God now stop worrying and enjoy your life so there was there was a real kind of dynamic sense in which you know this very specific quite dogmatic form of non-belief was presenting itself and and that was reflect in the conversations we had you know so so it was often these new atheist type characters who would be coming on opposite Christian apologists to debate the existence of God and whether Christianity was evil and can we trust the Bible and so so that was that was great really interesting I I really you know cut my teeth in Christian apologetics in those early years and was able to sort of you know kind of put together my own sense of of how to understand Christianity at an intellectual level at least but I did notice especially kind of from the sort of I guess from about 2015 onwards there just was a kind of noticeable shift in well firstly the number of non-christians atheist coming on who were actually dissociating themselves from new atheism saying I'm I'm not a rich or doin kind of athe because because I think there was almost a sense that it had become a bit shrill and dogmatic and almost quasi religious in itself and and also just many more secular folk that I was featuring on the show who were actually a lot more open to the value of Christianity weren't dismissing it as readily as the new atheists were and I started to bump into people like Douglas Murray for instance who you know arguably was very much part of the new atheist set when he sort of lost his faith in his early 20s he was you know going for lunch regularly with Christopher Hitchens and that sort of thing but actually in latter years I think basically realized I'm I'm basically bred of Christian stock I um I don't believe in God necessarily I'm not a Christian but he calls himself a Christian atheist and and I just started to see more and more people like that coming through who were just recognizing that that fundamentally atheism cannot provide all the answers for life and that actually we still owe an enormous debt to the cultural and spiritual and moral value that that Christian Christianity has granted the West essentially wow and so in 2015 that sound that sounds a about right to me and so it's like you know it's something that seems to be happening to the culture and have you seen also the new atheists also go into certain direction because one of the things I've noticed is how the new atheist because in some ways there was a weird secret desire for something more that they ended up becoming more and more ideological in their approach like even more politically motivated you know being influenced by by certain ideology I don't know if it's something that you notice happening like at at some point when the atheists were no longer just attacking Christianity when they actually had to now propose a social world like they had to propose something that we can we could start to see something else up here I don't know if you know I I totally did I mean I I was kind of an interested bystander for for a lot of this but because of my world did intersect with new atheism quite quite frequently I I was often sort of seeing some of these dramas unfold in the new atheist community so in in the book and and the podcast I do go into some detail about the way internally there was a lot of argument debate and a kind of unraveling really of the movement because of it so you it was around I think 2011 really that that I think there was this particular moment called that came to be called elevator gate which really set the tone for the way in which new atheism would start to unravel and this was um a an atheist conference happening in Dublin in Ireland and um one of the speakers Rebecca Watson who was a sort of online atheist commentator uh under the name skep chic was talking at this conference about the problem that the The Atheist movement had with women that it was misogynistic patriarchal um there was a lot of sexism in this kind of very male white dominated movement and uh well she then had sort of late night drinks with some of the other speakers which included Richard Dawkins and on her way to her uh hotel room you know early hours of the morning she basically got propositioned by one of the attendees of the conference in the in the elevator so she wrote about this later on her blog and said this is the problem with you know the atheist movement exactly what I was already describing and getting propositioned and so on well that might have been the end of it except that Richard Dawkins himself weighed in on this um sort of by posting a very highly sarcastic kind of response blog to Rebecca Watson called dear muslima in which he you know very sarcastically compared her her troubles to uh a Muslim woman you know who's getting her hands cut off you know for disobeying a husband or something like that and just said you know but pity your poor American sisters who have to put up with people asking them for coffee in an elevator um well this just poured gasoline on the whole thing and suddenly I I do honestly see elevator gate as the point at which the movement kind of split basically between those on the kind of Rebecca Watson side who who were very interested in atheism not just being about a denial of God but about being for something so it it was at this point that people started saying we need an atheism plus we need a movement that is also about social justice and feminism and LGBT rights and so on and then you had the Richard Dawkins kind of crowd who you know went very you know were not into that at all and said we just want science and reason and Common Sense and you know an oasis of free thinking um and so the movement really split and I I would say it was it was almost like the culture wars kind of came early in that sense for new atheism that that was the thing that that broke the movement apart and the kind of arguments that these atheist figures started having within the movement like completely dwarfed any arguments they were having with their Christian counterparts because it ended up with a not you know atheist conferences being cancelled because people weren't prepared to share a stage any longer so I I watched all this from the sidelines and it was just an interesting reminder that that um yeah movements kind of come and go and this one very much founded as soon as it tried to do something more than just be this denial of God once it tried to build anything more than that suddenly the whole thing just just fell apart very quickly yeah and you see it it's still it's still exists in the online word well you have these people that have made a career as atheist but you know it's like they just make video after video after video about how religion is stupid and you think okay like this is interesting I mean it's interesting that that's it like that's your that's your thing that's your stick and that's fine but uh there's a manner in which like you said as soon as you try to propose a mode of unity then all of a sudden you're in trouble and if you and if you're not careful then you're surprised you know with like what is it Matt dillah Hunty talking about women with penises and you're like what happened how did we get from Like Richard Dawkins biologist scientists to basically you know all categories are now exploded and we're in a we're in a weird postmodern reality I think the interesting thing about it is for me it's it's kind of meant the the cultural ground has all shifted in the process because people who were formerly happy bed fellows like dillah Hunty and Dawkins now are not on speaking terms any longer you know Dawkins got you know his his humanist of the Year award rescinded by the American humanist Association because he's been quite you know outspoken on trans transgender and so on you know um and and so you find then this weird sort of changing where actually suddenly secular atheist kind of more conservative minded folk kind of then seem to sort of form alliances with Christians who maybe are kind of sympathetic to those issues and you find that the secular atheists who are kind of more on the woke side kind of suddenly they're kind of more in keeping with their kind of other woke Brethren so it's it's it's a kind of you know it felt like the the game changed quite a bit once the culture wars came and just kind of messed up everyone's categories and they realized we we're not sure we actually agree with each other on on anything after all H and so what what to you is the most like when you hear the these characters that talk about their their return to Christianity or they're coming close to Christianity you know what is what is the thing that's most Salient to that that pops out as you know this is what's going on in in these transformation because they're happening all at the same time so it's like it's not just an individual thing it's a there's something happening in the culture yeah that's right I I think I think there's there's a few different things going on I think one kind of in a sense small part of it and I think it was just symptomatic in some ways the new atheist movement kind of coming and rising and falling is is that generally there is this you know meaning crisis in our culture which which you and many others have have pointed out and and it's it's on the basis of the fact that people have lost a story essentially to live in and the story that materialist secularism offered just ended has just not proved capable of building a flourishing meaningful life for people and so what I see is a lot of these secular thinkers now sort of realizing that the atheist project is kind of dead on its feet and so they're basically just saying well look let's let's look around and see what's here and oh hey it turns out the Christian story um has actually provided people that sense of meaning purpose and identity for Millennia and they're just willing to give it a second look in all honesty and and it's almost like they had it's almost like they had to go through some of these folk I think a kind of teenage atheist phase almost before they kind of came out on the other side realizing ah there are other ways to understand the world than just this kind of very one-dimensional flat science explains everything kind of mode of of thinking um and so yeah I I do draw out the stories of a number of those people some of whom have kind of crossed the line to Christian faith others who seem to be teetering on the brink of it others who seem to be just kind of acknowledging its value um but maybe I don't know what it's going to take ultimately for them to kind of cross the line themselves um I mean and and the interesting thing is you know I wrote the book it got published in September 201 23 but even since publication there's been fascinating new examples of this so Ayan her Al who I'm sure you're aware of the story of who um you know basically wrote that that Viral article for unheard as a former New atheist herself who had come from a very you know come out of a very fundamentalist Muslim background in the past just saying it turns out atheism cannot sustain a meaningful life and I I've decided to embrace Christianity and that's just such an interesting example of I think the the thesis of the book kind of happening in real time because it feels like something's changing you know secular intelligent thinkers are giving Christianity another look and I find that quite exciting yeah one of the things that I've noticed is you know this is basically experienced in my own world which is the Orthodox Church you know in North America but we are seeing waves of of converts I mean you know parishes some are doubling tripling like just massive amounts of of conversions but the conversions they have a certain characteristic which is their intellectual conversions you know and it's not it's not as much the the the the kind of usual not usual but the the story of someone who maybe hit rock bottom who's been having all these problems and turned to God you know and found God in in their struggle and in their their suffering but it's really people that are you know University uh graduated you know that are professionals that are that are thinking that are reading that are extremely that are intelligent who are actually dealing with a meaning crisis and that are looking to find uh meaning um and so that's to me is a very interesting I don't know if that's something that you've noticed as well in these in this movement that there that it doesn't look like early Christianity was slaves and poor people and and women and people that had no recourse basically finding the god of love in you know in this in this possibility of of of Christ and now right now it seems like it's actually anite that's converting yes yeah I I think I think there is something in that um I mean and another aspect of this is is arguably that it's quite a male dominated sort of um sort of demographic now um again I I think I think that kind of ties in to the fact that you know when you look out at the average audience for the people turning up for for say a Jordan Peterson leure it is highly male and it probably is the same demographic you just described who a you find a converting to Eastern Orthodoxy and and there's I think it's something to do with that that the idea that people are just coming to the end of their resources um I think Christianity has always appealed in a sense to those who who obviously find themselves in that place destitute um you know dried out and and everything else and and in a sense that's always been where Christianity has found its first fruits if you like of of people who are who are just desperate for something and they find it in Christ but I think that the more intellectual sort of ones who sort of for a good while being able to live on their own resources and kind of assume that they had life figured out at some level or at least you know if they watched enough read enough God Delusion books they could they could kind of convince themselves that that life had basically been explained I just think sometimes it takes something like um us collapsing into the tribal culture wars that we're currently facing or the threat of Putin invading a democratic country or the rise of AI and everything suddenly like these kind of Tipping Point events suddenly I think kind remind people a of their mortality and B that we haven't got it all figured out and there's just a sense in which I see a lot the chickens are coming home to roost if you like in the postmodern West and all that Enlightenment stuff that's happened and it just feels like this is the moment when now it's as you say those Elites who are suddenly realizing I don't have this figured out I I I'm I am you know B basically depressed even though I've got more technology than I could ever dreamed of and more material Prosperity than any of my forbears ever had and yet I'm more unhappy than any of them um it there's just something about this moment and again the male thing I don't know what your thoughts are on that Jonathan but I I'm just wondering whether that's something to do with the fact that as we've lost that story particularly it's hit men in a way where they've lost something of their identity um that that there's an identity crisis thing going on here and yeah and for whatever reason suddenly when it's presented well the Christian story suddenly gives people a sense of identity that that they were probably looking for all along I think that I think that's right I think that you know this is annoying to this is annoying to the secular uh listener but there is a way in which the the man in especially in our cultures is the vector of identity right there's a reason why women would take the name of their husbands there you know there's there's a reason in which the the idea of the St Paul presents the idea of the head and the body these types of images that is are presented in the Christian tradition um and so when there's an attack on identity in general uh and on vectors of of of identity then men will definitely suffer and we can see that and there has been a kind of uh organized attack on masculinity you know for the past several decades you know the Homer Simpson idiot father and etc etc like this constant attack on on on masculinity and so it seems also that in some ways men are the most difficult position in that regard in the regard the question of story and identity and purpose and stuff um and so I think you're right that in some ways Christianity you can see a lot of people convert there isn't just Christianity that's H that's coming towards us right there's a lot of neopaganism there's lot of of Jim bro uh you know kind of yeah I mean there's there's the Andrew Tate School of masculinity that that's kind of in in comp competition with the kind of the biblical kind of form of of that so it's yeah absolutely there's there's other possible routes that this could go and that that that is the great danger and one of one of the sort of one of the metaphors I use in the book is you know um you know when GK chesteron said when people you know stop believing in God they don't they after believe in nothing they have the capacity to believe in anything and I think and I think if there is something coming back on the tide you know if if you know Matthew Arnold's famous do Beach tide is gone out of faith if it is coming back in again some people have said well how do you know it's going to be Christianity that comes back in again there could be all kinds of other things and and we're obviously seeing that because the religious inclinations never go away that search for meaning and purpose has to get filled by something so I guess I'm I'm sort of I'm optimistic that it's going to that ultimately even the Andrew Tate School of you know religion will ultimately fail because it it isn't it's always going to be a a weak heresy or parody of of the Christian thing but that that's that's in a sense that's me saying that as a Christian you know that's something I I kind of take on faith because I do believe there's there's something bigger than us that's that's ultimately you know going on here yeah but I I think also that Christ has revealed something about reality that once it's been revealed can not be taken back so once you once you see the the the notion that self-sacrificial love is the is the source of our relationships that it's the source of healthy relationships the source of of of even hierarchies in in the world that that's actually how proper hierarchies functioned is through self-sacrificial love you can't really take that back and you can try but it it ends up being like you said it kind of caricature there's something Antichrist about the reaction to it there's no way there's no way to really fully Escape now from that story you know that's one of the reasons why I try to help people I try to help people understand that like you're in the Christian story folks you can't you can't avoid it anymore if you try to get out of it you only the only thing you can do is become Antichrist uh and and it's not like a moral thing that I'm not trying to guilt you into anything I'm just saying it's just how it's just how it is once you there are some things that once you know you can't unknow anymore it's like Genie is out of the bottle you can't put back yeah yeah yeah and that's that I think that's true about about about Christianity and so what do you see coming down the the line like what do you see I mean I don't want you to to I don't want if you don't feel comfortable saying it but you know because now there's this thing going on like this this movement that's happening how do you see it developing yeah it's really interesting I'm I'm not a good profit of these things and all I'm really pointing out is what what I see happening right now which is this kind of um yeah just just this really interesting conversation that started again with people taking Christianity seriously and kind of the door being opened for you know a quite significant number of people by the likes of Jordan Peterson and even you know Tom Holland who you know I I think is one of the the the best unsung evangelists the UK has right now most of the people I meet at the moment who have serious taking Christianity seriously again they they've basically been reading Tom Holland's Dominion you know and understanding that they are basically products of uh the Christian story uh at a fun mental level so I I find that all very exciting now where is it going I mean My Hope and prayer is that we might be seeing you know the next great Revival I mean that doesn't mean that it's going to be a Revival that looks like previous revivals and but it's going to be whatever needs to happen in our moment I think having said that it could get worse before it gets better um because you know we all know where certainly the the statistics on Church attendance and religiosity and so on are in the west so I'm not saying that suddenly we're going to be seeing you know the pews all filled and church is bursting at the seams but I do feel like there's a there's a kind of winnowing happening of the church itself at the moment there's kind of a lot of models that were kind of superficial or not fit for purpose are sort of H having to be broken down and I think that all as part of the process is there's there's almost like there's always been I think this kind of birth and redeath sorry death and Rebirth of the church in various generations and I just wonder whether we're going through that now and you've seen it obviously in some of the scandals in parts of the Catholic church but equally in the you know in my area the sort of more Evangelical sort of church where you've had lots of celebrity Pastor scandals and and certain ways of doing Church which are obviously toxic are not kind of actually giving life and and doing you know bringing people God in the way that they're meant to and so so I I feel like there's there's that going on on the one hand but there's also this kind of bubbling up of something quite exciting on the other hand and and that I want to sort of just ask the church to yeah absolutely be realistic about the bad stuff but also to maybe have some hope and get excited about the good stuff and ask well what can we do to nurture that and to kind of learn the lessons that we need to learn to make sure that we shepher this movement in a way that that that's helpful as I say it could go off in bad directions you know there there's always the danger that it turns into some kind of Quasi Christian nationalism or something like that you know there there's all kinds of things that will come in and and try to viy I think for for what is actually the true work of the spirit that I think is is going on at some some deeper level um in in the lives of these people and the people who are who are seeking meaning so that's all just to say I don't know exactly where it's going but I just have a sense that the wind is blowing and it feels like something's changed in the atmosphere quite significantly and that actually that that if the church if we Christians can sort of just lean into that and start to answer the questions people are actually asking right now that would be a really good start um I spent you know most of my career kind of doing that traditional apologetics you know here five reasons to believe believe in God and four four reasons to believe the resurrection I just feel like now is possibly the moment to actually step a little back from that not saying that's not important sometimes but to just help people understand why they would want this to be true in the first place and that that that's kind of where we're at I think in our culture people suddenly realizing I want something to be true and and kind of helping them to realize and then maybe you know later on you can show them that in fact it is true you know with with some of that traditional apologetics but it's like at the moment it feels like people are are just at that point of of realizing that they want there to be a bigger world than than the one they've actually been presented with h and so do you see yourself like your approach apologetics do you see that it that it has changed in the past few years like the way that you're talking to people I think it has in all honesty because um as I say you know the first half of my career sort of Hosting these shows was really kind of in that bread and butter sort of science versus Fai you know can we you know five five Arguments for God kind of stuff and as I say it was all good kind of intellectually kind of rigorous stuff that that helped me to kind of get a handle on that but I I quickly realized that there's relatively few people ultimately who actually step into something on the basis of that it might be an important part of the process but there's always at the end of the day there's an imaginative element to this where people have to kind of I don't know their mind has to be renewed in some way where their imagination kind of gets baptized as much as their their intellect kind of gets convinced and um and I've never met someone in all honesty if I just look at it in the cold light of day who just had some intellectual conversion um there's always a sort of spiritual imaginative component going on and and I know it's kind of too cliched almost to say but CS Lewis was obviously a brilliant exponent of doing this because he did that traditional apologetics through m Christian ity and the problem of pain and that kind of thing but but I think where he was at his most fruitful where he resonated the most with people was when he wrote the naria stories and things like that where he created a world that people wanted to be true and and then he said to them well what if this world does in fact exist what if you're actually living in this world and um and for me that's that's a very powerful you know way into the Christian faith and I I think that we need to sort of recapture some of that in the way we we approach people today yeah I I obviously I totally agree with you in some ways you know that's why I've been focusing my attention on storytelling quite a bit recently you know to to to help people as much as possible see that and so have you seen I'm curious what you see the role of artist being in in this because you know it's the the the world of apologetics is usually a world like you said of scientists of kind of of Theologian often very systematic thinkers and so how do you see artists playing a role in what you're describing I I I think that what I would love to see is is artists and I'm again not the first person to say this but but artists stop who are Christians stopping doing quote unquote Christian art that is basically just a knockoff of secular art but with Jesus in the in the frame kind of thing um I just think we need to do great art because anytime you do great art true art you are representing Christ at some level and um and to that extent uh yeah I I just want folk who who do find themselves who do call themselves Christian to just do their art as well as they can um and to to to sort of yeah just just to put it out in the public sphere and and to I mean one of the things I you know what's been fascinating is doing this new documentary podcast series The surprising Rebirth of belief in God um I I ended up for for various reasons moving on from hosting the unbelievable show about a year ago and and it it it was kind of to some extent it was it wasn't a move I'd completely planned out but it did give me suddenly an opportunity to do something very different and I thought I've got this book coming out and I just this thought dropped into my Soul you know what now that I've got some time and space I would love to do a really good documentary podcast series based on the book I just felt like there was a story to be told here and and so you know in God's Providence I sort of had this time and space to to kind of work on something that I would never have been able to work on you know in in my previous role and and I've poured a lot of time and effort um into sort of trying to create something that's not just information but is actually a bit more of an experience it's um that that it it's it it brings something across not just through the the people and the voices but through the music and the kind of the way it's woven together in something that is a little bit more artistic now I'm not saying it's some Oscar worthy you know production but it's what I've what I've noticed releasing that is that the response has been really quite different to the kind of these more sort of just kind of brains on leg debates that you know that I hosted for many years it's it's kind of like people suddenly feel able to engage with it at a different level because they feel like they're entering into a story so so many of the people who've got back to me whether they're Christian or non-Christian have said yeah I feel like this this resonates with me I feel like this is telling my story I I I kind of you know had all those memories of the new atheist phase and I've kind of you know moved on in my thinking and and it's just like it it just reminded me that that there's something about doing something in a storytelling mode in an artistic mode in an imaginative mode that just does connect with people on a different level and i' I'm kind of really enjoying that if I'm honest I and I feel like that's where Christians need to try and almost like sometimes we need to put down the kind of the manual on you know five ways to convert someone in five minutes and and just s sort of start start again say let's just create something people will enjoy people will appreciate people will love and then see what God does with that um because I think that's what art is ultimately if it's used in a really dactic top down sort of overanalyzed way it it stops being art and people kind of know that they're being preached to and know that they're being sort of sold of something and and that's that for me is is where Christians who want to be artist should start to to to focus themselves stop trying to kind of do the thing you know do the thing you know anticipate what this art is going to do to someone and just do the art you know um and and it will speak for itself in that way yeah there's an it's an interesting moment right now because for many years Christians were caught in that world where they basically made propaganda you know especially in the highly produced world of music or of of movies and television you know they just basically made Christian propaganda but now we're at an interesting time when Hollywood itself has become propaganda and so it's actually opening a very interesting space for Christians and religious people to do like CS Lewis and token did which is basically tell stories that have the right world view that have the right perspective that it's a complete perspective right that isn't just kind of and I'm seeing that like you interviewed Mar and Paul Kings North a few few artist types and I can see that they get that right away right possibility of using the the the Poetry of Christ as a means to affect the world not through argument and through kind of convincing but just like you said following in entering into a story and and I think it's why in a funny way you know these prophets from outside the church like Peterson and and Holland and others have have actually been so effective actually drawing people towards Christianity it's because they're not going at it as kind of you know three-point evangelists they're they're just opening it up and and saying here's a story and isn't it interesting and what would happen if you know you you started to step into it they're not you know they they don't have a plan I think to convert people but people are being converted and it it it's because it's it's this much more sort of natural holistic way of doing things where where where PE I mean the thing about especially you know Jordan Peterson that I I find with him is the reason I think he connects with people is because they genuinely feel like he he he cares about them like he cares about their soul basically yeah and and when he you know you know breaks down in tears on stage it's it's not manufactured it's a kind of it's a kind of a re a real reality that kind of breaks through the int ual firewall that I think you get actually with a lot of other public thinkers and things and and I just think there's something about that there's there's something about the um that's very attractive to people I think and and you can't manufacture it you know you can't then say you know to the Evangelist well you need to do the Jordan Peterson thing and start crying on stage because that's the way to get them in it's it's just got to be real you know and that's and so whether it's art whether it's you know Jordan Peterson on the stage people connect with with real stuff and that's where I think we have to go in that sense yeah that I think that that's right u i mean since we're talking about Jordan I I am curious to because you kind of were there at the outset I remember you interviewed Jordan quite early in his you know Skyrocket to to uh to fame um and I'm wondering how you see Jordan's role in this transformation especially the new atheist transformation if you see if you feel like he's played some role in in changing the way people perceive religion I mean I you could probably answer this question far better than I could in all honesty Jonathan but but the I mean the reality is yeah I I I remember in 2017 that was when I first started to to hear the name Jordan Peterson being banded around and people saying hey you should get this guy really interesting you know Canadian psychologist on your show Justin he's he's having these these amazing sellout lectures on the Bible and I always thought oh that sounds interesting and you know and and I heard he you know was making some waves as well around the c16 bill and all that but um I finally kind of got my opportunity actually in in early 2018 um I was starting a series of shows from unbelievable called the big conversation and um I Peterson was just about to release 12 rules for life and he he happened to come over to the UK for a kind of almost pre-released sort of mini tour and I remember sort of getting in touch with the publicist um at the time saying I'd love to book you know Dr Peterson onto my show I'm gonna hopefully bring you on with a sort of atheist psychologist to debate meaning and God and that kind of thing and she said yeah that should be fine yeah we got room in a schedule so so that was fine and and I just remember a series of emails from her as as the time Drew near where she said oh this this man's far more popular than I was expecting him to be and could we just Whittle down your time a bit because I need to take him over to the BBC afterwards and and and it was it was interesting because I even then I could see something was going on and they' sort of you know around the time he came over they booked kind of hastily booked sort of a a thousand seater Auditorium and it sold out you know in hours and so they booked a second one and that sold out and um and this was before the book was even properly released and and then the book came out and funnily enough just a day or two after I recorded my show with Peterson he had that he recorded that Viral interview with Kathy Newman you may remember where you know they they kind of debate the gender pay Gap and that kind of thing so then it just exploded and every everyone was suddenly seemed talking about Jordan berson so I was kind of sitting on this show that I just recorded as well but I I wasn't going to be releasing mine for a few months you know because we weren't going to start this series yet but when when we did obviously it it caught fire and you know brought you know I I can I can thank honestly Jordan for for the fact that our YouTube channel kind of got going at that point because because of that video but it's I guess what I noticed you know a more fundamental level was that yeah this was a classic example of a completely different conversation because I brought him on with this atheist psychologist Susan Blackmore to debate the question of whether we can make sense of life without God and you know I didn't in that sense bring Jordan on as a Christian guest so it was kind of an unusual show in that way I'd normally have a Christian opposite you know an atheist or something like that but but he could have if you had just been casually listening you could easily thought he was a Christian sort of guest because he was defending the idea of you know the fact that the only way we can talk of of value as as humans is that we're made in the image of God and you know and and it was just the most fascinating thing and and I as soon as that show went out suddenly I had a huge influx of new listeners people getting in touch um a very good friend now actually called called Dean in Australia who you know stumbled across the unbelievable show because of having Peterson on and and just people who are basically agnostics but really interested and and just looking for something and I just realized there's this whole sort of outside these kind of quite nerdy Christian atheist apologetics debates there's actually this whole demographic who are just basically looking for something and they've they've kind of looked into the Sam Harris and the Dawkins way of it and it just hasn't quite worked and suddenly Jordan Peterson comes along and and I don't know it just opens a door for them it's like for whatever reason he speaks language that they can understand they can kind of get their heads around faith and religion in a new way and suddenly it's like a door opens for them and and as I say a good number of them I think are walking through that door yeah that's that I when I I remember watching that interview and also thinking he's bringing people on a in a place that they're are not used to he's saying things that people are not used to hearing and kind of crashing some of the argu the normal arguments that people have remember he even argued with her about the the idea that memes then affect genes right trying to say that it's like if there's this idea that memes that memes are just a a you know an emergent property but he was he said then the meme affects the development of the gene through the way that humans act and and it's like I could see her like she had never thought about that in their entire life and I thought oh and it's weird because it's an argument that Jordan used that he hasn't even touched after that and I thought that's the type of argument that can help people understand the idea that at least understand that top- down meaning is real that that constraint from above is something that you can't avoid even in your even in your biological kind of evolutionary way and that that way of arguing is a way to help secular people understand that that that when we talk about you know idea meaning coming down from heaven or names coming down from heaven that it happens even in the the biological uh so anyways I remember that interview I I Remember Loving that interview there I mean it was only a short interview in all honesty you know we we we had about 50 minutes and but we packed an awful lot in and and I just yeah there was some absolutely stunning moments in that one I mean the one the one that I particularly remember is is Jordan beon essentially saying to Susan Blackmore well I don't really think you're an atheist and and she kind of got somewhat offended by this you know what do you mean I don't believe in God and and he basically did his thing of saying well no you you do have something that he's God to you it's you know and and and obviously she kind of you know went back and forth on him on that um but it was interesting because it did introduce me I think to the first time to to this this quite nuanced kind of way in which Peterson and yourself to some extent kind of talk about God because again as he has been on many interviews he wasn't too willing to be drawn on exactly what he means by God but but he was willing to say we will have something that functions as God in our life and um and again I saw I I just think that whole conversation has been quite interesting I think it's sometimes confusing for people because they are it's like uh you know I wish I could just get a straight answer on this but I think what I've I'm I guess even I am beginning to learn is that so so often that conversation is is already being held in sort of um rationalistic naturalistic terms you know when you say just Define God for me and then then we we'll decide whether he exists or not kind of thing yeah exactly and and I just think Jordan is just one of those people who says I'm not going to play the game that way okay that's because I'm immediately going to fall into your trap basically and and I I just found that quite refreshing that he was kind of I don't think he was being evasive in that sense he was just not willing to sort of fall into that specific debate which you know how that's going to go kind of thing so yeah yeah a lot of people make fun of Jordan because of that that these moments where he says well what do you mean by God what do you mean by believe what do you mean and and I think that I understand why they make fun of him but I think that there he's basically trying to say when you're talking about the source of reality when you're talking when you're when you're that's the conversation you're having you're saying what is the source of meaning what is the source of reality what is the source of all things then if you try to use a language that reduces that to propositions then you're already in the wrong sphere and so you you have the problem of you have the you have the problem of again falling into a trap which is like you said if I if I try to define God like I try to define the species of a dog then then the Christian is lost at the outset and there the truth is that in our own Christian tradition there is an apophatic idea there is an idea that God is Not totally definable that God cannot be completely captured by meaning and it's not a way of evading it's a way of saying the source of all things cannot be captured by things like that's just how that's actually just a a kind of normal argument for the same reason that how can I say this like you'll never get to the Big Bang even in your science because you can't get to the origin in the system the origin of the origin is behind yeah the the system of something anyway that's a difficult argument for people understand but I think that there's something about Jordan who intuitively yeah wants to and I think and I think you know 's always that danger in my world that we want everything kind of buttoned down and kind of explained and neatly sort of systematically kind of done and I think in that sense Peterson sort of has sort of frustrated both Christians and atheists at that level because he's not willing to be put in those boxes in that way but I found that but in in in an interesting way that's part of his appeal I think for many people is that he's sort of not kind of using the typical language of of either side and so he's he's kind of that's why I think it opens it up for people in in a strange way because it's it's it's a bit more expansive and they feel like I I this isn't the kind of the thing I heard in Sunday school and but it's not that it's not kind of you know the Dawkins lecture either that that I was at so I yeah I I just think there's something going on there that that means that it's yes sometimes hard to pin down in the way because people like to have things very black and white but at the same time it's kind of opening up PE the possibilities for people in in other ways you know and so in your new in this new project in this new documentary series um what are the things that have surprised you because you I you kind of had a perception and and the right perception that something's happening in culture and so we need to investigate this and understand it but what are the some of the things that that you didn't expect to see maybe I I think some of it is is the people you know that I encounter who have become Christians um and some of them are really surprising stories you know you you know Paul King's North quite well and and again he's someone who was himself completely shocked surprised by the fact that he became a Christian um because it was that was not the thing that he was expecting would provide the answers you know he thought he knew what Christianity was you know there's that sense in which I think you can almost become inoculated to Christianity if you've kind of received a small shot of it you know at some point and thinking that you've had the real thing and then you discover later that ah no it turns out the real thing was was something altogether different and bigger and and he you know went through you know sort of teenage atheist phase he kind of then spent a long time sort of in Buddhism felt like he still needed to worship something though there was that kind of deep sense that the world was enchanted and and nature which he loved so much and so he tried wicker you know for a while and you know was out in the woods kind of doing nature religion and worship and but again in a very sort of really interesting series of events in his own life where at one point his his wife out of the blue again not a Christian told him he was going to become a Christian and then he was having dreams about Jesus and he was suddenly having all these correspondences from people he hadn't realized were Christians in his life and and it just there was just like he says it was almost like he got dragged out of wicker and into Eastern Orthodoxy in fact in the end so it's I just find that really interesting because again you've got someone who's a highly intelligent you know person um 21st Century Modern person but who who suddenly finds that the the story they've been looking for for a kind of a story to make sense of life and suddenly that the last story they expected to do it was the one that did it um and I just I'm finding kind of increasing examples of that that again in a funny way that that sort of story of ion hery Ali and I'm only mention mention kind of the big well-known ones here there there's lots and lots of other smaller less well-known stories I could mention but but again I just find it so interesting that suddenly you know in in this moment she comes out and says actually I'm not an atheist anymore um I and she doesn't she doesn't kind of give a you know credal statement of belief exactly in Christianity but what she does say is atheism isn't enough and I need what whatever it is that this person Jesus represents that's what I'm looking for in my life and again I just find I would that you could have knocked me over with a feather when when she dropped that article because I was like what this is this is a bit like St Paul on the road to Damascus here this was a proper new atheist one that you know she shared the stages with Harris and Dawkin so if it could happen to her it could happen to anyone you know and so so these I do find these genuinely surprising I feel like something's changed in the atmosphere that that it's possible for those kinds of stories to suddenly be happening so that's probably the bit I find most exciting most surprising I think um in a way there's lots of other surprising elements to it you as I said the way that the ground has shifted so completely so that I see kind of unusual bedfellows now with some of the atheist interloc who were now sharing stages with Christians who are you know studying up and and kind of collaborating in various ways so many interesting conversations that you're having with with people that you might not have ever thought to you would be having you know 10 years ago because I think there's been a kind of convergence of lots of things and and so I'm I don't know how that's all going to shake out and it's not all necessarily going to be positive and people are going to go off in different directions with this but I do just find that that the whole thing is sort of getting shaken up stirred around and I feel like you know again this is my me speaking as a Christian that that God's doing something you know in in the process of all that and uh and I I just yeah quite excited about it well everybody you check out uh Justin's book The surprising Rebirth of the belief in God and his his documentary series re-enchanting like I said at the outset it's really interesting he's talking to all the people that similar people that we're talking to there is you know he's in the the he's perceived some of the similar things that everybody who's watching this has seen that there's something happening there's a deep shift in culture uh and definitely there is a return of the Sacred and the possibility of seeing Christ freshly again and so Justin thanks so much for all the work you do oh you're you're so welcome Jonathan it's been an absolute privilege to be on um just just one slight s of um correction there which is the the re-enchanting podcast is a slightly different thing to the surprising Rebirth of belief in God podcast but we're using quite a lot of material material from that in the documentary Series so they're very much connected in many way where's the best place people can find what you're working yeah Justin bry.com is my website so you can sign up to the newsletter do all the usual things there but you'll get links to the podcast to the book and to re-enchanting as well if you want to follow some of the conversations we have on that other podcast but yeah Justin bry.com all right thanks Justin thank you so much
