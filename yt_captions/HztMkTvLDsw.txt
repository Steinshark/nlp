when huawei announce team 820 Pro they also made a pretty bold claim they said that this phone will charge a 440 percent faster than the iPhone 10's max we're going to put that to the test so welcome to the charging speed test in which we're gonna have the mate 20 pro with its behemoth 40 watt charger but I've also managed to get hold of the standard mate 20 and that should be no joke either with 20 2.5 watt charging we've then got the pixel with 18 watt charging which on paper shouldn't be far behind at all the note 9 which is still stuck on 15 watts something the company's been using for a while now and the iPhone 10's max which comes with a pretty appalling 5 watt charger in the box ok let's get the show on the road and to make this a completely fair test we're gonna drain all the phones right here right now they're all pretty much about to die so I've just pulled up some demanding games and apps they'll be gone in a couple of minutes so that's it we plug in the cables and charging begins so for all of these phones I'm using the stock charger that you would get with the phone that's probably the one that 95% of people will end up using seems like the fairest way to do this for some reason the iPhones battery jumps at the beginning there seems to think it's on more charge than it is but this corrects itself further down the line and you can probably tell already these two Huawei phones have already pulled ahead they are blazing fast when it comes to charging speed it's been barely five minutes and the meet 20 pro is already on twelve thirteen forty I can't keep up quite a lot of percentage points the pro model isn't as far ahead of the standard model as I was expecting or as the charging specification might make you believe but this could be explained by 40 watts only being the maximum power of the charger it isn't consistently charged at 40 watts and also the fact that the mate 20 Pro has a slightly larger capacity than the mate 20 this means that 40% on the May 20 Pro is worth slightly more than 40 percent on the mate 20 okay so taking a look at the other phones you can see that they're pretty much in the order you would expect given how powerful their charges are as you can probably tell testing the charging speed when you're using the charges that come in the box is is not something that favors the iPhones even though it has the smallest battery of all five phones here the Telus max is on the lowest percentage this is comparatively and not even close this is the kind of difference you would definitely notice on a day to day basis if you look at the comparison you look at the difference between that phone and the mate 20 pro on the very left hand side it's staggering also let me know what you think to these new graphics I've been trying to make the video as easy to follow but also nice to look at as possible and if you're new around here I would really appreciate it if you could smash that subscribe button for plenty more tests like this ok so notice how after 50 minutes the mate 20 pro is now on over 90 percent which is great but at the same time means it has slowed down since it hit over 20 percent after just 10 minutes and this is normal this happens with all phones when they're charging but this is the reason why companies tend to quote the initial charging figures they might give you a certain amount of power after 30 minutes of charging just cuz that's the most impressive to make this a fair test by the way the iPhone turns on automatically when you start charging it so I've turned on all the phones as a result also I've put them all on airplane mode and kept their screens at the same brightness using a luminance meter okay while we make 20 Pro has hit 100% after just under one hour and 10 minutes the first thing to note is that that is the fastest charging phone I've ever tested but the other interesting thing is that while weighs quoted figure was that the firm would get 70% charge in 30 minutes and clearly that's not quite what happened here there's a number of potential reasons for that the phone is on for starters but to be fair when it's in airplane mode it's barely sipping power I'm sure the fact that I'm checking the screen every now and again will also contribute to slightly slower charging not to mention figures that are given are almost always best case scenarios so what we're seeing here is probably more likely the kind of charging speed you would get if you've also been looking at the Mait 20 you'll have noticed it fell quite significantly behind towards the end of the test and now finishing at one hour forty it is a good portion slower than the meet 20 pro and not so far ahead of the pixel 3 Excel or even the note 9 the iPhone is looking like a different beast altogether but we'll get to that when it comes as we hover around the two-hour mark the note 9 finishes charging and to be honest it's a pretty impressive performance compared to the pixel it doesn't take much longer but its capacity is much higher even though it's taken longer it has charged a lot more battery in that extra time okay so we're not going to spend too much time on the iPhone here I'm gonna fast forward it so that we just get to the end to see how long it takes but essentially a long time especially as the battery starts to fill up now for those of you who use a fast charger I've already separately charged the iPhone tennis max on its own with a fast charger to see what the result would be so I'll leave that at the end as well so all phones are now fully charged let's take a look at the results to make a bit of a comparison in fifth place was the iPhone 10's max appalling time 3 hours 22 minutes but if you did he's a fast charger you get a much more respectable 1 hour 50 the note 9 then finished quite a way ahead with 2 hours and one minute pretty impressive given its large capacity but at the same time not amazing I didn't come away that impress by the pixel considering it has a 3 for 30 million power battery which is pretty average it still took nearly 2 hours to fully charge then we have the mate 20 and this is on the boundary of what I would consider a fast charging phone has got the same battery capacity as the galaxy note 9 but finished almost 20% faster this is pretty comparable to one plus 6 charging speed if you look at it in terms of milliamp hours per minute but then the pro really impressed me this phone has not just the largest battery of the bunch but also even with that managed to charge almost 30% faster than the already first mate 20 I don't think you'll regularly hit the 70% charge in 30 minutes claim especially if your phone is on but a slide from the super vooc charging Oppo find X Lamborghini Edition this is easily one of the fastest if not the fastest charging phones in the world so that's the charging test I've got plenty more Huawei mate 20 Pro and mate 20 coverage coming up and if there's anything in particular you want to see drop a comment let me know I will have a look and with that being said my name is Aron this is mr. who boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
