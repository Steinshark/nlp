I haven't played kahoot since I was in school and I was just thinking the other day you know it's been a while since I played you know I have my degree that means I'm pretty educated I must know what I'm doing how loud is this oh who's it gonna be who's gonna be oh you thought it was gonna be me yeah yeah no everything just went back so I still suck at kahoot I still can't win a stupid game you know who even needs a kahoot win anyways so I had an amazing idea instead of using my ooga booga cave membrane why don't I just use AI since it's gonna take over the world why can't it take over kahoot games you know [Music] I've never won a kahoot game even in school because there was always that smart kid that was just like that was so easy I don't know how you guys got that wrong I didn't even need to study you guys must be really stupid so it's time to make a tool to Humble these people and make them feel like idiots and hopefully get them to shut up and make them retire from kahoot permanently now I'm not gonna create my own AI because that's too much work and I'm too stupid but you know who can these guys you know what they made Chachi BT you know what I am a programmer and you know what I can do program chat gbt so here's the plan I'm gonna make a program that looks at my screen and it's gonna grab all the kahoot information so it's going to grab the question and then all the possible answers and then once it gets that information it's going to give it to Chachi BT and then chat GPT is going to decide an answer and the moment it decides it's going to select the answer for me where it hopefully gets all the answers right dunk on these [ __ ] kids and makes me the number one kahoot player in the world [Music] so the first thing I have to do is read my screen and get this kahoot information I don't know how to do that so I'm gonna figure that out however long that takes okay so I was doing some research and there's two main ways that I can think of doing this the first way I thought of is using OCR or optical character recognition and this is just a fancy big brain machine learning technique that lets your computer read text from an image so what I can do is I can take screenshots of my screen that has the kahoot question and then all the answers and then I'll use OCR to extract all the text from the screenshots and then just give that to chatgpt now some issues with this approach is that it could take a long time to extract all the information and it might not be accurate so if this reads the question wrong or any of the answers wrong this could mess up the AI completely the second way I thought of is just using web scraper to just grab all the elements on the kahoot page so I'll just grab the question and the answers but that might take a lot of programming and I'm pretty lazy so I'm gonna go with the machine learning OCR approach since we're already using AI let's just go all the way with it definitely not because I'm lazy shut the [ __ ] up and I just want to give I just want to give chatgpt a handicap okay I just want to give this Market a chance because I'm such a nice guy so so let's start programming this done yeah that's all it took sometimes programming is not that hard here's what's going on so the way this script is going to work is when I press a certain hotkey it's going to activate the script so when I press these buttons it's going to take the screenshot of the question and then all the answers and then from there I'm going to use OCR to extract the text from those screenshots and then hopefully it reads it correctly and then I can just give it to chat EBT but I haven't tested this OCR so uh we're gonna find out together if this works or not and if it doesn't then I'm gonna have to think of something else like there's Roblox all right let's see if this works if it works on be so [ __ ] surprised this is so scuffed holy word what the [ __ ] it'll work yeah so almost about ingenious this actually worked perfectly it actually even tried to get the symbols on the buttons so I'm gonna have to cut those out of the screenshots and then we're gonna try it again all right this time I removed the symbols from the screenshot let's see if this works oh my god it works yeah so this actually works I'm gonna do some additional tests like if we only have three buttons and just other questions because I refuse to believe this is actually gonna work all right let's see how this does nice all right another question dude this is crazy all right see this one oh my God does it work with numbers wow this might actually just work a way up I spoke too soon bro there's no way who would have thought there's a day we're not having Windows would actually affect me this is why Linux is better let me just go fix my complicated code programming ladies and gentlemen all right let's try this again wow who would have thought funky Windows all right oh three buttons see if this works let's [ __ ] go all right I'm too lazy to test other questions so uh let's just move on so before we start walking around with chat gbt I want to make sure clicking a button works because programming chat gbt is not free and I'm broke so I don't want to waste money and go bankrupt over this stupid project so let's write the code and do some quick tests let's see if this works oh what the Bubba did it work yeah it did work it was just so fast I couldn't see it cool so everything works now we can mess around with chat gbt oh and by the way we're only gonna do quiz questions We're not gonna do true or false or any type of weird questions because I'm too lazy to program that but let's mess around with some chat EBT all right I just finished writing the code for Chad gbt and all it's doing is just telling chat GPT just give me the answer don't give me a whole [ __ ] essay about why this is correct just give me the answer and we're done oh and I'm also using gpt4 since it's the most advanced model right now and also because open AI on its website is like gpt4 is super Advanced it can handle super complex instructions it can solve difficult problems and we're going to put that to the test alright so here's the final code I'm going to be using this code right here is going to make me into a kahoot Legend put me into their Hall of Fame make me a man amongst boys so let's test this out and see if this actually works see if my stupid idea works [ __ ] work oh my god it worked yeah I don't have any comments to say it's it's so satisfying I think we're ready to move on to the next phase of this dumb project that's tall big guys we locked up for life what the hell wrong with you hey yo okay so now that we have a working program we can honestly just have fun with this so we're just gonna test gpt4 and see how smart it really is by giving it a bunch of different kahoot questions ranging from different subjects and if it gets all the questions right I'm giving myself the title of number one kahoot player because I made this vlogging program and honestly this is a pretty good test to see how smart gpt4 is since you know when they reveal gpt4 they shot off how smart it was using practice exams and you know coming from a professional such as myself you know such a smart genius that's pretty dumb you know I think that's a pretty dumb way to show off how smart it is like nobody cares about the bar the LSAT the SAT medical knowledge all that is useless nobody cares about that you know what people really care about [ __ ] kahoot questions that's what God this Project's so stupid we're gonna finish the kahoot I started so let's see how it does um foreign before we continue I just want to say one thing [ __ ] you Robin who's first place now yeah all right let's do some more kahoots this is so dumb but it's so cool time for some big boy science [Music] oh a video clip I hope this works uh oh oh no no God damn it [ __ ] yeah I should have seen that come in everything was going too smooth let me just prompt engineers and then we're gonna try again okay I made a small little change in the Chachi BT prompt so it should now work so let's get back into it [Music] thank you foreign wow um I'm gonna be honest with you guys I thought it was gonna get every question right I didn't expect the wrong answer uh well guys I just proved that AI is not going to take over the world because they can't answer a kahoot question you're welcome ladies and gentlemen you are welcome it's definitely not because they couldn't read the question that has no correlation at all it's all because gpt4 is stupid it still won the game though aha all right let's do one more kahoot set this one's gonna be for all the money for all the Marvels All or nothing and look what I found a kahoot of a hundred questions I'm gonna grade gpt4 based on how many it gets right so if it gets 70 it's a c and 80 a b a 90 an A minus and then a 95 to 100 is an A so uh let's do this oh God [Music] wow we got the first question wrong that's crazy Never Back Down never what never give up never back down never what never give up boys [Music] [Music] the truth well there you have it guys gpt4 got 91 questions out of 100 some of them are my fault but we don't talk about that it's all on gbt4 remember so uh gbt4 gets uh a minus congrats you're welcome open AI you have a new statistic but um I guess I'm the number one kahoot player guys hell yeah [Music]
