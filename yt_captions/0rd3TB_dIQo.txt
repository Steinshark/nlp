I know you're not a futurist but are you excited have you when you look back in your life long for the idea of creating a human level intelligence yeah I'm driven by that all my life I'm doing just by one thing but I go slowly I go from what I know to the next step incrementally so without imagining what the end goal looks like do you imagine what the end goal is gonna be a machine that can answer sophisticated questions counterfactuals of a great compassion [Music] responsibility and free will so what is a good test there's a touring test a reasonably free will doesn't exist yet how would you test free well and that's so far we know only one thing meaning if robots can communicate with reward and Punishment among themselves hitting each other on the wrist and say you shouldn't have done it okay playing better soccer because you can do that what do you mean because they can do that because it can communicate among this because of the communication they can do because of the communicate like us reward and punishment yes you didn't pass the ball the right the right time and so for therefore you're gonna sit on the bench for the next two if they start communicating like that the question is will they play a better soccer it supposed to work as if what what they do now without this ability to reason about reward and Punishment responsibility and it's fine I can only think about communication communications and in an honest a natural language but just communication just communication and that's important to have a quick and effective means of communicating knowledge if the coach tells you should have passed the ball pink he conveys so much knowledge to supposed to would go down and change your software that's the alternative but the coach doesn't know your software so how can it coach tell you you should have passed the ball but that our language is very effective if you just pass the ball you know your software you tweak the right module and next time you don't do it now that's for playing soccer and the rules are well-defined well not well defined when you should pass the ball is not what the fuck'd know it's very soft there is no Z yes it's art but in terms of aligning values between computers and humans do you think this cause and effect type of thinking is important to align the values values morals ethics under which the machines make decisions is is the cause-effect where the two can come together qualification is necessary component to build a ethical machine because the machine has to empathize to understand what's good for you to build a model of use of you as a recipient we should be very much but what is compassion they imagine it you suffer pain as much as me as much as I do have already a model of myself right so it's very easy for me to map you to mine I don't have to rebuild the model it's much easier to say oh you are like me okay therefore I would not hate you and the machine has to imagine it has to try to fake to be human essentially so you can imagine that you're they you're like me right moreover with me let's defend it that's consciousness they have a model of yourself where do you get this model you look at yourself as if you are a part of the environment if you build a model of yourself versus the environment then you can say I need to have a model of myself I have abilities I have desires and so forth okay I have a blue print of myself though not the full detail because I cannot get the halting problem right but I have a blueprint so that level of a blueprint I can modify things I can look at myself in the mirror and say hmm if I change this much tweak this one I'm gonna perform differently that is what we mean by free will and consciousness gorgeous you
