[Music] okay so i was at this meeting a long time ago with google and youtube i don't even know if i'm allowed to talk about this yet but it was so long ago proud it doesn't matter uh but eric schmidt was there and he said something that i remember super clearly to this day i'll never forget the quote which was every problem that we have is a problem at scale and the more i think about that the crazier it is i mean it makes a lot of sense youtube is a huge site so youtube right now in 2022 has 2.6 billion monthly active users that means that if there's a problem that's so small it only affects 0.1 percent of people on youtube that problem now affects 2.6 million people so if you're running a company that big that affects this many people like there's gonna be a lot of decisions that come across their plate that are going to affect large groups of people and obviously there's got to be a threshold that you set where you can't do tons of things every single day but once it reaches the threshold then you got to make a choice so maybe oh you know something comes up that's affecting a third of youtube users that makes 4k videos loads slowly or something all right we'll do something about that or hey looks like three percent of youtube users are getting dislike bombed so we'll do something about it we'll just get rid of dislikes from the whole site but there are still going to be small little issues all the time that are below that threshold that affect a tiny tiny fraction of the site 0.1 0.01 percent and that isn't a big enough issue to spend money on fixing but it's still affects millions of people but this issue i really just from my experience on youtube i have to think that it has gotten above that threshold and that is comment spam so really any recently uploaded video you go to on youtube by a relatively active creator you will undoubtedly come across comments with duplicate names and profile pictures like this thanks for watching message right away i have something for you thanks for the feedback expect more videos very soon send direct message i have something for you congratulations you've been selected amongst our shortlisted winners and they're usually the first or only reply on a lot of the most recent and most popular comments on any video doesn't really matter what the comment is about they'll figure if you're leaving a comment you're engaged enough to see it and fall for it and their goal is to get you off of youtube onto a telegram message or whatsapp message now if you're thinking well damn that's stupid that's obviously not going to work it's clearly fake well that's what i would think too but i started getting emails and tweets first it was like one email a day or someone once would tweet at me and then it was two a day or three a day and then it was several every day now at this point every day i wake up to at least a dozen new emails of people sending me screenshots of conversations they think they've had with me just checking to make sure they sent the money to the right place or whether or not the paypal payment went through these people are claiming to have a giveaway prize ready to ship and they just need you to pay one or 200 bucks for shipping and if that's just the people who have thought to email me imagine how many other people are falling for this and not emailing me that i'm not seeing like that is a serious bummer and the crazy part to me is you would think the comment section would be this precious priority for youtube because it's such a unique feature of the site this is one of the only places that you can facilitate real conversations between the creators and the audience between you and i it's what makes youtube youtube like i remember back when i started on youtube i had email notifications turned on for everything so every new comment and every new subscriber i got an email for it and i would reply to every single comment on every single video for years actually but this was my portal into the community now these days obviously i can't reply to everything but i do still try to spend a lot of time in the comments section and talking to people but i end up spending most of my time blocking channels of people trying to scam my audience out of money and keep in mind this is just the spam flavor of the moment like these spammers like any other bad actors are always going to try to adapt and evolve and be as effective as possible all the time so like on my channel if i'm doing a giveaway or even if i'm not they'll know they can slip in and talk about like maybe doing a tech giveaway but on jacksepticeye's channel he just did a video about a month ago talking about how commenters will try to get you to go to their adult sites with just copying and pasting another highly rated comment and then just getting a bunch of bots to upvote it to the top linus made a video this year on comment spam his channel gets plenty of crypto stuff along with pc related giveaways and you can imagine on any mr beast video or any channels in that cinematic universe there's just going to be money giveaway spam there's just so much spam and with the number of places the number of channels that i've seen this comment spam running rampant on i feel like it has to be associated with some level of negative sentiment of just a bad feeling of spending time in the youtube comments section so now there are moderation tools that youtube has built to help keep comments and check right they've gotten better over time there's an automatic spam filter that does a pretty decent job and catches a lot of stuff and just recently this button to hide user from channel will actually work retroactively so it'll block the channel but then also remove all the comments they've ever made on any of my videos but i've spent a lot of time doing this and the more time you spent trying to keep up with the spam the more you realize that not enough is being done so now youtuber theo joe you might have heard of him he's made an open source tool that will scan for spam comments and is much better than youtube at identifying all of them and just on my last video alone out of around 6 000 comments scanned it found that nearly 2 000 of them were identified as spam 2 000 spam comments look i don't know how bad something has to get to get on youtube's radar to cross that threshold but if 30 of the comments on my new video are spam that's just not a good look so okay what should be done that's the real question right uh and i think there are two things one is a community built solution and two is a youtube built solution but only one of those things actually exists effectively right now so the community built solutions can actually put a dent in things by users that are active and and going through and doing this type of stuff all the time so that tool by theo joe that i mentioned earlier it's multi-platform it works on windows and on mac and if you plug in your youtube info you can purge youtube comments according to its much more accurate filters and criteria which is super helpful for creators that implement it i am definitely going to try it and then other people can download it and run other videos through it to mass report comments on other videos and other channels now that doesn't delete those comments but hopefully the mass reporting of these types of comments can help train youtube's automatic filters to more effectively remove them will it actually work i don't know but i promise you no matter how good these community built solutions get nothing can touch the effectiveness of youtube building a fix themselves and we know that to be true because the community built solutions are amazing and the problem's still here so youtube has to do something about it now i'm not expert but i have been on youtube longer than i haven't been on youtube crazy to say that so looking at these youtube comments even though these are all pretty obviously spam comments to me clearly they're getting through the spam detection filter that youtube's built so a comment moderation tool to nuke them all would be the ideal right now like i mentioned earlier they steal the uploader's profile picture to try to be convincing but then they also make literally dozens of accounts really quickly so blocking one of them and hiding all of their past activity from the channel which works it only works for one set of spam comments that one spam account left on my last video alone like i said tons of spam there's almost 40 different accounts leaving comments and each one of them has left anywhere from 1 to 111 spam comments so as of right now you can already block certain words from appearing in the body of a youtube comment so if somebody leaves a comment with a certain word in it it will just not show up and that makes a lot of sense it works for like if someone tries to put an address or your phone number or an offensive word or any number of things that may be part of the spam flavor of the moment that you can just nix right in the bud that's super useful but like i said these bots are smart or at least the people making them are they're already adapting to that by cramming as much information as they can into the username now so not just the body of the spam comment itself so the best solution i can think of right now would be for youtube to let us ban words from user names so that right off the bat i can just ban anyone who tries to use my name in their own username it's the easiest way to stop impersonation type spam from occurring and i know it might sound messy or brute force and you might be concerned about innocent users getting caught in the crossfire hey what if someone has the same name as me but listen this is the same company that saw a fraction of users getting dislike brigaded and decided to turn off dislikes for the entire site so to me this tool seems to be not that bad and who knows maybe someday in the future youtube's ai will get advanced enough that if you make a brand new account with the same profile picture and name as the person whose videos you're commenting on and then leave a hundred comments in an hour that it'll trip something and it'll recognize it as spam and delete it but in the meantime a psa myself and other creators will never ask you for money or for a shipping address or to dms on telegram and if we do have a giveaway going out we have verified accounts and will never message you from any other account so if you click on an account and it doesn't go to our channel that's a pretty good sign okay that's it for now youtube get on it that's it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music]
