what does that mean what does God do well God creates that's what God does so if we want to become God we have to create so we have to create life so again there's something almost subconscious there going on that we have to create new life in order to actually be Gods if we're going to really cement our dominance of the planet and our coming dominance of the universe because we're going to colonize that as well because that that I mean that's another aspect of it right we end up colonizing the whole of creation this is all part of the same narrative we're going out into the Stars we're going to we're going to terraform the planets so it's uh in order to become like Gods we have to create we have to create worlds which is what we're going to do when we terraform Mars that's what Ellen musk wants to do and we have to create new life so here we are openly trying to do it but at the same time we have this kind of terrifying sense that the life we're creating isn't under our control you know it's it's already looking like it's going to supplant us so because funnily enough we're not very good at being gods you know we're good at creating but we don't even really know how what we're doing or where it's going to go turns out that being God is quite [Music] complicated this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic [Applause] world so hello everyone I am here with Paul kingsnorth Paul kingsnorth for people you know who watch my content needs no introduction uh he is a writer he he has written several novels and recently did an entirely very powerful uh series on the machine which broke down some of the mechanisms of what is happening around us trying to help us understand you know the processes with the the let's say first of all the principalities behind it but then also understanding how it how it runs and so he has finished his series he's actually going to publish it as a book next year and so I wanted to talk to him and see what his insights are after going through this so Paul thanks for talking to me yeah great to be back good to see you again and so you have you've gone through the whole process of of thinking through let's say our situation um you know and things are moving so fast what what are the main insights that you taken away from your process yeah it's a good question so well it's so you just use the word principalities right to talk about talk about the thing the power behind the machine and I think this is the main insight for me so I mean my my my sort of long-term I don't know what my background is exactly I'm a writer but I I've always I've always kind of I've cycled between my left and my right brain as a writer so I'll I'll write a novel and then I'll then I'll write some non-fiction then I'll go back to the novel and and I'm always circling around the same question I think all writers do and I think the question for me is why modern people are so disconnected from well everything real actually disconnected from culture I think disconnected from nature disconnected from God and I felt that all my life and I've tried to explore it in all my work um since I became a Christian since I became an Orthodox Christian three or four years ago now it's it's really come into a different Focus entirely it feels like that's the kind of the apex of the understanding but what I what I was trying to do with this book which I started writing while I was in the process becoming Christian so that that that kind of is reflected in the writing I think the last chapters are more Christian than the first ones strangely enough but what I was trying to do was look at the technological society that we're living in which I which I called the machine which is a term I borrowed from writers I've admired for years RS Thomas DH Lawrence Robinson Jeffers you name it for a hundred or so years people have been using this phrase George Orwell used it this because it's a very good image it's a very good symbol for the kind of world we're living in feels like we're cogs in a machine it feels like we're part of something very much bigger than us that isn't really natural that's constructed in some way and we're controlled by it maybe we built it to control things but now it controls us and it's accelerated a thousandfold in the digital age and it's accelerating all the time and it's very difficult not to feel like we're part of something that we can't get out of now that's starting to feel like it's got a mind of its own and that's the big Insight so especially in just in the last couple of years as as say AI has has taken off we've really started to feel and we've seen a lot of people talking and writing about this that there's something behind this that's almost intelligent so I felt like we were trapped in this thing and I wanted to write about what it was where it came from what it how it actually infected or affected or infected the culture and politics and what we could do about it and and I think that the big insight for me probably is is a spiritual one it is the sense that there's if you look at this from if you look at it say from a Christian perspective then it looks like the ultimate manifestation of the Rebellion against God that begins in in the start of the Book of Genesis right so we decide to to stop aligning our will with that of God and we start to follow our own will and what do we do then well we construct cities we construct technology but more than that we start to try to build a world of our own and the ultimate end point of trying to build a world of our own is trying to build God or trying to build Gods which is the way that the people in Silicon Valley now openly talk about what their project is yeah so we've ended up building this thing which is far more than the sum of the Technologies involved so it's not just about whether smartphones are good or whe cars are good or whatever it's a it's a whole network of something that feels like it's taking on a life of its own and one of the things that I I really found Most Fascinating and disturbing in in in the research was that if you start to read the stuff that's written by the guys in Silicon Valley who are coming out with this stuff who are really designing the the the kind of the brain of the machine that we all function on all the time which we call the internet they talk very openly about what they're doing as summoning God building God creating a a platform for something to come into they talk about um the importance of they talk about uh self-replication but more than that they talk about something that has its own mind and and its own way of seeing so you know you can dismiss that as mad fantasy but they're the people building it and so if you if you look at it from from a a spiritual perspective from the perspective of those powers and principalities you see something going on that's sort of long predicted it's very old but it's also very new we're trying to replace and we're trying to build God and we're trying to live forever and we're trying to become gods and in that sense it's a very old story but the machine if you like is is is I think that the latest manifestation of it probably the most successful one so that's the weird disturbing conclusion that I ended up coming to yeah I mean I I I think I totally agree with what you're saying I I mean there's a question that I have this is something that I've been thinking about for a very long time which is if you can so in in Revelation right there there are two images there's the image of the Beast and the [ __ ] uh you know of this this kind of let's say civilizational Beast which is using people's desires to advance itself and to basically become more powerful uh and then ultimately the Beast kills The Horde and then it's just T tyranny all the way all the way through so there's this one image right that's one image of of civilization but then there's another image which is Heavenly Jerusalem in which you do have the sense of tech of a city uh you know have you ever thought or imagined or thought of how technology it would it be possible to turn this into something that would serve god let's say well that's the question isn't it the question is always what the machine what the technology itself is serving so firstly I think there's a difference between a tool and a technology because a tool is a very simple thing that you can use to you know a spade is a tool you use it to break the ground um and you could use it to dig the grave if somebody you just murdered or you could use it to plant beautiful plants and grow food that you need to feed your family right so that tool could be used for good or ill a technology is something that is almost able to manifest its own will and that's where we are now um so the question is what something serves so so I don't think that's just a question of you know a very common argument you here is technology is neutral and all we really need to think about is whether we do good or ill with it and sometimes that can be true like it's as I say it's true with the Spade um but some technology is not neutral and an atom bomb is not neutral it can only do one thing I would actually argue that a smartphone is not neutral either I mean it's going to take you in one particular direction so you can create Technologies and tools and creating Technologies and tools is what Humanity does there's no way of getting out of that that's who we are that's what that's that's the gift we're given it's a question of what you create and what you create is determined by what you serve and what the what the machine is so this thing I'm calling the machine I think is designed to serve our independent will so it would take us in a direction away from God you could build Technologies designed to serve something else and they would look different I think so it's not a question of the tool or the technology person say it's a question of the thing that's being served as you say yeah there's a different kind of City I've seen you talking about this before you know the Heavenly Jerusalem has a tree at the center of it you know it's a very particular type of city I'm struck by the fact that the cities we used to build in the Middle Ages the highest buildings in those cities were churches the highest buildings in our cities are banks yeah so that's the difference between the city now and the city then there are a lot of different kind of cities there are different kind of Technologies there it depends on on on who you're serving and what you're trying to do and I think that in a culture like ours which specifically almost even rejects that question can't see anything other than the material and the financial and the and the progressive in the broadest sense of that word it's always going to build something like the machine which will always just turn us back to our own will all the time yeah one of the things that I think is interesting tell me what you think about this because I I've been thinking about this a lot which is so when you build a tool make a tool then the tool serves the purpose of what the tool is made for but there is a manner in which we become dependent on the tool to some extent right so if I you know if I have matches then I forget how to make fire with something else and and at some point if I don't you know as technology increases then I lose certain organic abilities to make that ability more powerful so there is a manner in which we we tend to become dependent of our tools now is is that good is that bad you know it's just reality like it's just how it how things function but when you create a a technology which has to do with mind and a technology which has to do with attention and Technologies which have to do with human the way humans perceive meaning and engage with meaning so the idea of creating a statue of a God for example like that's an example where you create a tool you're creating a a tech a technical structure like you're making a statue of some God uh there's there seems to be a way in which all of a sudden that the manner in which we become dependent on it it changes because then we serve it because you're the AI like what we're seeing with the AI is that we're creating this AI to serve our will but everybody knows that ultimately we will subject our will to it it's a it's a weird thing right it's like we're doing it to increase our power and to increase our capacity and to increase to do these things but if you ask even the people building it like will it transcend us and then become a God in the proper sense of being above us and managing us and the answer is well probably probably yes you know my daughter like my daughter her last essay for graduating English was to write an essay about how AI serves the needs of students and she said that the way that the the the the the things that they gave her to read in order to write the the the essay were all about it basically being impartial you know of being able to manage things without the human Prejudice and all this stuff and I'm like basically they're saying you're gonna serve these AIS no it's really it's really interesting the the whole the whole notion of what you serve um so again I mean we've known for a long time that we've already created a society which we're serving consider how people talk about the economy okay politicians talk about the economy all the time and when there's an election the argument is who's going to run the economy best what's best for the economy what can we do and the economy is spoken of like a god like it's a separate thing and if you actually look at what you know the economy literally the you know going back to the Greek you're you're looking at a a term that means household management right so an economy is something you're embedded in say your home is an economy then in a traditional Society or even in a modern one it's just it's the sum total of things humans doing but we now talk about this thing called the economy which is somehow out there it's separate from us and we're already serving it okay so and and you'll hear oh we need lots of immigration for the economy or we need privatization for the economy whatever it is as if you somehow have to make a sacrifice to this God right well we might not like this but we have to do it so we've already accepted exactly so the economy has become it's become an idol and we're already serving it and we're accepting if you listen to the way that politicians talk about this we've already accepted that we've created a thing that is now controlling us and we have to give the economy certain sacrifices every year otherwise the economy will collapse and then we're in trouble right that's like the god rejecting us so we've been in this for a long time so AI in one sense is very new but in another sense it's just a culmination of living in this system in which you say we are totally dependent on and we have been for centuries or Millennia yeah um there's a there's a phrase that the historian Ronald Wright came up with called the progress trap he wrote a great book called The Short history of progress and he's talking about exactly this you create you create a technology to solve a problem maybe it solves the problem but you're then dependent on that technology so say you want to i' take something like the Green Revolution right so we're saying oh there there's a lot of people in the world there's not enough food for them well let's let's uh let's use artificial fertilizers and phosphates and chemicals well great now we've in now we've increased the food supply but we've also damaged the soil and also we have to keep producing this stuff because there's so many people now dependent on it so now we're locked into an industrial system that needs all these inputs and then that has a lot of ecological impacts that you hadn't worked out before and then You' got a deal with them that requires another technology so you get deeper and deeper all the time so AI is the solution to the problem of us already being dependent on a society that we're stuck in and so we just get deeper and deeper and deeper into it um and it's like we have to always convince ourself that what's happening is good we have to have the myth of progress because otherwise we might step back and say Hang on we're completely dependent on this machine yeah and we don't even know where it's going and now as you say it seems to be going somewhere that is not under our control at all yeah yeah but the the problem and this is it's so it's so interesting technology is so fascinating because the issue in some ways is also real like if I I want to give the devil is do as we say right so the AI problem once the cat is out of the bag it's almost impossible to put it back like once the serpent is out it's almost impossible to put it back because because then there's also World competition so if we don't do AI means that we're gonna let China do it of course and we don't want China to be the ones ruling us with their Ai and so it it and it's interesting because that's when you can understand what it means to be dominated by a principality where like no nobody controls us anymore and this is what was great about your entire essays I thought the whole series of machine is that people you know are always saying oh you're a conspiracy theorist because you see these these these things happen in the world like no you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist you don't have to have to have intention at every level of of the the system it's just it's just uh like it's just whether or not people follow their own Advantage once the the the cat is out of the bag then this the the process just lays itself out and you're you become a slave to it and now we're going to ride AI until what well that's the thing isn't it it was so interesting you saw that thing that happened maybe six months or a year ago when all these guys in Silicon Valley came out with a call for a moratorium on AI development right and they were pretty high level people they were the people who were developing this thing and you knew as soon as they did that that that was not going to happen right these are the people developing this stuff they are saying this is dangerous we need to take a step back and you already knew that wasn't going to happen because as you say the cat's out of the bag now and then okay we can stop it but the Chinese won't Etc so it's an arms race um there was a fascinating PE in the New York Times and I can't remember who wrote it I quoted in one of my essays um and the journalist just went and spoke to a lot of these people who were concerned about AI development in Silicon Valley he spoke to the developers who' signed this moratorium and he said if you're concerned about this why are you still why have you been developing these things at all right and they all gave different sort of vague answers and one of them said something fascinating they said he he he said he said when he listened to them all he would sum up what they were saying and they were scared about what's happening but they felt like they had a responsibility to Usher this new form of intelligence into the world right to Usher this new form of intelligence into the world right so he literally summoning a new intelligence into the world through their machines this is a New York Times journalist right he just spoken to these people and he's trying to sum up what they say so you get the impression that the people developing this stuff don't exactly know what's happening either right that that's why there's no there's no conspiracy theory required you don't need six Evil Geniuses in a room with a plan they haven't got a plan they're developing it they they can feel that there's something behind it that they're ushering into the world but they don't even know what that is but they feel like they have to do it it's like it's almost like they're they're addicted it's a very strange very strange thing to to hear people AR to hear people who are making the tech itself say that they're scared of it they don't really know why they're doing it they think we should stop but they can't stop and they're ushering in a new form of intelligence and you think well hang on a minute this is this is a very very strange situation so one one of the ideas that I had as well is that if you think about the revolt against heaven so you think about it like a a structure and you see that structure in hess's cosmogony right theogony where you see the gods castrate the father and then because of that they have to create a tyranny because you know your own children are not going to come and get you because you killed your father and then you have this back and forth where on the one hand the the the one who does the Cast rating first has to tyrannize the the people below like Stalin that's what happened in the the the Soviet Union right like a bunch of we we we we killed the SAR we created a revolution at some point somebody takes control of it and then kills everybody that participated in the revolution that's usually how it works yes just to like clamp down right so you have this this problem but it seems like the Revolutionary thinking itself where we think that we have to take from heaven right this Promethean gesture that we have to take from heaven for ourselves that we're owed this that we we we take it the the sense that I have in this is that secret secretly hidden in that process is the secret knowledge that if I've done it I will be supplanted and therefore there's almost like a weird uh like unconscious desire to be supplanted and we are we actually people unconsciously are creating the thing that will supplant them they know even that they're doing it but it's almost like this is the process this is what we did we took from above and we lifted ourselves up to be the gods and now that's going to happen to us and sometimes consciously that's a thing you hear from people as well you know this is a thing you hear from philosophers of Technology some of them will openly say yes we are creating the species that's going to supplant us and they'll use the argument from Evolution they'll say well this is how evolution works right new species evolve so we're just helping the new species to evolve and we hope it will be kind to us when it evolves and I think that I think that the gamble is that if we can create these new things this new mind this kind of Asimov style over mind then then we can we can hitch a ride on it you know this this will allow us to become immortal this will will put the chips in our brains we can replace our bodies with silicon we can upload our minds all of this stuff so yes we will create a new species but at the same time we will somehow you know we'll merge with it this is the r Curts Curts B Singularity right we merge with the Silicon new species we become part of it we we move to our ultimate Destiny so it's a deeply religious narrative you it really is exactly that yeah it's been there since the beginning I don't know if you were uh I was a science fiction fan when I was younger yeah me too yeah and the the first Star Trek movie that's what basically it was about right it's like they send this they send this technology out into space and then it becomes conscious who cares what the reason the way it becomes conscious but now it wants to return and merge with its maker like it's a it's a it's a theological it's a form of of like a weird form of of theosis kind of inverted form of theosis and that is possibly yeah that's that that might be the fantasy it might be a a deformation of theosis that we're looking at like we're going to create this God and then we'll merge yeah it is that isn't it and it's also that you know if we want to become God which I think we do I think our ultimate aim is to become gods and again this is this is the story of the snake in the garden right that the snake says you don't need to follow God's will you can follow your own will and you can become gods and he literally says that right you can become like Gods knowing good and evil so don't bother with God he's just trying to keep you from your your your own power so become like God so it's the ultimate dream if we want to become like God what does that mean what do God do what God creates that's what God does so if we want to become God we have to create so we have to create life so again there's something almost subconscious there going on that we have to create new life in order to actually be Gods if we're going to really cement our dominance of the planet and our coming dominance of the universe because we're going to colonize that as well because that that I mean that's another aspect of it right we end up colonizing the whole of creation this is all part of the same narrative we're going out into the Stars we're going to we're going to terraform the planets um so it's uh it's in order to become like Gods we have to create we have to create worlds which is what we're going to do when we ter for Mars that's what Ellen musk wants to do and we have to create new life so here we are openly trying to do it but at the same time we have this kind of terrifying sense that the life we're creating isn't under our control you know it's it's already looking like it's going to supplant us so because funnily enough we're not very good at being gods you know we're good at creating but we don't even really know how what we're doing or where it's going to go turns out that being God is quite complicated yeah complicated yeah the fact that we listen to the snake the fact that we you know because ultimately our destiny is to become Gods like that is what God wants for us but not through our own self- willing right not through this taking but rather through through through obviously through submission to the highest principle to to God himself and also self-emptying that's the image of of that's what Christ comes to to reveal to us but then but then because we did it by this grabbing by this grasping by this taking yeah it's interesting because you know you ask because I've asked some of the people that that it's say have ideas about where AI is going to go you know why is it because we do create beings like we have children that's what you know we actually but then they sometimes they'll talk about it like this is our child that we are that we're that we're creating but it's different making and giving birth is not not the same I guess no because because what would you know if you have a child you you I mean you're not really in control right you have the moment of creation and then nothing else is really up to you you have to bring the child up you do your best at that but the being that you've created is not in one sense is created by you but it's part of the same species as you what we're doing now is we're trying to create a new Whole New Order of beings right a whole new so it is like God because God creates beings that are not of nature giving birth to Children is continuation of your own nature now it's like we want to create something and it's something you're given you know you're given this ability to create create to to replace yourself to create new life but it's it's new life in the line that's already been created so and then when I think about um what you were just saying about the difference between the way that we're we're to become Godlike as Christians it's the difference between aligning your will with that of God like you say there's the self- emptying aspect the destruction of the passions emptying of the self-destruction of the will align your will with God's Will and that's how you become Godlike whereas what we're doing is we're saying no we don't want to do any of that we don't want to do the self-emptying we're not doing any we're not doing any asceticism we're not aligning our will with anyone's we're going to align the world's will with ours and since we don't believe in God that's not a problem anymore we just have nature and nature is just fungible and malleable we can take that and we can use that to our own Advantage because we've got the tech to do that now so we take nature which is just a collection of dead matter there's nothing sacred about it and we use that for our own ends and then we create a new species we create new life and then we fulfill our Destiny which is to colonize the universe and become Godlike so it's a it's a it's a it's a religious story it's a theological story you know it's and it's also it's just foreshadowed in so many creation myths it's obviously it's Genesis but it's also stealing fire from the gods it's you know there are so many stories in which humans just their pride overtakes them they try to become gods and then they they fall burning from the heavens and it's such an old story such an old story it's like we're going to get it right this time we're got we got it this time this time we're going to win it's going to be different because it's not like we we it's not like we've totally forgotten all those other stories we you know we we completely know the plan like we've forgotten all our myths and now we think that we're going to do it this time because yeah we we don't believe in myths anymore because we've moved Beyond myth and religion right we're all Richard Dawkins now we've all moved beyond that so we know that was just stories and doesn't apply to us because we've got we've got the internet so it's going to be different although as everybody knows now Richard Dawkins has officially said that he is a a cultural Christian oh he's moving rapidly towards his deathbed conversion we can see it you can see it it's coming it's coming it's hilarious he's on the way all right so I have a I I actually have a very I have a tough question for you like I don't know maybe it's not a tough question you you you'll see and so you know before before your converg in you were you were obviously quite involved in in the environmental movement you you you had dedicated a large part of your life to to that and you know I would say I definitely believe in the the principle of humans tending properly to to the to the creation but I also see that at least modern environmentalism the way it's set up now that it seems to be it seems to be somehow wedged into globalism somehow like that there seems to be some relationship between the desire to set up some type of one government or a global system and and the modern at least the the way the environmental the environmental narrative is set up and so I don't know if you've thought about that if you have if you have thoughts about that relationship yeah yeah no I have a lot I've written about that a fair bit so I mean the the way to see this is environmentalism is it's a little bit like Socialism or something like that it's been swallowed by the machine that's really what's happened so I mean you could look at the trajectory of the left for example say you know a movement which at least originally say where I come from in Britain had a strong workingclass contingent say take something like the labor party for example or the labor movement comes out of the working classes exists to help the poor exist to get working people represented where they weren't represented you know 50 years later it's Tony Blair you know and and he's and he's jetting around the world talking about globalization and the labor movement has been entirely swallowed by globalization it's been as you say by by the the kind of global machine which points you towards the kind of technocratic global state effectively that's where it's going and lots of old socialists have been complaining about that for a long time right and quite rightly so there was a huge controversy in Britain over Tony Blair because he was very obviously a kind of cuckoo in the nest of the labor party and so the left's gone in that direction and the green movement has been swallowed by it as well and that's what's happened if you look at the origins of the green movement they're fairly small CA conservative the likes of EF schumacker or Leopold core or Teddy Goldsmith or a lot of people who came from Britain they were kind of traditionalists really these people it was very much about conservation conservation of nature with conservation of culture um it's about it is about stewardship it is about tending it's also about respecting the rest of life that was the kind of the green movement I grew up in and you know it was always it was always leftist and so was I when I was young anyway but it was also had a sense of a kind of small scale localism about it the green the green environmentalism works when it's localist really yeah and what's happened is that the greens decided or at least the leadership of the greens decided lots of people environmentalism is a very broad church but the kind of mainstream commentators of the greens decided that localism wasn't going to save the planet and we had to go all in on effectively technocracy and what we've got is there's an essay about this in the book actually what I what I would call machine environmentalism in which we say that the way to save the planet which is defined now almost entirely as cutting carbon emissions that's all they're concerned about as if there was nothing else to talk about and that is an issue right and you do need to do that because climate change is real but the way that we're supposed to do it is through yeah Global agreements probably Global governance certainly uh intense Technologies say artificial food the destruction of small scale farming uh giant wind farms all over the mountains Etc so the green movement that used to say that the way out of the environmental problem is localization small scale living um a form of asceticism really Community roots in place Etc that's effec ly been killed by a movement which says that the way forward is is is high-tech machine globalization and if we don't go down that road then the planet's going to die and so that's really that's that's my analysis of it um and I was always part of the old small scale slightly romantic Lite you know just really just saying look the actual problem is the machine yeah the actual problem is the machine so you're going to try and live outside that if you want to live ecologically and there's still a lot of people who do that but the green movement that we see in the newspapers and we see at Davos and that we see in the the the so-called thought leaders of it is entirely machine shaped at this point yeah and and I think that's a tragedy because I think that the the green movement always came into being to to resist that right to resist the machine and it's been almost entirely swallowed by it to such a degree that people are now saying well you know I screw the greens so I want to drive my car around and eat as much beef as possible so it's like almost as if if you don't like environmentalists the the way to deal with it is to you know poison nature to make a point and that's that's a tragedy as well so you what's happened is as well is it's been swallowed by the culture War now right so you got a bunch of people on the right who say well I hate the greens because they're socialists so screw it all I don't believe in climate change and then you got a people on the left people on the left who will say well we have to save the planet from all these fascists so let's let's bring as many new laws and and and and high tech geigor in as possible so it's it's yet another thing that's been swallowed by the by the culture while that's eating the eating Society I think yeah it's been it's been fascinating to watch locally where we are to notice uh a hostility against local farming like an open hostility against for example like past several laws recently where you're not allowed to have like you're not allowed to grow stuff at home like you're not allowed to have even just chickens or whatever like in different different places in Quebec they they're really trying to clamp down on people doing on their own and even even some organic farms have been closed down for reasons that are very suspicious uh that are nearby where we are and you're thinking these are the same people like the same the same governments that are touting you know like how we need to be save the environment and everything but at the same time and so and but then they're also they're opening the biggest bug Factory um in the world is going to be in Ontario here I think it's already open and they and they're making insects they're making protein yeah of course that's that's a great example of exactly what's happening so you know an actual an actual if you wanted this horrible word sustainable that used to be a good radical word and has now been completely ruined if you wanted a society that was actually sustainable right which meant it could be sustained and it was you you would have to be culturally sustainable ecologically sustainable spiritually sustainable and all of those things would go together and so you would have to you know you would have lots and lots of people managing small farms you would have lots of people actually involved in their culture people would want to protect the natural natural world because they actually knew what it was right because they went outside and they knew what grew in the Hedge RS and they actually had connection with nature that's what that's what an ecological society looks like what we've got instead is this top- down system in which everybody's sitting inside looking at screens and eating bugs and living in the Pod and all the rest of it and this is this is allegedly sustainability but it's not it's just been the the entire thing has been hijacked yeah um and it's you here's the other thing as well you can't have an ecologically sustainable society that isn't culturally and E and spiritually sustainable as well it has to be sustain sustaining to our Spirits sustaining to our families sustaining to our cultures and our communities and at towns if it's not those things then all it is is the state and the corporations handing down a ton of things that you have to do and you have to eat and you have to cut down uh and it just becomes a sort of yeah Green Brave New World you know Brave New World with wind farms is what you end up with that's great and so you so you finished the the the essays on the machine uh you know one of the questions I've had and so now you've been writing this for how many you've been doing it for three years how long did well yeah I mean the essays themselves took over two two years and a bit I think and then I've had to edit them down and turn them into a book so it's been kind of in my head for a long time and so my question is as this has been happening like you're working on these essays you're you know you're moving away from from fiction and you you know converted Christianity all these things happened has it changed like have you noticed that your percept or your the way you think about about uh story and about literature about fiction do you feel like it's changed in the past few years as you've been working on this other thing it has changed and it's changed it's changed because I well it's really changed because I've become a Christian uh it changed since I was baptized because really yeah I thought about this so much I mean I was baptized in the River Shannon in January so it was very cold and we sort of my priest just uh he's a he's a he's a force of Nature and he said we're going to baptize you in the river we're going to do it properly because he said if you ever go to mount Athos they're going to ask you if you were baptized properly so we're going to do it properly so so he just he said right we're doing it in the river so he took me out to the River Shannon on this freezing Frosty day and he was standing there try pushing my head under the water and trying he was halfway up up to his waist as well so he he had trouble saying in the name of the so we were both kind of almost on the verge of a heart attack and then we both came out and you know it was it's it it's such a kind of um you know at the time I thought well this is a kind of ceremony it's a symbolic ceremony right I know I'm becoming a Christian here but this is a kind of it's It's a piece of symbolism and it is a piece of symbolism but it actually changes you right it it changes the way you see it physically changes you in some way that you can't put your finger on and what's happened to me is I haven't been able to see the world in the same way and I can't explain that I can't explain that it's not that I've become a Christian and I've decided I have to believe in some things and so now I believe in them and I didn't before it's not a question of that it's like I because of this I've been initiated into this whole cosmological vision of the universe that you talk about so much and and that that kind of symbolism this whole pattern that you're always trying to lay out is inside you you know and it gets introduced to you through baptism and you come out of that and you think God the world looks different you're looking out through the same eyes at a different world so I couldn't write the sort of novels I used to write because I'm not the same person anymore I see the world differently so for me the question is now that I'm like this and this is a process obviously I'm just at the beginning of it what kind of stories would I write if I were to write fiction I don't want to write you know Christian fiction in a some sort of horrible dactic way nobody wants to read Christian fiction including most Christians exactly nobody wants to do that but you know the the stories have to be different in some way because they reflect a different universe and I don't really know what that looks like yet but it's going to look like something different but I want to find out what it looks like I do want to try and do something but I feel like I'm still in a kind of state of transition you know where I have to work out how to write a bit differently now in some way and it doesn't even mean that I'd write about anything that was even necessarily obviously Christian or religious but whatever I did it would feel it would reflect a different world different Universe in some way and so and so have you dabbled like have you have you have you have you jot this is the question this is so it's interesting so so we we we last met in Dublin didn't we last year doing an event together and you started harassing me about how I had to write fiction and and I that was actually very useful I thought this is good happy no it was good because you you were just telling me I had to write stories and you were quite right because the way I the way I seem to work this isn't really a choice it's I as I said earlier I think I bounc between my left brain and my right brain so I've just spent two or three years on these essays which I just had to write because it was all bouncing around in my head and I had to try and understand what the hell was going on but now my left brain is exhausted and I need some creativity and I need some soul and so I've been you know I've been writing these stories on on my substack called which I've called life of the wild Saints which I've quite enjoyed and I've taken I'm trying to tell stories of Aesthetics who lived in the wilderness and I'm taking the taking the original sources and I'm I'm not exactly fictionalizing them I'm trying to stay true to the story but I'm I'm writing them as stories which I've really enjoyed doing and hopefully I'm going to bring that out as the book as well actually so I'm kind of in in on the source of that but that feels like a sort of bridge between between what I was doing before and what I might do next so I've had a few ideas I've had a few ideas for novels you gave me an intriguing idea about writing a novel about the desert fathers actually which I do yeah I still dream that that'll happen that was a good idea your dream come true I've thought about that I've thought about that a lot actually and that's that's I would really quite like to do that it's again it's a question when you're writing fiction it's always a question of the how it's always about the technique you can have the idea but it's it's always the how that's going to make it yeah because the technique has been so important in your writing like you've always you've always the the style even the grammar everything about your writing is related to the purpose of what it is you're doing and so it's like that's why I that's why I kind of dream about what Paul Kings North book on the desert fathers would be like I know there would be some integration like that that it would be fun it would be interesting what I found with fiction and again it wasn't even it wasn't a it wasn't an idea that I sat down with it's the the the form is so connected to the content that you can't separate the two things out and I discover that I was writing the Wake which was my novel said during the Norman Conquest which is famously or infamously written in its own version of Old English which is which was a mad idea that somehow worked but I did it because I just it had to be done that way because this is the language had to reflect the way people would have spoken and when you do that you find that it then creates an entirely different landscape that you couldn't have created in Modern English and all of my books have been like that so the language it's again it's a you can come back to this question of AI and the Machine the language we speak is such an an unthinking reflection of the world that we live in it's so the the the there's been a lot of controversy around you know AI programs being hyper woke for example yeah you know the language that they use because obviously an AI is created by a group of people so whatever their politics or their culture is which is probably completely un they they they didn't probably sit down to try and create a radically left-wing AI program it's just that's just the way they think so that's how it came out and if a different bunch of people created it it would have spoken different language and the language we speak is a completely almost unconscious reflection of the way we see the world yeah and be honest though like I won't give the Gemini people like the the benefit of the doubt because if you've used it you know what it does is it actually takes your prompt it I have I've seen these pictures I've seen reformulates it with de and then it gives you the answer and you can sometimes you could catch the reformulation before it would SP it would it wouldn't surprise me in certain cases I've seen all the pictures of the African kings of medieval England for example yeah but again you know it's it's that's just a that's just a really obvious clumsy manifestation of of of the reflection of the the way that we see the world the way that we speak and once you start paying attention to the language you're using rather than just doing it unconsciously which we mostly do you go I can see how I'm every time I open my mouth I'm creating the world right I mean isn't it interesting that in the beginning there was the word right so we have this translation of logos which is word and Christ is literally a spoken word and he speaks creation so right at the beginning of of of of the Bible again or certainly the beginning of the gospels Gospel of John you've got this this fascinating notion that in the beginning was the word so there's there's a way that you speak reality into existence every time you open your mouth so that's always reflected in fiction if you you know the the language you can't use language unconsciously when you're writing fiction you because every every the way that all your characters speak and the way you represent the world is going to create the world yeah so you know that's that's that's why it would be interesting to try and recreate the world of the desert fathers just to it's such an interesting thing to do to put yourself into the head of I mean I'm fascinated by history I'm a history nerd so I love to love the idea of you know what what would it actually have been like to be in that desert at that time because these people were so different to us right I mean they're human but the way they see the world and the world they've grown up in is so alien it was like that with with the Norman conquest and you try to try to imagine yourself into that world and it just um yeah it's a fascinating process I mean it really kind of I mean I couldn't spell properly for about a year after writing the wake I was just I was just in that world I couldn't I couldn't write in Modern English it took me quite a long time to get back into the into the B of of modern modern English language so that is that's that's hilarious yeah well I think that also artists in general we are more aware of the sacramental power of of language and in some ways like the magic that is in language because we see it right like you said you first of all if you're writing a story you have to create a coherent world for the story to exist in and that happens at different levels but then also you're affecting the world as you put it out there you know how so many stories you know if you think of for example if you think of 1984 and Brave New World for example you know are they on the are they just simple prophecies are they self-fulfilling prophecies to what extent do these fictional or even the science fiction of the you know like n late 19th century and and to what extent does do these stories actually participate in the icted or participate in the process by which he comes about it's it's not clear there's a there's an ambiguity in that in that uh in that yeah I've always been so fascinated by that I've always been so fascinated by that question it's like it's like the people who are creating the technology we use now are looking at some of these things as instruction manuals and it is a question isn't it how much of this is is a prophecy how much of it is created by people who read it and then integrate it consciously subconsciously into themselves and then create the thing that they've created I feel like sometimes like people watch you know Mark Zuckerberg watched The Matrix in 1999 and then but he thought the agents were the good guys that's correct so he he then created the this lovely metaverse which luckily isn't proving very very fashionable but but yeah it's it's it's like there's a there's a a back and forth all the time between the science fiction and and the fact and which came first and are they actually integrated and is that are those novels the really interesting question is are those novels some kind of unconscious picture some kind of unconscious story of something that's unraveling something that's unfilling that people can sense and yeah I think it's akin to prophecy it's not prophecy per se it's not direct it's not like Revelation from God but it there's something of Prophecy in it where we're we're perceiving something that doesn't have form yet and beings that that that let's say embody meaning and and and formulate meaning it's almost like a tuning fork that catches a vibration yeah before before it's fully kind of embodied in the world I think think that's it and in some ways it doesn't matter which side like it doesn't it doesn't matter which side you're on if you portray it as the bad guys or the good guys it it doesn't matter it's just the actual just embodiment of it uh so you could you could be James Cameron and think I'm writing this to stop to stop the AI you know machine but that's not actually what's happening you're you're in a weird way participating in its in it's unfolding and it's unraveling and then you know but you've come up with Skynet but then by the time we have starlink it's like wait what's the difference between Skynet and starlink is that exactly exact same the same word like isn't that the same name yeah yeah no it's exactly that it's the participation in it and it's what's interesting is that you can go right back to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution you can see these novels starting to be written as soon as the dark satanic Mills start up you know and and it's interesting that they're called satanic in Blake's poem as soon as you get these kind of infernal industrial monstrosities beginning across the landscape you start to get novels like Frankenstein and then you start to get novels like Wei and you you know then you're into the 20th century and it's like the novels are always a few Paces ahead of what's happening but like you say they're in they can tune into what's going to on full and it doesn't matter how many warnings you issue you can issue as many warnings As You Like It makes absolutely no difference to the the process of the thing you know nobody ever CH nobody ever stops people don't read the novel and say my God yes we must change direction that no it never happens no because like I said it doesn't matter which how you portray it you're you just have to portray it whether you're against or for it it doesn't matter in some ways it and it's not like we can it's not to blame the artist there's no blame to put because it's not it's not a it's something that's happening it's not like uh I'm not saying we don't we do participate in it but it's not like you could stop it by writing it like a completely story you know in some ways you're just kind of writing this wave that's all you can do as a writer I've discovered in my life from being a young man who thought he could change the whole world through his writing and then being an older man who realizes there's no chance of that at all if you're lucky a few people might read you and it might be helpful and that's that's all you can do and that's all right but yeah it doesn't it doesn't matter in fact it's almost a case to be made that the more of these novels are written the more they accelerate the process you know because it it just normalizes it it normal is the the kind of horror show it's interesting I think that there are like there are some no novels that in some ways give a fuller picture so maybe that's also the way to do it so if you think of of toen for example you know I actually I I I've confessed this before I actually didn't enjoy reading token that much like I I love the story the reading of it was difficult for me yeah it's um whisper it but he's not a great writer actually yeah right I mean he's a fantastic creator yeah exactly he's a wonderful Creator he's a Wonderful World Builder he knows so much he's got so much investment in the in the the the kind of Genius of the world he's created but on in an actual technical level his writing is is just yeah it's and it's laborous to to and it needs it needs editing he needs to someone needs to strip all of the songs sung by Hobbits that go on for three pages out of the you're making enemies on my channel I know I'm going to be I'm going to be cancelled by lots of people but I love talking I love talking he's a genius but I just don't think on in a technical level he could probably just do the bit of a trimming you know but I think what I was going to say is that because in some ways he gives this full epic Vision you know he is in he is portraying the the vision of what's Happening like you know he's he is kind of seeing this kind of technocratic uh world coming to us but he's also bringing us he's also in some ways bringing us out of it he's showing us the the the way that it will resolve itself and so but that might be that might actually have just to do with how much Insight you can you can muster and so for example like the Matrix guys you know you could tell like they're they were they didn't know what they were doing I'm sorry I didn't tell you like they just really didn't know what they were doing they were just catching something and you can tell because they just put all these they just put all these names in there and there's no meaning like to a lot of like the mythological references it's just references for references uh but they caught something like they definitely caught something uh but then how do they resolve it who do you remember in the third movie like Neo gets merged with the one with the source or something but what does that mean who knows well he's kind of he's kind of techno Jesus isn't he I mean he's kind of crucified and then resurrected I can't quite remember something like that yeah he gets joined with the source whatever is and then he then he becomes like maybe he becomes like a hidden God or something but it's like but it's it wasn't particularly insightful like it wasn't as insightful as as you know uh as as Frodo like you know hesitating to destroy the ring and and His Dark Shadow has to basically do it for the wrong reasons like that's a really that's such an insightful it's such an insightful and almost disturbing way to end like the the the the Epic it has a it hooks in you right it kind of hurts but anyways so so so I do think that we can change like what I'm trying to say is that I think that as artists we can participate fully like as fully as possible in giving people also a glimmer of what's possible beyond the the monster yeah I think so yeah because what you what you're doing is I mean talking's a great example again um you put as you say you're painting a full picture you're trying to paint a full picture of what all the forces are yeah so and and and you have to do that in a way that is not that is really true to what nature is so again the end of The Lord of the Rings with they go back to the Shire and actually the Shire has been scoured you know because everybody wants the happy ending and they made they did that in the film of course in the film you go back and everything's nice which is a kind of a nicer ending because they sorted it all out but actually the reality is they go back to the Shire and the Shire is not the same anymore yeah because after what's happened nothing could be the same anymore so that's not hopeless but it does mean that what's happened has gone through the whole world and so there's that kind of refusal to give a simple happy ending tied up in a boat but at the same time it's that kind of you know the the what's happened with the ring can't be undone even though the Ring's been destroyed yeah you know the world has been changed in some way but you can you know you could clean up and you can move on but there's a recognition of what human nature is and what your nature is and the ring is just such a wonderful symbol I mean it's just uh I think I think I saw something recently that somebody had done online that they took all the references to various passages from Lord the Rings where Frodo or Bilbo are effectively addicted to the ring and they just replaced the word ring with the word iPhone and it was really good it was really good um that's that's a bit obvious but it's just the the the the understanding of of that kind of ability to be addicted to something that you know is killing you as well is right at the heart of it yeah so it's it's such a it's such a great like you say it's a universal story but it's a universal story that works because it focuses on really particular small things in ordinary people and it's it's so interesting that you know back in the 80s I read the Lord of the Rings and it's like it was just a fantasy book then and now it's become this this huge symbol of something much bigger in the time that we're in tolken has become so much bigger than he was when he was just a fantasy writer something you know because he put his finger on something a long time ago that's almost manifesting now yeah and there more relevant and people you know as a fantasy it's it's it's one of the stories that people live in quite a bit like they live in a in a way uh they use it as their that as their lenses to look at the world a lot of people see the world through Lord of the Rings it seems it seems that and especially since the movies it it really did you know you know for all the criticism we can level at the movies they really created a kind of subconscious series of images that inhabit oh yeah are really strong yeah they were great they were fantastic everybody wanted to be Aragon you know of course I wanted to be Aragon when I was 16 so this the films just made it worse they just made me realize I would never be Aragon but I enjoyed the fantasy was finally over but they no they were great they were really they're Timeless those those films it's um it's a great example of I mean the the achievement actually of taking those enormously long and complex books and boiling them down that way was very good and it's it's that's another example actually a similar example that you can see how artists sometimes they just they like catch something because I mean what has Peter Jackson made after Lord of the Rings that's been yeah what did he make before yeah no it's very true it's very true I mean I think that's that's almost what we have to it's the kind of best that we can hope for as as creators that we know we just keep doing our work and maybe we'll catch something maybe we'll there will be some Zeitgeist that we're tapping into in a way that we you could never consciously do it you know sat down and decided to do it you would you would never be able to but it's out there and if you if you have your Aerials out you could touch it um so the qu I mean for me the question as a as a writer Some who's written novels is where what are the novelists going to do from now are there even going to be any novelists I don't know are novels going to continue to be written to people even read them I don't know but how stories going to be told because we're you know we're obviously so obviously at the end of a kind of cultural cycle everything's so exhausted everything's being recycled everything's boring everything's political everything's woke and even when it's not woke it's just got nothing to say it feels like such a tired time in the culture but something's got to change something's going to come you know something has to those kinds of periods always lead to some kind of renewal oh yeah so there's going to have to be new forms of writing new writers and they'll be out there now beavering away you know they'll they'll be doing it so the question is what it's what form is it going to take what are the stories going to look like what how are they going to move move Beyond what's been done and yet somehow remain kind of tied into the stream I don't know the answers but that's you know I'm desperate to see the the new stories because I'm so bored I'm so bored you know I'm so bored it's terrible now I mean it's you know there's it's such a lull in the culture almost but it's yeah yeah but it also means that there's a hunger at the same time feel it and and and you know and almost like I'm just tired of eating candy are just they they they they've been oversaturated with just Bland culture and regurgitated over and over and over and so I think people are just are just hungry for something beautiful it's exactly that and and the challenge is going to be tap you tap back into the source the Eternal source that the stories come from and and as ever you have to do that in a way that's going to make people look at things freshly and that will happen people will come and do that like I say I'm sure they're out there now doing it um and for those of us who are kind of a bit seasoned um it's a harder question in a way because we've already written books right so we're kind of stuck in a rut but it's how do we do this I think this in that in that sense it's quite an exciting time because I think the last 10 or 15 years have been a time of cultural Decline and like I say it's just become so dull and it's getting to the point where something's going to explode and that's interesting you know there's there's the stories the stories will hopefully come come roaring out again yeah just how we tell them yeah yeah yeah yeah so we have to keep our how how did you say keep your Aerials out is that how you say yeah it just feels like that it feels like you have you got to have an aerial out there you've got to be paying attention to somehow to the to to what's to what's in The Ether and and you can't almost can't do that consciously as you write it will just come to you but you know the times The Times They are changing and all that and they really are now very fast I it's impossible to predict what the world's going to look like in five years you know which which in a way makes it a hard time to write but it also makes it exciting yeah definitely yeah and in some ways like you said the the the and the fact that the old stories have been twisted and forgotten and you know there's this I always feel like we're in this moment uh in in Lord of the Rings you kind of have this image right it's like there are these old stories that have been forgotten you know this old lineage that has been forgotten it's still there you know Aragorn is there but nobody knows it's like it's all and this this idea of reforging the sword or this idea of Finding the Treasure right because the treasure has been has just it's there in a Dusty Box nobody knows it's there and so there's something about that that's exciting now because we can we can in some ways represent the stories in a manner that will once again be surprising and fresh to people because yeah because they've been forgotten and because also people are hungry and so it is a great I mean in some ways it is a great a time of great opportunity but who's going to who's going to be able to to catch it yeah well it's kind of it's like you you've got to take that reforged sword and then you've got to slash your way through all of the the cultural thickets that have become so over because all the crap yeah because it's like you say people have either forgotten the stories or all the stories have been taken and deliberately inverted right by giant corporations which I know you've done a lot of stuff on and it's always impossible to you know you know that if Disney produces a version of a fairy tale you know exactly what they're going to do right it's going to be yada yada You can predict it without bothering to watch it um but the the alternative to that is not to to to go back and Faithfully reproduce exactly what the brothers Grim did you know that's not an option either right because that's all been done too so so how do you go back to the source of those stories and do something that is neither of those things yeah and again I think people are just if these stories are playing on on deep images and archetypes and things that are unconscious and things that are always real and forms whatever we want to call them which I think they are then people always need them they don't always need them in the same form told in the same way but they're not going to put up forever with boring corporate inversions of the stories making political points you know they actually want the real thing yeah and as I say it doesn't mean going back to the past it means going back to the source and then and then refreshing it it's like you say it's like it's like I've been writing a lot about holy Wells recently it's like you know sometimes you'll go and visit a holy well and it's been neglected and it's clogged up and it's full of leaves and so what do you do you clean it out and then the fresh water comes out again and then you know then then then you're on to something and then you can start drinking it almost feels like we have to go back to the source and and clean it out you know and let it let the water come roaring out again and then see which direction the stream goes in yeah well let's keep let's keep trying let's keep that's something keep keep you busy so there's there we've both got our orders now we've both got our orders all right you know there's a lot of interesting people out there and you know you've spoken to plenty I've met plenty more um I I hear from people all the time who are writing who have ideas who are doing things like you say there's a real hunger you can feel it it's bubbling up so so yeah I hope that in 10 years time things are going to look really different you know this there's there's yeah things are happening I feel like we're on the verge of some sort of explosion hopefully a good one yeah well I really hope that you that you're able to kind of that that you move towards some fic because I I am excited of the idea of a of a kind of diving into some aspect of the weird you know Christian tradition by by Paul Kings North I think it it would be for me it would be very exciting to to to read that so I'm looking forward to seeing what you're gonna GNA pull together at some point well yeah I haven't been able to get this de desert father's idea out of my head since you mentioned it so something something's going on there you've put that in there so I'm going to have to I'm going to have to dig into that it is yeah it's it's inging we'll see we'll see what happens that's now that now that you made it public now you've got it
