and the final piece of advice I love that picture okay it's to look up to the stars and appreciate every single moment you're alive at the mystery of this world at the the beauty of this world again this is my perspective taking with a grain of salt but I advise the forever oscillate between deep profound doubt and self dissatisfaction and the deep gratitude for the moment for just being alive for all the people around you they give you their love with whom you get to share those moments to share the love a poem by Stephen Crane that I especially like in the desert in the desert I saw a creature and naked beastial who's squatting up on the ground held this heart in his hands and ate of it I said is a good friend it is bitter bitter he answered but I like it because it is bitter and because it is my heart so I would say the bitter is the self to satisfaction not to think that's the Restless energy that drives us forward and then enjoying that bitterness and enjoying the moment and enjoying the sweetness that comes from eating your own heart in this poem is is the thing that makes life worthwhile and that is to me happiness so with those so a few pieces of advice I'd like to continue on that on the gratitude and say thank you thank you to my advisor thank you to this University for giving me a helping hand there you go and thank you to my family and all the friends that I've had along the way thank you for their love I appreciate it [Applause]
