ladies and gentlemen I've got bad news and I've got good news the bad news is this is a shocking update about the chess career of Magnus Carlson the good news is this is a shocking update about the career of Magnus Carlson and we all enjoy Magnus content okay like I see the comments I I I I'm reading them Gotham never fails to put Magnus you know up and cominging chess players in his videos listen I make the content we all watch it um Magnus content is always appreciated here on chess because he is the most interesting and dominant chess player and he's currently playing in the European Team Championships which is a team tournament where he plays with Norway because that's the country that he represents uh and he had a shocking start to this event which we will get into in today's video uh also today the last day you can get merch today Monday November 13th last day you can place an order for the G crown or the goatee logo if you don't buy it today you ain't getting it because we want to tally up all the orders and get them out before the holiday season so last day to get merch link is in the description you can watch the video you can go get the merch now if you don't get it today you're not getting the merch cool all right outstanding uh Magnus has played three rounds thus far uh in the tournament and and this is the Highlight game that I'd like to show you his opponent is Valentine dragn from Austria 2589 rated player you might not hear too much about dragn uh because he's not yet Ultra Elite he's not 2700 just yet uh but uh very strong player and um well yeah let's watch him beat Magnus E4 from Valentine and Magnus plays C5 the most confrontational opening there is he wants to play Sicilian Defense we have Knight F3 Knight C6 this is magnus's pet Line This is the line that uh he uh he has played in World Championships against Fabiano Carana that was before you were watching chess but uh that was in 2018 and you can either Play Bishop to B5 or D4 the open Sicilian at which point I'm not really sure what Magnus would have played because he could play Kalashnikov he could play Knight F6 and E5 which is the sveshnikov he could play Knight F6 and E6 which is the Four Knights he could play Knight F6 and D6 which is the classical he could play The Accelerated dragon and he could play the UGA this is not actually called the UGA but I'm calling it The UGA um Bishop to B5 instead is the Rosal liimo more closed of a sicilian and Magnus plays E6 and 97 there are many lines against the Rosal Lio but in general black uh EX the double Pawns in this particular line black actually says you know what I'm going to sabotage my own development very slightly by the way this is a really comfortable hoodie I'm just it's tight on the wrist it's like it's nice I like this I just don't really believe in wearing my own merch outside I feel mildly self-conscious but I but I would wear the goatee one I think the goatee does look quite nice um anyway you sabotage your own development uh but you make sure that you're going to take back like this and so what white does now is white goes here and White's idea is that if black plays A6 you no longer take you go back to F1 well you basically say look stupid look at what you did look at what you did you thought I was going to take so you could take I'm not going to take I'm just going to go back so Rook e one and now Knight D4 so Magnus spends three minutes I have to tell you I have never seen the move Knight D4 in my life ever I've never seen this move um because normally since you did this you're now going to kick out the bishop and then play Knight G6 like this this I have seen you know many times or I have seen D5 or or I've seen G6 Bishop G7 like I have never seen the move Knight D4 in my life and this is kind of magnus's specialty he he makes players make practical decisions in the opening so that they don't necessarily remember what they're doing you see dragna takes on D4 probably knowing it's the best move and now plays C3 clearly white is not spending any time very principled approach trying to trade off that Center Pawn so that if black takes you just go here and I don't even have to go to F1 I could but I could also like maybe come here or here and then play D4 and white is just a little bit better so Magnus uses this moment to kick out the bishop and now brings the other Knight to C6 so that if white plays CD Knight D4 the Knight stands comfortably in the center but instead of that dragn plays B4 so still white has not spent any time he's going to build over here he's going to play Knight A3 Knight C4 Knight A3 Knight C2 I can't draw arrows but that's okay you get the point uh Magnus plays Bishop E7 now we have A4 still drag not spending any time still obviously quite comfortable here ideas of B5 ideas of expanding on the queen side ideas of me taking a sip of my black coffee today's a black coffee kind of day you know you have days like you want a little latte you want a little you know uh nice little a drink you don't want too much caffeine no today is like I this is gas this is gasoline and I need it all right we not we're not an electric car today today I need black coffee so Knight A3 takes takes dragn still clearly in some degree of a comfort zone Bishop F6 Magnus is the one thinking so he attacks the pawn Here and Now white plays this so now the players are more or less on their own black has certain potential weaknesses but he will look to offset them by slowly and and and you know and and progressively moving out of his position plays D6 and uh Queen B3 is chosen by dragn after about 10 minutes of thought puts the queen on B3 very natural follow what will be put the Rook here and White's position is going to play itself I mean he has a very harmonious set of pieces uh he's going to decide very soon what to do with these pawns the Knight is probably going to go to C4 where it attacks this it could also go to E3 and then G4 this bishop patrols a lot and and really this is like White's game to play so he plays Knight C4 and like I said Knight E3 Magnus has what we call a hedgehog setup all right like kind of low and spiky so it's very difficult for white to actually access any square but you know he he will he will access he's going to try to look for something like I said Knight G4 kicks magnus's Bishop out and now c4 very very nice and coordinated decision right se's in control of the diagonal and now Magnus uh takes the bait plays H5 so moving a same side Pawn forcing the Knight to probably get out but it doesn't get out instead Magnus Checkmate is threatened on Magnus Carlson while he is hang while he is uh targeting this Knight and here I am absolutely devastated to report that for the first time in his career Magnus Carlson blunder no he stopped Checkmate uh there there yeah he saw that uh that's that's you know not that okay Magnus is not scile okay he's just 32 which is basically 40 you know the the brain ages faster in your 30s I I'm I'm messing around uh again we're we're we're not at the he fell off you know you got you say you fell off that's like there's no there's no bigger insult in 2023 than you fell off or NPC I mean if you call somebody NPC now that's it I pack it up I you're gone uh H4 though look at this look at this move Pawn to H4 what a move this is an amazing idea by dragnev uh dragnev clearly Gotham subscriber by the way Knight is hanging of course you can retreat but then black will blockade and be very happy uh he doesn't have to do that he could also just expand try to take dark Square control yeah uh great move what's worth as much as a knight a bishop and that is a very nice situation so Magnus takes on H4 dragn plays here and after takes takes uh Magnus grabs a second Pawn he just grabs a second pawn and basically says all right hold on to your hat I mean Rook E3 Queen G4 and dragov is a pawn down he's got Five Pawns Magnus got six of them he's got a lot of Pawns on dark squares counteracting the dark Square Bishop but uh dragov has a what we call a c blanch cart blanch look at this and all of a sudden the best player ever is being attacked massively massively attacked Rook G3 and now dragn is like well how do I plug more pieces into the attack bring the bishop around the bishop is not breaking through that but the bishop might break through over here and also I have F4 ideas you know the move F4 might happen in the future I might find a way to get my second Rook there I might find a way to trade the bishop because when all your pawns are in dark squares means your light squares need to be monitored right look at this bishop E2 look at Rook G6 now dragov moves his King out of the way to bring the Rook oh my what a sneaky way to bring the Rook King H2 Rook H1 and he brings the king back and suddenly magnus's King is on the Run magnus's King going to E7 to try to bundle up for the winter surrounded by his boys but now Queen G3 hits the pawn magnus's queen has to play defense but this is very much this is very much like a tennis match this is very much like a boxing match any one-on-one analogy you want to make I'm trying to break through over here the king is safe in the center but the board has three sides and look at this F4 dragn is taking the fight to Magnus Pawn takes Bishop takes the pawn on D6 looking loosened up rook H5 seizing more squares Queen H4 poking at the pawns and right around here dragn had a winning idea which was Pawn to A5 sneaking in the smallest of inconveniences to loosen up this square and after you sacrifice both pawns you just calmly go win it back Black's position is undipped if he plays Queen C8 he takes his eyes off of G7 if he plays Rook C7 you lose a rook for free and it's not a sacrifice so all of this to say that on the 41st move of the time control dragn finds A5 he finds the Haymaker he finds it at a slightly worse moment and after Knight takes A5 and queen D4 they get the extra bonus time after the 40th move dragn is now down two pawns but he is still bulldozing the attack is breaking through he was winning if he had played A5 earlier who knows if he would have won the game at that point but but he finds the idea a little bit later Magnus on the defense Knight C6 the position is falling apart near magnus's King the G Pawn has collapsed but now he brings reinforcements and my friends Magnus has to sacrifice his Rook for defensive measures but this is not the end of the story watch as Magnus blocks his blocks his King from checks wins a Pawn on C4 loses the pawn near The King and I mean just watch magnus's watch what Magnus has to do to survive this attack he starts giving checks Queen H5 King G1 Queen E3 now he might still be looking for a way to play this for a win in the end game but Magnus Carlson's King travels from E7 to E6 to D5 to a couple of moves later to the D4 square look at this can you imagine the king is being bulldozed like this queen a the king runs all the way to D3 and is safe the king is safe Rook B7 and Magnus Trad the Queens with a check and dragn offers a draw he offers a draw because Rook B6 would have been played hitting both and if you play this then white would have played Rook C6 and there would have been no easy way to protect this pawn bishop D6 and uh if this there's Rook C5 so the the players agree to a draw in this position before any more damage is able to be done but it's likely going to be a draw they could have played like 40 more moves uh what a game I mean look at and and some of you might say hey you said you said he he was beating Magnus yes that was a that was a fake spoiler dragn had Magnus on the ropes he really did I mean in this position if dragn had found this double Pawn sack idea uh we might be looking at at another Magnus loss to a 2500 like this is crazy this has not happened in years and it's exciting to see the the the the the players that are maybe underrated and a bit younger like taking the fight to him but the aura of invincibility is is is slightly is slightly fading you know what I mean and and and that's a wild wild thought I mean I'm enjoying watching these players completely just attack Magnus and I'm watching I'm enjoying seeing Magnus play uh play some of this provocative chest but it it as a fan I'm like oh my God you know it is slightly terrifying look at what he had to do look at the defensive concoction that Magnus had to create with his King his King just stood in the center of the board as drag of just bomb and fire punches now the good news is if a Magnus fan he didn't lose he was close but he didn't lose and he played two other games one against Jas pesak uh I I jurus uh was covered in a tournament uh Tata of Steel I think at the beginning of this year in 2023 he had a rough event um and Magnus did a did a magnesian thing against jurus he played D4 it was a Berlin's uh Berlin Ru Lopez an E4 E5 in a Berlin and the main line here is for white to lose this Pawn but Magnus play D4 which is a big sideline big sideline like hardly ever played uh at the highest level jurus took like this and then tried to kick out magnus's Bishop before taking back the Knight and Magnus said no Queen trade both sides castled and we now play the following position now what again we we have a Magnus Heart Attack by the way this was the first round of the tournament just for the people people are going to be like this is not this game was the second round of the tournament this is how he started the tournament uh and it it's also it's always fun to see how Magnus just beats like a standard very very very good player right Jus is 2600 he's very good uh so let's see how he does it E5 he plays E5 because he wants to Target a weakness that's it he just wants to create a pawn trade that will Target a weakness black says no thanks so Magnus plays Queen G4 targeting the pawn on D6 black could take on E5 but then after it takes it's a fork Rook F7 you kind of don't want to be pinned not to mention you will just straight up lose the pawn so Queen G4 Rook F5 and now Magnus just very simply very straightforward has a little bit of a weakness to work with and has three pawns and three pawns and stockfish evaluates this position as very slightly better for white right cool let's watch queen C4 targets the pawn black defend Knight E4 activating the Knight targeting the bishop and it's not just about one move threats it's about improving the position of the Knight and maybe I'm going to go there maybe I'm going to go here right so so Jus doesn't want that so now Magnus plays a very interesting idea which is A4 A4 does a couple of things number one it stops anything from going to B5 Queen trade or otherwise number two you want to play A5 and then you want to play A6 to soften up that structure number three you want to go Rook A3 you actually have an idea to bring your Rook into the game through the third rank so like if black lays A5 uh White very well could go here I mean it it's a very very reasonable move so A4 is a very interesting multi-purpose move which is why black plays you know Knight D5 trying to centralize now Magnus plays this restricting all of these pieces from that square Queen can't really come in Black stops the plan now C3 limits Rook A3 you're probably not going to do that so now G3 limiting even more squares on that side of the board very slow game black plays H6 kind of a non-committal pawn move you know you think a little bit you got I don't know what to do H6 nothing can go to G5 now maxus plays Bishop D2 because he hasn't developed his Bishop yet Queen B2 is possible but after Rook B1 Queen C2 Rook takes B7 you probably don't want to mess with three isolated Pawn Islands because I'll take and then I'll take and then you'll lose everything so Rook E8 now Magnus goes here just bringing all the pieces you still can't take the pawn on B2 to the point that Magnus says you know what take the pawn on B2 bro and now for reasons I don't fully understand Yura said Magnus Bozo I can take the pawn on B2 big decision big decision calling the the bluff because even though Magnus cannot play Rook to B1 he can go here so now he targets the Queen the Queen's going to move and then this bishop is obviously going to retreat but the the the real story here is like why why did Black there was no need to do this I mean black could have played like like let's say black does nothing you know white might go here and try to play like C4 Bishop E3 but it I mean we we are we are far from something major happening in the game uh but uh Queen B2 now now some now some very major is going to happen in the game so now the threat is something like a bishop C5 leaving the queen to die so for example G6 Bishop C5 Queen's just trapped and uh that was a major thing that uh that needed to be avoided I think black probably should have returned to B6 but instead he does this and Magnus correctly forces more or less a trade of Knight for Bishop and now Magnus has a major advantage uh in this position actually him giving up the bishop opens up things for white it doesn't slow things down normally you would think a bishop is better than a knight and normally a bishop is better than a knight but not in this position I mean that KN was the glue that night was the glue of the black position it's like giving away a very good player on a team right that that was just like a glue player and now it's going to be tough and now we advance on the same side and the idea of advancing on the same side is that the king is still safe and the Knight is going to G5 and when the Knight goes to G5 it's going to pressure E6 which now the Queen pressures because this Knight disappeared so everything Magnus does sort of flows into one another it's a very coordinated thing and jurgus does his best but it's a simultaneous dark squared approach by white A light squared approach by white targeting the light squares while standing on the dark squares very very nice approach Rook F3 now you can't even come back the black Rook was on F5 strong and I I I zigzag you you can't go here because of the pin Rook F7 is a major threat and Rook F looks like it stops me but watch this the second you take your eyes off H7 look your king takes your eyes off H7 not Knight H7 lot of you like one movers but chess is not about one movers ween E4 that's the point it's about this but also Queen H7 so if I come back and defend that's great but the Queen's getting in here and it's not about the Knight it's that the queen is going to do all this damage Queen E4 is a very nice move and yeah juras is just like half a step behind and now he is a full step behind so he's going to lose his pwn E6 with check he's going to lose this Pawn so he just down two pawns and uh Pawn's going to go now juras could play on but he resigns he could play on I mean he could play like Rook E7 and then he could move his Rook to like H7 but it's just a matter of time Knight D6 Rook D1 Magnus will find a way to trade the P he's going to win the game how did Magnus win this game very tense position it was a very tense position and finally juras just decided to relieve it to like make something happen he didn't have to go for this he probably could have just stayed but again it was going to be a slow grinding process of Magnus targeting a pawn a pawn which was a weakness created from the opening like in this position right here juras decided I'm going to trade and Magnus said Pawn to E5 good luck defending this Pawn in the long term I'm going to initiate a pawn trade with you which going to trade off your D pawn and create an isolated Pawn like Magnus could have went like B3 let's say and then after something like E5 we would have had a very different type of structure right or even D5 E5 would have been different at least this would have been all together but by forcing a trade like slowly like this that is what he focused on the whole game and he won a very very nice and clean one uh and then actually earlier today November 13th uh he just finished the game against hivar gretarsson who is one of the best players in Iceland if not the highest rated player in Iceland I'm not exactly sure this one another Spanish not a Berlin D3 kind of an anti anti-open Spanish you don't want black to take this pawn and then this very provocative line Bishop G5 this is a really nice game that Magnus played very instructive game so you should um you should watch it and you should get your merch orders in because the store closes today um H6 and the reason why this is a very kind of provocative and aggressive line is that uh White brings the bishop here and that Bishop is a target so for example if black if uh if if let's say you know the something like this and castles uh black is going to go G5 and then after this black doesn't even have to Castle he can and like let's say white just plays a bunch of lazy moves black can play King G7 and let's say you play like Bishop C2 I'm you're just not doing much then black will play like Rook G8 bring the Knight out H5 like just you know Knight H7 H5 H4 like like there are crazy lines here for black where black will just throw all the pawns forward so this is deliberately he deliber I can't speak deliberately doing this because he knows he's going to get a game out of this G5 and you know he knows like by doing this it's like okay I have a chance to create a provocative position where I can dominate okay and it it doesn't always work all right that game against uh against dragov was crazy like dragov played out of his mind H4 amazing move and now you know Magnus plays Knight F1 so by committing all of his pawns to dark squares I've heard talked about this the light squares are very weak you know if if if a very bad decision by black would be to play this move and then take back with the queen right now the computer still justifies it but I would like to think and the computer justifies it by playing very dynamically but F takes E6 to my eyes looks much safer because you cover your because look if you play Queen E6 again it it it's equal but just from a long-term positional standpoint if black is unable to deal with these weakness white is going to just park the horses there Park them Park them and it's going to be very happy computer is always you know computer's always like it's fine I'll figured out but as you can see Magnus is trying to exploit these and he he's looking to get taken that would be an even worse decision because what will happen then is now you have no Patrol of these squares at least with a pawn or a queen you have some Patrol right then you can go but it's slow so Bishop 2 E6 Knight E3 right and now uh gretarsson says you know what I don't even like where this Knight is I don't like the Knight I'm going to give away my Bishop for the Knight so that your knight can now no longer get to those squares not a terrible decision per se but very committal and as you can see Magnus hasn't done much Magnus played an opening which made his opponent play provocatively and now he's like well if you play provocatively like this but then you don't get anything out of it it's just weaknesses it's like a power puncher in boxing if you burn out all your energy but you don't get a knockout or you don't even hurt your opponent uh now your muscles have lactic acid in them right you can't swing them as much and you're technically not a sound so it's what Magnus is trying to accomplish here and he pulls something off very nicely Knight D2 he's got ideas to transfer the Knight someplace he's trying to utilize this f file Bishop G4 and he's he's looking potentially to attack over on the dark squares now he he doesn't very funny o he plays Knight F3 Knight F3 has a hidden agenda okay F5 is weak why does that matter like why did he even why did he go back in this position what what was the point well the point is that now he can sneak into his opponent's position how how how can this Knight safely land on F5 how I mean I mean you could bribe your opponent not to take you but how are you going to get to F5 well sometimes your opponent's defenses are an illusion in this position Magnus Carlson played Knight to H4 he did not need to bribe this Pawn not to take it was the open f file combined with this pin that would have won him the game if the Knight got taken so now his opponent has to deal with the arrival of the Knight on F5 and now very important you never take to UND double you never take with the pawn here again super seeding Concepts in chess oh no I've got doubled pawns I've got to UND double them no no stop sounding like Stewie Griffin you got to get the rook in there The Rook is pressuring everybody the pawns clog the center they disallow black any any access sueding Concepts the hardest part is in chess is of course realizing when the sueding concepts should be utilized now you may ask yourself why did Magnus not play Knight H4 in this position because there was Knight E4 what what's but what about this then then this would have been taken now the queen would have added a layer there by doing it the way he did it in the game there is no Knight takes C4 because the king is here Knight F5 there's no Bishop there's no Bishop covering you understand there's no Bishop covering by getting the bishop to to zigzag Magnus now gets this POS and now watch as Magnus shows how two Bishops can destroy a position that has two knights Knights love closed positions the fact that both sides here have eight pawns means the position is closed but watch as Magnus slowly methodically opens up the position for his Bishops opens up the position for his Queen and Rooks and utilizes any available empty space to his Advantage we need to light squares Magnus goes for the light squares Magnus brings the Rooks F6 position is Rock Solid on dark squares but here comes a pawn knocking on the door a permanent overloading of the nervous system the Knight comes back Magnus says I will not give you my Rook Bishop C2 ready to advance with pawns when necessary H5 a key a massive decision you permanently prevent yourself from getting in on that side of the board but you're fighting for the light squares Pawn to D4 I'm just advancing I'm advancing and taking your space away Knight to D7 now I go back with my Bishop to patrol the entire diagonal Rook d8 now I Advance again with my Pawn Magnus firing away on all three sides of the board very very instructive stuff F5 black tries to create Havoc he tries to create counterplay but you're opening the position for the Bishops and the queen and the Rooks this is a very dangerous decision which is why the eval went up by nearly 2x black should have just sat there and waited White's arrival and tried to defend himself but he he just couldn't help him now Magnus immediately rips open the center the king comes to play defense now Magnus glues the position shut he's a pawn up he's not letting go Pawn takes B5 Queen takes B5 no Queen trade why cuz we're going to slowly expand we're going to slowly get the queen out now look at this pawn move you know what pawn B3 is trying to do you think we're no Rook rotation we bring the Rook all the way to A2 all right now we play E4 now we play E4 to make sure everything stays protected and we have control of this diagonal with the bishop here comes the bishop we lose this Pawn but by taking this Pawn you proceed to open the position more because now Rook C2 so you took my Pawn but you opened up the position even more for my pieces Bishop D5 knocking hello the knight's got to move the Knight moves Magnus breaks into C7 and it's just too little too late the pieces protecting the king in the castle will slowly be picked off one by one while I go for the weaknesses over there but it's not even about the pawn it's that The Rook cannot be traded because if you try to go after my Rook you'll see what's going to happen Rook C3 played by black Bishop C4 and if you try to take I have Bishop D4 and also I'm hitting the pawn on D6 Bishop D4 I don't even want the Rook because I would have walked into a uh a fork there so Rook C4 Knight C6 and now very calm Rook H7 Magnus goes after this at which point the king will collapse all these pieces unfortunately were not able to defend the king against the infiltration of the Bishops and the Rooks and just a very instructive game about how to take a very slight positional advantage and just hammer at home so the good news is Magnus hasn't fallen off yet but the crazy news is these 2500s are coming at him like never before I mean it is wild how many of these young strong 25 2600 gmms are just going after Magnus and how hard it is to stay consistent with black and um it's one of the reasons he's not the top performing chess player in 20 uh in 2023 it's just not you know he's just not um so I think he's like number two or three he has more wins than he has draws which is ridiculous at top level but he has more losses this year uh and uh well we will continue to cover the tournament uh we will continue to cover um impressive games from the European team championship and um if you're in London I'm coming to London November 16th to 22nd link is
