[Music] what's up guys i'm kbhd here and welcome to september welcome to the ask mcbhd q a series so this is the middle of what i would call hardware season or smartphone season where pretty much everyone is in the midst of getting their stuff announced or released or ready before the holiday season this is always that busy time of year it's keeping us very busy around here but of course we can't leave out the q and a's so i asked you guys what you wanted to know on twitter and these are some of your best questions so what's the coolest shot you've taken with the robot okay so that would easily by far be the shot that we actually took while we were at motorized precision and we did that sort of an orbit intro shot talking to the robot as it was moving around not only did it look really cool but with all the timing and all the words being said and the sinking of the movement of the robot with the words that was actually probably the most ambitious thing that we've done with the robot that being said this is mia say hi and if you've noticed some shots in the past couple videos they've been a little bit more trippy a little more interesting she's why moving on do you think the pixel 3 can get the best score in dxomark without having a zoom lens because the zoom category is important to dxomark yeah i fully do not expect pixel 3 to have a second lens again as we've seen from leaks and i also don't expect it to get the highest dxo score you're 100 right one of the biggest new categories of the dxomark score is the quality of your zoom so if you have an additional lens to do optical zoom you will do better just because of physics in fact i think i saw recently there was a leaked or basically it could easily have been faked but like atop new phones of 2019 dxomark scores and whether it's real or not even though it's probably not those scores are very predictable and line up with pretty much exactly what you'd expect we're expecting a couple more triple camera phones to be coming out soon and uh those will score high on synthetic benchmarks that take advantage of those doesn't necessarily mean it's a better camera though keep that in mind as a youtuber would you rather have one video with a billion views or 1 000 videos with a million each so i guess that adds up to a billion that's actually really interesting as a youtuber obviously the the longevity of a channel having a thousand videos all with a million views would be that would be insane that would be like a career basically then again there are not that many videos with a billion views and pretty much all of them are music videos so there's definitely no tech videos with a billion views there's probably no tech videos with a hundred million views to be honest i think probably since ben gate nothing's gotten anywhere near 100 million views on a tech video so i guess as someone in my position i'd probably be more interested in what kind of tech video could possibly get anywhere near a billion views and i'd love to see that but that's of course a stretch it's 2018 why is apple still sticking with four gigabytes of ram you know this is one of those things that we seem to forget about every year uh specs don't mean that much relative to the way the phone works like pretty much every new flagship coming out has somewhat near identical specs very close if it's a new iphone it has the a12 bionic it has some ram it's got a screen it's got a camera it's got all these things if it's a new android phone it's gonna have snapdragon 845 it's gonna have four six or eight gigs of ram it's gonna have a screen it's gonna have a battery camera etc but every year we kind of get sucked up into comparing the specs of iphones with the specs of android phones this is a really easy mistake to make because it's just a number to a number i see four gigs of ram on one phone and eight gigs of ram on another phone why does apple still have four well with their vertical integration and their optimization and the fact that they control everything in there with their walled garden apple happens to not need eight gigs of ram we saw this with cpu cores before there was all these four cores six core eight core cpus and then there would be new iphone i would have a four core cpu and you'd wonder why is apple lagging behind but when you actually use the phone just because it has four cores and four gigs of ram it's not slow that even reminds me of this iphone 10r everyone's talking about the iphone 10r and the numbers on paper and the the fact that the specs are kind of weak and it has this sub 1080p display and it only has three gigs of ram and all these things are true but the fact is the typical iphone buyer first of all probably couldn't tell you the resolution of their iphone and also probably doesn't care but i just keep seeing this every time a new iphone comes out we latch onto the numbers and it's easy clickbait to just talk about how the numbers don't seem to add up but until you actually use the phone which nobody has even i i've gotten an hour or two with it i made a whole video about it but we haven't really used the phone yet so until we use the phone we should probably reserve judgment about just the numbers and see if it actually seems to work well so in the case of the 720p ish display on the iphone 10r it's really really easy to just say hey it's 2018 720p bad maybe it is but let's get it in hand let's actually see how it looks i can tell you from the couple minutes i spent with it it looked pretty good to me but again we'll have to literally see first it was the ipod then the iphone then the ipad then let's say the apple watch what's next i'm gonna go with air power 100 it's definitely air power i'm loving the new autofocus series thank you i'm glad you enjoyed those videos and the videos were great now what comes next which car is next that is a great question so we started those auto focus videos with the tesla model 3 then we went straight to lamborghini aventador and then we went to acura nsx the common theme with these is that they're all tech centered in some way but as far as what car is next we there's no plan honestly there's no slate of cars lined up there's things that we want to review and that i want to get my hands on and talk about um but it's just kind of playing it by ear maybe porsche will come out with that missionee pretty soon and we'll be able to get our hands on it maybe jaguar will come through with that eye pace maybe something else electric or tech heavy will just show up out of the blue like a faraday future or something like that i don't really know but that's kind of the way the autofocus series works is when it happens we'll kind of pounce on it maybe you have a suggestion maybe there's a car that's out right now that you want to see on autofocus maybe you want to leave that in the comment below let me know oh whatever happened to that bixby speaker are you planning to make a full review yes in fact for those of you who missed it i did on april fool's day as sort of a parody because we had all these smart speakers coming out we have the alexa the google home the homepod what if bixby had a smart speaker and i made this entire joke of a video destroying the concept of a bixby speaker and how lame and horrible that would be hey bixby what do you think of siri and then what do you know at samsung unpacked a couple months later boom bixby speaker it's not called the bixby speaker but it's a smart speaker that only has bixby this i cannot wait to use but it doesn't come out for a couple more months so you know whenever that happens i'll get my hands on it somehow i'll buy it i'll find one samsung probably doesn't want me to have one but i'll get one and i will review it count on it so dunkin donuts recently rebranded to dunkin i did see that what smartphone company do you think needs a rebrand i actually thought about this like i studied business and marketing in college like i didn't think i would be that into brands and brand image and what that does to people i was one of those people who thought like ads don't affect me but brands really do affect you a lot and so changing a brand image or rebranding or even adding a brand can have a massive effect on the way people perceive something like car companies do it all the time like in the us there's a pretty mid-tier pretty budget-friendly car company called hyundai you never buy a hyundai for the luxury it's because it's a good price and it's practical but then the same company wanted to get into making luxury cars and you know if you put a hyundai logo on it they just won't see it the same way as a mercedes or a cadillac they got the name behind it so they started an entirely new brand called genesis they don't have the hyundai logo or name anywhere on any genesis car but they make these nice classy luxury cars now and they have a totally different new brand name they will never associate the two together but that's how you do it so as far as smartphone companies i could take advantage of this the one that came to mind was huawei and maybe even some others because you know huawei in the us especially with the authorities and the headlines and the things that people talk about with huawei it's not going to go well if you try to sell a huawei phone in the us at this point there's just a name that's just not quite lining up with the apples and the samsungs of the world so maybe just maybe you got to start a new sort of new sort of brand name to sort of start over and get a fresh start in the u.s we just saw the pocophone too that's a xiaomi phone it's not called the xiaomi pocophone f1 as much as it's just called the pocophone f1 that's for a reason if you could revive and refresh any piece of tech what would it be and why you could revive and refresh any piece of tech what would it be small phones small phones bring back the small phones the smallest flagship phone you can buy right now is like bigger than all of the biggest flagship phones you could buy eight years ago bring back the small flagships tell the story of your hand and the stitches okay so this is probably new to some people like i did that iphone unboxing video and i guess i haven't shown my hands on camera in a while people are like what what happened to your hand that looks like it hurt what's with the stitches so a couple years ago in college i broke my hand playing ultimate i got a plate and screws in there they're still in there got the stitches eight stitches got them all out that's good then this other scar on my knuckle is also from ultimate from just like running and jumping and when i jumped up my hand hit someone's tooth and then that was pretty deep but that was no stitches and then this other one over here that i had my band-aid on for that supercar video that was just a self-inflicted knife wound way less cool of a story also eight stitches and now that's done too can you reveal the k in mkbhd what it stands for at 7 million subscribers [Music] how about 10. how about 10. if we add a digit i'll tell you how about that all right i'll end it there thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace you
