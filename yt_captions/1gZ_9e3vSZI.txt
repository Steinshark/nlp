[Music] Shami is a company best known for making really slick pretty premium looking products for quite an affordable price and what we have inside this wooden box right now is no different so this is from one more which is a headphone company founded by a heavy investment from Xiaomi using similar values and applying them to the audio market okay so there are a whole bunch of different products in here we've got some strange ones that I wasn't expecting and then we've also got five flagship products which is kind of what we're going to be making this video about there are also a few miscellaneous packages that came with the audio stuff we've got a polo shirt branded with one more logo that's pretty unusual inside this white box there's a DIY headphone stand there's a jumper too kind of looks a little bit like a baseball jacket but nonetheless pretty nice materials and this bear which I guess must be the company's mascot because we've got a tiny keyring version here plus the giant one we pulled out at the beginning the first main product is the triple driver bluetooth in a headphones and this neck band design is currently my go-to I quite like how earphones like this just kind of sit round your neck and you'll pretty much forget you're even wearing them also notice the attention to detail these sketches on the side every single possible ear tip you could want a USB type-c cable for charging as well as a soft leatherette style kass not to mention the instruction manual of course as well as this cute little sticker okay one of the main selling points here is the new L deck compression algorithm which basically allows higher bitrate sound to travel you might have heard of Bluetooth apdex well this has twice the bitrate of even apt X HD and almost every Android phone with Oreo or higher natively supports it you've also got mega fast charging it uses USB type-c and in ten minutes gives you three hours of playtime we've got environmental noise cancellation which uses software and an array of microphones to massively reduce background and it's premium feeling you've got a soft touch flexible headband aerospace grade metal composite any diamond cut bezel okay next up is the spearhead bluetooth VR in-ear headphones so these have the fast charging as well as the environmental noise cancellation of the last pair but with the focus on gaming and this brings a couple of other things with it but first of all inside the box you'll get pretty much the same stuff but the box itself has quite a nice dark red and black theme to it the focus on gaming means that you get real-time 3d audio if there helps you to position at enemies and you guessed it customizable lighting which is quite unusual for in-ear headphones like this if three drivers weren't enough then these are the quad driver in ear headphones and you might be thinking why on earth would you want quad drivers in one pair of earphones well three of them are focused solely on the high and ultra high frequencies and in a sense this is one of the areas of strength here also out of all the products in this video this has got to be my number one favorite in terms of presentation the Box in particular is a real highlight and it also comes with an airplane adapter as well as a clip alongside of course the audio you've got a couple of other benefits with this pair of earphones the 45-degree angle of the head means that once it is in it pretty much locks into place so it doesn't fall out you've got a cable that is constructed with Kevlar fiber on the inside which as you might have guessed means getting in a break in your pocket for some people that in ear form-factor just doesn't work no matter how good the product is so there is something more these are the triple driver over ear headphones the headphones come presented in this hard clamshell case which is cool and all but it's weird that they've actually included a soft case as well inside the box not that I'm complaining of course [Music] for most people this is the more comfortable option and the benefit of having an over air product means you're gonna get more spacious sound it's foldable - and kind of resembles the wheels of a sports car and this headphone has what they call a bass reflex driver which is a more dynamic driver that can deliver more energetic bass this leads to audio that is punchy whilst also feeling light and bouncy okay and almost the product that we've been building up to this is the spearhead VXR it's serious business as you probably guessed this is the heaviest package on the menu and this is not an ordinary headset by any stretch of the imagination there's quite a few unusual features that come with it it uses a 50 millimeter levitating magnetic driver inside before they describe as thundering bass and a surprisingly rare feature these headphones work with pretty much anything they support audio through both USB and the 3.5 millimeter jack so not just your phone but also your PC or console the spearhead VXR uses a tech called waves nx2 not to simulate surround audio but continually adjust the audio as you move your head around as happens in the real world this of course makes virtual reality incredible and you can watch movies with real 7.1 surround sound they also have a fully customizable lighting system a dedicated volume and bass slider and something I personally appreciate a fingerprint resistant coating all right massive thanks to one more for making this video possible I'll add all the links in the description below and also we've got a 10% discount code so yeah thanks a lot watching I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
