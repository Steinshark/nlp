the First full stack HTML web framework does that mean html is officially a programming language or does our server need to be written in CSS that's the question I need answered immediately okay I need to know right now okay I'm going to turn this off as beautiful as this is please go back to this I need the I need nighttime theme I need nighttime theme please please build your entire app with accessible HTML isn't that what reacts does too it just does it really convolutedly get productive enhance ships with everything you need to build a production ready app file based routing database backed apis SSR composable HTML custom elements web components Progressive enhancement what is this next JS but even more incredible no JavaScript required what is this is this supposed to is this a troll unless you want it this website's really good SSR web components build a server rendered custom elements that seamlessly upgrade to interactive web components I love you I really really thank you very much I really but that's the thing is they say no JavaScript no JavaScript required yet look at this yeah look at yeah let yeah look at this atheist Checkmate that looks like JavaScript that looks like JavaScript that looks like JavaScript named with MJS okay I don't want Michael Jackson script in here okay I've never even enjoyed Michael Jackson's script every time I use Michael Jackson script it just completely everything up in my project Progressive by Design uh enhance uh let's see enhance makes it the right way to uh the right let's see oh my goodness enhance makes the right way the easy way start with a version that works everywhere for everyone incrementally upgrade interactive elements okay so okay I'm not gonna lie to you this whole notion I'm I'm very confused by this that people still are doing like the no JavaScript thing haven't we given it up haven't we given it up is this just Astro that's like my first thing I'm thinking of is this just Astro did they just remake Astro is that all this is I don't know hey hey team nice images I like that you used images right here okay nice images they they almost fit together hey you forgot a little something here let hey uh uh uh uh website I can help do you need me to help you do you want me to uh you want me to help you with that um anyway stable forever the web platform has what you need and never goes out of fashion when you uh when you learn enhance your learning development approaches that will last as long as the web does really you think file based routing is going to last forever will it I don't know scoped Dom updates my message extends HTML oh look at this class components let's go class components no need for a full a page a render to update now Ken wheeler is gonna be so happy this is Ken Wheeler's dream it's his wet dream right here always ready for liftoff checkout enhanced welcome to Costco I forgot to turn off the alerts shut up all right let's look at the quick start let's just see what let's just see what it requires all right gonna do a little create latest right here you're gonna get some file based routing you're gonna say hey here's my HTML uh very happy to meet you you got your elements custom element pure functions file based routing about index a pure function that returns an HTML string your function will be uh passed an object containing the HTML rendered function for expanding custom elements okay so it still uses [Applause] foreign [Applause] no no not nope that is awesome you know what's awesome about this is that you don't have to have a build step right like there there is something really awesome about not having a build step okay I like that but what's the problem about not having a build step anybody you are fully fully dependent on how fast this thing runs right like you are bound by the performance of HTML it is doing full string parsing in JavaScript and building objects out of it fully fully erect yeah so I I love this concept because this is a thousand times better than always needing effing transpiling steps but B you're gonna defeat a huge amount of the compiler here right you probably there will probably be a whole slew of uh problems that you can't detect I'm a little skeptical about it but I love the idea okay I'm I'm not gonna lie to you I love the idea but I think that it's going to be uh kind of painful and then we also don't know like what do you what's how's it routing requested I assume it's using fast fastify or something like that either way it's still it's just yet okay so I'm gonna be real here it's yet another JavaScript page-based routing framework do we need another one like who are you competing against are you competing against quick are you competing against htmx or you could like the thing that I love about htmx is that htmx has no requirements on the server none you could write a full stack page-based routing for htmx without like without JavaScript you could just choose the language you want right and so that's there's something about that that's really cool and so that's why I like htmx gonna give it to you versus something like this which is you're still just JavaScript you're always just JavaScript without JavaScript called it you sure did pick you sure did and so what are you trying to solve I always ask this question which is what have you iterated to make something amazing Astro does this Astro does pure JavaScript or I mean pure HTML renders you don't have to you can render on the server with react and then you can go straight out with all the other stuff you could just be HTML on the other side so you're not winning against that story if you need interactivity with say Astro you can Define when to send it down so it already is kind of winning you know what I mean it's kind of winning so it's like what are you doing what are you doing that's different I don't know maybe I need to play with this a little bit more but at the same time Michael Jackson script always rubbed me the wrong way I love the idea though great idea amazing website I just don't know the purpose I am sorry I'm not trying to on your product I'm not trying to be mean to you I really am not I just I don't I don't know what to make of it you know what I mean I don't know what to make of it why would I why would I want to do that you know that's all appreciate you though the name is the HTML again
