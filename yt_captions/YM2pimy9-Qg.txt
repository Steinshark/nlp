- Hello, my friends, I have purchased every Amazon product. Last time I bought every Samsung product. So this time I had to up the stakes, by buying literally everything that has the Amazon logo on it. (upbeat music) I think we've made a very bad mistake. This is, dumb. (upbeat music) That's a lot, the more of these I open, I'm actually starting to have
a little bit of fun right now. Oh, that's exactly what
it says on the box. The cube - [Ken] looks like the All Spark. (laughs) - Oh, this is cool, this is cool. - [Ken] What is it? - You'll see, you'll see, hang on. Tadaa, Baby Yoda, look, its cool right? (soft music) - [Ken] This is the worst. - (laughs) I forgot we bought
this, the Echo Wall Clock. - [Ken] Oh, that's actually,
yeah I like that a lot. - This is actually pretty cool. Oh, excellent, my kid's tablet. I think it's okay, I'm
pretty sure it survived. So when it comes to buying
the Fire TV kid's tablet, the main claim to fame here is that. Not only does it come with this case, which to be fair is a case. So you can't take the
tablet out if you want, but if you're able to break
the tablet with this case, they'll just swap it out for you. And well, I could see why. (upbeat music) I kinda get used to this. (upbeat music) (laughing) I'm sure it'll be fine. (upbeat music) Oh, that was loud. (upbeat music) (car engine revving) It's dirty now. (upbeat music) Oh oh, we broke it. I will not be returning this
for a full refund on Amazon, but just make sure your kids aren't near running vehicles,
and it'll be totally fine. Should probably do that anyway though. Hey Alexa tech best is a YouTuber? (soft music) - [Alexa ] Tech Best is a
YouTuber with 200,000 subscribers, since creating their
channel on July twenty. - Okay, well that, scratch that, you know, feels like I say this a lot, but I really mean it this time. I think we may have
wasted the money on Amazon on this one, nothing against, having Amazon Alexa in the car. - [Ken] It's boring. - Lucky for us, we have many
other exciting Amazon products, that we have already purchased, and now have to find something to do with. So to start out with, we
have the wall of Alexa, or the table of Alexa. (clears throat) Look at that, I guess we now need to create, 24 Amazon accounts. That should be easy, right? You wanna do it? I got, I'm really busy, I gotta like, - [Ken] Are you though? - I gotta, I gotta buy
more of these clearly we don't have an option. - [Ken] This was your idea. - No, but we have other
things though, look see I'm busy, remember when we
broke the Amazon kids tablet. Hey, you guys want to hear it? We're gonna go buy more stuff. Do you want to just do all this? Thanks, cool. All right, so let's go get
some more Amazon stuff guys. (upbeat music) - [Ken] I gotta film Austin so. - [Austine] Ken, Ken, be cool. (upbeat music) Oh yeah, let's get these, - [Ken] How many do they have? - [Austin] They have six, update. - [Ken] So we can get an extra 10 on top of the six that were in the window. - Get 16 of them! - [Ken] What was the total? - $1000, On top of everything
else we've already gotten. This video better do well off than others. (upbeat music) Do they have Pokemon cards here? - [Ken] They do. - Do you know how much money
we just spent on Echo Dots? - [Ken] Oh, cause that's the older ones. - These are $18, these are
less than half the price of what we just bought. We just wasted money on
Amazon via Amazon and target. (soft music) - [Ken] Okay, okay, okay - I'm really sad right now. Hopefully these cheer me up. (soft music) Hello friends, I have
returned with more Echo. - [Matt] What? No, no, no, no. - [Austin] I got just a couple more. - That's fine. - [Man] No worries it's
okay, it's okay, it's okay It's okay, look, look, look,
look, look, look, look. - [Austin] I got some Pokemon cards, okay. This is the most important thing, I'm gonna play some Pokemon card. We were here - [Ken] I got Animal Crossing socks. - [Austin] Just a couple, so there we go. That ought to be, that
should be enough, right? - This is gonna take, let
me show you real quick, what we got here. (laughing) - All of our devices
that we have right now. - [Austin] Hey Alexa,
announce our all the devices. - [Alexa] Announcing - Hey guys, this is Austin. (voice echos) (soft music) - [Ken] You should probably
learn how to use them first. (voice echos) (laughing) - This is good, okay, while
you guys work on Echo stuff, we've got a couple of other things here. So this is my new Fire tablet. I bought this because it was
white and it looked cool. So as we unpeel it and give you that full add some more experience. Oh, look at that. Smells like plastic, oh boy. USB-C? That's the port of the future. We have bezels. - [Matt] Alexa announce - [Alexa] What's the announcement? - [Matt] Kill me. (sound buzzing) (laughing) - That's not gonna get old,
that's not gonna get old. Yoh, while you get old is
my Amazon Fire 10 tablets. - [Ken] Are we still going? (laughing) - Have you ever reviewed tech before? (upbeat music) So while the wall of
Alexis is being built, why don't we go and play a
little bit of twister, shall we? Twister Ultimate, which works with Alexa. - [Matt] You're supposed to
play this with some friends, so you awkwardly touch, places. - I don't wanna awkwardly
touch any of your places. (laughing) That laugh is not making it any better. - [Ken] It's okay that it's twice as big. It's slightly more
socially distance twister. (laughing) - [Matt] Socially distant twister. (laughing) - [Alexa] Left hand red. Left hand blue. Left hand blue . - [Austin} Easy, for Me. - [Alexa} Left hand blue. - [Ken] I'm down - [Alexa] Left foot green. - [Austin] It's no longer
as fun, I don't like this - [Alexa] Left foot yellow. - [Austine] Aaaaah, noooo, - [Matt] I just wanna point out, that technically, Ken already lost. - [Ken] Yeah, because my
knee is on the ground. I was cramping so. - [Austin] I won, yes, oh what will we do without Alexa, ah. Okay, I gotta think
about this for a second. Okay, how do we get all of these, to work together in unison? - [Matt] Hold on, hold on. - [ Austine] It was at - [Alexa] One phone isn't set up for help. (loud music) (upbeat music) - So, why don't we try? Can we connect these to the TV? - [Ken] Theoretically, - [Austine] this came
with the remote right? I hope Ken's TV works.
- Excuse me. - Nothing.
- Okay. Where is a remote, can we
Fire TV on our Fire TV Ken? - [Ken] You can if you - Guys plug our Fire TV into the Fire TV. - If we can turn it on, - It'll fix it, It'll fix it, because we have to Fire TV or Fire TV. And then we'll, Alexa, Fire TV. And there's probably a button
on it, but most important, I wanna a Fire TV in my Fire TV. - [Ken] Don't call it it. (soft music) - Them? What pronoun do they prefer? - [Ken] Tense TV. (laughing) - I'll look into that one? Unable to update your TV. Try disconnecting the power
cable for a few seconds. Then plugging it back in. - [Ken] Can we not? It is kinda crazy to me,
that you have to wait to far more update this
thing in order to use it. - I've already got a Fire TV,
ready to go into my Fire TV, I'm not sure what the problem is here. - [Ken] The other problem, is that this TV has no hard buttons apart
from the power button. So you can't even use it out of the box. - But it has a $31 estimate,
yearly energy costs which is... - [Ken] Not if you can't use it. - Good point, you save a lot of money by not using things. - [Matt] Roughly $31, - $31 a year in fact. Hey, you know, there's a
good side of this though. Now that we have our Fire TV updating, at least we can see the display
is not cracked horribly, like the last time we had
a Fire TV on the channel. - [Matt] Alexa play Despacito. (loud music) - 1945 by volleying for soup. - So what have we learned
today? Well, we've learned that having many many Amazon Echo devices in your life, is of dubious value. So hopefully you'll
subscribe to the channel, because after buying all of
these Amazon Alexa products, the American Express card no longer works. So this is the last video ever gonna make. We can't make any more, no
more tech, no more shenanigans. Thank you very much for watching though. Hopefully you've subscribed,
on the off chance that we were able to make another video at some point in the future. But I think this is it, we've clearly gone out the way we started. With a whimper, not a bang. - [Ken] Oh, I thought you meant poor. - That too.
