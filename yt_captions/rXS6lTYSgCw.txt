In this video, we look at how IBM freed the
software industry. Sit down, my friends. And let me spin you a tale. It is the 1950s and early 1960s, and your
company just got its first computer. Nice, but now what? Well we need some software applications for
that spanking new computer. But how? Well, there were a few ways. First and foremost, your company might go
develop it themselves. In the beginning, computers were rudimentary
and slow. Programming them did not require a particularly
big team. The original programmers on the ENIAC was
a team of six women. The team at IBM that created the FORTRAN programming
language - one of the dominant languages for scientific computing in the 1950s - had just
ten people. For many companies, that was how they got
their software - they made it themselves. But as computer hardware advanced, updating
and porting all that software to new hardware became time-consuming and expensive. Alternative options became necessary. ## Cooperation and Sharing This growing difficulty led to a few new developments
in the software industry - cooperative sharing and libraries. In 1955, IBM announced the IBM 704 computer,
which was capable of executing up to 12,000 floating-point adding operations per second. Quite fast in the day. But the 704 was not compatible with software
written for the previous generation 701. Considering this, several companies in California
- the Rand Corporation, Lockheed Aircraft, and North American Aviation decided to collaborate
on scientific applications software in an organization called "Share". That organization is still around today! In addition, the hardware makers started maintaining
libraries of commonly used programs for certain industries. The most well known was IBM's Consolidated
Functions Ordinary, 1962 - or "62 CFO" - which was for insurance companies. I know, the name is terrible. Designed for the IBM 1401 tape computer, 62
CFO was not a single software but rather a set of applications that processed ordinary
billing and accounting functions on life insurance contracts. IBM made the software available to their regional
insurance customers, who often did not have the resources to make their own software from
scratch. So they took the '62 CFO and adapted it to
their own internal procedures. Soon, that went the other way around - they
changed their procedures to adapt to the software package. Which was what IBM wanted. Sperry Rand had a library of programming tools
for their Univac computer called the Univac Program Distribution Library. Univac people can use it as they wished, but
Sperry made it clear that they did not provide documentation not took responsibility for
the program's functionality. ## The First Software Companies But what about those computer customers in
need of a custom software, but cannot afford an in-house programming team? In the 1950s, several companies were founded
to service this market need. The first widely acknowledged computer software
company was the Computer Usage Company or CUC. They were founded in 1955 by a pair of IBM
programmers who wanted to offer their services to others. Soon thereafter they expanded and took their
company public in 1960. The IPO proceeds were invested into the acquisition
of their own computer. Other companies quickly joined the fray, most
of them 1-2 person shops that sold their services back to their former employers. It didn't take much to start such a company
- just a notepad, a pencil, and some rented time on a computer. Another notable software development company
was Applied Data Research or ADR. Founded by seven programmers from Sperry-Rand
at roughly around the same time as CUC, they eventually became the first "software product"
company - selling software packages like as we know it today. RCA approached them about a flowchart program
for making documentation. ADR quoted them $25,000, which RCA turned
down. ADR eventually took the idea and made AUTOFLOW
- widely seen as the first commercial software package. Another interesting product was their version
control system Librarian. ## Complete Solution Despite the scrappiness of the small software
shops, most customers that didn’t make their own software got it from these IBM libraries
- for free. IBM did not sell their computer hardware directly
to customers like as someone might for a washing machine or a pet bird. Rather, they rented it out on a monthly basis
as part of a complete solution. That complete solution included free access
to learning materials like classes as well as engineering and maintenance services. Moreover, the customer got a team of system
engineers who served as "advisors". The systems engineers needed to do "whatever
it takes" to get the customer to start using the computer. This policy dates back to the punched card
era. If an IBM customer needed someone to plug
in the boards and lay out the reports, then the IBM staffers did that for them. If that meant providing and customizing computer
applications for free, then so be it. Of course, it is not like these expenses vanished
into the ether. IBM considered the cost of these system engineers
and software libraries as part of marketing. The customer paid for it through the bundle. The result was that many potential customers
for standalone software packages expected to get it for free. Like in the case of ADR and the aforementioned
AUTOFLOW, IBM had this free software called IBM Flowcharter, which kind of did the same
thing but with more hassle. This expectation somewhat suppressed ADR sales. ADR founder Martin Goetz grumpily recalls
in a 1985 oral history for the Computer History Museum: > However, the problem was the user wasn't
used to paying for software, he was used to getting it free. And he was also used to having IBM come out
with new software that might meet his needs ... > there was an expectation that IBM, if there
was enough interest or pressure, would provide what they needed ADR and other software companies did do quite
well and the industry was growing. But they succeeded by finding little niches
where IBM did not compete in. And many customers still opted not to buy
that software, but instead wait for IBM to eventually make a version. ## The 360 In 1964, IBM released the System/360, their
new third generation line of computers. It replaced a vast jumble of older second-generation
computers with this single offering. In development since 1961, the 360 was IBM's
most ambitious product yet - the winner of a fierce internal battle between dueling product
teams. At its announcement, the line had a range
of six computers spanning the low to high end. A key feature of the System/360 was its scalability. Each computer was built on top of the same
operating system and had the same standard interface. Customers can write software for any of the
360 computers knowing that it will work for all of them. IBM President Thomas Watson Jr. wanted the
System/360 launch to be its biggest and most well publicized yet. And he succeeded. The System/360 turned IBM into a colossus. In 1966, IBM generated $2.5 billion in rental
income alone. The other big American computer makers - Control
Data Corporation or CDC, General Electric, and Honeywell - generated $500 million combined. ## Tension As it does in capitalist society, success
invited competition. A bit later, RCA released their own line of
computers - the Spectra 70. Importantly, they also claimed that their
70 computers would be compatible with applications programmed for the 360. This was big, if true. Customers can now switch to RCA computers
and still use their System/360 applications. IBM could not charge those guys for that software
unless they also charged their own current customers. And that, in turn, cannot be done unless they
first unbundled the cost of software and hardware. In the end though, the RCA Spectra 70 computers
turned out not to be as compatible with 360 software as RCA claimed that it would. Bullet dodged. ## Should We Unbundle? Despite this, several IBM employees argued
that IBM should move forward with the unbundling anyway. For one thing, they thought that selling software
was a massive opportunity. Furthermore, developing software was starting
to get expensive. By the late 1960s, a third of IBM's R&D costs
was spent on software development. Giving it all away did not seem sustainable. But unbundling would also be a tricky thing
with several unresolved issues. For example, what legal avenues were there
for protecting IBM software from piracy? Patents? Trade secrets? Copyright? Licensing? None of the options were great. The IBM executives were hardware people. They saw everything through the lens of selling
more hardware. That lens made it difficult for them to see
what can be possible with selling software. But they weren't stupid. There was also something else. To be more blunt about it, "bundling" was
how IBM suppressed competition by controlling the prices of their data processing offerings
- adjusting them as necessary to defeat competitors or raise profits. On the surface, it seems like a "flat price",
but as needed, IBM can raise profits with "extra shift" charges that hit whenever the
computer was used for more than a single day or "shift". More shifts, more charges, more profit. Furthermore, most of a customer's costs occur
at the beginning as they get set up. Later that effort declines and IBM collects
substantial profit. They can leverage that profit to fund the
acquisition and onboarding of new customers. If one customer costs more than usual, that
is okay because those losses are subsidized. Any potential new entrant into the data processing
market had to do more than just bring the hardware. They needed to build and offer all of IBM’s
software, maintenance services, and education too. And they need to do it for a price that is
fundamentally uncompetitive because they don't have thousands of massive, profitable customers
already supporting them. Internally, IBM had been looking at the possibility
of unbundling since 1962. Every time, they concluded that unbundling
would hurt the business. One notable 1965 memo reads: > The single combined price for hardware and
whatever degree of service an individual customer may require to achieve a successful installation
always has been one of our greatest competitive advantages > In general, to the extent that IBM unbundles
its prices, the results would be as follows: > The areas of our line susceptible to attack
by competition would be multiplied > The number of hardware and service competitors
would increase. > Loss of business would result from higher
total prices and increased competition In other words, unbundling would raise IBM's
costs and increase competition by pitting their own hardware on an even ground against
that of others. And we can't be having that, right? ## Antitrust Unfortunately, bundling looked suspiciously
like "tie-in" sales. A tie-in sale is when a seller forces a buyer
to also buy a secondary product in addition to the one they really want. If you want to take one, you must take the
other. IBM's competitors had long complained about
marketplace selling practices like bundling to largely no avail. But as early as 1965, IBM knew that the government
would likely declare "bundling" illegal under the Sherman Antitrust Act. But as late as the summer of 1968, IBM executives
still believed that unbundling was a bad idea. Then came rumors that the US Department of
Justice was investigating a possible lawsuit. Based on like, everything we just talked about,
IBM felt that they were unlikely to win. Tired of waiting, in December 1968 one of
their competitors - the Minnesota-based CDC - sued IBM over several market practices that
it said were illegal. That lawsuit would grind for five years. Bundling was one of those bad practices but
another was selling "ghost computers" - like the System/360 Model 92 - in a successful
attempt to block CDC sales. If CDC won on any of these claims, then the
US government had to follow. This rang alarm bells inside the IBM hallways. At the same time, the packaged software industry
had proven the model of selling software. Companies like ADR, CUC, and Hankins - which
sold payroll software - were making millions of dollars and even going public. IBM executives felt that it would not be so
crazy for them to start charging for software as well. So with this in mind, and with the goal of
heading off a DOJ suit forcing them to unbundle their offerings, IBM decided to go and do
it to themselves. In the end, they felt that they had no choice. ## The Announcement On December 6th, 1968, IBM made a vague announcement
that it would "make changes in the way it charged for its data processing equipment". Later on June 23rd, 1969, IBM said that they
would unbundle - which meant pricing their system engineering services, hardware and
software products separately. The new pricing comes into effect in 1970. IBM customers were excited about the new pricing. Rumors claimed that the unbundling would cut
their hardware prices by as much as 25% - now that the software costs were no longer included. But the actual discounts disappointed. IBM basically looked at how many of its 130,000
employees were programmers - which was about 4,000 or 3%. And that turned out to be the size of the
hardware discount. The popular response to all of this was - unsurprisingly
- skeptical. Some complained about now paying for what
they had previously gotten for "free". Others argued that even if IBM was doing this
to satiate the regulators, then all it was doing was making several smaller "submarkets"
for it to dominate. So savvy, they said. ## A Star is Born But internally, IBM didn’t feel that way
at all. They didn’t want to do it and if they felt
they had more time then they would have taken it. Unbundling popularized and accelerated the
market perception that software should be worth something. Over the next few years, the number of software
companies exploded. The explosion was particularly noteworthy
in areas that IBM had once cornered, like insurance. Companies like Cybertek Computer Products
- which employed a member of the original 62 CFO programming team - or Tracor Computing
Corporation sprouted up right after the IBM announcement in 1969, competing for the lucrative
insurance software market. These companies at first started off with
software that extended or complemented the functionality of the venerable '62 CFO - things
that IBM hadn't built because they hadn't been nagged enough yet for it. But before long, these small software companies
were providing entirely new services like underwriting automation. By 1972, an industry survey found 81 vendors
and over 275 software packages. ## Conclusion IBM‘s preemptive move failed. Just a few days before Lyndon Johnson left
office in January 1969, the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit to break up IBM. Take that, Nixon! United States versus IBM was a brutal trial
that involved 860 deposition witnesses, ran 104,400 pages of transcript, and cost somewhere
between $50 to $100 million for both parties. They called it "the antitrust division's Vietnam". And after 13 years, the US Government simply
dropped the lawsuit. Can’t say that was a good look. But look at what it - or rather the threat
of it - did for America’s software industry. As I made clear earlier, the US software industry
was already on the rise when IBM decided to unbundle. No one can say that it created the industry
- considering the successes that were already around at the time. But what smashing the IBM monopoly did do
was to tear off a heavy lid on this growing industry. An industry brimming with energy and ready
to take on the rest of the world. And so it did.
