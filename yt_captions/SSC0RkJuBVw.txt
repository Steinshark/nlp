this is the Apple Vision Pro headset it starts at three and a half thousand dollars it's going to very possibly replace the smartphone one day so how does it work what's good about it what's bad about it and then most importantly why on Earth is Apple doing this so it's a pair of goggles that you wear over your eyes I wouldn't exactly say they make you look cool like these auto tinting sunglasses I'm testing for another video kind of do wow but I think the key thing that Apple's trying to go for here is to make it look seamless they've designed it in a way but even though there is more Tech going on in this headset than literally any other consumer tech product on the market right now that it doesn't feel like a burden so how does it work well the main thing that you're going to be seeing is the screens there's two of them there's one for each of your eyes which you know in the real world each of your eyes sees things from a slightly different angle and that's what gives things a sense of depth this allows them to recreate that same effect but in the digital world so it will feel like you can reach out and touch the things you're seeing which is not completely new but it does seem like one of the most convincing applications of that in large part because of how good the screens are to give you an idea the iPhone screen is already pretty sharp right like you would struggle even if you stare right up close to discern individual pixels on this well the screens on these glasses have can't even make this stuff up 64 times the pixel density of the iPhone that's almost impossible to even visualize but they're doing that because even when your eyes are right up next to these screens they don't want you to ever see an individual pixel so yes this thing is really really expensive but we need to make something very clear that this is not just a pair of movie glasses the kind you've been able to buy already for the last 15 years that you stick on your face and you watch TBR this is Apple fleshing out what's very likely to become the replacement to the smartphone one day a way to watch things yes but also a way to communicate to express yourself and one day be able to use all the apps that you've gotten used to but in a whole new dimension it's the equivalent of not just having like a 6.5 inch screen like I have on my iPhone right now but a screen that at all time can fill your entire vision and if your entire vision is just display then you have basically unlimited room for your apps and so as you can probably imagine to achieve that the hardware also has to be a lot more than just screens on the inside so you'll notice if you look at the bottom this thing is covered in sensors you've got 3D cameras you've got lidar scanners for depth detection and more so the 3D cameras can continue to feed you a 3D view of the room you're in just like your eyes would normally do and then because you've got these depth sensors you can place your apps within these rooms and what I thought was just such a cool touch is that they actually have a presence you'll see them casting a shadow on your desk or if you're watching a movie you will see the glow from the screen spill over into your surroundings don't get me wrong there are some very legitimate concerns about tech like this and I'm getting there but at the same time this has been the wet dream of every developer for the last 30 years and so some part of me is kind of shocked that in one Fell Swoop it's not just here but this well thought out already and then the other thing that you can tell apple is trying to push here is that this is not you losing yourself in your own little world and your own content this is a social experience and for that the inside of a headset is lined with a second set of cameras which kind of feels like the next iteration of how phones right now have a rear set of cameras and a front set of cameras and this has a few implications it can a record your eyes and then use its General understanding of what your face looks like to turn those eye Expressions you make into a full-on photorealistic digital avatar for when you're having FaceTime calls so it will look like your entire face even though it isn't but then also it can project a 3D model of what your eyes are actually doing underneath this headset to the external screen yes the outside is a 3D screen too and yes the image that other people see will change based on the angle that they're looking at you from and this is kind of weird I'm definitely not used to it and it's not something I ever expected a headset to do but it does make you look like a present when you're doing things that are augmented reality where you can see other people in the background it's making it clear to them that you can see them which does at least somewhat address that that kind of uneasiness that you'd get by not actually knowing what someone wearing one of these headsets is looking at and then when you switch to something that's a full screen experience your external screen will Cloud over to again communicate that to the people around you and then the third thing that these internal cameras do assisted by some tiny little infrared sensors is that these are how you control the thing and this moves me on to the things that I really like about the Vision Pro because yeah really it tracks the pupils in your eyes it learns your irises and uses that as the way to authenticate you and automatically unlock itself it knows exactly where you're looking and effectively makes your eyes the cursor to hover over things I was a little nervous that they then make you have to Blink every time you wanted to click something thank God they haven't because that would be a Fast Track ticket to a headache instead you can just use your finger your glasses will know where your fingers are because of these cameras which have a massive field of view and from the moment that I first saw this I thought yes this is the most natural way to interact with a VR or ar headset it's going to make it feel like an extension of you and I'm so glad that you don't have to reach out and hold your hands up like this because that's gimmicky the fact that you can just rest it on a table or your lap and still use it that is going to be the key to it feeling seamless kind of like when we first saw touchscreen phones that didn't need styluses you just interact with your fingers and I mean the rest is history plus you do also get Siri to type things with your voice and you can also link it with your normal Apple keyboards and mice and then you've got the power when I first saw that Apple was making a headset I initially thought oh okay well it's going to require you to have an iPhone and that iPhone is probably going to be the main source of computing power and it'll just stream to the headset which is just where you view it that would have been the simple way to do this but apple is instead very clearly drawing a line that separates this from just being an accessory to the phone this is a brand new product category with a brand new operating system for the first time since they launched the Apple watch nearly 10 years ago and with that it's got its own laptop quality M2 chipset inside of it as well as a dedicated R1 chip that's going to focus on processing the insane amounts of data from the 12 cameras 5 sensors and six mics on the thing and then to keep the whole thing Juiced up got quite a weird solution in that it's an external battery pack that you keep in your pocket and my very first thought was this doesn't feel very Apple it's not the seamless polished perfect solution and the fact that it only lasts like two hours on a charge definitely makes it feel a little bit less bleeding edge but I do think it was the right decision because it allows you to redistribute a large part of the weight and size of the headset which if it's being designed for daily wear is really really important it's still not light by any stretch of the imagination I mean it is made of glass and aluminum mostly but it's not bat B it means that it's completely Standalone and portable having a battery and having your own chip means it doesn't require you to be plugged into a console or a PC it C allows you to quickly swap out batteries instead of needing to actually take the headset off and recharge it although to be sure based on the cost of the headset itself I don't think many people are going to have spare budget to buy extra batteries but D what I think is the most important part of this is that it's allowed them to get the product out sooner if Apple had waited for the day where they could get this much power in this kind of form factor with an integrated battery this Tech might well have been sitting on a shelf for another 10 years but the fact that they are putting out now means not necessarily that now is the time to buy one but that in 10 years time this Tech is going to be in a much better place than if they waited for the first iteration to be perfect it's also going to be a really comfortable way to consume content so I took an 11 hour flight to get here I pre-downloaded some podcasts on my phone but the whole time while doing that I was just thinking this doesn't feel like the ideal way to consume that content whereas The Vision Pro would have an even more immersive screen that even though it's smaller will feel a lot bigger have speakers that fire directly into my ears it'll rest naturally over my eyes so that I don't need to hold it or prop it up to get just the right angle in a way this one product has the best parts of every one of Apple's other products baked into it the connectivity of the iPhone I mean the current Vision Pro does not have a SIM slot in but there's no reason why the Next Generation couldn't the display quality of the five thousand dollar Pro display xdr the computing power of the MacBook not to mention the whole other extra Dimension it's adding and then cameras this is where you really feel the benefit of wearing your Tech in the sense though all of a sudden you don't need to take anything out to take a photo or video it's one button so you can experience a moment while also at the same time resting easy knowing that you're recording that moment in the exact same way that you experienced it in full three dimensions I mean this is a huge deal we've been capturing photos and videos for over the last 50 years in two Dimensions so if this headset or the idea of this headset catches on and becomes mainstream that changes the entire Paradigm of what it means to capture a memory but there are also some things that do concern me for example I find it kind of funny that in the same presentation Apple talked about how it's introducing a feature that encourages you to keep screens further away from your face and then introduce your device to keep screens one inch from your face then there's a next thing which is that there's already very little separation between us and our technology you only have to take your phone out your pockets and your screen Auto turns on and you're blasted by notifications when the device is on your face there's no escaping it and that's also slightly worrying the FaceTime thing also kind of creeped me out so when you first set this headset up you do a full 3D scan of your face and from that point onwards whenever you FaceTime what the other person sees is technically a reconstruction of your face instead of your actual face and at least with the state that it's in right now it does feel uncanny valley kind of weird but the key thing that I don't think any future revision of this headset could ever solve is the potential for isolation I am so incredibly excited that this next era of tech is here but I've never wanted and not wanted a product to exist at the same time as much as I do with this one for the simple fact that I do think this is the start of the end for shared experiences at the end of the Apple event where they were leading up to announcing the price they were like you know if you bought a massive TV and a proper sound system you'd spend like 12K but with this all of those things together are just three and a half thousand but the key thing that was missing from that is that a cinema room is an experience for a family this is an experience for one I mean yeah you could buy four or five for the entire family and then technically watch the same film all at once but what I imagine is a more likely scenario is that everyone's actually just watching their own thing and that core human connection that we've built up ever since we first discovered fire and we've gathered around it will start to fade and that brings me onto the why why is Apple doing this because I mean let's face it this does not feel well timed the AR and VR headset Market shrunk by like 50 last year no one wants the metaverse people don't like the idea of wearing a thing over their head the whole time and at 3 500 this is not going to sell in the quantities that the iPhone did well I think this is an optimistic gamble I think this is Apple having seen the potential of VR and AR having seen that it could potentially allow people to do way more than their current phones can and they're trying to win the market early to be honest I think they've got a pretty good chance Apple has kind of a reputation at this point for moving into product categories not necessarily being the first to enter them but dominating them the iPod became the best-selling MP3 player the iPhone the best-selling smartphone the iPad the best-selling tablet and the Apple watch the best-selling Smartwatch and see Apple has been secretly preparing for this headset for years now they introduced lidar scanners into the iPhone 12 Pro for depth perception in the cameras which as well as benefiting the iPhone has silently been training developers on how to best take advantage of lidar so that this headset doesn't feel like a sudden new developmental challenge for them how they've been focusing really hard on series Voice to Text engine knowing that one day it may well be the primary way to type things how a couple of years ago they announced spatial audio for airpods which tracks the movement of your head and adds the dimension of direction to your sound not that useful for an iPhone but for a headset that's designed around head movements I mean it's pretty clear that's what it's really made for no other company has had an opportunity like this to slowly gradually build up all the separate ingredients of what makes a headset like this and that's what's allowed best to launch is a far more Complete product than anyone else has in their first gen and I honestly don't know what other company is going to be able to compete with it I think apple is fully aware this is not about to replace the iPhone now but it is going to sit at the Pinnacle of Apple's lineup and it's also pretty clear that the ceiling thought this can do is way higher and so if 10 years down the line let's say the iPhone keeps plateauing and this takes Leaps and Bounds and gets Slimmer and lighter and way more powerful I don't think it's unreasonable for the iPhone to start to drift away into being a legacy product one thing is for sure they absolutely need developers to get on board for this thing to pay off this isn't like a watch where you can just build some health apps and some sleep tracking and that covers 90 of use cases this is a platform that could carry us for the next 20 years into the future with applications that are far bigger and more complex than anything we've seen before at the same time of course it's also arguably the hardest Market to break into right now because Apple has to not just make the best products but they also have to change the way that Society uses technology so the purpose this video is not to say you should go out and buy one of these but it's validation the AR and VR are very likely going to be the next chapter in technology and now that this is out there the use cases for it are about to get a lot better very quickly if you enjoyed this video then a sub to the channel would be visionary catch you in the next one
