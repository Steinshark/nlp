windows 11 is here and although microsoft is of course promising the moon as usual there are some changes from windows 10 that you might not be super thrilled about imagine that so here are five features that we think it's a good idea for you to go and tweak right now if you've already installed windows 11. it's impossible not to notice how the icons on the taskbar including the start button are now aligned to the center of the screen maybe microsoft is trying to copy mac os or maybe they just thought it looked prettier but regardless of what the real reason was many folks immediately wondered if they could just put everything back to the left turns out you sure can just open up the settings app and you'll see a personalization and taskbar menu choose that then hit taskbar behaviors and you'll see an option to align everything to the left as god intended our next tip will address another feature that's frustrating for power users the new right-click context menu in windows explorer microsoft tried to simplify it by putting common options like copy paste delete and rename up top as icons but other options such as send to and create shortcut are hidden now so you might want to get the old style menu back if you find yourself missing those unfortunately there's not a simple switch in the settings app for this so you'll need to do a little digging around and you guessed it the registry fortunately it's just a matter of creating a new key in the right spot and tweaking a couple of values we're going to link full instructions for how to do this down in the video description so you can copy and paste the correct values instead of trying to type them out yourself moving on it's not surprising that windows 11 features some icons on the taskbar for microsoft services you may have no interest in using probably the most obvious of these is chat which is a new app that's kind of like microsoft teams except it's geared more towards users than businesses and organizations nice try microsoft but most of your users probably rely much more on a chat app like signal or telegram or whatsapp and simply have no use for microsoft chat so that icon is just wasting space on your taskbar to remove it just go to your settings app go to personalization then taskbar you'll find an options group that lets you show or hide taskbar buttons just disable chat to reclaim that space we'll tell you about our next week right after we thank hetzner cloud for sponsoring this video hessner offers high performance cloud servers for an unmatched price to

list of folders and shortcuts we've been used to since the days of windows 95 with the new start menu relying a lot more on keyword searches and automatically recommended shortcuts based on your usage patterns but you can still pin frequently accessed system folders like downloads and documents to the new start menu if you'd like in your settings app go to personalization then start then folders where you can toggle what you'd like to see on and off unfortunately it looks like the registry tweaks that some people were using to bring back the windows 10 start menu and pre-release builds of windows 11 no longer work bummer but we've saved possibly the most consequential tweak for last disabling virtualization based security or vbs in a nutshell vbs is an advanced security feature that has been documented to slow down performance particularly in gaming and while vbs shouldn't be an issue if you've upgraded from windows 10 it can actually be enabled by default if you do a clean install of windows 11 or if you bought a pc that ships with it fortunately it's pretty easy to turn off if you know what to look for in the settings app go to privacy and security then windows security then device security you should see something that says core isolation details click that then toggle off the switch under memory integrity see what i meant about knowing what to look for restart your computer and vbs should be disabled you can confirm this actually by checking windows as windows's windows system information app what are your pro tips for windows 11 let us know in the
