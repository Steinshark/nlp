ladies and gentlemen welcome back to Tata steel 2024 the first major chess event of the calendar year we've got many many big names playing this is the 10th round out of 13 the tournament is in the final stages and in this round we got a rematch of the World Chess Championship that just concluded in 2023 between Yan pishi and ding Len Yan pishi has been active he has been competing all the time this is ding Len first major event since actually winning that title and then returning home and recovering from all the uh all the potential stress uh that it ca so this is a very big game I will also cover Hans Neeman for you uh I've got some other very big games from this round here we go yanomi opens with Pawn to E4 Knight F3 Knight C6 Bishop to B5 we have a Spanish and dingly ren plays A6 and Knight F6 not playing a Berlin with Knight to F6 straight away but entering the main lines of a Spanish with Bishop A4 and Knight F6 both these guys are very well versed they play on both sides of this opening many many uh on many occasions Castle's Bishop E7 and now Yan takes the first step out of uh like uh Mainline Theory rather than continuing with Rook E1 followed by C3 and D4 uh he plays D3 and uh ding likes to keep this Pawn back and then he likes to play D5 in one go uh D5 in one go as opposed to going D6 is known as the Marshall it is actually an opening that Magnus Carlson plays quite frequently uh but B5 and D6 is now played because nepo committed to this move as opposed to Rook e one C3 H3 Etc now Yan plays C3 ding castles Yan plays A4 striking at the queen side looking to make a little bit of a of of a difficulty there for Ding and now ding plays Bishop D7 after about 4 and a half minutes minutes of thought ding could play many things here Bishop D7 is one of the moves Rook B8 is also possible uh it surrenders control of the a file but many people have played like this and then they try to put the pawn on B4 like this uh that that is definitely a possibility you can prob probably also just play Bishop to B7 so it defends your rook and then you can take back but ding plays Bishop to D7 supporting the pawn a little bit and Yan plays Bishop to A2 spends a a few a few uh a few minutes there slides the bishop back and the major question is why did he do that like why didn't he put his Bishop on C2 to support the center and then go for D4 uh why didn't he play A5 to potentially just kill the tension there and and and and then go with that plan like why is he leaving the door open for ding to do why didn't he play H3 or Bishop B3 or Knight D2 like so many moves look possible in this position but I think it's basically you know Knight A5 comes with a Tempo uh and then maybe black will try to play C5 and and very quickly activate so he plays Bishop A2 kind of baiting ding to take uh and then he's saying like you know you know what I'm actually not afraid of this you have a weak Pawn in the end game lot of subtle intricacies of the Spanish that you and I could live lifetimes and probably not understand now ding plays H6 clearly both guys are on their own many things cross your mind here now Knight A5 doesn't come with a Tempo it would be actually a very bad decision because white would just play B4 and put the Knight back on C6 uh because if you play Knight B7 here with black you should I don't know probably be beaten physically for for Knight B7 uh but uh unless absolutely necessary of course so ding doesn't do anything on the queen side he plays H6 just a waiting move maybe he will use the H7 Square in the future but it's also to prevent Knight to G5 or Bishop to G5 Yan also Waits a waiting game but at some point both guys are going to run out of moves all right now ding plays Rook E8 also a little bit of a waiting move uh he has Rook E8 uh you know he's maybe going to put the bishop back on f8 to support the center and D5 ideas put the bishop there in the future Rook E8 is always a useful move almost always the computer really wants queen B8 for black really wants this queen move I guess to try to get this uh it also wants to utilize the d8 square to reroute some pieces I mean the computer's suggesting some really dank stuff here Rook E8 Bishop E3 instead of that Ding plays here cuz he's a human and not an AI uh the computer still really really really likes Queen B8 but ding does this and basically I guess the idea is to take the eye off of the a file Knight bd2 played by nepo Major idea here will black take or will black play B4 no black is still waiting black black is actually still waiting and now we get a wild move we get G4 now this is insane this is insanity the fact that yanomi just spent 10 minutes on this move tells me one of two things this is either all his prep and he has the best poker face of all time like he's pretending to think but actually this is the idea maybe this is a similar idea from a different part of his prep you know because the thing about these Spanish openings is like maybe you have a position where the bishop was here instead of on A2 and The Rook was there maybe there's a position where the pawn and F7 is in line with the bishop and these pieces are arranged like this so G5 could come with a little bit of a Tempo this is nuts to attack somebody in a Spanish without the necessary preparations of like rookie one I I'm just making moves like here G4 makes a lot of sense because you have back up very quickly to just do this is nuts like if it I I'm hoping that he had some files on this if not this man is the modern you know version of mik tal Su just play G4 and the thing is there's no guarantee this attack even works so ding plays Bishop B6 and trades off Jan's B his Bishop now Yan whiches he could almost play G2 in this position no he takes once activates his Rook dude just keeps going forward he's a mad man what you can't play chest like this evidently you can if your name is Yan ponesi this is Gangster Behavior HG Knight G5 now ding didn't have to take but like if he didn't then it would have gotten take take Yan would have slid his King out of the way and the attack would have continued and then he would have put a knight on F5 and then he would have gotten his Queen out and then this would have been bad news because this bishop is better than that Bishop this Knight is not as good as either of these so HG now ding has to go back the position's still fine but now here comes King H2 and my man is just going to attack on the G file this is crazy I have never seen a modern-day grandmas game in the Spanish with such an early G4 I'm sure games exist like I'm sure Grand Masters could say oh 2019 AA flot open you know board 17 this guy this guy that guy hadn't showered in two days this dude was wearing a red shirt you know like I I'm sure that that's what they could do but I can't do that I I I have never seen in top level chess average rating 2775 for players to play like this ding Strikes Back in the center computer doesn't even bless it which is like crazy I mean they always say attack on the side is best answered with a strike back in the center that looks very good to me but Rook G1 and there's some very nasty intentions Brewing on the G file D4 take take Bishop slides out of danger and now Yan says I do want to trade but I want to trade on my terms so if you take me I'm going to take with the Rook yeah have to take me though because if you don't take me I play F4 once I got two pawns rolling at you the pawns leading the attack is always the best unless there's like a Checkmate but the pawns going into battle first will push the opponent back CU otherwise he's going to lose material so we have Bishop G3 and now Rook takes G3 right and nepo still building his attack now the king unpins that's a that's a tough move to play King G1 uh King G1 and he spent that's why he spent so much time he spent 25 minutes Yan pomi doesn't spend 25 minutes on literally anything except maybe sleep like Yan pomi he moves fast all right he you know King G1 25 minutes is crazy Rook A8 they trade and the attack continues that's a fork now one of those pawns is much different than the other which is why ding defends the one near his king queen B5 is a free Pawn now but there's actually Knight H5 here which probably just draws the game uh the point is if Rook F3 is played then there's Rook A5 which is really really vicious so you got to keep your Rook guarding the Knight and then they would just repeat moves so that's why Yan doesn't take Knight F3 Rook B8 Rook B6 and ding is trying to build up a defense and now Yan plays this move E5 and ding was under pressure for most of this game but now is a very critical moment he plays Knight H5 Rook G4 it's a big decision to make what do you do here apparently you need to put your queen in the center that is the way you have to play and then you have to use your F Pawn they always say don't push pawns where your king is being attacked well sometimes it's time to break those rules F5 lashing out might be the critical idea or even F6 to try to get rid of this Pawn bring the Knight back and despite only one Pawn being the difference between you and your opponent getting uh your opponent just completely destroying you you have to use your F Pawn but instead of that Ding think and plays Rook B8 and he's been a bit off his game this tournament uh and Yan plays Queen C5 and then Knight E4 and the attack regroups the Knight now cannot return to battle the F Pawn now can't move and now Queen D5 is still the last resort but after Queen E6 Rook H4 uh jst just winning Rook D5 on the board Queen A3 the sniper in on the back rang the Knight is hanging you can't stop everything ding goes here Knight fg5 and um he just resigns there's uh he resigns because Queen a queen A8 is a massive threat so Queen E7 Queen A8 uh if you block then there's this uh but the other portion of this is actually the fact that you can sack your Rook so for example if Knight G5 Queen D7 you can sack your rook and then play Knight F6 so seeing that all those threats are coming ding resigns and yanon she gets revenge now make no mistake this revenge is all right you know winning a game in t of Steel is not winning the World Championship but dingly Ren has now lost three games in t of Steel I'm I'm not miscounting that right it's either three or four and he's down to 2760 uh which is wild then Yan poni bounces back I mean trust me if nepo could choose world championship and losing this game versus no world championship and winning this game he choose the world championship but it's a good Revenge game um and it shows you that right now the Throne of Chess is really up for grabs like we have a world champion who is the world champion but we have a a non-or champion who's obviously the best player in the world and we got like 10 guys that are chomping at the bits I mean really this candidates is very exciting and ding's got to find his way back to form I there's really no way you know there's no other way to to slice it but again ding stepped away from the game for like eight months this is what happens you don't do something for eight months when you're a former top five player or top five in anything and that's what's going to happen now Neiman versus munka this is a very interesting matchup this is a uh uh this is a Indian Grandmaster uh Leon mandona who's apparently like his name has Portuguese origin which is what the comment section always tells me uh versus Hans nean uh this is a very weird opening that they play Hans played a very kg setup a lot of Pawns on the third Rank and uh we got into a skirmish early Hans had his patented 30-minute lead on the clock with good pressure on Black's position so Leon tried to force the issue to trade off some material and by the middle game Hans just had a very pleasant Edge and basically it was up to him to try to chop everything down Lon again forced the issue Hans locked the position and now started taking space on the queen side Leon again tried to force the issue but Hans built up a very pleasant Advantage um which he then had to simplify into this type of a position you know maybe earlier in in all of these uh Shenanigans he could have done a slightly better job like maybe around here he could have uh done things slightly differently but overall it you know instead of Queen C2 like I think Queen C1 and if black had done this then there would have been slight differences and maybe you could have tried to go here if Knight takes D4 Rook D4 Knight E6 Rook D5 Knight C5 at least the queen could have been utilized till I go to the E3 Square to try to then play E5 Etc but Hans put his Queen on C2 instead of C1 and that's the way chess works sometimes you put a queen on a square and uh now you're just going to have equality and make when I tell you that you're about to have equality I am not exaggerating this game went on 70 more moves and the thing is that black just has a dark Square blockade that that that's that's what black has now if you do the math you may realize that Hans demon is is uh is up a pawn you may Wonder when that happened well it happened here Leon gave away a pawn and then won it back but at the cost of losing one of his own that that it it does not look like White's position is a pawn up but it is and it's that pawn but how do you get rid of the blockade well Hans is going to start there we go there there it is now if Hans get rid of this blockade and and and and open up Black's position he is going to be winning he's trying his best but Lon is defending himself Queen D4 all right now Hans walks the king back I mean you should have some winning opportunity but this a really tough position Queen C5 White's King is a little too open we have now crossed 60 moves and now we go to an endgame because Leon correctly trades and the the drawing chances now are astronomical because despite being a full Pawn down he has a total defensive Fortress and this goes on for a very long time Hans King gets extra cardio runs around the board runs around the board runs around the board run and then he has to give up a pawn to get a pawn but this is just a draw you are not going to win and this game goes 112 moves and Hans Neeman unable to break through menona who lowkey is having an excellent event I will tell you about that later I got more decisive games coming for you uh the tragic story of Max varram in the last two rounds has been really a sight to behold he probably should have had one and a half out of two uh but while playing uh while playing a Gambit with black instead of that he has zero he lost both to gukesh and param and in this game no AB satov smell blood remember abdulov is winning the tournament he is tied for first and he God bless him plays a Queen's Gambit accepted line that I love to play I love this bishop G4 line it is terrible terrible but the surprise value of it is very good the thing is if white knows you're going to play this line in a classical game he will prepare it but as you see from the time span Max vadam you know he plays in uh by the way that I am saying that right right it's not warmer Dam not warmer damn it's warmer here damn like I've been saying vam and then I've been seeing comments like why is he pronouncing it with a V it's a w and I don't know if the people writing that are Dutch or American because listen we Americans we don't know any I mean God God bless an American trying to say nbe's name you know what I mean um so I'm I am just curious anyway as you can see from the opening Max is down 21 minutes it's not that he didn't know how to play the opening it's that he didn't remember The Cutting Edge way to get an advantage and The Cutting Edge way to get an edge might be to go here right because black is surrendering the center so castles H3 Bishop E3 like this might be the way to get the biggest Advantage which is three cuz chess sucks but instead of that Max does it his own way right he plays H3 now he's down 34 minutes on the clock but noirre has to try to play this for a win how's he going to do that he's going to try to keep as many pieces on the board as possible and now he's going to try to create very microscopic weaknesses in his position to try to get some Dynamic play going it's a very very tense struggle and uh one guy is down 40 minutes and that guy is is right now suffering in the tournament so NRE builds up this massive wall of Pawns right only one Pawn has been traded literally they both have all their pieces on the board it's a very tense fight at some point one guy is going to have to break through and as you see nck begins attacking on the queen on the king side he gets his Queen there and just too much much hesitation for Max who has 19 minutes to make 18 moves to get to the time control Nock smells blood puts his Knight on B4 F4 and oh my goodness oh my goodness too many pins too much pressure white plays Pawn takes F4 and now noj plays Knight D3 and White's going to have to lose material he's going to have to lose something he moves his Rook he gives up the bishop the Knight is stuck but Queen D2 but NOC saw all of that so he he gets out with his Knight Pawn takes A4 Bishop B4 in between move to get the Rook back now G4 for Max feram trapping the bishop but he sacrifices his Knight and when the dust settles a couple moves later Nock has four 1 two 3 four five six he has two extra pawns and he has a rook so it's rook and two pawns for two knights but somehow white is okay I mean White's got a lot of pieces 1 2 3 four five pieces and Black's pawns are a little slow now what should NRE back have done differently apparently B4 put a knight on D5 and then try to play that position like continue to bait G4 out of your opponent this Knight is hanging but the Rook is hanging and if white takes then uh here's a nice little way to get your queen stuck on A1 that' be really really nice right so but when it when what happens in the game is uh whoops what happens in the game is black is actually not much better Bishop C2 and not only is black not much better nck continues to try to attack Max who completely shuts down the position black can't move any pawns and before you know it despite having almost no time he makes the 40th move Max fadam is winning he's winning he's going to take the pawn he's going to make a queen oh my God what a comeback this is massive he's about to take down the leader of the tournament Rook F6 and now in instead of grabbing this Pawn he had to go Knight C7 idea being he escorts the pawn to the promotion he completely leaves this Pawn it's kind of hard to do cuz Rook D4 I mean little hard to do CU it looks like you're going to get mated but the pawn gets to A7 and it can't be stopped Rook E1 Queen E1 Rook d8 A8 Queen take take I don't know how you're going to lose this with white I mean you might not win cuz black has a very powerful Pawn but you can't lose Queen E2 B2 Bishop E4 stop the pawn it's crazy but but instead of that Max says you know what I'm I'm not I'm going to grab the pawn Rook F4 Queen D1 Rook D4 the position's back in the balance Knight D3 Rook f8 Rook E3 he's got to defend himself but nck just gets the pawn back and and the reason he got the pawn back cuz this was a fork so now Norbeck got the pawn he's up three pawns he's got a rook and three pawns for two pieces now two pawns but White's King is so open could Max survive this he was better for a moment he was he was worse for a moment now it's equal but it's oh God I mean this is this is this doesn't feel equal I mean wh's King is getting mercilessly hunted around the board but he grabs a pawn and now he's only down one Pawn the king is safe Bishop H3 uh-oh uhoh Rook F1 King C2 uhoh Queen G6 White's position feeling a little loose Max runs his King but oh Bishop C4 he had to play Queen D5 maybe he plays Bishop C4 with 3 seconds on the clock the last chance to survive there might have been something like Queen D5 or even King C3 I can't even begin to explain why but he he does it this way and and now he can't go to C2 because Rook F2 Knight F2 Queen F2 wins The Rook so he goes out with the King and and now the king is hunted and it's over because of this the king ultimately gets stranded on an island nobody can come help Queen C4 Rook B1 check and the game is over your king is forced to the a file where you are unfortunately met with a variety of different checkmates and Max fought and fought and fought but the tournament leader grows his lead and listen nobe is a fighter he is always there to fight and I have more decisive games for you Max radam does not I mean 0 and three there is is wild dko coming off a big win versus fuja versus gukesh who's also in first place Bishop D3 D5 take take we have a main line and a Queen's Gambit decline structure where uh danchenko just comes to fight I mean he does not spend any time play look at how many moves he's played he hasn't even thought all right Knight B6 G4 on the board we're looking for an attack here lukash plays Knight C4 clearly the opening battle has been won by donchenko who takes the Knight seizes the entire control of the center and is ready to keep going apparently that was a bad move by the way apparently the tension needed to be kept and he should have castled but watch as my man danchenko plays D5 and gatch does his best impression here of a judo expert utilizing all of his opponent forward momentum against them you know in wrestling that that that's a little bit of a thing but you know in fighting like sometimes you you just pour it on your opponent I'm not saying any of you have been in a fist fight I was only ever in one physical altercation um and it was like when I was like 11 so I I I can't say I have experienced fighting as a fully grown adult um I actually lost it's kind of embarrassing it's kind of embarrassing story I was I'm going to tell it to you in about 30 seconds I I was I was like hanging out in the neighborhood you know this was uh in the in the suburbs which I you know was a dark part of my life and um there was a little kid he was very annoying and there was me and I was a lot taller than this you know little little guy uh and uh he tried to get in a fight so he grabbed my shirt right he started pulling on my shirt my shirt started ripping and I thought it was unfair fair if I fought this cuz I'm like a lot bigger and I was a good kid I was raised by you know I was raised in a in a nice respectable household not you know not I wasn't taught to beat up people who I'm bigger than so I kind of try to subdue him so I try to like sit on him which is a a tactic you know you have younger siblings you sit on them because and then they can't move so I kind of try to like wrestle him down and just not let him and while I was wrestling down he punched me in the face so the only time in my life I've been punched in the face I was punched in the face by like a 9-year-old kid when I was like 11 or 10 years old just punched me I was like where did a 9-year-old even learn that that was an action you can do to a human got to be a rough household uh but yeah he got me real good and um remember I went home and I really didn't like that my teeth hit my lip and I that didn't feel good that was the day I realized that I'm going to be a chess YouTuber and not a fighter so there you go that that that's that's my story uh anyway the analogy that I was going to make for this game is that some people pour on the pressure and some people take their opponent's forward momentum like in Judo and then you you know you you land a flip and watch as Denko walks down gkes with all his pawns like the this really looks like a bullet game this man does not stop making pawn moves while gash puts all his pieces on the back rank I mean I'm not even exaggerating by the way right and says come get me hey he's like all right I will I will come get you and I mean it's a moment away from mate it's literally plays G6 and now there's this big moment like what next cuz it's re cuz I got news for you black is coming as well with B4 so Rook D1 he gets his King to F2 and gukesh says I only have to move one Pawn you did all of that stuff but I only got to move one Pawn Knight E4 and he's just moves one piece off the back Rank and White's entire attack falls apart Knight to G3 and gesh a cultured man God bless him sacrifices The Rook Knight E4 and now white can't move white can't move all of this is on the way Knight F6 check and this is I'm going to lose my queen so right so I'm going to L so sack the queen first to take yours back E4 we come in with a check and gesh oh oh brutal Bishop takes before a counter sacrifice we trade everything gash a principled man go straight for the end game when it's all said and done black is up a pawn and he has the bishop and the Knight for The Rook so he's up two points of material and um it's a clean he doesn't make a draw plays F5 you can take on pant but the king is coming and uh black just locks everything down kicks out the white king there is absolutely no way to capture anything maybe here gach could have been a little bit more accurate he could have you know he could have played like King D5 for example King here um and gkes is going to convert this it with a with a slight headache whoa who whoa whoa whoa what is so The Rook is in jail now which is kind of hilarious you can go to G7 to sack your rook and now black can't really move because he's got to go Knight H6 but it but it's winning it it is winning and uh he get one Pawn survives but it's the only Pawn that he needs uh because uh he goes King F5 and it's just enough distance between these Pawns that you you win King G3 Knight F4 and uh he resigned because you would win this by going B6 throwing in a check and getting the Knight back to stop the pawn and some of you might still be confused why this is a win it's a win because under traditional circumstances this is a draw right under traditional circumstances th this this is a draw well black would not go here black would go here and now yeah that's what would happen so gukesh wins too he's also winning the tournament and the last game that I have for you this is Elena robers versus marrea maritti and um Elena is uh the last couple of rounds she has been like a heavyweight boxer she is coming to entertain Mar Andrea man after my own heart plays Carl con plays E6 playing the Gotham course by the way although I recommend Knight C6 and E6 both and uh he plays my line I love this line I I I don't like to put the bishop on B6 I like to put it on E7 I like it so much I'm going to look at it from from his perspective and now what you do with white is you with black is you play Knight D7 F6 Knight H6 Knight F7 you also play A5 to induce the pawn to come forward just watch and learn nerds F6 played you'll notice that Elena is spending a little bit of time A5 it's exactly what I do Knight D7 Knight H6 perfect and now she plays the best way I mean she's playing in kind of like The Cutting Edge style trying to attack the black structure castles Knight bd2 Fe the position opens up and now he plays Bishop F6 we have this moment of tension I mean if black plays all the moves of theory black is just going to be equal because that's chess and chess sucks and he plays Queen C7 has some good pressure on the white position but white is doing fine however if white for a moment underestimates the black position and plays something like Knight F7 when the dust clears black is going to be very happy because white never castled so he does not go for the Knight he goes for the bishop and now Queen E4 check and she's got to move her King and yeah that's I mean this guy has been like a shark in the water he literally needs just a a BRI brief moment of weakness from the opponent you can't take the queen because of the pin she tries to trade he goes to the other side Elena takes the pawn bishop D5 and I mean he he's already looking for for various attacks on the king white goes here uh Queen takes B5 check Queen goes back H4 and H4 is the mistake apparently white has to put the King on G3 I guess that stops Queen H4 she decides to move the pawn that allows black enough time to create counterplay on the B file and it goes from bad to worse as he plays Rook B3 as he plays Queen F4 and Rook B2 check is game over because uh Queen comes here and there is no easy way to stop all the threats Queen G1 Queen D2 and the threat in this position is very brutal the threat is this it's protected but the Knight would stop guarding that you go here white is forced to Checkmate themselves marre maritti now has seven and a half points dude is winning the entire section with seven and a half out of 10 that's Insanity that is insanity he he's he's completely destroying everybody I mean it's it it's it's it's unbelievable and uh Leon is in second so the person that I just showed you and in the m in the in the open it's gkes Norbeck up with six and a half alira Drew Anish giri today so Anish uh was under pressure quite quite a lot that game but he defended and uh kind of shocking the second uh highest rated Dutch player Jordan van forest in last which is a shock meanwhile Jan Jud and dingler ran tied with four uh uh tomorrow is a rest day we have a couple more uh matches to go and then we will Crown a winner get out of here
