the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the biggest iPhone camera Improvement that I can remember Apple's doubled the resolution of its photos improved both the night mode and the portrait mode all while addressing two of their biggest weaknesses they've upgraded their optical zoom camera from 3x Zoom to 5x zoom and increased dynamic range the ability to make sure that everything is correctly exposed in an image but then it's very easy to say well this iPhone is better than the last iphone the best way to actually gauge that progress is to see if it can actually beat the competition so I've taken and analyzed over 500 photos and videos across both the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra which is the most popular alternative and the one that you guys are voted for as the camera to beat and Within These 10 categories each getting more important as we go I think we finally have an overall winner starting with the front cameras which is probably the area that the iPhone has least improved on over the years but still one thing that you do notice is this newfound focus on skin tones it's one of those things that you don't fully appreciate until you see the side by sides where the Samsung shot in isolation looks right-ish but then you see the iPhone you realize oh yeah my shirt was that color and yeah the boat was like that and of course my hair is black for now but then at the same time I do think the iPhone is severely in need of a hardware upgrade Samsung has invested a lot into their selfie camera and you can tell you get more natural background blur in the images and quite often some extra sharpness too plus I also think Samsung just takes more flattering photos across all cameras which is not necessarily what you want let's say I'm taking a photo of you and you're that far away from me but a selfie if you think about it is a very intimate photo if you're very up close with your phone and so I think for those shots most people would prefer the subtle brightening and smoothing that Samsung does to make you look good because the iPhone really does expose your flaws but if you have any dreams of vlogging then the iPhone does take it in terms of video on the selfie camera not because the Samsung's bad it's actually improved a lot in the last few Generations but it's just the iPhone High dynamic range is a little bit better and it's also just much more resistant to grain I think if you get into really dark areas something can get very grainy very quick please now one of the new things quite literally on the table for the iPhone 15 Pro Max is zoom this is the first iPhone that I would actually say is a good option for trying to shoot the moon or take out to a concert I was actually scrambling to get some tickets to go and see Rick Astley live and test that theory but since I couldn't I decided to make Rick Astley [Music] this is our simulation of a concert and what that would look like on both phones and see Zoom is a complicated one because both of these phones go about zoom in a very different way the iPhone has a single five times optical zoom lens the Samsung has both a three times and a 10 times optimal zoom lens and so you end up in this very funny situation in which both look very similar at one time Samsung looks better between three times and five times in that middle ground after Samsung's first optical zoom is activated but before Apple tells then as you hit 5x apple looks better with not just more detail but in a lot of cases more background blur too because it is a good quality 5x lens and then as you get to 10x Samsung takes over again but it's close this time Samsung's definitely not twice as good as like the magnification number might suggest but here's the thing as soon as you switch over to video the iPhone wins at every single magnification even those points where Samsung technically has the edge in terms of his Hardware it's a product of the fact that this iPhone is the best iPhone for video ever with the fact that Samsung phones in particular are quite sensitive to grain there are times where it will shoot better zoomed content it's just that a lot of things have to go its way for that to be the case more often than not with Max Zoom photos Samsung is better but it's not always the case sometimes it's ambiguous and sometimes the iPhone takes it since its zoom camera has a much wider aperture that lets in more light so on balance I think applezone themselves a draw in Zoom for the first time in a long time something I think is often underappreciated but still very important to the overall camera experience is the camera apps so who does it better well I've always found Samsung's camera to be more fun it's historically been well ahead in terms of just the number of things you can do with it versus the iPhone and that's still kind of the case you still got food mode which makes your food look richer and tastier and single take which is this idea of taking one 10 second clip and getting a whole load of different shot options out of it but I do want to caveat that by saying that from the fun perspective I don't think Samsung has kept up with other Android manufacturers who've come up with so many interesting experimental options and then from the Practical perspective it's starting to feel a little dated versus the iPhone one because of the shutter lag it takes not as long as it used to but still noticeably longer than the iPhone 2 capture almost like it's having a little think about it every time you can on the Samsung also install this separate app called camera assistant which has an option to boost shutter speed but I don't use it because it does come at the cost of quality the transition between lenses still feels clunky in that it's not immediate and does also introduce noticeable slowdown which feels like it's on full show in this comparison because of how smooth those transitions now are on the iPhone 15 and then also while Samsung does have a lot of modes which on their own are all individually cool I do think that the feature of the smartphone camera is more integration like less you're having to think oh this is food let me navigate to Food modes and more just your phone knowing that and doing it for you and also the Samsung is a very two-handed camera experience because all the controls are at the top it's just not simple to change them all with the same hand that's about to take the photo now the iPhone is not a perfect experience either it could also do with an injection of creativity Plus in the pursuit of trying to tuck every single eyesore away and only trying to show you what you need to see at any one time you will spend a lot of time gesturing to adjust things and sometimes those gestures can overlap with each other it can feel fiddly but on balance between the two I do prefer using the camera app on the 15 Pro Max the new iPhone does also have this new action button which can get into the camera quickly and gets shooting straight away but assuming that you're using your phone for normal photos in an upright position it's not really any faster than Samsung's double tap and then using the volume down to actually take the photo so we can pretty much just disregard that okay we're pretty even in terms of score so far but moving up in terms of the order of importance let's talk about audio so right now you're listening to me on the iPhone I'm in a pretty quiet space and you can absolutely tell now shifting over to the Samsung again it just sounds really good both of these phones are very well equipped to pick up good sound from all directions it only has the level of background noise increases that's when they start to diverge so right now you're listening on the iPhone and let's probably tell very little is filtered out like you're very much hearing the background noise but the upside of that is that it's not interfering with the quality of my voice there's still that sort of natural richness to it with the Samsung though the background noise is way reduced it's just that in the process of trying to chop out the background noise you also lose a lot of the lower tones within your voice so a little bit of the fullness is gone but there's no real right or wrong here there's just two different ways of doing things okay I love portrait mode anytime taking a shot that I feel like I'm going to want to print out or post somewhere it just feels right to use it since it's a one-click way of doubling the production value of a shot and with the iPhone 15 Pro Max Apple has introduced both two massive perks and one massive contabus the con is that the three times optical zoom lens that we used to have and the three-time zoom lens that Samsung still has is I would say the best balance between being a flattering angle I.E keeping you far enough away from the subject that the shot doesn't look like it has a fisheye effect on it but close enough that you're not having to leave the chair you're sitting in just to take it and if we left it there Samsung would be a bit of a no-brainer something portraits are Punchy in a nice way the edge detection is really strong and that 3x lens is just convenient but then there's those important perks that this new iPhone has one that you now don't need to specifically go into portrait mode to take a portrait you just take a normal photo of a person and then afterwards you can apply portrait mode if it feels right now lesser known but Samsung can actually do this too but since there's no depth information in the shot what you can't do is refocus on let's say something in the background and then the second thing which is really hard to ignore is that if you take portraits using the one times main camera Apple will shoot those portraits in 24 megapixels two times the resolution and when something like that exists as an option it becomes much harder to justify Samsung's 12 megapixel portraits even if stylistically I prefer them so we'll call this one a draw and now just before the big three categories let's run over special features which is basically cinematic mode slow-mo and macro mode both phones cinematic modes have come a long way since the features first debuted which I was quite surprised to see on the Samsung since the company is historically when it comes to video and also just never really talks about this feature whereas Apple goes on about cinematic video a lot then you've got slow-mo which is ironically also improving in slow motion every year getting a tiny bit better as phones let in a little bit more light and have slightly better sensors but honestly if only the tiniest bit of effort was put into it with the amount of computational power on these phones right now it could be something quite special do you know what I'm just gonna keep featuring slow motion in these tests just in protest because I just think it's wrong that it doesn't get more support I'd say Samsung takes it slightly just in the sense that it has 960 FPS super slow-mo at the hit of a bit more quality if you fancy doing that macro mode on the other hand is getting attention and that's great I have to say I don't use it very often but both iPhone and Samsung are very equally capable at it just with different styles the iPhone can technically get closer and it kind of leaves objects looking a bit more natural which is a bit less striking but easier on the eyes meanwhile Samsung processes very heavily adding in a lot of sharpness to these macro shots which you might like you might find offensive all of this is to say that for all of these special features both phones can do them but I'll give the category to Samsung just because of that slight Edge in slow-mo but currently apple is beating something just like they're absolutely whipping our Simba subscriber race but when we overtake them mark my words I will build the biggest iPhone the world has ever seen so a sub to the channel would be shutterly brilliant right let's talk about video video is a category that used to be a no-brainer for the iPhone and it's only actually since the s23 ultra that I've even had to think about it and you know what Samsung's video HDR is way better than it used to be and a lot of cases better than the iPhone like if you look here can you see how that building is really washed out on the iPhone but you can see it clearly here or like here when I enter this cave Samsung is able to retain the sky behind me in the way that Apple just can't but there's four things in the iPhone's court and there are four very important things look a little closer and you'll see that the detail is higher even though both are filming in 4K resolution Samsung is not quite using all of that resolution it's close but there's a difference like you'll see if you look at my beard in this shot Samsung sometimes misses The Mark with skin tones these new iPhone 15s in particular it feels like they're able to just latch onto what someone actually looks like and just hold it no matter how much the scene is changing around them whereas it feels like Samsung is tweaking colors based on the scene there's both phones action mode super steady which are specific Ultra stabilized videos that come at the slight cost of quality there's actually another example of a phone feature that I think should just become integrated like the phone should be able to detect when you're moving fast enough that you need it and just switch to it but for the time being going into this mode the iPhone is the only one recording a clip that you might actually want to use somewhere this is too much of a quality hit but I would say the biggest thing is just Samsung's grain in low light it's enough to  footage that apart from that grain honestly would be a strong Contender for best smartphone video out there but it's just a pretty severe Achilles heel to have against something that Apple has specifically worked on to address on their new phone they're saying that the a17 pro chip inside the iPhone 15 is what allows an extra layer of noise removal and yet some of these yearly camera improvements that you see they end up being negligible but this this you can tell I mean in this Scene It was so dark I couldn't even see where I was going but that's kind of wild that both of these phones can although the iPhone with a significant amount more clarity and this is also true for photos in lower light now this is not as much of a blanket when his video is because the Samsung doesn't have that noise problem in photos and in a lot of those middle lighting conditions even though the phone has more shutter lag I actually find that it's much easier to blur a photo on the iPhone something within Samsung's image processing does a very good job at recovering from those slight hand spasms but assuming that you are holding the phone steady there's three things that have improved on the iPhone since last time here first is the Smart HDR which helps a lot in night scenes because they tend to be the ones that have to balance out really bright spots within generally dark images and to be honest I wouldn't say that the HDR is now outright better than Samsung but it used to be noticeably behind it's not anymore and there's a couple of times where I've noticed something really clever going on which I will show you with a shot of the Microsoft store I took this because this is one of the most complex challenging lighting scenarios that you could possibly conjure up it's got a mixture of warm light on the outside cool light on the inside and the inside of the building is brighter than the outside anyway the smart hdr on the iPhone has factored in all of this and it's represented the image in a way that when I took it and I was looking to the iPhone screen and the Microsoft store behind felt like it was spot on but then what it feels like Samsung has done is tweaked its overall white balance using an average of the image as a whole and by doing so you'll notice that everything on the inside including the Microsoft logo has a slight blue tinge over it and that everything on the outside a slight red tinge that wasn't actually there in real life the second thing is the resolution so long as you're taking a normal photo on the iPhone and night mode doesn't activate which it doesn't seem to now until you get very dark you're taking a 24 megapixel shot compared to 12 on the s23 now to make one thing clear the end result is not as different as that number might make it sound because really in a lower light environment no phone today can properly use 24 megapixels of resolution but you know p peek into the windows of a shop or a bright Street Lamp and the difference is also not subtle and then the final tool that Apple has is when night mode does activate while you do lose that 24 megapixel resolution you gain photonic engine which is basically Apple speak for tweak the colors and increase the detail the thing is though never are those things more important than when it gets really dark it means you'll see more stars in the sky you'll see your objects rendered with more clarity you'll see grass and trees looking green as they should and not red if at any point you think that these images are doing a bad job by the way just bear in mind at this point my eyes could see nothing so they're both pretty good so what about daytime daytime photos is the single most important category for most people and you know I said that at night time the iPhone struggles to take advantage of the full 24 megapixel well that's not the case anymore during the day and it's almost a bit weird that in 2023 it comes down to megapixels but this one thing really does just completely take the wind out of Samsung sales because yeah you still get the usual difference style Samsung is more poppy it's Larger than Life it's sometimes a little too much and your face looks like a tomato then the upside of that is that it never under delivers on warmth so in situations where you really need it it's better than the iPhone iPhone largely leaves faces alone Samsung gets involved and Smooths things out it's very hard to label either style as better or worse my preference literally shifts from photo to photo and both are now very well matched in terms of their ability to cope with challenging lighting and so on but what is measurably better is having two times the amount of pixels to work with pretty much anytime you zoom into a daytime shot which you might do for a number of reasons you might want to print it out and frame it you might want to crop into it because you only like a certain part of it you can tell the difference you definitely still have to be looking for it but if you are you will find it and we should clarify something important here the Samsung has a 200 megapixel camera that does count for something it means that when you really want detail you have access to it but I don't think many people will use the 200 megapixel mode it takes far longer to catch the photos take up 10 times more space you have to turn off portrait mode and the ability to capture a motion photo your dynamic range suffers and your ability to shoot in low light falls not to mention the processing time is ludicrous and then even if you forward all of that the iPhone also has a high-res mode it's only 48 megapixel but the end level of detail is very similar to Samsung's 200. the Samsung's is a little better if you have lots of lights but then the iPhone's high-res mode overtakes it a bit as the light starts to dip I think both of these phones super high-res modes are off the table for most people and what's important about the new iPhone's 24 megapixel mode is that it's the default option and that it comes with no extra compromise now that Advantage disappears when using the ultrawide cameras since both phones are using standard 12 megapixel sensors and also the zoom as we've talked about but assuming that you spend the vast majority of your time on the main camera this is a big step forward with the iPhone but I'm hoping Samsung will be able to replicate with their next phone in 2024. do remember that some categories are worth more than others so even though this is a 6.5 up to 3.5 to the iPhone consider the things that are specifically important to you but yes if you point blank ask me which of these two cameras is better I would tell you the iPhone 15 Pro Max now I've got one more thing to show you which is kind of perfect for the iPhone you might remember that last year I showed you the case defy bounce case which has six times the military grade level of drop protection the way it works is this Eco shock material you can see here this thing absorbs all Impact and sudden shocks compared to this competitor block that they sent me where the ball just bounces off but if that's not enough I find this so insane this is the ultra bounce their newest phone case it has even more protection for your camera with this integrated lens protector six layers of padding and Ultra reinforced Corners giving this 10 times military grade protection it's so much protection that let's be very clear not everyone needs this but what I like about Christopher is that you can decide you can decide how much protection you need the base color of each part as well as exactly where you want to take the design from there like a personalized Collage if you're so inclined so if you head to my description box
