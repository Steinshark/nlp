ladies and gentlemen i'm not making this video because i want to i do want to but i'm making it because i have to one of my rules has been violated guys that rules we are but animals okay and i'm not about to violate one of my most sacred rules the rule is this if a larger youtuber makes a video about you mentioning you even with words conjuncted next to each other that appear to be like you like if they're drinking coffee and talking about godzilla that means i have to make a long response video to that person immediately as long as humanly possible actually and the bigger their channel is the longer the response video is proportional to how long they mentioned me for example ladies and gentlemen some ordinary gamers made a like a seven second shout out to me i made a nine minute video about it netflix they put me in a mini docu-series for one second i made a seven minute video about it okay i have to do it i mean it's it's the rules and so i try not i don't even want to do it sometimes but i have to do it so with that being said people don't seem to be learning because it's well known in the influencer space you know if you don't want the heat stay out of the kitchen or something like that uh cody co guys dropped me in his recent video and i just thought to myself this is a 12 minute video at least but let's take a look at what he said stupid the people making these coins think the average consumer is but i mean then again people bought elon sperm after i made fun of it so and according to another youtuber who uh does videos about finance and crypto his name's coffee zilla safe for mars is definitely a scam it's a total copy of another coin called safe mars wow so there it is ladies and gentlemen that's my big cameo i know you thought to yourself this might as well be copyright infringement the amount he's using your name but uh yeah this is cody ko talking about this channel covering the soja boy scam where he mentioned safer mars which was a crypto scam that i called out a few days ago and soja boy was being paid for it didn't disclose it and i know you all of you said to me hey if you can't trust sojourn who can you trust but i told y'all it was a scam it's being reported in major press outlets like the kodiko youtube channel guys very respected uh press outlet so now it's mainstream news youtuber news on snapchat kodiko blasts crypto influencers blasts crypto influencers cody cos slam dunks on crypto influencers and i told you guys this days ago okay but the reason i'm bringing this up besides my rule is because of the fact that there's an update that i have to give you with the soja boy story that not even kodiko had seen yet because it just happened because safer mars which was promoted by soja boy has recently disappeared ladies and gentlemen if you go to their page it says this account doesn't exist so he promoted something and put up a link to go buy this token for something that a few days later doesn't even exist these influencer scams have gotten absolutely out of control and we have to say something about it okay this is the whole point of the kodiko video is these influencer scams are out of control but there's so many examples it's even hard to pick from like recently i saw this lindsay lohan saying that the ethereum market is hinting at a bull run for nfts it's like who are these people that all of a sudden become crypto experts overnight because they signed up with coinbase it's absolutely ridiculous everyone's your financial advisor now guys and so i had an idea put a stop to this once and for all using the power of the kodiko shoutout and also he gave me an idea quite frankly which i'm going to explain in a second but he mentions the fact that uh you know all these all these tokens all these coins they're just kind of doing the same thing copying each other's code and just changing like one word it's a total copy of another coin called safe mars they just added an r i i would invest in ours because it's safer so you're just gonna invest in safe moon kind of a risk ours is a lot safer see this got me thinking ladies and gentlemen i want to help protect people from themselves and when i realize that people keep throwing dumb money at projects with things like safe in the name or safer in the name or moon star anything i decided what if i could join the scam to save people from being scammed and that's when safest galaxy was born ladies and gentlemen this is my domain i i picked the safest by definition and largest possible crypto coin and i know what you're thinking that's impossible isn't the universe the largest you know possible body of matter no because i bought safest universe and redirected it to safeasgalaxy.com that's right ladies and gentlemen uh i anticipated it all all to protect the consumer you because we all knew where this was going we had safe moon then safe mars then safe star then safer moon than safer star it was going to safest and i decided to jump to the front of the line let's go let's just let's get it over with dude if we're playing this game we're all copying each other's code and just throwing it on a different domain name let's do it as you can see i have a very nice graphics here and i'm about to tell you how to buy this thing okay because i'm trying to save you guys so first of all how to buy you got to be a zilla holder that means you have to subscribe to coffeezilla obviously follow elon musk on twitter a side thing that i didn't even mention here it's in like the terms of use you have to like and retweet every single thing elon musk does like if he violates an sec order and tweets about tesla you have to like it thirdly you have to tell everyone you know about safest galaxy ten times a day at least otherwise you're ineligible now what do you get for doing all of that nothing absolutely nothing ladies and gentlemen did you not see safest in the title i can't what it's safest because it's actually technically the only crypto coin that's not crypto at all it's not even a coin at all it's the safest largest technically non-crypto coin because i decided that maybe you shouldn't be invested in these things these sketchy coins that you have no business in investing in look i say it all the time isn't crypto risky enough without getting invested into these hacky copied uh erc tokens come on guys we can do better than this there are a lot of great kryptos out there you don't need this trash and if you do need it i have the safest and largest coin in the entire world so just to save you money i did that for you free absolutely free but yeah that's uh basically it safestgalaxy.com or safestuniverse.com however you want to get there be sure to follow all those rules if you want to participate and look uh maybe this response video will finally teach cody co a lesson and all of these large youtubers who think they can just mention me without getting some kind of a slam dunk a rebuttal in their face so that's basically it very cool of cody to mention us had to get this quick response out there didn't i did want to but i i did it because i had to uh so thanks for watching i appreciate you guys and i'll see you in the next one wake up smell the coffee
