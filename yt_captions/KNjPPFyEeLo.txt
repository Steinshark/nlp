Brace yourself, this is gonna be big. 2, 2, 3, 4, 7 - looks easy right - 14, 42, 213, 2837, 175450, 139759600, 6837625106787 You want one more? They get big! 266437144916648607844:
and the next one gets a lot bigger. And they keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger. What are these numbers? Well you don't have a clue right? I wouldn't have a clue myself. Where did they come from? Yeah, okay, well the where they came from is actually a puzzle, a genuine puzzle sequence. And it's a triangle, so I show you the beginning of the triangle and I ask you to explain how I'm getting from one row to the next. The zeroth row just has a single number in it - 2. The first row is 1, 1. Second row is 1, 2; then 1, 1, 2 yep? Then 1, 1, 2, 3, and then 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4. They're getting bigger and bigger, the next one: 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,6,7; and so on. This is Lionel Levine's triangle; and how is it defined? Can you figure it out? Give up? Okay, let's see how we would go from 1,1,2: you read it from the back, and this tells you how many 1s there are, so there are two 1s in the next row. This says how many 2s there are, there's one 2, and this says how many 3s. So the next row is 1,1,2,3 okay. How do we go from 1,1,2,3 to this row? We read it
from the back, the 3 says we begin with three 1s; the 2 says the next we have two 2s; that 1 says we have one 3 and this says- that 1 says we have one 4. And we keep going in that way; so here again we have four 1s, three 2s, two 3s, two 4s, one 5, one 6, and one 7 - that's the next row and you keep going. That's the triangle and now you add up the numbers in each row. So here we get a 2, 1 plus 1 is 2; 1 plus 2 is 3, then we get 4; so these numbers are the sums of the numbers in the rows. And it's an innocent looking triangle but when you follow it for a few rows you get a triangle which is bigger than any computer memory could possibly hold. (Brady: That is fiendish, I don't think) (anyone would get that 
in a job interview.) No unless they could cheat. Just in case you're wondering what would come next in this sequence, because obviously there are more than nine digits now, what we do is we have seven 1s, six 2s, five 3s, four 4s, four 5s, three 6s, three 7s, a couple of 8s, a couple of 9s and a couple of 10s, and then 11 12, 13, and 14. So we're using full natural numbers not digits. So for the sum of this row we add the natural numbers not the digits, so for example 11 is treated as 11 not two 1s and the total of the whole row is 213; and so it continues. You can find out more about this sequence and many other sequences on the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences; and this is entry number A011784.
