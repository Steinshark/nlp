do you prefer tabs or spaces tabs tabs why is that is there a reason for it or is it just history less typing tabs or spaces spaces what is that i have no good reasoning for it so no good reason okay uh i'd be a tab person personally yeah but then you get some uh editors that convert tabs to spaces so it doesn't really make a difference oh you get your tabs man so okay but now to be fair so in people say people answer whatever the answer is they answer it with like as if like as if there's ever a question what's the deal with this contention okay so practically speaking these days if your text editor is good which like they almost all are it's fine the system will see whatever's in there and you can convert between them losslessly and it's actually not an issue at all oh yeah yeah definitely taps yeah tell us yeah okay have you got a reason why or is it just that that's what you do yes perfect i mean if you go for spaces you need to go one two three to get the same thing right okay so there's no way i will use spaces for for programming i think tabs is the way to go because tabs semantically mean indentation like that's what tabs are for as a character and it also gives you the freedom to decide how you if you like to view your code with four or three or two or whatever you can set your like tab stop in your editor and it's fine but yeah like i say these days if you if you feel like doing that you can do that in your editor even if it's done with spaces so it kind of doesn't really matter anymore but i feel like oh and also file sizes right if you're indent with tabs your files are smaller question hello and welcome back rebecca again uh spaces or tabs uh definitely tabs why though i would say wow literally no reason other than it makes more sense to just have a single character to me okay a single character okay but what how's the tab rendered though when somebody looks at it as kind of like hex is it several is it is it characters it's all right i don't know i think i think so i have never googled that specific question but yeah it's just something i've always wondered you know because some uh you put it in like tab in some very basic editors just do some spaces right and then i think that's the editor though that just does that automatically it just transfers it isn't an important question to get answered it definitely is all right just so i can check the mic's working andy um what's your preference is it tabs or spaces uh tabs definitely tabs all the way i think is there a reason for it it's just um it's less presses of a button isn't it so taps obviously obviously yeah sure what else otherwise i know i just press the tab button and hope for the best sometimes it works yeah tabs all the way only weirdos use spaces well i don't understand the difference though why why would you prefer one over the other so so the reason why i say tabs and this is probably because i'm a come from a digital publishing document engineering type background is is that if you've got a tab and you're encoding to the computer that you want to tabulate this to a particular point whereas if you put spaces in you're actually saying i want these many spaces between it the advantage of the tab is it if you've got good software is that you could then change the layout to meet the person who's editing the code at that point it's time rather than have forcing it to be whatever weird standard you're using tabs or spaces tensor spaces oh that's a difficult one isn't it i so i used to use tabs and only tabs and then i used python a lot and actually i did a computer file where i committed some code to github that had only tabs and someone just put in a pull request straight away to change it all back to spaces and i started learning after that that maybe i should just use spaces i'm going to use python uh so i use both so both isn't i'm not sure that's an acceptable answer but okay we'll take it all right well yeah okay if i was to choose house do you have a view on tabs or spaces tabs any particular reason it looks better to me it looks i like my things spaced so i so i can i get lost in clutter very easily so i put a lot of space and tab is easier than place pressing space like six or seven times it's just faster so uh in fact before before we start i think i don't know if i've asked you my new sound check questions so we're going to give it a go uh tabs or spaces tabs or spaces oh i need notice of that question sean oh oh no no is it that you don't want to answer or that you don't know i can just think of times when i would not trust the tapping mechanism or for whatever i do but equally there's other things where i do trust this tapping mechanism to do what i want to do and i would do that so the answer is uh it depends i'm sorry can't give you a better answer than that the thing for me was what difference does it make as you say it depends on the the tubbing mechanism right well the point is that when you tab you move to a fixed point and it doesn't matter where you are coming from you move to the next term the danger with always using spaces is sometimes you have to know how many spaces to add to where you are to get where the physical equivalent is to the tab point whereas tab is such a nice shortcut i don't know where the heck i am on this line but i want the next tab and i think that must be something to do with the reason tabs or spaces oh tabs tablet spaces oh you've asked this one before have i no although i would like to change my answer oh you can change it that's right go for it um last time i think i said spaces but i don't actually worry about it i just let my text deal with it how does that happen then what you just well i think it detects if you're into if it's already indented with tabs then it just uses tabs so it just carries on with it yeah okay and then so even more contentious question what's the text editor emacs obviously favorite shortcut um the falcon nerf pinch it don't it does it it does they're both the same oh okay windows desktop yeah you can do really anything with it it's uh yeah it's pretty amazing i don't know about favorite they all have their pros and cons
