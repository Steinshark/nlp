financial freedom it's what everyone wants the ability to not worry about money the ability to flex on people and also sit on a beach for some reason with a laptop which i'm sorry is a dumb fantasy sand and keyboards do not mix all you've done is give yourself a terrible experience with both sorry to go on that weird tangent but also it needed to be said the point is that everyone wants financial freedom and many people look to cryptocurrency as a new way to get it because nobody trusts the monopoly man controlling the money printerino anymore and because of that a lot of new people have been happy to step in and promise to be the solution the new monopoly man if you will but a better one sort of inter celsius who we're talking about today a company that takes crypto and also lends it that pitched itself as being a new place to put your money and borrow money but that's kind of not a bank it calls itself a new economy an economy where quote financial freedom doesn't come with a price tag which sounds about as believable as a diet pill that gets you a six-pack without the exercise but even so celsius's pitch was undeniably effective promising up to 10 a year on your money since they opened their doors in 2017 they've taken in a grand whopping total of 25 billion dollars worth in crypto and for a while things were going great right up until on june 12 2022 they suddenly collapsed without warning and froze withdrawals and went radio silent and it has everyone wondering how could this happen well that is what we are trying to answer today i've done a shorter video on this which we'll link here but this time we're gonna go much deeper down the rabbit hole because i believe celsius is unfortunately finished insolvent and i'm about to tell you why it begins with one man and his vision you know we need we need someone to help us with our financial uh accounts with our financial life and normally we trust people that we think are acting in our best interest but what if these people are not acting in our best interest what the banks really think is that because we have to trust them we cannot trust somebody else so they they don't believe that a company like celsius can exist because who would be crazy enough to give their coins their crypto to somebody who's not a bank right that is alex mashinsky the creator of celsius he's critical to understanding the collapse of celsius and the first thing you should know about him is that he claims to have done a lot in his career we can get a glimpse of just how many businesses alex has had in his lifetime from a 1999 article which says this he tried importing urea from russia selling indonesian gold to switzerland and brokering poisonous sodium cyanide excavated from china for use by gold mines in the us now all of these businesses failed obviously but the point is he's always been selling something and probably the biggest thing he's been selling is one of his claims that says that he's the person who invented voip voice over the internet protocol something that i know you've used before even if you've never heard of it things like whatsapp use it but this claim it turns out is actually a little bit exaggerated alex mashinsky says he's one of the inventors but all the records i could find on the history of voip suggest he wasn't the first to do it or even a key inventor at all he has a patent that goes back to 1994 but voip was already a thing by then with an app called rascal in 1989 and he wasn't the first to monetize it either a company called vocaltech was the first but as you'll find alex doesn't let an inconvenient truth like that stop him instead he pitches himself as a central piece of this technology despite most histories of voip not even mentioning him and this is a pattern of behavior of slightly stretching the truth he claims in fact to be the inventor of a lot of things he says he has patents that cover aspects of the smart grid ad exchanges twitter skype the app store netflix's streaming concept you'd think he basically invented the internet actually and in addition to him being this amazing inventor another core part of his story seems to be that he's also a man of the people not interested in money but instead he's interested in fighting for the little guy and taking down mean old monopolies this is his core pitch about voip and also it's his new pitch today about banks so i i fought the monopolies my entire life i mean i fought the phone companies i thought all the different people who uh thought that it was a god-given right for them to charge high rates forever to all of us and and so voip was a great example of that right where basically we created a new technology a new platform completely decentralized uh uh completely autonomous to the phone through the entire phone lines infrastructure and it wrote on the internet for free right so the same thing is happening now with money right and the first time this is the first time that that you can basically replace the banks the internet hasn't been able to do it the first time that the technology the crypto technology and the blockchain technology can replace the banks completely with peer-to-peer so we're going from voice of rfp to money over ip money over ip he says that's his new project with celsius and i gotta say moib has to be the worst marketing term for something of all time it sounds like a chronic disease honestly most people instead usually call it defy decentralized finance where you cut out the middleman and create smart contracts or little bits of code to replace what a bank might do like lending for example instead of going to a bank you can go to compound or ave to get a decentralized loan but crucially in this defy world celsius doesn't exactly actually fit because it's not decentralized at all it's just his company and this is where things get a little weird because when alex mashinsky describes what celsius is in theory it sounds like he's eliminating banks that is the killer the application of basically eliminating the toll collector is the purpose of the blockchain but then when he describes what celsius actually does it sounds like he is a bank so celsius network enables you to deposit your coins it enables you to lend them to someone else and you get to keep 80 of the value i mean you just heard it celsius takes deposits and lends money that's literally the definition of a bank according to investopedia except well for the fact that in this definition it also says licensed and in that one sense the worst since of all alex is correct celsius is not a bank because it turns out they're not licensed to do this if your bank loses money for example it's insured if celsius loses your money well you're out of luck and this verbal sleight of hand is a pattern with celsius mashinsky would use words like deposit and withdraw which sounds like banking terms for a savings account don't they but in their terms of service they explicitly spell out that these aren't banking terms at all it's not what they mean instead celsius considers these deposits actually a loan to them that you are lending to them to then lend to somebody else and when you withdraw your money you're not withdrawing from an account you own you're calling your loan due basically and it turns out that's a pretty big difference the other big trick they did was convincing people that like a savings account they said their earn program where you could get up to 10 a year on your deposit they said it was low risk incredibly low risk as seen in this clip bitcoin is dividend price elsewhere how does bitcoin point because we earn yield how do you earn yield on bitcoin what do you do to generate income on that bill i'm happy to spend an hour with you yeah you're trading it you've got to be taking tremendous amount of risk the bitcoin itself doesn't generate any yield it does just like any other asset can generate yield gold no but what earnings what earnings does the bitcoin generate gold generates five and a half percent at celsius yield token what are you doing to generate that you've got you've got you must be taking tremendous risk to generate those returns well that turned out to be a huge lie they were taking tremendous risk now i spoke with a celsius insider who on the condition of being anonymous told me that quote they were kind of degenerate in their d5 pools so it turns out they were taking tremendous risk according to their own people and i also spoke with a crypto sleuth called dirty bubble media who's been tracing these actions a long time before it fell apart to understand more and i asked him how is it possible that celsius could earn 10 percent or more on their crypto here's what he told me essentially they were engaging in some fairly risky practices essentially taking borrow borrowed assets and lending on the multiple times in order to try to maximize the yield and most of most of their yield was likely coming from stable coin loans at least their claims are that they were making these large loans of stable coins out to like institutional traders who were engaging in undescribed or undisclosed activities that somehow generated the return sufficiently high enough to make these uh 10 or higher payments one way i had heard it described was that people thought they were investing in a bank with celsius but actually they were investing in more like a hedge fund do you sort of agree with that yeah i mean i think that describing them as a hedge fund that was playing with retail money is probably a fairly charitable way to describe it but they definitely weren't operating like a bank so i know you looked at their d5 wallets what kind of returns did you see them getting there did you see them getting like 10 12 15 no not at all um so what they're what part of their strategy was using d5 to access stable coins so for example they would borrow ether from their customers they would then deposit that borrowed ether into say a compound uh d5 protocol and then use that as collateral to then borrow stable coins against and then from there the stable coins flow out all over the place and that's something that trying to track that is very difficult um but essentially i mean net that actually costs them more money than it makes because first they're paying interest rates out to their customers to borrow the ether and then they're also paying uh between two to three percent to those protocols to borrow the stable coins and over collateralized matter so it was actually costing them money and on the part of the the part that's actually visible to us on the on the blockchain so they're making all these bets some of them risky and i guess you found that some of these didn't exactly pan out can you explain that yeah so there were a couple mistakes that they've made that i found and there are probably others as well one example of that was this thing called steakhound ether which to get into it's a little bit complicated but essentially they were using this service to take some of the customer ethereum and deposit it to this eth2 contract which is something that has to do with ethereum switching from proof of work to proof of stake the long story short is that the money that goes into this contract is locked so you can't access it for a very long period of time it's indefinite at least until the switch occurs so what state count allowed you to do was they gave you a derivative token that you could then kind of keep playing with and use to say borrow against or lend out and for a while the market was treating that as equivalent to uh ether um the problem was that state count actually lost the keys to uh over half of the big or the ethereum that or ether that they had uh deposited so essentially what happened is the crypto that they gave them is locked up for essentially forever unless the keys can be found and the ste derivative token that they were using to kind of uh stand in for the for the ether that they had deposited basically is worthless now so that's it was a massive loss i mean we were talking tens of millions of dollars another example was this badger dell hack which happened uh several months ago um essentially it was like a phishing attack they were participating in this badger dow protocol they ended up losing 54 million dollars of rap bitcoin wow that's a lot of money but there's also a side of this which is the incompetence of celsius which i think a lot of customers didn't know about at the time uh explain that yeah so badger dell in order to try to salvage the situation um came up with a plan essentially to reimburse people and it's a little bit convoluted but essentially the way it worked was that the the dow gave the the victims these tokens called rem badger so reimbursement badger and the only the only requirement was that they had to hold those tokens in their wallet or in the badger dell protocol for a period of two years as the as these rewards were paid out over time unfortunately and i haven't got an explanation as to why this happened but a few months ago celsius actually removed all those ben badger tokens from that deposit account and essentially that means they they lost the right to get any more reimbursements from the dow why did they remove the the badger tokens i mean your guess is as good as mine so it's literally stupidity is what you're saying it was the mistake well so it's the the mistake is so egregious because there was actually a warning screen that would pop up and say you know if you do this you are forfeiting all of your reimbursements from here on out tens of millions of dollars just lost because of a stupid basic mistake yes see it's stories like this that appear to be something of a microcosm for celsius a small example that shows a much deeper problem problems like growing too quickly and having bad executives see celsius by the time of their collapse was almost at 800 people mind you this is only like a four to five year old company and just in the past year statistics showed they grew their staff by 281 percent you can just not on board people this quickly they were growing too fast and trying to scale too fast as well and ultimately it looks like they paid the price remember that this is supposed to be a budget bank passing on the savings to their customers unlike you know the big traditional finance banks but with this many employees it's not clear how that's even possible i mean they were likely spending somewhere between 10 to maybe 50 million dollars per year just on employees and again this might not be a problem if they were hiring star employees but the opposite actually seems to be true when we dig into it here are a few examples of what i mean their chief financial officer for example got actually arrested while working for the company under money laundering charges their chief revenue officer also got in trouble when he started a business with a convicted money launderer while at the company and then you also have their head of lending a 24 year old whose face i will blur for privacy who turns out to only really have been in the industry for four years before she worked as an adult actress before coming onto celsius and then moved into a marketing assistant position before becoming the head of managing hundreds of millions of dollars of loans to have someone with only a few years of experience handling hundreds of millions of dollars of customers money is just always going to be a bad thing and once again the insider that i spoke to at celsius agreed that this was all sort of par for the course they called it a quote story of incompetence that's literally how they described this whole company but of course you wouldn't know about that would you if you just listened to alex mashinsky who describes his company in much different terms he describes it as safe and of course totally solvent only days before they froze all their funds alex was still going on amas saying stuff like this are our funds safe at celsius can you address that for the audience yes so not just that they're safe again we provided anyone who wanted to withdraw partially or fully there were no problems i know people are uh concerned about the whole market and they were specifically concerned with the terra luna situation that we've publicly stated many times that we would we didn't lend to them we were we didn't buy luna or ust we were not like many others who invested in the project we didn't have any exposure to that and not only was he saying everything's fine he would frequently get angry at people accusing his money of not having all the dollars or just asking questions for example when this user said that he hopes retail investors can get out alex responded mike do you even know one person who has a problem with drawing from celsius why spread fud and misinformation if you are paid for this then let everyone know you are picking sides otherwise our job is to fight tradfi together but it's not just people on twitter they're going after when this youtuber criticized celsius he also got in trouble but this time received a cease and desist letter from them he joins me now upper echelon gamers why do you think celsius was so worried about the criticism you were giving them and how vindicated do you feel that you've basically been right about them this whole time alex mashinsky has a pretty long track record in my opinion of making false accusations or false statements and right up until 24 hours before they closed down all withdrawals he was saying do you know even a single person who can't get their money why are you spreading fud fear uncertainty doubt right this buzzword to discredit criticism so yeah there is an element of i guess there's a personal side to it where i do feel a sense of ha gotcha you know why would you send me a letter like that why would you fixate hyperfixate on one tiny portion of a video that in my opinion highlighted very extreme things that should be looked at by the community pieces of information that are not well known things that he's denied in amas such as pretending he doesn't know who moshi hoage is and yet he was an advisor to moshi hog's syrian labs while also simultaneously moshi hoke was an advisor on celsius years prior so things like that so so getting a letter like that that hyper fixates on one tiny thing to try and i think strong arm me and intimidate me into not speaking it does feel good to be right but like i said double edged sword because being right means a bad thing for a great deal of people well said and i will link his youtube channel below the point i'm trying to make is that celsius didn't just have problems in the immediate term like some people think they did rather it seems that they had every imaginable problem from incompetent management to the fact it seemed like a bloated company it also is not clear that they were ever making enough yield to pay back their investors and maybe worst of all they would publicly put on a front that everything's fine while secretly uh trying to hide the fact that they were what looks like seconds away from insolvency even a day before freezing withdrawals their twitter account was bragging about how quick and easy it is to swap coins with them they say it takes less time than it took to write this tweet and this to me is unforgivable they know that they're about to go under and they're trying to bring new investors in right that is so disgusting not only that it also looks like alex mashinsky was pretending to be sick only two days before everything went under he said that he lost his voice and was unable to attend an ama and said he had to reschedule it and honestly all indications point to the fact they knew what was going on and chose to hide this fact from their customers who they knew were going to get screwed because remember that customers were not depositing they were loaning to celsius this was an unsecured loan meaning that when everything goes belly up well too bad you're going to be the last one to get paid as one of the you know regular retail investors on the other hand a lot of the loans that celsius did have from other big companies like tether who they reportedly borrowed a billion dollars from these were collateralized loans so tether boasted the other day that they had no exposure to celsius's collapse and just liquidated them it's also worth noting that tether is a massive shareholder of celsius go figure so once again the big guys get out fine and the little guy gets squashed and so it's at this point that we have to say celsius looks pretty much unsolvent especially if they got liquidated for almost a billion dollars they've lost money on badger dow on steakhound they're losing money everywhere and everyone wants their money back at the same time now i know things are getting heavy as i said celsius looks insolvent from top to bottom and there's been talk of them trying to find some way to sort this all out but i find it very ironic who they turn to in their time of need this fake bank that sees the big banks as bad guys you know who they turn to when they're finally admit that they screwed up they turned to citigroup which is a bank that's right ladies and gentlemen can we all just appreciate this fact that this fake bank which was claiming to you know be saving the people is now turning to a real bank in their time of crisis you just can't make this stuff up and that maybe is the only funny part of this whole story because i do have to say there is some bad news which is that alex mashinsky looks like he's walking away with um let me uh check here millions of dollars how is that possible well because of celsius token the crypto token they built around their company also known as sell when it started it really didn't do much there was no real customer demand but through some clever manipulation and incentives alex managed to get himself some real demand for this token that pretty much has no reason to exist to understand how that's possible you have to start by knowing that alex mashinsky was just sort of given a lot of these tokens to start obviously he's the largest individual owner of cell but he can sell them whenever he wants to and of course the problem is why would you buy this token that he automatically has a bunch of money in if it's not like going to give you a share in the profit of the company well they thought of a brilliant way to sort of create demand out of thin air so you know how you can invest your crypto in celsius and earn a yield right well it turns out that if you'd simply accept your payment in sell tokens instead of let's say your native cryptocurrency you deposited you'd be paid extra money extra interest which is pretty ingenious because it makes people start to get into your token but it wasn't just that they did they also added something called a loyalty program where if you held a balance of their native token you'd get extra rewards on your interest with the platinum level giving you 30 percent more on your interest payments and if you think the degeneracy stops there well of course you're wrong because they go even further the next layer they added onto that is that you can actually stake your celsius in their earning program as well and earn interest on your interest with bonus interest is everyone following that that's the way celsius inflated their coins value which frankly sort of had no reason to exist except to give their founder a way out of the token himself and sell it he did alex mashinsky it turns out was sort of constantly selling this cell token and i spoke to dirty bubble media about this once again and here's what he said yeah so alex's selling was kind of a focus of a lot of my work there was a total lack of transparency around it um i mean celsius often would kind of tell their their transparency on things but when it came to these sales he he would admit that he was selling some tokens but would never give a specific amount so so based just on the numbers that celsius itself provided they have a list called the top 500 hotel or list that they would periodically update that was the top 500 holders of this sell token um it looked like there were several million tokens that were sold by mission c over a period of about a year what is the rough us dollar um kind of equivalent of that tens of millions tens of millions so he's walking away basically even more rich than he was before and his users are walking away what seems like maybe bankrupt uh very possibly yes wow that's heartbreaking when i later went to the insider i had been talking to at celsius and asked them what they thought about this whole situation they told me sort of a similar sentiment they said two words it's over so even though i don't like to give bad news on this channel despite what everyone thinks probably i do have to agree i think celsius's time as a fake bank larping as robin hood is coming to an end ironically they ended up screwing regular people way worse than the real banks ever will and it's become a huge cautionary tale to not just listen to people because they're saying what you want to hear they told people that financial freedom was just an investment away that they would do all the heavy lifting and all you had to do was sit back and unbank yourself by banking yourself and unfortunately that's just kind of where this story ends i know it's a bit of a bummer today guys thank you for watching and i'll see you in the next one
