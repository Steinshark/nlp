ladies and gentlemen today I am extremely excited to announce the beginning of a series here on the Gotham YouTube channel to cover the Women's World Chess Championship match it's a match played between actually two participants from the same nation and that is of China the incumbent the defendant Juan Jun is defending her title for the third time against Lei Ting yep and the match is very interesting it's different than the open format or the the match that we saw between Ding and nepo some months ago in the sense that actually the match is best of 12 games and it's played six games in one city and six games in another city so the cities that The Players are from I don't think they did this because both players are from China although if they did that's potentially very interesting and other than that I mean it's just first to six and a half points out of 12. so let's jump into the games this video is actually going to cover um the first two games that were played uh because um they started the match a couple of days ago and I think this is how I'm going to do this uh for the duration of this match um I will kind of update you on the match uh perhaps if there's like some crazy crazy game I'm gonna I'm gonna throw it in there uh but uh very interesting to see so the match begins uh letting Jazz with the white pieces and she opens with E4 uh and her opponent plays E5 and we actually have a Berlin a Spanish uh played by white black responds with the Berlin and a lot of the top chess players in the world that you are featured prominently on this channel hey Carl Wesley a lot of those players that play the Berlin will will frequently face what is known as an anti-berlin not allowing black to take the pawn on the E4 Square um but uh that's not what happens in this game White Castles and completely allows Knight takes E4 now there are two main lines here for white the historic and classic uh Berlin uh end game if you will begins with the move uh D4 Knight to D6 Bishop C6 DC D E Knight F5 queen d8 king d8 this position has been reached some thousands of times and essentially the argument is does white have an advantage because black has lost the right to Castle and has doubled pawns or does black actually have a completely reasonable and playable position but in this game white does not play the move d4 and plays rookie one which is fine but a little bit boring uh because black immediately goes back with the exact same night jump and it's very difficult for white to prove an advantage here white takes on E5 giving up the bishop but you can't really take it because Knight would take and it would be a discovered attack black does this and white drops the bishop back to F1 if you've never seen this before it looks like the stupidest thing in the world but I promise you it's a very real thing now black does this and white has this goofy rook in the center of the board now here players have played Knight C3 and D4 and all of these different moves um to think C3 and D4 has been played I think some some people have even played C4 um to try to be a little bit more edgy I think they played a little bit later though they don't play it in this particular variation because you would be surrendering the control of the D4 square but I digress white plays D4 drops The Rook back to E1 there's even a move here Rook to E2 it's kind of a ridiculous move some top some computer move but rookie one played and black plays rookie eight uh and uh white sacrifices upon on the D4 Square so you're gonna go back a moment here um Knight C3 is a Gambit so lightings yeah comes kind of well prepared here we've had C3 Bishop F4 all these different moves later plays Knight C3 look at her time she hasn't spent any time which means she has not blundered uh this Pawn with rookie one Queen E1 and the removal of the Pawn on D4 we have this this and black is simply a pawn up so how do we already have a blunder in the Women's World Championship uh 2023 in game one like some 12 moves into it no um this is actually a deliberate attempt by white uh White plays Bishop D3 and basically says what's your next move and uh I gotta tell you it's actually kind of hard to find one for example if white tries to excuse me black tries to finish development with Bishop to B7 white plays Knight to B5 and this diagonal is open so after Knight takes B5 I have absolutely no business going here I'm gonna play Queen E4 hit you here hit your Rook if you try to save your Rook that's really Valiant because after this this this this this this this this this this you're gonna lose a queen because your King has to protect your queen so it's actually kind of difficult to make a move here with white excuse me with black you can't really play B6 if you try to go for a queen trade I'm not gonna trade with you in a happy way I'm gonna play Bishop F4 and then I'm gonna get my Rook here and I'm gonna try to go down there so late things yeah basically just sacrifices upon for a very interesting and playable position her opponent now takes the Knight and tries to catch up in development now visually this position is really nice for white you're going to move the bishop out you're going to play rookie one Rook D1 and the Challenger is actually potentially going to do a very nice job here uh with the pressure and trying to win this position now black plays the move 98 like I mean this is just ridiculous Knight F6 Knight E4 Knight back to D6 98 I mean it's kind of ridiculous you can play chess like this but black 15 moves into this game has only a rectangle of pieces set up and is just going to play like c65 maybe D6 and develop the bishop and basically just say like look I'm passive but you have nothing and the chess meta at the highest level is exactly that black essentially sits down every game completely happy with the draw if you have to do a little bit of suffering like a Buddhist you know no problem you do a little suffering you get the Nirvana you get the draw you try to win with the white pieces so black plays the move Pawn to D5 lightings yeah you will notice has not spent any time you start this game with 90 minutes on the clock she has 94 and a half every move she makes she gains time black is down 20 minutes on the clock black plays the move Bishop to E6 the problem with White's position is you can be up 20 minutes on the clock but at the end of the day you are a pawn down and when you are a pawn down one of two things can happen you can either win the game because your position is so good you're going to be a pawn down but probably checkmate or you're going to win the pawn back but to win the pawn back you're gonna have to sacrifice the whole Army if your whole Army doesn't exist you don't have a good position anymore it's probably going to be a draw so rookie one Queen D7 white has done everything in her power to get a great position plays the move a force still in her preparation Knight to D6 Rook to E3 is played after 10 minutes of thought so up until this point 18 moves of prep was latex YES Prep it's good prep I mean it definitely got her a very very promising position and she proceeded to remember the best move she had to think about it but the idea is very clear rookie three's trying to rotate over here and and poke some holes in the black position make black maybe go here but my friends I told you something uh like about a minute ago I said when you start an opening down upon your options are deliver a Checkmate which seems to be happening here if the opponent plays in a greedy way like yeah you can't have my pun back yeah you can't have and then you're gonna go Bishop H6 and all of a sudden you know black is gonna have to like you know go kind of Head Over Heels here to try to defend themselves you know you're going to play Rook back to E3 and then in Queen F6 and so on yeah but she just goes Knight E4 the alternative is your opponent gives you the pawn back if Bishop takes D takes Pawn to C6 and then Queen to D1 there's absolutely nothing and uh Queen C7 is the exact same outcome it's a queen trade and it's Knight C5 and it's an end game and is white better in this end game by the most literal microscopic of factors um listen nah size matters when stockfish is talking about it and right now it says 0.00 which means nobody has an advantage black plays Rook C8 Bishop to E5 uh .08 does not count as an advantage either it's a nice food for Thon white does have a very pleasant position throughout this game you will notice by the way that Bishop D3 was played and Jew and June actually did not go for this end game because white is the one pressing this is the biggest the advantage has been the entire game which is saying a lot about top level chess white would then play F4 bring the king to the center and basically just try to smash black like down this line because this bishop is so passive Jew and June is not in the business of getting into a a torturous end game so she moves back and forth and basically and her Knight is doing a little dance she breaks out with the F Pawn and again we have potentially our uh our our biggest moment of advantage in the entire game um but so far Juan June is doing a nice job Bishop to E4 on the board take take Bishop to B4 and at this point lay started asking some very menacing questions uh Jew and June can go here but after rookie four The Rook is getting in um in about seven or eight end games out of ten the bishop is going to be better than that than a knight because it's a more powerful long-range weapon you can kind of immediately get rid of the opposing piece if you need and after rookie eight white can uh play F3 uh or or take on f8 right away um and she chooses to take on f8 and just start running her King and she does actually get to a very very pleasant looking uh Rook end game she could have been a little bit more patient she could have played the move F3 I think at some moment but so far just kind of like a smooth sailing effort but this is a nice move from Chu and Joon with a nice counter-attack Rook d8 check Rook C8 the pawns come off the board and it's going to be a rook and 2 versus rook and 2N game white advances black puts the Rook behind the pawn and game one is in the books with a draw um I mean relatively smooth sailing for game number one latexia asked a couple of questions Jew and June answers them it's like a tourist asking somebody for uh directions they say you gotta go here and here boom fantastic what are you gonna do with white if I you know what are you gonna do with black so ju and June's first game with the white pieces she plays D form and we have a Queen's Gambit declined this is called the semi-terage variation um and uh it's a very good one the idea here is cd5 Knight D5 Ed this was the old line like this and black would play Bishop before check but nowadays after C takes D5 it has been discovered that black can actually play C takes D4 which was not really known until about five years ago uh and I wonder if that was the idea because after E3 Knight C6 the position is literally completely symmetrical so again The Meta strategy is sit down for a game with the black pieces and don't lose right so it's up to White to kind of pose the problems and she plays Bishop to B5 late things yep takes on D4 and now eat takes D4 which is a massive surprise massive surprise um to me because Knight takes D4 as far as I know playing against the isolated Pawn is absolutely The Meta strategy here and after Bishop D7 you can play castles and you basically just play against this isolated Pawn all right the pawn that has no neighbors uh but you and June clearly has other intentions as she creates a completely symmetrical Pawn structure no epon or C Pawn for either player um castles and it's like total symmetry I mean you have a completely identical position from both sides rookie one black plays H6 white says I'm going to maintain the pin black brings a rook to the center and white plays this move A3 a decent move fighting for the B4 Square could potentially weaken the light squares but basically anything you do in this position is completely fine uh black plays rookie eight so every single one of Black's pieces has gotten a turn Latin ji if any kids are watching uh abroad or uh over in China like this is fantastic uh I mean this is a fantastic role model to have I mean she has given every single piece of turn she has made a she's Castle she's made a love for her King this is like excellent chess and now June June for a second time this game goes back to B5 after going to B5 and dropping back but she is trying to put some pressure over here it's a very legitimate you know move black plays A6 now if I'm playing with white here when I play the move Bishop to B5 I'm thinking do I take on C6 if that move happens ju and June thinks and decides against it with the move Bishop to A4 very clearly inducing the move B5 and generally in chess the way it works is one side says I would like you to play the move B5 and now the other side says I know they want me to play B5 but it's not a matter of I know they want me to play it so I'm not going to play it it's more a matter of I'm gonna play B5 and maybe I've calculated that they've missed something or they've misevaluated the position June also had the option to take on C6 here to try to kind of fight for the dark squares with the moves like Knight A4 uh BC probably wouldn't have been played I think maybe Rook C6 is a little bit better but in my opinion probably Rook C6 over bc6 there is B5 and now lateing jie plays g52 so Jew and June spent too long in this game doing nothing so we go back to the opening this is White's position she proceeded to kind of go back and forth with her Bishop she made multiple Bishop moves here multiple Bishop moves there and she went here and then she was hesitant she didn't take the Knight she went around a lot of time wasting and black says you know what G5 you're not supposed to push Pawns in front of your king unless you're 100 sure that it's a good move and at this level they are 100 sure Knight takes G5 sacrificing material like this to try to create an attack is possible but you're not like if you go here it just hangs a queen so that's not a good move so white plays Bishop G3 take stakes and later plays Queen here and just has an advantage I mean just a very clean Advantage with the black pieces her Center is Rock Solid she has more space on all three sides of the board Bishop G4 is coming to remove the Knight potentially from over here Queen D2 Bishop G4 and this is a really really nice position if white tries to sacrifice on G5 this is not Checkers I'm not required to take but I will take this Pawn because then I used to guard that if I if I took that your queen would have gotten in but after Queen D4 Knight D4 you have a Knight hanging you have a bishop hanging so that's very bad you lose the bishop you lose a rook too so after Bishop G4 she has a really nice position she when June trades off the Rooks but gives white a dominant control of the center and now now black really should have really should have stepped on the guess black should have played Knight to A5 Knight C4 Knight A5 also defends the Knight with the queen so Knight takes G5 is not possible also of course there is a pin here but just in the future uh lighting ji spent quite a bit of time on her next move and she played King f8 there was nothing wrong with the move King f8 but if you ask me to explain it to you I can't really I don't actually know the idea of King f8 I think she was trying to get the king just sort of generally out of this area like Knight takes G5 and all of this would not be possible nothing on H7 is possible the king is always guarding the Rook but king of Fate is very much like a pass back move it's like I don't exactly know what to do with my position but I'm gonna make an improving move and you probably also don't know what to do with your position so um you know next I'm gonna start playing moves like B4 before I actually start fighting I think this is just a general improving move Knight A5 might have been a touch better to try to get the knight in but she strikes with B4 anyway Knight A4 and now a nice move Queen B5 looking to trade the Queens in the following way so you open up the a file for the rook and you get the E2 Square uh White sees that so white plays a takes B4 Queen takes and latex yeah has arrived that is a fork it's not a fork that wins any material but it's certainly a menacing move Knight to D7 is trying to rotate the Knight around and also fight this Knight off so it doesn't have any access and also potentially move the F pawn bishop goes out this way completely surrendering control of F5 so this bishop goes to F5 immediately but now Zhu and June is able to bring the Knight back G4 strikes the Knight but the Knight jumps into the middle and unfortunately my friends for a second game in a row all the pieces get traded we have another rook and Bishop end game and the players Advance their pawns and it's just going to be a matter of how many pieces either get traded or the players repeat moves um so far in the early stage of this match I would say Lei Ting Dia was asking perhaps the more pressing questions in the first game she um she had a decent position from uh from the Berlin but because she was down upon most of the game all she could do was win it back she had like maybe one or two moments she could have posed a couple of concrete problems with the white pieces but the thing is once you play a Gambit in the Berlin like she did Zhu and June is going to be prepared so I would imagine that you're going to get D3 uh in the next game instead of castles so it's you know this is kind of already Juan Jun saying I'm going to be playing the Berlin with the black pieces um and uh in the second game you know Jew and June with the white pieces playing D4 we don't get Knight F6 we actually get a pure form Queen's Gambit declined in this game June June went for Knight F3 the more meta move his Knight C3 avoiding Knight F6 because the exchange variation is considered a touch touch better for white but it's you know um now are either of these players speaking with dingly Ren it's a fascinating question I don't think so because they're both from the same Nation I don't think it would make any sense for him to advise either of the players but who knows maybe they're you know maybe there are our teams and camps and uh ding did play the Queen's Gambit declined in the world championship match so and you know Jan is not a D4 player so perhaps there's some advice being given there uh there were some photos of Juan Jun um excuse me of lightings yeah I believe walking in with Timur rajabov and late India played you know this and she probably has some some good notes there in the semi tarash uh rajaba of of course a universal player with with white at his level so curious to see where this match goes in game number three it will be tomorrow uh I will be on an airplane but you know I will uh I will update you uh I will update you when I'm on the ground probably after the next rounds three and four and uh yeah we have another World Chess Championship upon us this time in the women's division latings yeah challenging June June for the uh for the title I think that's all I have for today's video get out of here
