it's the doomsday system and this was a project in 1986 developed by BBC with a lot of input from BBC schools but it was using brand-new technology to remember the 900th anniversary of the Doomsday Book this is a modern version of it and what it was was an enormous catalogue of everything that William the Conqueror had conquered no the original doomsday book you can still read if you know the language these sadly are beginning to fail after barely 30 years this was a Philips laser vision player when the coding was first starting when the first development of the doomsday day started they hadn't even got this particular player ready by the time they were testing it they got the prototypes there are actually two disks in all these a double-sided each surface is an active surface the two disks were called the the national disk and the community disk they had different sorts of content they aren't digital discs so you can't actually say they're a particular amount of of megabytes or gigabytes it had actually got trucks on it just like frames analog frames in an old-fashioned TV across this width there are 55,000 tracks which is about half an hour's playing time unfortunately this technology not as I say not only the disk but the the players are very hard to keep in order we've been in touch with Felix and can't find anybody who can help us to repair them so we got a couple of players that work fitfully and a few discs that are just about readable so this is the 2011 remake of it using all the original data that's been devised to work on a program on this touch table but basically using a PC with Windows underneath it that's where we are now yet near Bletchley just about here keep zooming in and eventually you get the map as it was in 1986 got the modern maps on and you can see the city is now full of housing here's Bletchley here's what people wrote about Bletchley at the time there were pictures one of the lakes near Bletchley children biking in the Milton Keynes Bowl and here's Wells Mead school the school that contributed this information the BBC contacted schools all over the country and invited them to write little bits about the area about special things about their area send in photographs and there was a massive operation digitizing all of that some of it was written on BBC micros the schools are trying to get their students to learn about using computers within this this whole project but then that all had to be moved into a standard form plugged into what we would now call a geographical information system so the country was split into these areas about three by four kilometers so when you did this searching down to a particular area you would then get these little stories or descriptions of the area and pictures as well of course it was only cameras in those days they didn't have smartphones or anything of that sort and they would have been film cameras so they would have sent in actual photographs on on photographic paper and every picture would have used one single frame and they would all all have been indexed so there were tens of thousands of pictures all of which were indexed and when the program was written they had to have all that data so that when you clicked on a particular area on the map it came up with the right pictures and not somewhere else this is just like a 30 year old Street it's exactly like that and there was indeed a walk function within it where there were certain towns and cities where they did just like Street View and you could turn four sideways and backwards onto your direction of travel and look at what was filmed at the tower this was not done by the schools this was done by the BBC the Domesday desk and all of this hardware cost a great deal of money for schools to buy very quickly the BBC realized they got to produce some other titles one of those titles was the Eco disc and another was called volcanoes I was involved in the Eco disc and it was about the ecology of a field study centre that was in Slapton Lee Inn in South Devon and this was much more like some of the educational software BBC's schools were producing at the time that's the virtual walk where you could walk around the lake but also if you can see the dots that run across the middle there was a walk in about why there was a paddle across the middle of it as well I was brought in to do the programming of this it used a language called BCPL and we used the same system and the same user interface as the Domesday disk so we talked about 40% of our code was was parts of the the Domesday disco and then we wrote all these additional exercises that allowed students to investigate these this field study centre the plants the animals the fishes the birds etc and then there was a module that did the management of it and they had to work out how to make the field study Center survive and thrive over a prolonged period of time a lot of the good features with the BBC micro were a result of a very constructive dialogue between the BBC and daikon it was it was a it was a creative tension he wasn't always easy we didn't like everything they they wanted but they were
