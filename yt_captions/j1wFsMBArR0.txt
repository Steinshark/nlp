i can see why they call them fidget cables they're uh [Laughter] so you might have noticed that uh i've been off social media for a while now this is why possibly the craziest smartphone gadgets video i've ever made and the first product is actually my first car it's a little smaller than i would have liked but no less useful you just screw in a smartphone holder work your phone in and this allows you to film perfectly smooth video and if you look here you can actually adjust the angle of the wheels which allows you to film different kinds of shots like being able to circle around your subject all with one push did you know that google has actually developed a project to start weaving technology into the things that you wear this idea of taking ordinary day-to-day objects and just infusing a little bit of magic into them they call it jackard and this is one of the first products to come out with it the connecti smart backpack so if we actually try it on right now you can see that this is a touch sensitive layer so i can actually just swipe down to skip next swipe up to go back and double tap to open the camera and take a timed selfie there's a lot of different commands you can set it up the way that you want it nothing that you couldn't do already with just your phone but it just means that you'd have to keep taking it out and being distracted by it okay now for a controller that i'm gonna be honest with you absolutely flawed me on the face of it yeah it's a gaming controller it's got nice hardware it's got a grippy matte finish it's got console quality buttons and really nice meaty triggers but i would argue that the best part of this is a software that comes with it what happens after you get the controller for starters the setup is instant you just install the app and it's good to go providing the games that you're playing support controllers the on-screen controls will be automatically mapped to these buttons and you could just tell that they've put a lot of care into this animations are smooth you can feel the phone subtly vibrate as you scroll the app feels so polished that it's almost like an extension of the ios i'm running it on this is the best mobile game controller i've ever used the only caveat is that it's ios only so i would love to see this come to android 2. now just before we get to the the thick boys serious gadgets but a couple of ones that are just cheap and cheerful but actually quite good first up is the fidget cable with the tagline finally a fun tidy durable cable i'd agree with all those things there's a whole bunch of different configurations you can go for but every one of them has the same soft matte high quality finish it feels fantastic and as far as the tidy part of that's concerned every cable is laced with magnets and this doesn't mean that you can just kind of drop it and it'll automatically wind itself up into a coil but it does definitely make it a step above a normal cable in that once you have wound it up it'll stay in place also i can see why they call them fidget cables they're uh they're very fun another simple one is the phone tether you just place this tag on the inside of your case and then from the outside you link up this wrist strap and just never drop your phone again it is like very very secure this is not going anywhere and the side perk of this is that you can also use the included clip to stick it onto pretty much anything else we've got a clever little phone stand here it kind of looks ultra generic on the face of it but it is surprisingly well thought out it's got a two-part design which means that a you can completely adjust the angle b you can fold over the second part to act as a stand in itself or c you can use it as a clamp to clip around a desk for example it works in portrait it works in landscape it's just generally a good one to have if you're planning on doing a lot of plane or train traveling you can keep your hands free and finally another one that falls into this cheap and cheerful category is the three-in-one smart viewer you just get your phone drop it inside and like magic it'll start wirelessly charging and switching its speaker output from the normal small phone speakers to this much bigger unit on the back it's about 50 louder the main problem is just that well like most generic smartphone accessories it's made with the iphone in mind first not the galaxy note 20 ultra which quite literally sticks out like a sore thumb all right now for the big guns so you might remember a couple of episodes ago i showed you a smartphone external monitor cool a bit later we had one that had a built-in battery so you didn't need a mains connection even better we then actually had one that combined that with the fact that it also had a 10-point capacitive touchscreen just like on your phone fantastic well this the air view which arrived to me in this almost pre-deconstructed package takes all of that and makes it wireless now it's also meant to have mm wave technology built inside of it the same tech used by 5g to give no lag at all but because this is a pre-production unit mine doesn't so i can't really say to you yes you should go out and buy this right now because i haven't tested the feature myself but it might be one to keep an eye out for however on a similar note there is something that i have managed to test properly and it's even cooler we're talking about the hyper mirror and it might just be one of a kind it allows you to wirelessly project the contents of almost any device onto almost any display you do have to plug a receiver into the screen and then plug a transmitter into your tech of choice which is all a bit of a faff but the result is worth it because this is by far the fastest snappiest wireless screen projection i've ever used the whole reason that you have to go through the faf of using their own transmitter and their own receiver is because this doesn't use wi-fi this actually does use the mm wave tech i just talked about and the difference is night and day it's so so responsive it's good enough to use on every tech product i tried it with and if you are enjoying the video by the way a sub to the channel would be sublime okay now i've got a couple of power related products that i want to show you and each one is more extreme than the last so first up is the super tank pro which admittedly already sounds pretty extreme it's a power bank and it's just good at everything it's compact it's got a nice sturdy aluminium alloy body it's got a huge 26 800 milliamp hour battery four usb c ports two high power ones for laptops two lower power ones for phones and earphones and overall this thing can push a total output of 138 watts so chances are that whatever you are going to be charging with it will charge at full speed now the next level up from that is the hypercube a very strange looking contraption and it's a whole bunch of things at once but primarily a triple fast wireless charging station but using a combination of these apparently patent-pending hinges and some inbuilt magnets it can fold itself into a cube offering a clock an alarm an inbuilt speaker system for soothing sounds a color changing led panel to act as a wake up light or a reading light and you'll notice that there's a little stand that flicks out from the wireless chargers on the side and that allows you to still use them while it's like this so that's kind of a lot but it's actually made a little sweeter with the introduction of the ampere power cube which on its own is nothing to write home about a pretty plain no-frills power bank really but the pins on top they actually line up with the pins on the inside of the hypercube and make it a wireless and be portable you can also change the color of this led lamp here but i gotta say one thing that i don't like about this is the capacitive controls on the alarm they just feel super old school anyways moving on chances are that your current smartphone charger probably has a power output of somewhere in between 18 and 30 watts and so in past marvel gadgets episodes i've shown you charges that go all the way up to 120. well that benchmark just keeps getting pushed further and further out because right here we have a pair of 200 watt charges the angle is this apple sells a 96 watt charging brick for 80 this is 85 but it can power four devices at once with a total power output of more than double plus it also just supports a lot of the standard smartphone charging protocols like operook charge and qualcomm quick charge so it's more likely to be able to charge your phone at its maximum power it's not giving you something that you can't achieve using multiple separate charges but this is a major decluttering tool and now for the grandest power product the stunning the unbelievable the made in china i don't know why this needed to be right on top but actually what's inside this box is the most extreme power bank you've ever seen capacity check it's got enough juice there to charge your phone 23 times over and it's got a lot of ports four usba's one usb c port one dc one car charger port and two full main sockets and it can use them all at once so to reiterate you could charge nine devices simultaneously oh and also i keep forgetting how heavy this thing is there's an led light on the front it's not the brightest but it would do the job but you know the coolest part of the entire thing is actually how it charges they call it double helix charging so for a lot of big power banks like this they use either usb-c or dc input to charge this can use both at the same time which means it can charge flat in two and a half hours or for some perspective that's less than the amount of time it would take an iphone to charge just a couple of years ago and this has the capacity of you know 23 iphones now i've got a couple of gamer gadgets and these are gonna get increasingly weird so first up is a quite affordable but good gamepad it gives you shoulder buttons up top and they're adjustable too so you can position them wherever your heart desires and there's no slipping around the fit is is quite firm but the main differentiator is this it's the fact that you have a medium-sized fan blowing cold air onto the back of your phone with hot air leaving from the sides if you don't like the idea of a full-on bulky gamepad though then these helmets yes helmets are a surprisingly functional alternative they're again shoulder buttons to be able to aim and fire and game but they're just very well considered you can either press the helmet itself or press the triggers behind them your choice depends on the size of your hands and whatever feels good to you you get these little rings that hang off them to keep your other fingers in for extra grip i guess the helmets are internally hollowed so they don't start accidentally pushing buttons on your phone and they're actually constructed of a zinc alloy so they feel kind of nice now if you thought that was odd you're in for a bit of a treat with this next one finger gloves i realize what it looks like but this is a legitimate product little grips reach your fingers to stop them skidding while playing games but also whose idea was this like when was the last time you got beaten really badly in a game of card and thought you know what i really need a pack of five contraceptives on my fingers the only reason i actually ended up getting these was because i thought the product page was hilarious simple and handsome ultra thin attack say goodbye to bloated eat chicken walking position artifact i don't want to be the one to tell them but they need a better translator all right i've saved two of the best value gadgets till the very end so first up is the elegantly named xiaomi me true wireless earphones basic 2. now i was super excited about trying these out because the first basics were amazing like proper bargain basement value true wireless earbuds they were basic in every sense of the word but the sound was fantastic for something like twenty dollars the strategy is a little different this time xiaomi's bumped the price up to closer to 30 but then for that they've tried to integrate a lot of the features you'd find in higher end earphones like bluetooth 5.0 auto paws upon removal you've got usb type-c a longer battery life bigger driver units for better sound i will say though they're kind of clunky looking i'm not a huge fan of that and also the bigger drivers haven't exactly led to better sound quality because instead of going inside your ears like the last generation these ones just kind of sit in front of them so i would say that while these are still amazing value they're not quite as good value as the first ones but one product line that just doesn't stop improving is xiaomi's mi bands and the latest mi band 5 has carried that flag forward the way that i would pitch this if you're not someone who's into fitness bands and smart watches is just that this is one of the best value watches full stop for just over thirty dollars it's a good quality water resistant digital watch with over 100 different faces to keep switching between it just so happens that this watch can also do a thousand other things it can keep track of your heart rate it can tell you the quality of your sleep it can control your music we can count your steps it can literally tell you how healthy you are versus other people of a similar gender and build to you and it can do all of that while lasting at least a week on a charge also guided meditation is a nice touch you follow this breathing rhythm it gives you and just one minute later your heart rate will be slower and it'll show you exactly how much buy all right if you enjoyed this video i've got a ton of other smartphone gadgets episodes so i'll link from here my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next you
