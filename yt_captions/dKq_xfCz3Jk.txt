[Music] all right what's up MKBHD here so this is the RG phone 6 Pro I just want to start off just by reading you the specs of this phone that I'm holding in my hand right here okay so it has a 6.8 in 165 HZ AMOLED display it's got a second OLED screen on the back too uh Snapdragon 8 plus gen one chip which has cores running at 3.2 GHz 18 18 GB of RAM 6,000 mAh battery with 65 W fast charging dual front-facing stereo speakers triple cameras including a 50 megapixel main camera and uh two USBC ports and a headphone [Music] jack thanks for watching now this phone's specs are ridiculous and they're ridiculous because it's a gaming phone and with a lot of these gaming phones in the past few years you could really say they were focused on one true goal to just be as great for gaming as possible but with the latest Generations you can kind of tell they actually have two goals now to be incredible with gaming and to also be really great to live with as a daily driver luckily a lot of what makes a phone great for gaming also makes it great for using in everything else but there are still definitely some challenges as you'll see in a second it's kind of like how sports cars back in the day notoriously used to be you know super difficult to drive tough manual gearbox really harsh ride great for some high performance fun but you wouldn't want to to drive it every single day like that and so in that analogy the Rog phone is like a Porsche 911 where it's taking the high performance stuff but it's also easier to daily drive at least it would like to be a Porche 911 so as far as performance goes as crazy as it sounds there's really not that much to say here this is now the fastest phone I've ever used not even on paper but just as far as pure responsiveness and feeling like my every touch and input is immediately responded to this sets The Benchmark now for me I drag my finger across the display and everything moves about as perfectly one: one as I've ever seen scrolling animations opening up apps multitasking all that stuff it's just crazy fast it's the new chip of course Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 but also this is now the fastest screen I've ever used the 165 HZ display and it's running with a 720 HZ touch sampling rate that's double last year which brings the touch latency down 23 milliseconds so you really notice things just follow your finger around the screen being super tight and everything being real Snappy across the board you know if it's synthetic benchmarks you care about here they are they'll show you it is slightly more powerful and also slightly more power efficient than the Snapdragon 8 gen 1 and technically still behind the iPhone 13 but I'm telling you right now nine times out of 10 the r feels faster than anything else and then even with the little stuff his phone just goes all the way to the max for performance it has ufs 3.1 storage it has lpddr5 Ram instead of DDR3 uh it even has Wi-Fi 6E any spec that you can think of at the very Max this phone has it so I don't even have to be a hardcore gamer or a PBG Enthusiast or anything to understand that if you throw a game at this phone it's probably going to be able to handle it so I'm going to leave the gaming testing to the gaming enthusiasts but then what about all the time that you're not gaming that's probably even more time than when you actually do play games on the phone how does the sports car drive when it's not on the track spoiler alert pretty good there is 18 gigs of ram in this phone like I said do you really need 18 gigs of RAM to play a single game no I don't think so I think that's for the headline but lots of RAM does help with multitasking so I find myself using the phone flipping back and forth between five or six open apps easy it keeps up no problem keeps them all open this is also the best display yet on a gaming phone not just in refresh rate but in brightness and overall quality they keep getting better this is a Samsung built moled panel that they've tuned to be really really fast but it's still got improvements in color accuracy it's hdr10 plus certified and it gets up to 800 nits it's not quite Flagship levels but very usable outdoors and in most environments the haptics are way better this is one of the things that was bad in the last phone but the they turn the haptics all the way up they've got a new motor in here and so anytime you're scrolling or typing or bouncing back and forth on things you really feel the clicky it's good it's good haptic motor and the underd display fingerprint reader which also was bad on the last phone is much faster so it seems like Asus was at least listening about the stuff we were nitpicking about in the last Rog phone for daily use you probably also noticed triple cameras on the back just like the R5 these are passable cameras so they have a new 50 megapixel primary camera like I said in here it's giving me decent images to their credit Asus usually has pretty good software tuning from my experience but I'm getting B minus to B+ pictures in good lighting it's just not very consistent with exposure or contrast so some of them look fine some of them just like flat and a little Overexposed to give you an idea this is a Sony IMX 766 sensor the same one you see in phones like the Oppo Find X3 and the OnePlus Nord 2T both of which are under 600 bucks you're probably not buying this gaming phone for the cameras but at least for the money you'd like it to be able to keep up with the other premium priced Flagship phones out there and it's just just a level behind it's nipping at their heels matter of fact let's just get it all in one place now so if you were thinking about getting a phone like this and these following things don't scare you off then it might be a good phone for you ready so the cameras definitely a weakness especially the camera layout Choice like even if this primary camera is passable I hate this camera layout it's a primary camera than a 13 megapixel Ultra wide which is a little softer and worse whatever that's not a shock but then the third camera is a macro camera instead of an ultra wide and it's not even a good macro camera so the cherry on top is they bury the macro mode like deep in the settings and like alternate photo modes so you'll almost never actually use it but they do prominently have a 2X button right here in the normal viewfinder which is just a 2X crop on the main camera you don't have a telephoto camera just put a telephoto camera there instead anyway so that's one then there's no wireless charging so they reor ented the Rog Vision display on the back of the phone it still does light up and play animations when the screen is on and when it's charging when you have an incoming call or any other notifications it's still super customizable and very unique to this phone but it does mean there's no room on the back for wireless charging so that's another thing and then there's just the sheer size of this phone like I say it every year but it's like the biggest phone that I review and uh it's not even it's not trying to be Sleek at all they've kept the huge bezels around on the top and the bottom huge stereo front-facing speakers in there it's thick but hey you know what it's a form factor where if you're gaming a lot you spend a lot of time holding it in Landscapes so you're going to need some spots for your thumbs so you don't block the screen when you're gaming that's all good it's got some extra thickness for extra cooling you got that extra USB port on the side that's good for charging the 6,000 Mah hour battery at up to 65 Watts with the included charger so that's the double play of great battery life and very fast charging and a headphone jack I mean it's just Asus and Sony keeping headphone Jacks around in their premium phones at this point but just you know all this stuff takes up space it's a big phone so uh yeah I also there's like little things like the ipx4 water resistance rating isn't quite up to flagships of this price might not matter to you unless you get really really sweaty while gaming I don't know but overall Rog phone 6 pro at the top of the lineup is a great overall bump up from rg5 ultimate it's what they're calling it so yeah it's a great high-end super performance oriented phone wrapped in a cyberpunk package with text printed all over it uh and it happens to be a pretty good daily phone too if those couple of things don't get to you and you know there's still there's going to be people always out there who want the crazy exotic McLaren or hardcore Lamborghini stiff suspension real tight steering handling and that's fine but I guess the difference is in the car world people who get cars like that usually have a different car that they drive most of the time daily and then they have the fun car but for a phone you typically just have one phone so you need it to do double duty so I do think the softening of this gamer phone into a more palatable daily phone and more well-rounded phone is a good thing so yeah props Asus for that good looks either way that's been it thanks for watching make sure you subscribe if you haven't already and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace
