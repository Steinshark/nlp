ladies and gentlemen the london real organization has now attacked the group of young journalists some of them are 15 years old who beat him so bad in an interview that he ran away early now london real has issued a statement calling them disingenuous saying that the fault was not with brian it's with them forget this brian doesn't have the receipts the kids do the kids like tracked the whole thing and now are exposing him live again for going back up against them it's incredible he just keeps digging or as uh my buddy david fuller would say rebel wisdom he's the grift that keeps grifting so i know it's another emergency broadcast y'all are sick of hearing about brian but oh boy hey this is the this is the best entertainment i get all year okay i'm gonna be streaming the election guys very soon as well you should know that it's coming right up but man i mean are you guys not entertained brian rose is now attacking kids let's take a look together shall we okay oh my gosh oh you gotta look at this check it out guys this is from left foot forward i guess a publication in england i guess rose's spokesman said that the young journalists were being disingenuous can we show that clip of where brian was getting destroyed real quick 20 minutes so we're just after the hour so howard's just giving me a shake here firstly brian didn't cut short the video wow he made time to talk to politics relaxed on a busy day and they rocked up late for their zoom it's the young journalists fault they're irresponsible kids that's what brian rose's organization is saying a bunch of twerpy kids causing trouble right pay attention to that the guys ask challenging questions and it would be good if more candidates were prepared to submit to a grilling like this so they're going hey we had to submit to the 15 year olds everyone should have to we got so destroyed oh my gosh but it's disingenuous to complain about the time they had when it was them who messed up their timekeeping okay so check this out so the guy brian rose is basically saying these twerpy kids he's accusing these kids of lying of lying ladies and gentlemen he's accusing them of not being real journalists being unprofessional rocking up late but guess who has the receipts not brian it's this guy this kid his name's felix he's a lovely guy i chatted with him here's the email between him and brian's team great brian might want to record on his zoo blink either way 5 10 to 5 45 p.m confirmed so it's supposed to go to 545 and this kid is here with the time being 5 33 that's when brian left the zoom call the kid had the wherewithal to show the time this kid is a genius dude brian went up against a kid journalist who knew his stuff and he got destroyed tried to attack him again now calling him disingenuous unprofessional whatever now he's getting destroyed again how good is this man oh it's so wonderful to see a guy dig his own grave so uh effectively now it's also worth noting that brian or brian's team addresses the copyright concern they say that the copyright concern is just uh them having to worry about repurposed stuff by unauthorized third parties i guess they're complaining about fair use there which is funny for a free speech org but they apply our content id to all recorded materials which use our assets eg zoom calls vlogs and the like so brian records every zoom call he's a part of and uploads it as if it's his possession which it's not by the way if i if i go and i go on like fox news and i zoom in it's not that's not my content they have the rights to publish that and what he's saying here is that they apply copyright to it that's not how it works also that's clearly not exactly true because brian rose also copyrighted the mail pluses coverage of him we'll talk about that another time but i've gotten copyrights that have no none of brian's content in it so this is an objective lie but i don't want to get in that right now because it's distracting from the main point the main point is is that brian rose went up against a bunch of kid journalists he thought it would be an easy softball interview and now he's spinning it as you know more candidates should be prepared to submit to a grilling like this he calls his interview a grilling and then says that it's not his fault he ran away the kid screwed up that turned out to be a lie the kids have a receipt how does this guy have any credibility left you're out attacking kids you're you're attacking kids oh man this is just it's too rich man i don't know where it goes here for brian but um i don't know how anyone can watch this and think this is professional but either way guys just go subscribe to the politics relaxed channel they're doing great work and really proud of them they may be the ones to take down bride like it wasn't me it wasn't rebel wisdom it wasn't any of us so yeah that's basically it thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next one
