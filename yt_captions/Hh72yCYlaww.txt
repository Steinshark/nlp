I'm curious I'm curious does PHP suck Real Talk does it suck it does PHP oh redo it oh dude I hate okay I hate this about YouTube you gotta stop doing this  okay when you have something that it's Auto paused when you full screen it it should not play okay that should not cause play that should not cause play all right all right kodemy.com learn to code let's find out does PHP suck I'm ready I'm willing my body is capable let's find out right now does PHP suck let's talk about it I think it does what's going on guys John Alder here from codeine.com and in this video we're going to talk about PHP and whether or not it sucks now stop right there I know you're about to click away because nobody cares about PHP and you don't either but you should maybe it might there's a lot of people that like PHP right what's the lambo guy name watch this what's the lambo guy's name what is it who's the guy with the lambo on on Twitter right now somebody's gonna know that several people will know this person's name go for it tell me right now not Aaron Taylor that's right jackforge no is it Taylor isn't it Taylor Lambo man the prime machine no not me what Taylor yeah it's Taylor yeah Taylor see look at that Taylor otswell Allen is his name Alan why would you guess Andrew Tate might just be the most important thing you ever learn no probably not but it is kind of important and it's worth spending a couple of minutes hearing what I've got to say about it now okay I'm ready I'm right hated for decades absolutely it's I've been around a long time and I can't remember a time when somebody wasn't complaining about PHP being absolutely terrible but it I guess when I started in what in 2007 doing my first website 2008 somewhere in there I thought PHP was fine with no one really made fun of it back then I I mean it kind of was like the option you know what I mean there wasn't like a lot of options going on yeah maybe I am a boomer maybe I'm not but uh you must be 34 I'm over 34. uh yeah so okay is it that's we're going to talk about in this video so why does everybody hate PHP the fact of the matter is PHP is incredibly easy to use and it's very quick to use there's nothing to install there's nothing to configure every single cheap web Hosting account out there has PHP already installed did I just get bamboozled there for a second he said there's nothing to install everyone has it installed you do have to install things you do have to install things especially if you're on docker barely nowhere uh even if you want to do that you gotta you definitely got to you know you gotta install a thing or two okay minimally minimally [Music] oh you did know her okay not a big fan of that phrase okay I'm sorry sorry Karen uh is there anything else you need for me because you know honestly I was doing something I'm a little offended that you just interrupt me like this that you demand my presence in the middle of me being a react Andy it's a little it's a little much Karen [Music] and if you have a more expensive hosting solution like Heroku or AWS or whatever it's very easy to get PHP up and running on those as well if you've got a cheap web Hosting account for like ten dollars a month and let's face it unless you've got a website with hundreds of thousands of users a 10 a month hosting accounts probably enough to get you started if you've got one of those accounts it has PHP on it all you have to do is upload a file called index.php or whatever.php type a little PHP code into there and it will just work that's opposed to every other web framework like Django like flask like Ruby on Rails like node where you have to learn two things the programming language and the web framework so you have so it's not a framework those are more run times than Frameworks right like nodes of runtime you know what I mean it's a little bit it's a little bit different and it's a little bit different you know I mean just a little bit you know what I mean you know what I mean you know what I mean you have to Learn Python and flask you have to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails you have to it's okay that's a good thing I'd say that's a good thing because right after you get done learning just a little bit when you want to make say two pages or you want to make some sort of custom routing all of a sudden what you're really dealing with is with uh Apache dot HT access files and you can't remember what the hell the syntax is and good luck trying to learn that crap way harder way harder just give me flask any day of the week in JavaScript and node and on and on and on with PHP there is no framework to learn now I know there are many there is a framework and use one but I've never used one it's like a runtime right a patchy's the thing running it with thousands of PHP websites in my life never once even touched a framework because you don't have to it just works without it so that makes it incredibly easy to get up and running no technically Works without it as well all you have to do is just import the HTTP thing start a server say a port boom you got it but if you want like fancy pantsy request handling like you have in say the HD access file then you have to kind of do the same thing right somewhere somewhere you have to specify and do it do you want to do an AC access file or do you want to do it inside the node function thingy call back just saying you know there's there's something there's always something doing something it's not for free it's never been for free install PHP in Docker is run oh my goodness gracious very quickly but I understand what he's trying to say so this thing could probably be summed up a little bit easier which is to have a simple website PHP is dramatically easier than anything else because you can take advantage of Apache and just run the damn thing and that's that it has a pretty good Pipeline and a lot of things already supported and you're just dropping in a file and writing it and the difference between the server and the client you don't really have to understand anything you just feel like it's magic and you're throwing in some weird angle bracket question marks and boom you're programming you don't really understand why but it turns out one's on server one's on the client Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam let's go small startups individuals people with not a lot of experience or coding skills and that's fantastic but it's also the reason why people hate PHP so much and I'll explain so there's a story that's been going around for decades I've heard it at least a dozen times in a dozen different ways and I'm going to tell you the story today so there's a company they hire an intern named Billy and Billy's sitting around without much to do because he's an intern so he's just kind of watching and over the days he notices that the company has a really weird inventory system it's mostly just a half dozen to a dozen Excel spreadsheets scattered all over the place and anytime somebody wants to do anything with inventory they need to pull up a specific spreadsheet fill it out it's a hassle then at the end of the month two or three people have to compile these spreadsheets and create all these reports it takes two or three days every month just to do it and it's a mess and Billy thinks why don't they have a centralized database for this and some little web interface to take care of all this stuff for them Billy's a smart ass is what Billy is okay you know what we tell you know what we tell you know what we do to Billy where I come from okay Billy gets walked out by two people holding him okay Billy get your ass out of this place right now okay we like our spreadsheets Billy and so he starts to build it now Billy doesn't know what he's doing he's not really a coder but he's watched a few PHP videos okay you know what I will say if you're not a coder and you've watched a few PHP videos I have several questions for you okay I want to sit down with you right now get on stream I'm not gutter just uh dabbled a little bit here and there in PHP watching voyeurism mostly um a voyeur on PHP okay Billy get the hell out of the startup Billy he doesn't he knows enough to be dangerous so he starts building this thing out little database a little web interface starts punching all this stuff together creates a couple of reports where you press a button at the end of the month and it does its stuff internally and spits out the report it looks pretty good so he shows it to his boss and his boss is ecstatic this is great we've been needing this for years thank you so much Billy but a healthy company who works he works you know who doesn't like a nice healthy company that's like hey yeah that sounds great oh I know I paused on the butt I get it let's find out what this butt is okay I like big butts cannot lie can you add this this and this report as well Billy says no problem pulls up his code his code's four or five pages it's not bad it's kind of messy it's not really indented correctly because he doesn't know what he's doing it's all single spaced it's a little hard to read there's no comments at all but Billy can read it because he just wrote it so he starts to modify it he starts to add this this and this report shows it to the boss fantastic thank you Billy that's great a couple of months go by and they use this thing and it works fine it does what it's supposed to do no problems whatsoever but then somebody else says you know what we really need this and this report and while you're at it this other report too Billy says no problem I can do at this point I hope Billy has been learning in his free time enjoying all of his wild successes from programming thus he's learned new techniques and he's not just recreating fizzbuzz this sounds like fizzbuzz are are we listening to fizzbuzz right now is Billy creating fizzbuzz I think so I think Billy's creating fizzbuzz right now and each report is another one of these multiples here we go do that he's feeling pretty confident these days so he starts coding and he adds this this and this report his code turns from five or six pages to nine or ten pages but it's fine he knows what he's doing he can read it I have never measured code in Pages real talk here this is the strangest form of measurement I've ever seen codemy guy don't say Pages like say lines of code you know like a couple hundred to a thousand right like we can get the trans you know we can kind of get it you know what I mean we can kind of understand what you're saying if you if you throw it on that but Pages like what are we talking about we talking about like you know uh you know double space High School paper page what are we talking about like you know a thick ass Stephen King novel page like what are we talking about here I need to know I need to know and he could figure it out no big deal a couple of months go by and another department here so go subscribe to this and they say hey can we get in on this action subscribe hey press the Subscribe button right now baby really use this too Billy says no problem starts coding there are inventory systems a little bit more complicated there's a few more things involved but he could figure it out it's no big deal but now his code's like 20 25 maybe 30 pages and it's getting a lot harder to read but it's okay so I haven't been in school in a long time it's 30 pages equivalent to like 100 lines of code like what zoom level are we in okay because right now I'm pretty zoomed in we got like what is this a page because I do like a I can do like a page down and that's like 11 lines of code is that what we're talking about 300 lines of code what are we talking about here is a Cobalt fine because Billy can still read it because he just wrote it he knows what it is and it's fine another couple weeks go by they asked for a few more reports to be added in he does some more tinkering all of a sudden it's 40 or 50 pages of code and that's fine it still does everything it's supposed to do it works fine well Billy I would like to say though that at this point if I heard this story and some person with no experience was able to handle that different many different generations of reports and produce 50 pages of code and make it work congratulate that kid get him a crown I don't care that you built it in PHP you just hacked your ass into that that is awesome congratulations let's go Giga Chad Billy let's go Giga Chad Billy you know what it was a good run but we're about to hear the downfall of Billy that son of a we're gonna escort that some clean out of this place he's cruising for bruising right now okay he realizes he did a pretty good job with this thing right his bosses are thrilled the boss is in the other department are thrilled everyone's talking about Billy it's great so he puts it on his resume and he shops out his resume and in like 30 seconds he gets a half dozen job offers from other companies for double or even triple what he's making as an intern what does Billy do Billy takes off he takes that job making triple what he was making as an intern and he's a hell yeah Billy you son of a  you're going straight to Lambo money with that kind of if you could just triple that triple that's practically a 10xer okay Bubba Billy over the moon company sad to see him go but that's what happens these days people come and go all the time that's what you do you build things you put them on your resume you get a better job somewhere else for double the money that's how these things work right is that how this works have I done this wrong which you know for those that don't understand what he just said you know not us obviously uh this is for the Future YouTube viewers could you just by chance put what you would put on a resume to double or triple your income like just just you know just for fun just throw it just throw it on there what would you put on there what will you you know let's explore the space for a second graduated from CMU got him if it ain't CMU you're I don't have anything clever to say I know PHP big times x x Fang just spell it f-a-n-g scrum master of scrum Lord I'm Billy no big deal and a year goes by and they use the thing and it keeps working and it's great and then another year goes by and then they hear from their manufacturer we're updating our inventory codes just letting you know company freaks out uh oh no this system isn't going to work what are these new codes we only need to update it Bob you're our senior programmer have at it now Bob knows what he's doing he's been around the block he's been coder for 20 years he's great he opens Billy's code and kind of throws up a little bit inside he cannot read it he has no idea what it is there's not a single comment it's single spaced 40 pages you can't make heads or tails of it it is a nightmare Bob shakes his head and goes  PHP now does PHP suck Bob shouldn't have said  PHP okay he should have said Billy Billy where the are you you know what he really should have said though is he should have said hey I'll just use rip crap search up a couple terms we'll get this done okay I'm not making any improvements though you want me to do this you want me to extend this guess what we're rewriting it okay that's your choice you want me to rewrite it or just change the product codes that's that it's gonna take me four weeks of course naturally Bing you know what I'm talking about you know what I'm talking about does prettier exist no not not in PHP PHP doesn't have a prettier it just has shittier and so if you run shittier on your code base it makes it worse job security Bob thinks so and all the other real programmers out there think so because this is what happens to them they get code that somebody that doesn't really know what they're doing created oh I just realized I really want to create the plug-in shittier and all it does is just make your code slightly shittier looking oh my goodness would that just not be the greatest thing ever oh my goodness just make shittier and that's it it's like prettier but it's shittier oh my goodness oh it's so smart oh it's so good oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness um and p uh uh uh make dirt shittier uh shittier uh and uh oh let's use let's like do I have pnpm Annette why do I have that no uh wait yes no I did no what the hell oh crap yeah that's that's that's a Alias I have yarn a knit yes okay um Vim this we'll go package that okay I think I can just do that and go uh npm publish primogen shittier cannot do that can I just shitty or Taken oh can I just publish needs off hold on hold on one second hey Luke take this out if you're if you're watching this or skip this part hold on I'm gonna off this hold on hold on uh npm login uh open up this browser hold on real quickly I mean if we're going to do this we gotta have we gotta have you know oh my goodness please tell me I know how to log into this oh my goodness do I not know how to log into this do I not know how to log into this oh my goodness forget it it was stupid anyways I didn't want to make stupid shittier hey no one take it okay I gotta go figure this out later okay gotta go figure that stupid stuff out later okay stupid shittier I hate npm I hate npm and the code works but when you have to maintain it or change it years later it becomes quite a hassle and that is like I think 98 of the reason why people hate PHP foreign I mean I love the story he told I like the things he's saying but I'm not convinced that's the reason why people hate it real talk I just don't think that's the reason why okay I just don't think that's why people hate it I think people hate it because the language is just not that great okay it's just a procedural mess language that's very easy to get things messy and I know it's made a lot of improvements over the years you got all this object orientation see what I did there and all those other things right uh still I still don't love it you know what I mean I'm still not gonna love PHP now I hear laravel makes PHP a lot better maybe it makes a lot better I haven't used it it could be a lot better but my experience as you know back in the day PHP actually sucked just because it was just bad it was just shittier it's because it's so easy it allows people with not a lot of experience not a lot of knowledge to build stuff which is great we loved that but also there's a flip side to that when it comes to maintaining that Legacy code over years when that person has moved on to the next job as is always the case right so if anybody ever asked Bob what do you think is a PHP he's going to tell him exactly what he thinks which is that it sucks but it's just a tool like a hammer if you hit somebody over the head with a hammer you're an idiot it's not the Hammer's fault and it's the same with PHP it's just a tool like any other now there is no doubt python is a better programming language Ruby is a but then he just defeated his own argument you can't say it's just a hammer no it's not a hammer it's a really shitty hammer right it's like a hammer that's like taped together and when you hit stuff sometimes it just like falls apart one time I was playing golf and my clubs are so old that when I went and I putted as I hit the ball my my Putter's head fell off okay that's PHP okay that right there my friends that's PHP better programmingham in JavaScript is probably a better programming language that was a base take right there okay can we all agree that was a good take all right the fact that he said JavaScript probably you know a little hesitancy to it like not sure yet but it definitely we'll say it's better for the sake of this video still decent it's still okay and it's so easy has such a low barrier for entry that is great for all kinds of different things startups that don't have a lot of money to hire lots of Engineers if you've got an idea and you want to crank something out with PHP over a weekend you can shop that around Adventure capitalists and use it to raise money to then hire people and build your real app right I think that's a little too easy that's you know I I see what he's saying he's saying it's fast easy to get something up and started um I would argue that I don't see how any of the more modern Frameworks or modern languages aren't as easy as PHP at this point uh and this idea that you as a programmer who's brand new you're gonna build a product really quickly and ship it out and be able to get someone to invest into it they just won't because you know the thing about Venture capitalism and the thing about making putting millions of dollars into an idea is that the people who put millions of dollars into the idea not only think the idea is sound it has some sort of provable concept that's going to work but B they have to also believe in the staff with whom is creating it and they're like hey do you know how to program he's like no but I did just buy a Lambo like that's just not gonna fly you know what I mean yeah I get it you know I get that you can make reasonable progress but it's great for that it's great for individuals who maybe aren't working with a team and never will if you just want to build a website you want to do a quick and easy bang PHP is great you can do a lot of stuff very quickly and very easily with it like I said it's very cheap to host any web Hosting account will have PHP already installed and ready to go nothing to install nothing to con so I think the thing that I I should have probably realized here is the t-shirt is the dead giveaway this is to people that are brand new to coding right that just don't have a lot of experience I don't think this is necessarily good advice okay I I genuinely would say that would would probably fare a lot better for you if you're brand new to programming is just learn JavaScript I know I don't like JavaScript it's totally stupid not a big fan of it but the reality is that you're gonna be able to build a front end you're going to be able to build a back end you're going to be able to build a CLI tool you're gonna be able to do a bunch of things with that single individual language and you can learn how to program now once you've learned how to program at that point just go and learn rust okay it's the end game you can tweet stuff it's fantastic uh man you can brag on people it's the best language ever but until you get good at some form of programming just start with JavaScript okay and then if you want to get good at programming you actually want to become great at programming learn some C or something that really teaches you about memory and like segmentation fault yourself 9 000 times you know get good at it experiment a little bit with go like do a little bit with rust do a little bit maybe hey maybe maybe you know get a little bit wild here okay get a little deep in there go check out some assembly go do a bunch of different things and just experience the whole thing even throw down a little bit of java that's fine learn a bunch of different stuff and then from there take that and figure out what you like okay if you want to be a good programmer that's really the best way to become a good programmer okay a good programmer is not someone that's ever only programmed in one language okay when you see someone that is a tech influencer and they have never they've literally used One Singular language and that is all they know and that's the only environment they know then they're not a good Tech influencer okay hands down simple as that they should not be Tech influencing they have nothing to compare anything to and they don't know sorry I didn't believe myself I didn't bleep myself my bad baby oh my goodness uh but really like you have to know multiple languages I think you should have that experience you should be able to see problems from different perspectives now once you've gained that then hey pick the one you love the most because you don't even know what you don't love right you don't even know what you love you don't even know what you hate you just used one thing your whole life and that is your only perspective okay see look at this people love C sharp go for it love C sharp I don't care that you love C sharp but if you haven't learned something else other than c sharp like if you don't know golang you don't know okay that's the reality if you think C Sharp's the end game and that's the only thing you ever learned guess what you suck okay that wait I just believed it so sound like it said you no you suck okay that's the reality to the whole situation okay so go learn a couple things okay go experience go spread your wings sow your Wild Oats all right that's my take away from this video you love lamp stack okay okay we got a PHP lover in here nothing to worry about it just works so if you've been on the fence for pH it's meme time it's meme time I Love Lamp uh meme generator please tell me this is just available there we go yes this is the one yes yes yes I feel like when I see this the only thing I keep thinking in my head over and over again is I love zamp right this is for all my PHP devs out there right this is so it just feels so right it just feels so right doesn't it feel doesn't it feel good it feels good doesn't it yeah you forgot yeah you did didn't you we all forgot about it and we'll go on here and we're just gonna throw this out there I'm gonna give uh I'm just I'm just gonna just put it in there okay I'm just gonna put it out there no care for how it does we're just gonna look at it we're gonna see what happens all right let's finish this off HP give it another chance let's finish this dude off that's it has its place I've used PHP for years at one time I owned a network of over 6 000 websites all built with PHP serving up literally hundreds of millions of pages and they all worked without a hitch for years and I made a lot of money with those websites so it's like anything the right tool for the job always so don't just discount PHP because you heard somebody say that it sucks it's probably Bob because he's bitter and angry over having to spend three months unraveling Billy's horrible code and he is never gonna stop talking about that and never gonna stop hating PHP that doesn't mean PHP is horrible so over at codemy.com I have a course on PHP I'll give it to you today for free there'll be a link in the description below with a coupon code so you can sign up I guess explain 20 30 videos not a lot because it doesn't take a lot to learn PHP give it a try check out the videos if you're interested it's my gift to the gods of PHP for inventing something that's so easy for so many people to use and I really think you should give it a try and make up your own mind so one point I'll I'll give them one point of some credit here credit where credit's due um if you don't want to get into programming but you wish to do some interaction with the computers and you just want to get WordPress up and running and do whatever I think he's right PHP is probably the easiest way to go okay on my site I'm gonna just say it out there you want to get something up and running you don't really want to learn programming but you might have to do a little bit of programming I get it it's probably it's probably the right move not saying it's a great move I'm just trying I'm still Manning his argument okay you've got to be able to steal man every argument you hear no matter how much you don't like it okay so that's all for this video if you'd like to be sure to smash like button below subscribe to the channel give me a thumbs up for the YouTube algorithm and check out

why you putting that photo of me up there
