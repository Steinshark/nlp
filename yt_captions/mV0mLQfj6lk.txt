tired of getting tea bagged disappointed by dim hdr well microsoft wants you to have one less excuse for being terrible with a designed for xbox display theoretically you can trust your tv to deliver exceptional response times breathtaking visuals and even immersive sound but is this program all it's cracked up to be to find out i've got three of them lined up right here and you see this little sticker right there look at that cute little xbox sticker spoiler alert in spite of that being there at least one of these is absolute trash what's never trash though is my segways to sponsors like cablemod thanks to cablemod for sponsoring today's video cablemod's new keyboard cable configurator is the easy way to complete your keyboard look you can customize almost anything and receive your handmade cable in two weeks or less check them out at the link in the video description [Music] this is not the first time a console maker has taken a crack at making or certifying a tv nintendo and sharp teamed up to make a tv in the 80s with a built-in nes sony made the terrible but at least interesting playstation 3d tv that allowed two people to game simultaneously for some reason okay that thing was cool you're wrong objectively wrong and there's also the more boring but more practical playstation tv but what we've got here is less like those and more like a certification program which makes me think of things like the vasa display hdr standards or the blurbuster seal of approval and the basic premise of the designed for xbox display program is pretty sound microsoft's basic pitch is that finding a tv that delivers a great gaming experience is a bit of a pain in the butt and honestly i agree with them it's easier than ever to show up at costco grab whatever tv looks decent for the price and end up with a very solid tv that kind of sucks for gaming you might get misled by its 120 hertz capabilities that rely on motion smoothing or find out that the picture is good because of a bunch of image processing that adds 50 to 100 milliseconds of delay essentially making every game feel like jello no matter how many fps your fancy new xbox series x is putting out so here's what you have to have to meet the design for xbox display program you must support hdmi 2.1 hdr 4k at 120 hertz and variable refresh rate now most of this is really good in fact the fact that consoles now support 120 hertz and variable refresh rates will legitimately make your gaming experience feel smoother but i do wish that microsoft had gone a bit further specifically with the hdr requirements more on that later let's start by taking a look at our first monitor here the philips momentum 559 m19 yv wow what a mouthful but i already kind of love it because look at this matte screen how often do you see that these days that's freaking awesome and there's a lot more to like here it's got a va panel with 95 coverage of the dci p3 color space so that's 125 of srgb it's display hdr 1000 certified with a peak brightness of 1200 nits they claim a 4001 contrast ratio with a delta e of less than 2 and it has philips's cool ambiglo feature which makes it so that the wall behind it and you won't see that because we actually went and put our own light back here but the wall behind it will kind of match what is being displayed on the screen i'm sorry did i see in the notes that the sound bar is like bowers and wilkins collaborated or something yeah really huh it actually sounds not bad yeah i mean bowers and wilkins it's like i wouldn't describe it as value from my experience but damn daniel oops [Music] shortcut i definitely feel the slow pixel response times of the va panel you do you don't no david back me up here well i mean like i measured it what do you think the pixel response is on this i would say somewhere in the neighborhood of like eight milliseconds 5.2 is what i measured well but they're both bad i mean depending on pricing okay like if we're coming in way cheaper than something like an oled and if my installation is gonna be in a brightly lit room i might be willing to make that trade-off right or if all i do is game and i'm really concerned about things like my hud getting burned in okay right you've got my attention but it's it's noticeable maybe open up halo all right forza is notorious for motion blur okay that's fair that's fair maybe some of it is just forza being a smeary mess you know what you're right the smeariness is not nearly as bad wow he died the smeariness is much much better it's definitely still there especially if you compare to something like an oled but it's absolutely usable this gives us an interesting opportunity to have a look at its full array local dimming performance it's only got 48 zones which basically means that under normal circumstances when you're looking at bright content like this probably won't be that noticeable but if you've got black bars yeah you can really see that's not really black it's more like it's more like a glow i mean to be clear it's not the same kind of glow you get from like an ips glow but it's if you're in a dark room you'll notice it yeah so the price of this is sixteen hundred dollars which is pretty much exactly the same as an lg c10 that's 55 inches that's a bit of a problem yeah it's funny to me given how hard microsoft worked to support dolby vision on the xbox series that it's not part of the requirements but i can also kind of see why because my understanding is it's quite a lot harder for tv manufacturers to implement and they wanted to be able to have as many partner devices as they can with that in mind let's move on to one of the other partner devices shall we next up we've got the rg strix xg43uq this one's 4k 144hz though it is limited to 120 on the xbox also a va panel 1000 nitpick brightness only 90 coverage of dci p3 but they claim a delta e of less than one and we actually measured 1.05 which isn't what they claimed but is still really impressive it's edgelit which means that we're probably not going to see the same kind of contrast that's a very unusual thing for an hdr display meaning i guess we better fire up a game here and see if it actually manages to look very hdr my expectations are extremely low i think i've already figured out which one's the poo poo one alex yeah did i did i do that try out the uh remote okay try out the remote you know i think wow what what it worked it's never worked for me oh really oh oh now it's not not doing anything else oh my god i already see it alex this display has a bit of an unusual subpixel arrangement so instead of rgb it's bgr and among other things it can make text look kind of weird but i actually noticed it just on like the edges of objects yeah we can inspect it further later but that is what i have in there like clear type you can make text better in windows but for like games browsers video it just looks bad interesting if i had to guess i'd say it's probably worse than the other one what'd you measure so they claim one millisecond response time and that's one millisecond moving picture response time okay so which is pretty dirty response time it's actually 6.9 milliseconds milliseconds okay all right which is fine for a va panel but if you're comparing it to something like an oled you're not you're not really there the thing is though you can't buy an oled at this size so if you want something smaller you're going to be stuck with something not oled yeah you can you can even see it here david do you see that how the leading edge of this text is blue and the trailing edge is orange it's there my eye can definitely most definitely see it bottom line is the color accuracy is great but at a price of 1300 us dollars you shouldn't buy this you should spend the extra couple of bucks for one of these or an lg c10 or c1 all right let's find out how damn cool acer's xv 282 k is oh why this not wait what we need to science this we need to show people why this sucks so bad oh we do okay yeah i want to just put it on the floor i brought a microscope in here you did yeah look at this all right fine one option to show you this would have been a macro lens but we wanted to go more hardcore than that with a really really really macro lens got the microscope okay you ready are we going to be able to okay here we go oh jeez boy wow that was that was really close yeah basically that's what i was talking about before it's all bluey on one side and orangey on the other side really it's only when you're looking at something white on a different background which makes sense because that's when all three sub pixels are going to be going full bore let's move on this is our first ips panel of the bunch it's 4k 144 hertz as well again 120 hertz on xbox 10 bit color only 400 knit peak brightness aka hdr rent and the only difference from the non-xbox version appears to be that it has a green accent here rather than a red one they boast a delta e of less than one we measured one point three which isn't less than one but is still excellent and it's got an i save panel which means it's approved by two tuv yeah sure uh basically means less blue light emission and it's supposedly better for your eyes now one thing i'm not really sure what to expect from it is smeariness i wonder if i just have a preference for ips panels because honestly it feels less smeary to me than those vas even though i can see that you said it actually has the worst response times out of the three yeah i also didn't have a problem with this one at all and the other ones i didn't really like weird yeah it's like measurably worse but and yet here we are yeah it's just way better to use it goes to show you that the actual science of benchmarking something like response times is incredibly complicated and one measurement can't tell you the entire story because the user experience of this one is miles better missed opportunity by the way alex ltt store desk pad it's not here your console gamer that's okay um you can get a t-shirt ltdstore.com the hdr experience is basically not hdr it's taking in an hdr signal but at nine hundred dollars my expectations are that you're going to need to have some kind of whether it's per zone or per pixel dimming in order to get that that high dynamic range right it's not just about that it's not bright enough it's about when you're in a forest like this and the sun is shining through the trees and illuminating the leaves and glinting off the trunks you're not getting that effect there's no impact from it to be clear it's not bad my biggest problem with this display is that it's being marketed as an xbox gaming display like it has other cool features it has a built-in kvm so if you have if you're a developer let's say who also games it's 4k you know high refresh rate uh you can have your two machines both hooked up to it simultaneously and quickly switch between them that's super cool i don't know if it's 900 super cool to you but the fact that it's hdr support is so bad means that if i don't get a value out of those additional features and the color accuracy for that matter i i just don't really i just don't really see it so bottom line what does the xbox certified sticker mean kind of not much yeah especially because we've found better xbox gaming tvs and monitors that do not have the certification yeah that's like a good monitor and a bad gaming display it's kind of rough yeah just like this segway to our sponsor squarespace we use it no joke we actually use it both our linusmediagroup.com and
