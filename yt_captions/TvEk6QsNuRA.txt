in 2018 tsmc broke ground on fab 18 near tainan city in the south of taiwan fab 18 is a monster it sits on 103 acres and has a total floor space of 950 000 square meters that is about three times the size of a t stadium in dallas texas home of the dallas cowboys in total across all of its phases fab 18 will cost tsmc nearly 20 billion dollars to build and operate more than the cost of the uss gerald r ford the us navy's most advanced aircraft carrier in this video we're going to look at why tsmc's fabs are getting bigger and more expensive than ever before and why that makes a lot of economic sense for the taiwanese chip maker but first let me talk about the asian armature newsletter if you subscribe to the channel you should also sign up to the newsletter lately i've been trying to add more exclusive content to the newsletters and they have been quite well received so i think it's worth your while you can find the link to the newsletter in the video description below or you can just go to agenometry.com i try to put out one every week maybe two alright back to the show there are a lot of ways to classify a fab generally the place to start would be to look at their sheer numerical output denominated in the number of wafers tsmc's bread and butter are logic fabs which make microprocessors and the like the company has three volume classifications mini fabs with ten thousand to thirty thousand wafer starts a month currently tsmc is building a 12 billion dollar five nanometer fab in arizona fab 21 as it is called sits on a one thousand one hundred acre plot in phase one the company is targeting twenty thousand wafers by the first quarter of twenty twenty four this would make it a mini fab mega fabs which do between thirty thousand to one hundred thousand wafer starts a month and the gigafab with capacity for over 100 000 wafer starts a month this is a tsmc marketing term that they apparently trademark but the wafer start number by itself is kind of useless you got to have some context different fabs have different levels of profitable production modern day logic fabs for instance generally target 80 000 wafers a month then there are remembering fabs like the types owned by samsung yangtze memory and sk hynex these produce memory modules like dram and nand a memory fab needs to do a whole lot more typically exceeding 120 000 wafers this and the fact that memory is a more generalized product is why the memory industry sees such brutal business cycles of overproduction you also have your more niche outputs these fabs are going to be a lot smaller analog chips which convert signals between the physical world light heat pressure such and such and the digital world cmos image sensor chips they go into your digital cameras mems which are tiny little electromechanical systems these are pretty cool and i will probably do a video about them in the future tft lcd panel fabs and so on gigafabs are conceptually the same as the mega and mini fabs they run the same instruments and processes but scaled up and in higher quantity usually a development fab pioneers the first recipe for a particular node process the company then needs to scale it to its other fabs so that they can use it too every company has their own way of doing this intel scaling paradigm is famously called copy exactly it attempts to do that technology transfer without compromising quality or yield by implementing the existing recipe without any modifications early on tsmc used this policy for their own fab scaling their version was copy exact but over time they seem to have tweaked it a little allowing for more flexibility process engineers monitor what is going on with all of their lines in all their fabs if a process engineer tweaks something and it works out to be a little better than the baseline then all the other process lines can be realigned to follow suit they call this new philosophy fab matching facilities are starting to cost a whole lot more in 1983 umc spent about 200 million dollars to build a 1.2 micron fab in 1999 they spent 1.8 billion dollars for a 0.35 micron fab in 2007 a 65 nanometer fab would cost 10 billion dollars in 2010 tsmc invested about 9.4 billion in total across four phases to build its nanometer gigafap in taichung fab 15. eight years later that five nanometer fab in tainan fab 18 will cost nearly double of that the tsmc gigafab's sheer size is partially why it costs tens of billions of dollars like i mentioned the gigafab is just a scaled up big brother more equipment more money but the equipment itself has also gotten more expensive over the years much of those price increases is tied to the ballooning cost of cutting-edge photolithography equipment such equipment accounts for 70 of total manufacturing costs and a staggering 20 of a fab's entire budget photolithography is generally a bottleneck in the fabrication process so foundries want to buy as many as they can feasibly afford and install these systems today cost a whole lot more as engineers struggled to overcome various physical limitations the price tag for a new cutting-edge system like euv and its follow-up high-end a euv are pushing 300 million dollars per system these systems will not only cost more outright their sheer size and complexity mean that tsmc and other foundries will have to build and maintain larger clean rooms to operate them clean rooms are one of the core drivers of fab expense increasing demands on air purity ranging from class 1 to class 10 and beyond make them more expensive to build and run while at the same time they're getting larger tsmc's fab 14 clean room is 31 000 square meters large or over 5.5 soccer fields fab 15's clean room is 104 000 square meters 14.5 soccer fields fab 18 has them all beat with a 160 000 square meter clean room 22.4 soccer fields the cleanliness requirements were ratcheted up for early euv tsmc's early euv machines lack something called a pellicle a polymer film just one micrometer wide commonly used to prevent stray particles from messing up the wafer projection asml eventually developed a suitable pellicle but before then tsmc operated in ultra-strict cleanliness standards less than one particle over 52 nanometers wide the size of a small virus each week uv added countless engineering complications right down to the very floors since taiwan has issues with earthquakes and its tainon fabs are located near the high speed rail the clean rooms have to be elevated and placed on dampeners to prevent vibration issues from ruining the wafers this adds additional complexity to using euv because those machines use co2 lasers to generate euv light much of the infrastructure for that machinery has to go underneath the clean room floor another substantial challenge to overcome with all these fabs costing tens of billions of dollars you sort of have to think in 2020 tsmc made 45 billion dollars in revenue and had 23 billion dollars of cash on their books they have all these maps including the four gigafabs and those cost billions of dollars to run what are the economics here how does tsmc justify spending a quarter of their revenue on a single facility is this financially sustainable tsmc started building these increasingly larger fabs for a number of interlinked reasons their biggest concern is in maximizing their speed capacity and customer value you can do it right do it fast or do it cheap pick two i have repeatedly seen that tsmc is not as concerned about doing it cheap than it is about doing it fast one example takes place during the chinese new year taiwan celebrates cny by sending everyone home for a week to be with their family but tsmc told its builders that it will pay an extra 140 dollars per day per worker who works during the holiday another example tsmc's nighthawk army r d engineers who work overnight shifts inspired by foxconn's hard driving 24 7 operation style nighthawk workers receive thirty percent higher salaries and fifty percent higher bonuses in taiwanese culture to work overnight is said to hurt your liver so the shift is referred to as a liver buster with this in mind tsmc is not really a low-cost leader for instance it is known that samsung foundry frequently offers lower prices slashing prices is not tsmc's preferred way of doing business rather tsmc seeks to offer value their fabulous customers tend to have good margins and thus can pay higher prices if it means that they can get good product on time an example of the strategy is how the company invested in upgrading his customers experience and lowering their entry costs starting in 1997 morris tang began pushing the company to become more of a service oriented enterprise they created the e-foundry initiative which sought to better manage the flow of information between the foundry and its customers fabulous companies can now know where exactly their order is in the development cycle tsmc also focused on bending the cost curve for end users with programs like its cyber shuttle service fabulous companies need to create masks to prototype their chips something called a new type out or nto but an nto can cost millions of dollars which small companies cannot always afford so tsmc offered a service where different customers can put multiple ntos on a single wafer sharing their costs a fab needs to produce you're investing immense capital costs to build the whole facility and fill it with equipment if that equipment is not being used then money is being wasted and customers start getting impatient and mean thus tsmc thinks about cycle time as much as it thinks about yield cycle time measures how much time it takes to run through a single layer on a wafer cycle time is measured in days per mask layer or dpml the lower your dpml the better faster cycle times are no longer a nice to have as process nodes get more sophisticated wafers have multiple layers that need to get prepped etched and washed over the years the layers have gone up in number as the process nodes advanced back in the late 1990s a 180 nanometer chip has about 25 layers and it took about two days to do one of those layers so the full 25 layers would take about two months tsmc's n14 and n16 processes had 60 layers and 10 has about 78 the n7 process 87 layers and n5 would have been 115 layers had euv not been used to replace a few it stands right now at 81. had tsmc not improved their cycle times one and five wafer would take nearly eight months to do such long lead times are unacceptable in the fast-moving super competitive electronics market bigger fabs help contribute to those faster cycle times the gigafab is made up of many phases connected together by an automatic material handling system but the whole process goes only as fast as its bottleneck phase equipment frequently breaks down or has to be taken offline for maintenance for instance ion implanters are down 30 to 40 percent of the cycle when a machine goes down planned or otherwise every wafer in the production line has to wait for its turn in the machine so having four tools in your clean room instead of one makes it less likely that all four go down at the same time wafer batches can immediately and automatically be routed to the next process step without bottlenecking the process simulations done in 2006 found that depending on the various tool workstations and utilization rates growing a fab eight times over can reduce its cycle times by nearly fifty percent in order to take full advantage of these scale benefits fab operators create sophisticated planning models and queue processes so that each wafer batch arrives at the right workstation at the ideal time one other thing that tsmc has that other foundries do not is its massive roster of customers companies like apple amd qualcomm nvidia and mediatek are unique in the industry they are able to afford higher prices while also buying in high volume tsmc leverages this customer base to its advantage it is famously known that apple on occasion provides a few billion dollars up front for a supplier to build a facility in return they get a guaranteed supply of a particular component i've heard speculation that apple might be doing the same for tsmc but i haven't seen any evidence to confirm it tsmc likes to own their fabs outright and they are more than capable of raising their own capital rather it is more that apple's buying heft allows tsmc to forecast their future demand better and justify a massive gigafab scale investment it knows that it can rely on its lead customers to take capacity each year might not sound like that big of a deal in this current chip shortage environment but market crashes often happen furthermore by servicing them tsmc keeps these prestige customers from taking their profitable business elsewhere smaller foundries like global foundries are stuck with lower profit customers lacking in scale so it's no surprise that global foundries makes negative gross margins really does make tsmc the apple of the foundry business which is why like apple they take much of the profits in the whole industry what makes tsmc yet harder to compete with is how aggressively they eat their own children tsmc offers its customers a variety of node processes you have the leading edge medium and mature processes tsmc spends billions of dollars to develop a leading edge process for a premier customer like apple they will charge a lot for it but because the yield is low and depreciation expense is high gross margins won't be so great but once the leading edge is done tsmc's engineers very rapidly turn around and start applying its benefits not to the mature processes but the medium ones with the explicit goal of cannibalizing those medium node users i earlier mentioned a specific example of this in action where tsmc uses euv to rapidly replace wafer cycles that used to have been done by immersion duv in older methodologies in 2018 tsmc debuted the n7 process step a year later it moved on to create n6 an evolutionary step introduced with the intention of rapidly replacing n7 and it has done so at a speed that surprised many industry observers from 15 to 50 in a single year i suspect n6 is very profitable for tsmc and it echoes what i said in my previous video about the uk's ibm the business and strategic importance of maintaining technical supremacy in the industry when you're the best in the world at something you'll eventually find a way to monetize it tsmc is very secretive about their fabs very open about many other things their product offerings customer service strategy financial performance so on but i have a hard time finding any material on their fabs and how they work the paper trail goes cold sometime in 2010. it is interesting to compare this with asml who is very open about their engineering research findings the european company is constantly publishing material about their latest efforts who knows if there's a particular reason for this but here's my irresponsible guess in 2009 tsmc won a lawsuit against a competitor smic for stealing trade secrets and recipes the shanghai company quickly took share in the china market and abroad using these secrets after winning i reckon tsmc shut down hard on any content about how their fabs work and what goes on inside i guess it makes a lot of sense but it definitely makes understanding how and what they do much more difficult to dig out all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching if you
