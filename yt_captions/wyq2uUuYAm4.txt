ladies and gentlemen it is my pleasure to welcome you back to Norway chess 2023 it's a super Tournament being held in Stavanger Norway and it's got a unique format where every individual plays a classical game of chess against each other worth three points and obviously zero for a loss and if the game is in a draw it goes to an Armageddon format with 10 minutes for white 7 minutes for black and black getting draw odds equaling a victory uh this tournament has had a lot of very interesting storylines the struggles of Magnus Carlson to win a game of Justin classical uh the Resurgence of Hikaru Fabiano caruana going back to number two in the world and many other storylines and today we will continue the action uh that is not a spoiler that is uh that is just yesterday's standings and uh I never changed round four so there you go we're gonna change that right now round five uh New World number two look at that we're gonna we're in a little live editing uh I apologize for this I have had a long day I have had a headache for most of the day so please bear with me uh let me know in the comments if you prefer this more relaxed Gotham you know or if you want me to act like a psychopath in every single video that I recorded um three games for you today we have Hikaru versus orientari Fabiano caruana versus chakraf and Magnus Carlson versus Anish giri and uh we can start here the struggles of one Magnus Carlson now struggles is a bit of a strong word he has won many of these matchups in the Armageddon but he has not won a game of classical chess he hasn't uh and he actually didn't today either his game against Anish was relatively lackluster and instead Magnus relied on the Armageddon where he gets 10 minutes to anisha's uh seven and Magnus needs to win the game um and then obviously Hikaru and Fabiano have their own very unique storylines for this tournament so the um Armageddon game between Magnus and Anish took a turn because Magnus played Knight C3 in their classical game it was a Catalan and it actually wasn't a game really worth showing it had I mean it of certainly could have been analyzed and appreciated but I think it was just like it was a game of chess that had maybe two critical moments uh for the uh you know for the untrained eye and um well it wasn't particularly interesting P3 is the move that Magnus Carlsen chose and Anish played bishop db4 and Magnus Carlson did something very very fascinating in this game as I don't know he probably does in many of his games he played the move Queen C2 which is one of the main lines defending the Knight to try to take back with the Queen the major idea behind Queen C2 is to play E4 and be supported by the queen and also to play A3 and take the Knight and then take the bishop back like this castles A3 take take D5 now in this position three moves are played Knight F3 Bishop G5 E3 sometimes white will play a setup where they don't develop the bishop out that way they Instead try to develop the bishop on this diagonal um white is completely fine yes White's Queen can be attacked it's really not a huge deal you can kick the Knight out one move that has absolutely never played in this position is this nobody plays Spawn takes D5 this move has almost no legitimate justification either why would you help your opponent develop I mean any of these moves are fine Knight takes is probably the least accurate because it allows white to play E4 after moving the queen back but both of these moves held black and black can now do this first and this and will Now activate the bishop which is exactly what Anish did but uh that was magnus's intention Magnus wants to take Anish who is one of the world's best theoreticians he knows opening Theory better than most he wants to take him out of his comfort zone now in this position if you ask me what is White's idea I would tell you it is to take that pawn if you ask me how to stop White's idea I would say to put my knight on C6 counter-attacking the pawn in the center and then it would be to finish up my development with rookie 8 in Bishop F5 but I am not a niche giri and after Bishop F4 he spent a minute on Bishop F5 Bishop F4 Bishop F5 this in my opinion might be an over-reliance on on Theory because Bishop F5 gives up the pawn on C7 Bishop F5 sets up an attack Knight G3 which would simply win a rook um but it's gambling the pawn on C7 right that's the idea Bishop F5 gambits the opponents again you ask me I'm an amoeba brain compared to these two I would just play Knight C6 and then I would play rookie 8 and I would be fine you know and and white would play what he wants to play and life would go on Anish plays Bishop F5 and gives up the pawn on C7 but he's clearly doing this because the next order of business is going to be to play Rook C8 taking the open file and now to play Knight C6 and attack the pawn on right it's the same exact thing that I've told you but Magnus has taken a niche out of a bit of a comfort zone and he's making a niche find moves on his own and Anish plays Rook C2 and apparently that's wrong you are not supposed to be aggressive you're supposed to play the move Knight C6 with eyes on this because if white plays the move E3 black now starts firing with G5 and if white plays F3 to kick the Knight out I can even do this if I want to but I can also just go back and then this proceeds to be a threat Anish wanders in with his rook and Magnus attacks tonight attacks the bishop and just defends his Pawn and Anish by the way should have put his Bishop here and I don't actually know why he didn't do that um maybe he was a bit concerned with H4 and something like G5 when the Knight has to go he he didn't like something here um but uh this is tough stuff Anish goes here Rook B1 and Magnus just plays E3 he's gonna go here next that's exactly what he does back goes the rook and Magnus is up a pawn he's up upon no questions asked he activates his King he brings the other Rook and he just trades if this he will go here so Anish does this B4 we trade down to a rook Bishop Knight end game and Magnus just freezing the pawn not letting it move forward Knight C3 Anish tries to lash out Magnus just takes he can't take back because of Bishop C7 so he forces this King G3 and Anish giri just resigned that is how dejecting it is to play Magnus Carlsen Anish giri just resigned this position he's got three minutes on the clock he can defend a worse end game for some 20 moves he just resigned that is how demoralizing it is to play Magnus trust me finish giri was playing Black here against me this man would not resign would not resign all right he would play for a win with black he would have no business doing so but he resigned Magnus wins his fourth matchup in a row uh in Armageddon but he hasn't won a classical game of chess just yet and then there's Hikaru he's having quite a good tournament he had that weird day where he drew Magnus in five minutes and played a king's Gambit but other than that he has had a very very good tournament and this game he was playing against aryantari and actually Hikaru went for a four move Checkmate he thought Aryan wasn't strong enough to defend against this I'm joking this is called The Bishop's opening and there are various move orders here where white delays the development of the night and if black for example castles uh White actually can even play Queen F3 you can play Queen F3 you can play Knight E2 and it's a very interesting opening but uh Atari plays C6 with the intention of playing D5 so Hikaru slides out of the way and he mentioned here in the confessional Booth did Hikaru that this is a different type of position it kind of looks like an Italian game but instead of black having a knight on C60 as a knight on D7 okay terrific ikaro plays A3 preparing just an escape for the bishop exactly what he does Atari plays A4 and you can't replace Knight H4 which has three ideas idea number one he wants to play nine to five idea number two he wants to play a four in the future idea number three he maybe wants to bring the queen so he has three different ideas okay tari thinks for some time and plays Bishop back to A7 a flexible move seeing what's next from Hikaru also maybe Knight C5 and Knight E6 is possible hikara plays Queen F3 okay while judging from the positioning of White's Queen he is in all likelihood not going to be playing the move F4 but he might he's definitely trying to play at Knight F5 he does in fact play the move Knight F5 and tari chops it off right away thinks for eight minutes and decides that giving up the bishop for the night here's the right decision probably it's bad for Hikaru to play like this because D5 and the bishop is sealed out and probably Hikaru has to take with the queen and allow some sort of Knight E6 Knight D4 potentially but I gotta tell you hikaru's Bishop on A2 is an absolute Beast all right that Bishop will stand unopposed that Bishop very well may play a hero role in this game and so tari plays the move rookie 8 and Hikaru which is very calmly develops the bishop to the D2 Square it's a very flexible game both sides have eight pawns which means that it is a closed position when it is a closed position you are considering two things number one you are considering peace maneuvering 96 Knight D4 and the like you are also considering Pawn breaks F4 D5 B4 B3 these critical Pawn breaks um black plays the move 96 rerouting and there's D5 peace maneuvering and pawn breaks those are the two most important and frankly the only two things available in close positions tari does in fact play the move D5 setting off potential possibility is that move does weaken the pawn on E5 but taking that would open you up to being absolutely slaughtered in the center of the board so Hikaru in a shocking turn of events does not play a horrible move and instead takes on D5 Knight D5 it's also very important here to understand something white has a bishop so white really would like to keep that position opened now in this position Aryan played something that I do not understand and it's actually very difficult for me to explain to you um tari here has the option to take with the Knight or the pawn or the queen if he's you but he's not you because that would hang a queen um Knight takes D5 is certainly not a bad move I completely understand it you're trying to be mobile with your Knights you preserve your queen queen can go this way but Pawn takes D5 to me looks a little bit more natural because you open up the C file which just looks really nice uh you keep the bishop more or less blocked this is weak but I don't really think Knight C3 is possible Knight D4 attacks the queen in defense level so I don't know I mean visually speaking to me and you know tari spent a little time he played Knight takes D5 so Hikaru played the move rookie one Queen G4 sliding out of the way and I think that is what he wants he wants Knight G3 Knight F5 Knight E4 this bishop is still very strong Atari plays rook d8 and here comes Hikaru and now Aryan plays Knight D4 Knight D4 is a mild inaccuracy because I think this Knight simultaneously allowed Hikaru to activate his bishop and also block Black's bishop and also it's just gonna be a Target tari played Knight D4 probably expecting C3 but Bishop G5 and now if you continue the journey down here I play Rook C1 and you have two hanging pieces so that doesn't quite work so Rook B8 is what tari plays instead and Hikaru is just sort of he's kind of calling the tempo of this game Knight takes Bishop F takes E3 Knight B3 very interesting position tari is like take my knight and hikaru's got a very weird structure plays Knight E4 tari trays and tari's doing well I mean he is like keeping equal but it's a very unbalanced position Bishops are on opposite colors D4 could come in at some point making it Rock Solid pressure here Knight D6 and and so on and Hikaru here after this move C5 pounces and one pawn move is an inaccuracy at the Grand Master Level Rook d8 is what should have happened and tari had to not fear this D4 move he had to just accept it he tried to stop the move d4 but in doing so Hikaru gets this and now a brilliant positional move C4 the most subtle of ideas the point is that Black's Bishop is dead it's a very sophisticated idea from Hikaru he plays Ponto C4 and Black's Bishop is now not going to get in the game and furthermore if this trade happens not only is the bishop sealed out not only is this a weakness and not only does white get the D file the a pawn is passing White's a pawn is a massive asset in every end game so kikaru is in fantastic shape Rook d8 played by tari Rook D1 and kikaru just plays King F2 and he's gonna put his King on E2 and tari cannot touch him there is a reason why every important piece in White's position is on a light Square do you know what that reason is because this is a dark squared Bishop light and dark 32 light squares 32 dark squares the board is always working in harmony the bishop on A7 is currently a complete non-factor and even if it was it would have no role in the game it could be on E7 it doesn't matter because it cannot touch these pieces and it cannot defend these pieces so H5 tari getting desperate just takes as we saw in the Magnus game H5 you just take I was there earlier I was there just a couple of moments ago Anish played H5 and Magnus just took just call the bluff just call the bluff so what you get F5 great I just come back and my knight is gonna live on a light square and it will be defended by a light squared Pawn like this antari succumbing to the pressure a takes B4 first e takes F4 and Hikaru look at this Mobility every Pawn tari has cannot move forward he has completely Frozen the black position Rook D3 Rook C1 Pawn to C5 look at this move by tari by the way if C takes D5 Rook C1 Hikaru just says I'm not even interested in that man I am not interested in that Rook to G5 attack The Rook take if you take I promote tari resigns and with this win Hikaru set himself up for being the number two ranked chess player in the world the only thing that matters now is this game if Fabiano caruana does not win this game hikara will be the second highest rated player on the planet behind Magnus Carlson something he has not achieved in eight years it has been 2 800 days since icaro has been the second ranked chess player on the planet Bobby however is absolutely on fire and he's playing Mommy Diary of and he plays for four nights it's a very sharp line in this line with a night sacrifice and then a center fork trick has been seen in the world championship it was actually played between uh Ding and nepo uh and uh very sharp line not going to get into the details into the nitty-gritty but essentially this is the position after the opening Queens Bishops and Rooks these dudes hate horses all right they are not equestrians they are not fans these dudes do not like horses uh and the position actually visually looks really really promising uh for white I mean white has all his pieces pointed at Black's King the position has to be quite resilient otherwise black is probably just going to be completely lost but uh it's not because then you know Mommy zarif wouldn't have played this so Bishop D3 Bobby plays E6 opening up the idea of Queen E5 look at this absolutely brutal position Queen E7 defending and just visually this looks absolutely awful for black this Pawn is such a thorn you can't just take it either Bishop before if you take this I can grab and I can come back so Bishop B7 Rook E6 if you do this bishop D5 you're just gonna lose the queen so Bishop E4 chakra plays Rook A6 and they trade the Rooks and Fabi plays queenish for Fabi still poking and prodding eyes on every Pawn Chad plays C6 a good move good move blocks the bishop opportunity to slide back to this diagonal and utilize it in some capacity Fabi plays Bishop back to D3 shark takes the pawn as I've been saying in today's recap sometimes you just gotta call the bluff Bishop A3 Queen G3 Fabiano is fully invested in e-pawn Industries all right Fabi has e coin all right nobody could stop him he fell for some influencer deal and now fabi's got a whole baggage of e-coin and equine is either going to two dollars and he'll sell it for a ten thousand percent profit where he's gonna lose everything he saw Fabiano needs to make sure that this coin is not just gonna is not gonna crash to the floor rookie eight I'm very concerned about this so what does Fabi do he plays Bishop takes G6 now Bishop takes G6 sets off a lot of stuff first of all if this white just wins you get the Rook you get all the pieces that sees that while that sees that and that sees that and that sees that and folks Bishop you know you know who else sees who the Queens yo Bishop G6 did you even notice that the Queens are looking at each other plays Rook E6 Queen can see the bishop and then the king is back there the Rooks can see each other the queen cannot take the queen for free because of mate what a defensive idea from my major this is brutal stuff and if you play rookie six I'm not I'm Queen C1 is mate so Fabi cannot take the queen Fabi cannot take the Rook well Fabi has to do here is play Bishop back check now Fabi could have played this but after this this this this this this Fabi didn't like his chances he didn't like the bishop and the three pawns over here because you know what happens when those three pawns start flying down the board Bobby's gonna get shook in fact Fabi was probably shook of this whole Prospect but he didn't do that he went here and Rook D1 but count the pawns my man Fabiano is still down one and he's lost his ecoin but shock's got some nice tokens these these pawns are gonna come down shock consolidating centralizing brings his Bishop out Something's Gotta Give he brings the bishop back to protect the king he's just waiting for his moment he's waiting for his moment windy to Queen E5 Bobby's still being aggressive but Shaq knows the best defense is offense Queen A1 hello who is going to defend the bishop because the queen is now calling the bluff on the queen if Queen takes Queen Rook takes Queen White is never moving these pawns are just gonna fly down the board so in this position Fabi plays Rook takes G8 and Rook takes G8 does not cut it the computer wanted this followed by F4 A4 King F2 A3 Rook A8 but A2 okay two and this is pretty brutal so if that doesn't work none of it is going to work maybe you can play H5 but it's just a matter of time for black probably plays Rook G8 and tries to give a Perpetual check but chakra runs out with his King he runs to the middle he runs back he escapes the checks and on move 47 of this game after escaping the final check yes there's this but you just take it mom is yarov won the game Fabiano caruana resigned and my friends here are your standings after five rounds of action at Norway chess Fabiano caruana still in first place but Hikaru is in second and not only is Hikaru in second Hikaru is officially the second highest chess player in the world the second note not by you know smoking the good stuff although maybe uh second highest rated chess player in the world now it's still a race it's very close between him alireza Fabiano Magnus in sixth place with six points out of a possible 15 from all the armageddans but it's Fabian it's it's Hikaru crushing it in Norway chess incredible to see I will see you all back here for round number six now get out of here
