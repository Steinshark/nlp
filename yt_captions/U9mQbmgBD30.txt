we're looking at all of connected and autonomous transport and really any issues around that regulations safety and the technology development in the uk the projects that we're often involved in are demonstrators so we we start with more controlled environments and sort of build up to um the real world we've been working on what we call pods small self-driving vehicles that actually travel on pavements as well as roads and we've really looked at how the pods can be used as a platform for other people to test on as well so that's what we have here in the lab we've been modifying pods and people can come and try out sensors algorithms anything that they are working on and they don't have the ability to develop it all themselves so at the moment there's an empty space over there we are missing the pods they don't happen to be here today we've got a bit of a pod behind you what's the current state where did you get to or where are you at with these pods at the moment so we demonstrated them using a control system from oxford university but we have an interface that's open so that was the oxford system plugged in and now the pods at the moment are in bristol working as part of the flourish program which is looking at accessibility and user friendliness of pods particularly for the older generations from a purely selfish point of view is there gonna be a point where i can go to the pub have two three beers and then just jump in one of these and press a button and go home that is some people's vision certainly um and i guess the there's a different levels of autonomy and with the pods we're really looking at that and point so what's usually called level five um where you don't have to do anything so as the you basically become a passenger rather than a driver and so you don't have any responsibility um for the journey in which case whether you are in a fit state or not is not important but most of the um vehicles and systems that are coming out at the moment especially in sort of traditional cars have some level of responsibility still on the driver so it definitely is the vision of the future and there are some level five systems in controlled environments for example at heathrow terminal five they have pods taking you to and from the business car park they go sort of within tracks but they're not not really following the tracks that's more a safety thing um but there you are just a passenger so that could be the vision of pods in modern keynes one day with the system we had originally there's really three main computers so there's one that's actually owned by the sort of base pod and that controls normal things in a car like lights and that kind of thing but also has a safety responsibility so if you have a control system that you um put on top and if anything goes wrong with that the pod will come to a halt basically um and then the control system the autonomous control system is usually made up of again two um machines are kind of low level and high level controller so the high level controller is doing everything you would expect in terms of bringing in sensor data having the maps that it then compares against and making decisions and the low-level computer is taking command from that and doing a small amount of sort of sense checking and again if there's any issues that will um in in the case of the pods that low-level computer will make sure that the the trajectory that you're following always ends in zero so if it doesn't get a new correct command it will just slowly bring the pod to a halt unless the next command says actually keep going at some speed we're in the center of milton keynes we had a mapped area with certain destinations that you could pick a user interface that was touch screen so you could choose where you wanted to go when you went in and as long as you closed the door put your seatbelt on and satisfied the other safety interlocks then you were in autonomous mode and it would take you to your destination avoiding any obstacles along the way the pods operate on pavements as well as roads and they were intended to do this kind of last mile journeys so they travel up to 24 kilometers an hour but they don't usually make it that far so it's a bit faster than walking pace usually but uh not not that much and only what's safe to do depending on who's around you mentioned they go on the pavements which in the us they call a sidewalk what happens if they run into pedestrians i mean i didn't mean literally run into pedestrians what happens if if you come across pedestrians yeah so the laser scanners and cameras are always looking out for what we usually call obstacles ahead um and the path is being optimized based on that so you can decide sort of how close you feel comfortable going to the obstacles but once you've set that then the pod will try to go around and one of the challenges in this kind of environment is actually if you want to follow behind someone at their speed that's a different thing to just going up to them stopping because now you're close and then they've gone away so you go again you can end up with a bit of a jerky ride and the same if you end up in a crowd but you want to keep progressing through and that's one of the areas that we started to think about was how assertive to be and i know that's a problem they've had with other self-driving cars actually in america with stop signs sometimes you need to actually assert that you're about to go and that might not seem always like the safe thing to do but otherwise you might sit at a junction forever so um there's that trade-off we also looked at various ways of communicating with um pedestrians so um having a noise that was just sort of an underlying noise as well as maybe some sort of horn or beep and obviously you could also actually have a voice asking people to move aside or something so i think you could do it in a friendly way but that people would still be aware that something was coming up behind them and they might want to move to the side often when we encounter pedestrians particularly if they're come on coming to the vehicle and they've seen it they will often modify their path as well to sort of go around it even if they're on their phone or something we'll just look up and not really notice that it's something different but just avoid it so there's quite a lot of behavioral science to go into sharing environments where there aren't really rules of the road this is a world apart from tesla autopilot 70 miles an hour on a motorway do you think it still has a place or should people be using bikes and walking and stuff yeah so the the pods definitely if you look at some use cases they look like they might be taking some journeys that you would otherwise walk or cycle but it's really about the overall idea of mobility and options and in our case we're not actually developing this as a transport system necessarily we're just interested in the technology and how the uk can can develop it but there is a whole spectrum of autonomous projects and we're also involved in some of the more traditional car projects with the pods we did a lot of safety work and obviously with all autonomous systems that's really the whole driver for having autonomy um and we were looking from the point of view of these low-speed vehicles we often ended up with um coming to a stop being the safest thing to do not all of the time but most of the time and there are a number of sort of layer levels and different computers on board which will check each other and if anything is not sending the right signals then there will be a reason a way to stop the vehicle i guess with any machine learning system you're worried about force positives and force negatives and in the case of the pods if you stop for no reason that's usually a safer thing to do so a lot of our systems were erring on the side of more um safety being that you would stop if you weren't sure of anything but obviously if you're on the motorway and being autonomous then just coming to a stop is not not the answer so a lot of vehicle manufacturers are stating that they will take the responsibility for um quite a lot of the issues if it's their software in charge um there there is discussion of uh kind of a black box to see who who was involved um but the insurance companies and our companies are starting to move it more towards that product liability and away from the driver responsibility and uk government has consulted on that recently so um it's work in progress and so that's all fed into the computer and done in real time and all of that talks back to our hq server um so where the pod is what's it doing uh when we're running publicly we're going to have all of the jobs coming through
