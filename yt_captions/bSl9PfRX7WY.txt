[Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here so earlier in the year you might remember we did a video on that in glass fingerprint reader you know all these bezel-less phones are coming out now there's no room on the front for a fingerprint reader unless you put it underneath the glass so we got to see a demo of it in action in an unreleased vivo phone well today of course now we have that phone it's here it's in the studio it's the vivo x21 and it's out now it exists snapdragon 660 six gigs of ram 3200 milliamp hour battery and a 6.3 inch 1080p oled display with of course the optical fingerprint sensor underneath so now that we have it in the flesh it kind of feels like we have no choice but to uh test the limits of it or push it to the limit so okay quick refresher on how this works you can watch the entire original video for the full rundown but basically this is a small optical sensor underneath the glass of an oled display and the sensor itself is really small it's maybe the size of a fingernail and when we say optical sensor we literally mean it's the oled shining up light to reflect off of your finger and the sensor reading the reflection of your finger to see the fingerprint so naturally there are a couple possible limitations to this just because of how the technology works that we can think of but you know there's limitations with touch id too but if we're going to see this in the future of smartphones you know on a possible future iphone or a samsung phone down the road then it's worth exploring now so i have my fingerprint registered here my right thumb and i'll go ahead and register my left thumb as well so you can see how it works but it's pretty similar to any other fingerprint reader like touch id you press down over and over again and it gets multiple reads of the same finger it's a little slower and more deliberate right now but it learns it it saves it and then you do the edges too so you're nice and thorough and that's it so now it has two fingers it's got the right thumb that's fingerprint number one and the left is fingerprint two so obviously a fingerprint reader doesn't work when your fingers are covered like with a glove on or something like that but what if your finger's just slightly covered so all right without water on my hands it works perfectly but we've all been sweaty or been in the rain for a minute or had our hands wet and we go to unlock our phone and it can get interesting here it's not rejecting me it's just having a hard time reading my finger it's saying you know press deeper it's not getting a very good read i'm actually not surprised though like if i bring out the iphone 8 here with touch id you're gonna see the same thing actually it works perfectly right now but if i get a little water on my hand here it doesn't work as well so there's no real advantage or disadvantage with water here but being underneath the display glass i'm sure doesn't help anything water has always been a nemesis of displays but you're gonna have to wipe your finger and get it a little more dry and then it'll go through no problem all right here's a little bit of a spicier test so let's say you're eating some hot wings maybe you're maybe you're at lunch with someone and you want to answer your phone you get a phone call but you don't have time to wipe your fingers but you still got to unlock now i would guess that this would also not work basically for the same reason that water doesn't work but also because if your finger is dirty in any way the sauce or the dirt or whatever it is that's on your hand it'll kind of fill in the gaps in your fingerprint and it'll look different to the optical sensor and sure enough saucy fingers do not work i'll try it on the iphone as well for good measure but yeah as you can see it doesn't go through phones just don't like saucy fingers and this new underglass fingerprint reader uh won't get you out of this one but we have another idea which was it's just dusty fingers so we got the sun chips out and basically i'm gonna i'm gonna get enough dust on my fingers to like when you're getting to the end of the bag we've all been there uh let's see how it holds up so the in-glass fingerprint reader it's not seeing me okay so that's a negative and if i try touch id actually touch id on the iphone does unlock wow so okay touch id saw enough info on that first swipe to verify it's my fingerprint but the underglass vivo didn't uh but then actually after a couple more tries it does work so another question that actually came up in the comments of the first video is screen protector will an in-glass fingerprint reader work with a screen protector on your phone well i can already actually answer that yes and i know that because actually i have two of these and they come in the box with the screen protector on by default it's a standard fingerprint reader cuts around the notch and everything you can see that right so that goes over the glass it doesn't affect the optical sensor because it can still see through that fingerprint reader no problem it doesn't obscure the optics in any way but that got me of course thinking about other screen protectors you can get all types of other screen protectors you can get tempered glass screen protectors i'm sure we've all seen those and the final level which is the glass privacy shield so it's basically polarized so you can't view it off axis it's one of those maximum security screen protectors so let's try the regular glass first it is still clear and i'm going to go ahead and put it right over the sensor obviously this phone is brand new it just came out so i'm pretty sure there are no glass screen protectors made for it but this one just has cutouts for an iphone but there you go completely covered no bubbles or anything and if we give it a shot that is success okay so no hesitation there that was pretty much exactly the same as if it didn't have a screen protector on confirmed you can use a tempered glass screen protector with this reader the privacy shield though it's getting pretty intense but believe it or not as much as i hate them a lot of people use these on the daily you know got to keep that person behind you on the train from being able to read your messages so there you go fully protected but does your in-glass fingerprint reader still work yes it does wow i was actually gonna i probably would have bet against that uh the privacy shield really messes with the optics if you even try to look through one it gets really funky but apparently that's no problem so very cool good to know that the future of smartphones should have no problem with this all right so how many people do you know with uh with those shattered screen protectors that they just leave on their phones so just like that i'm gonna leave this shattered screen protector on this phone with the cracks going up over the fingerprint sensor i mean that's kind of how it would crack it's from the corner and we'll give that a shot wow no problem it felt actually felt a little slower that time but it definitely worked yeah really slow but success is success so you can't always take the screen protector off and get a new one immediately but if you're the type of person to leave it on you can do that and get a new one later so that just leaves us with my final experiment which is simulated extreme wear and tear you see micro scratches these things happen right you take this thing in and out of your pocket hundreds of times a week maybe even hundreds of times a day there's gonna be wear and tear there's gonna be little things in your pocket little abrasions from the particles around you it's unavoidable it's painful to make them by myself on purpose with a box cutter but it's every phone i've ever had has gotten these scratches on the screen so here's where we're at and if we give that a shot no problem right the knife is a little harder and the scratches are a little more real this might be more like a year of wear and tear like a year later type of scenario if you take pretty good care of your phone but still no problem you're probably noticing this whole time that the reader isn't quite as fast as touch id that's for sure it's still just where the technology is right now no doubt it's gonna be getting faster with time like touch id did all right uh let's accelerate this like way faster cover your eyes kids man i hate doing this but for science that's what it looks like and the reader still works a little more a little more that's uh that's pretty good look at how scratched up this glass is right now i think it's safe to say if your phone ever gets this scratched up and your fingerprint reader still works then you're probably good for a long time like if your screen ever looks like this you're probably in the market for a new phone anyway i gotta say that's some pretty solid results with everything we just threw at it nothing exceedingly great or way better but also nothing exceedingly bad it's kind of in this like middle ground but that has me pretty pumped about it for its development in the future of smartphones see if you remember the first generation of fingerprint readers and smartphones the first gen touch id it wasn't that great but it's it's had time to develop and turn into the gold standard that it is now for both speed and accuracy and i kind of see that for the future of this if this gets worked on from all angles by a bunch of different companies i could eventually see this finding its way into a future iphone a future samsung phone and maybe even flagships in the next couple years so that's pretty exciting but until then thanks for watching talk to you in the next one peace
