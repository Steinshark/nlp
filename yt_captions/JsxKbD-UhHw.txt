- Welcome to "Mystery Tech"! (bells dinging) ♪ Ba-da-da-dun-dun, ba-da-da-da-dun ♪ That is a chungus if I've ever seen one. So I don't know what this is, but I see it says "astro" with the Amazon little smile on it. I've no idea what Amazon Astro is. - [Ken] Oh, is this, oh!
- [Matt] Yeah, baby! - [Ken] Oh, I know what this is. Oh, can you open it, open it. Open it. - I will.
- [Ken] Open it. - That's the point of this show. - Austin, unbox it, come on. (Austin sneezing) - [Ken] (laughing) Oh my God. - [Matt] Oh crap. - Whoo! - [Matt] This got so,
it took a second turn. - [Ken] He's gonna be the one replaced by this thing. - Ah, now there's some
stuff going on here. So it says "astro". - [Matt] Wait, do you really
not know what this is? - Absolutely no idea. What is it? - They're like, what if Alexa
could be even more annoying and follow you around the house? - Oh, this stupid sh-
- [Ken] Yeah. - Okay. Oh my God. (team laughing) - It's- - [Ken] It's Professor
Xavier, but with a screen. - It's some Wall-E ass little dude. All right. All right. Let's do this. (team vocalizing) - [Austin] Start here. Open me first. Charger inside. Plug in the charger, wake Astro, and follow the onscreen steps. Is this like a little security camera? Basically, he like roams
around trying to make sure that the bad guys don't "Home Alone" their way into your house? - [Ken] I actually
think that's part of it. I think that's part, that was like part of the pitch was that like, when you're not home, it'll just kind of navigate around and like, surveillance the
house while you're gone. - Look, man. - He a little thick, but that's okay. - [Matt] This looks like a Pixar mom. - [Ken] This is like
what the kids call "gyat". (team laughing) - [Matt] No.
- Astro is ready. So let's welcome him home
and take a few steps back. I'm gonna stand right in front
of it and see what happens. - [Matt] What? - Oh, he's got eyes. Okay. A couple steps back. (down tempo music) (Astro beeping and making robot sounds) It is so loud. - [Matt] Like it fills up
the entire room with power. - I'm docking. Oh, get outta the way. Okay. All right. That's enough. You can
stop. That's enough. Okay. Okay. Okay. All
right. All right. All right. - Hello. - [Matt] Oh, it's
assimilating our language. (Astro making robot sounds) - [Austin] Hi. Let's
try a few things. Okay. Astro, dance. Dance, boy, dance. (Astro making whooping
sounds and playing music) (team laughing) - [Astro] Whoo!
- [Matt] I like the way his little antenna comes up. - Teach Astro to recognize you. A visual idea allows
you to, oh, good Lord. So basically, they gotta take
a bunch of pictures of me so they can process and
figure out who I am. Oh. 'cause I have to
be looking down at it. - [Matt] Yeah. Tilt your head up. - My chin? I don't like this at all. Okay. He's gonna start exploring now. So before we get to
fully experience Astro, he needs to learn the space
and learn the pros and cons. Oh God. Here he goes. Okay.
All right. He's learning now. Whoa. Okay. Look how fast this dude is. Dude, he's way too fast. I don't like the fact that he's fast. No, I just don't wanna- Oh, oh- - Oh my God. Let cables let, - Oh God. - Astro, raise the Periscope. Oh, that's creepy. - [Ken] Okay. That's not, oh, Jesus. - [Austin] Wow. Astro, take a picture. (shutter clicks) Look at that. That's what you gonna, neat. It's uploading to the cloud. - Amazon photos. - [Austin] Oh, good Lord. Nothing ever goes to Amazon Photos. "Finding Austin". It's gonna look for me. So I told it to look for me. So let's see if it can find me. Oh, he's looking. Oh, he can't find his own- Op, there you go. Oh. Oh, no. Okay. Daddy. (laughs) I solved it. - [Astro] Just asked me to play. - Just tell him to play Cocomelon and follow your kid around. You're done. Jeffy B, this is worth it. I dunno if this replaces me or my child. Maybe both of us. Maybe humans are overrated
and Wall-E is real. How much was Astro? $1600? - [Matt] Like 1, 6, 0, 0. - [Ken] Astro, who is Austin Evans? - [Astro] On various
numbers that is not new... (indistinct) (team laughing) Well, it's like 80% correct. (Astro burps loudly) - [Ken] Whoa. - [Matt] Whoa. - [Matt] Why did he get right
up in your face on that one? (everyone laughing) That was personal. - [Austin] This is one
of the weirdest things we've ever looked at, but I just cannot wrap
my head around the idea that this ever was an actual product and that they are with a
straight face selling it for $1600. Like, I get it. There's a
lot of robotic tech in here. It's really neat, but like, it feels like they came up with this idea, they decided, "We're
gonna sell this robot" and then they just tried to
add features to it later. But like, what does this solve besides being an expensive
Cocomelon delivery device? And my answer to that is it doesn't. Thank you to the sponsor of this video, Bitdefender. Bitdefender is consistently rated as one of the best cybersecurity

Wow, that's a lightweight box. Cool. And another one? Sure. Why not? This was shipped on September 22nd, 2023. Yeah. What year is it anyways? Is it still 2024? Hopefully. - [Ken] Oh, that's around
the time of my birthday. - Well, happy birthday Ken. - [Joanna] Happy birthday. (Ken clapping) Oh, it's a whole thing. We've got the covert, oh, this is Genki. Not to be confused with Denki. (bubble pops) (laughing) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. But Genki have a number
of Switch accessories. So I looked at these, oh man, it's probably a couple
years ago at this point, on "Mystery Tech". It looks like they've got a whole new set. So this is the Covert Dock 2. I like the Covert Dock 1 a lot. Essentially, it is a
single little power brick that also has like your HDMI, USB, like everything you would
need to run the Switch. So that's very cool. Oh, there's a handwritten note. "Hey Austin, thanks for
being an awesome Genki fan. Please ignore any typos in
the placeholder packaging. We are in a rush to get these out and the final packaging
will look different." You know, you didn't need to be in a rush. Evidently, I don't get these things (Ken laughing) until months and months later. So if there's a typo, I'll
not hold it against you. Well, there's also the ShadowCast 2 Pro, which is a game cap, which is 4K, and it is compact, instant setup. So this is actually cool. - [Alex] Before you actually open that. - Yeah. - [Alex] There's one more
thing that they sent us.  It has been so long. They sent us a nice Christmas card. - "Hi Austin. The entire team at Genki would like to wish you a
happy, happy holidays." (both laughing) "As a special thank you, here's a hundred dollar gift code for you or anyone else to use it." There you go. If that code still works, happy holidays. 2024. Great holiday season. Hey, thanks, friends at Genki. I'm also looking forward
to the year of 2024. I'm sure it's gonna be great. So let's start out with
the game cap, which, oh, interesting. It's got like sort of like this sort of clear, translucent plastic on the top. So on the back here, we've got HDMI, in and out, AUX and line, and as well as USB-C. What I'm really excited to try is this. So the Covert Dock 2 is
a really clever idea. Now this is designed largely,
I would say for the Switch, but it should work with almost anything that uses USB-C and HDMI. So it's a, actually, how
many watts is it? 40? - [Ken] 45. - 45 watts. So. - [Ken] It says it right
on the top. The big "45 W". - [Austin] That? That bit? Oh, got it. (Ken laughing) The idea here is that instead of carrying a separate USB
C dock around with you, this functions not only as
the charger for your laptop, your Steam Deck, your
Switch, whatever the case is, but also look at that. Look how tiny that is. I mean, it's a little bit
bigger than a normal dock, but you've got not only
USB A, so it functions as a USB A port, but also
a full 4K 60 HDMI 2.0. I also like the fact that it's
a little bit translucent too, so you can kind of see it's
got like some character to it. This thing is sick. It also comes with the adapter. So if you close the, oh, look at, it's actually kind of neat. So it's got like the US plug
on it, but if I close that up and then I take the adapter, it actually slides onto the
plug and then you've got it. So technically what you could
do is you actually could use this as a travel adapter. This might look like a lot of cables, but essentially, what this is, is the actual Genki covert dock, which not only powering our Steam Deck, but also providing the USB and the HDMI. The HDMI is going from this
dock into our game capture, which is being sent over
to OBS to be recorded and is spitting out a 1440P, 144 hertz signal. It might be a lot of jargon, but essentially, not
only could you use this to stream and to record, but importantly, you're doing it with essentially no penalty. A 1440P, 144 signal coming
to a monitor is very, very impressive. So all that being said, let's
play Ken's Steam Deck. Woo. That looks really nice. I don't actually have an FPS counter up, but it certainly is a nice clean and very low latency pass through. I liked the first Covert Dock. It was very cool. The fact that this one now does 4K and has that sick design and everything, and plus has power on two ports. Man, good job y'all. Sorry it took a large
number of months for me to actually look at it, but
I'm real happy with it now! Hit me. - [Ken] Really? - No, don't actually hit me. Like throw the thing to me. What is it? What? What is this? McDonald's Crocs. What the Croc? Am I loving it? So these are officially branded, McDonald's themed Crocs. (foot thuds) - I'm going to do it again. - [Ken] Oh, Jesus. How did you already have the? - You know, I've learned
to kick my shoe off, whip my leg out, and drop it right on the
table with a moment's notice. - [Ken] I'm getting cramps
looking at that. Yeah. That's what I'm concerned about. - Let's see, I got, I got this. - [Matt] It was y  our wife that donated these. - Oh no. - [Matt] She says that it's very important that you wear these. - Why does she say that
it's important for me to wear McDonald's Crocs? - [Matt] That's what I'm worried about. - So we got the charms,
which are actually, no, no, no, they're not built in. So they're just pre-applied. So we got ourselves the
fries, the arches, a Big Mac, nugs, little fries, and a Coke. I'm gonna take my sock off now. - [Team] Oh, oh God. (team groaning) - You think I'm going to. - [Matt] Oh, get better socks, man. - [Ken] Yeah, this little- - [Matt] It looks like
you got the black plague on your feet every time
you take off your shoes. (Austin laughs) Don't wipe it on the table. - [Alex] Oh my God. (Austin blowing) - [Matt] We eat off of that. (Austin jumping on table) (team laughing) - [Ken] Jesus. I've never, okay. - Hello down there. - [Ken] Oh Jesus. - I... am actually happy. I, you don't say A-Cam is maybe not the most flattering angle. - [Matt] You're the
only person in this room who's happy. - Well, I'm loving it. So, I'd like to model you my Crocs. So you see, I got my, my
gibbits, my, my giblets, my gubbins. Well, this is the position I'm in if I have too much McDonald's. (laughs) - Ah. Where's the squatty potty collab? - [Alex] So these are $70. - [Austin] Okay. - [Ken] They have a sport mode. They have a sport. You're in sport mode. - [Matt] All Crocs have sport mode. - [Ken] These are in sport mode. - [Alex] Well, they are
very textured on the bottom. It looks like you can kind of run in them. - I think it's pretty clear. You can buy yourself
three Big Macs, a Sprite, and two cookies or $70 worth of Crocs. - [Ken] No, I think you mean two number nines, a number nine large, a number six with extra dip, number seven, two number 45s, one with
cheese, and a large soda. - Ah, here we go again. (camera whooshing) (box falling) - [Matt] Ah. - So you know what, I can always tell if a "Mystery Tech" item is expensive. Either it is displayed with
white gloves or yeeted across the table. Matt, you realize that
you're just basically asking to have a shot pot contest. Oh good lord. That's de-monetizable. You can't pull out weapons
like that on a YouTube video. - You guys even got a free
ticket to the gun show. - Anyway, let's see
what's inside, shall we? Newspaper? - [Ken] Wow. Is that? That
looks like a gigantic AirPod. - So, 3D printed. It does
have like a hinge on the top. It's got a hole, which
looks vaguely like USB C ish or something. Is there any context to what this is? - [Matt] Well, I thought you
were gonna try and guess it. - [Austin] A Mac mini? - [Matt] Yeah.
- [Ken] There you go. - [Matt] Look at him learning. - Okay, got it. What? But, but what, what is this
part for? Is this like? - [Matt] Remember, remember
the GameCube adapter? - Are you trying to tell me
you can put like an iPhone or an iPad on top of your Mac Mini? - [Matt] Yeah. - Oh, because you can do
an iPad as the display. So you can turn your Mac
mini into a lapt-. I get it. I think I get it. So this is said Mac mini. This looks like, is it
our M2 Pro Mac Mini? - [Matt] Yeah. - Okay. All right. So these pivot out and
then I put it like this. So I can take an iPad mini
and just line it up here. And that actually seems to
work pretty well. What is that? Oh, what the, we've got a display up and running. (team laughing) It's a little bit small. This is so much better than
just a MacBook where you know, it has a keyboard and track
pad and everything you need. - So while you build that
up, I'm gonna be logical and say this probably isn't
meant to be a laptop per se. - [Austin] Yeah. - But like I just, this
is a secondary display to a regular display that
you'd have on your desk. - [Ken] Yeah. - See look, Mac OS now shows up. Okay, so now I'm gonna
plug my iPad mini back in and turn on Sidecar. So apparently even when
you're connected via USB C, you still can't do it
unless you're connected to the same iCloud account. After a very brief and simple setup, it definitely didn't
take me like 20 minutes, I can now use my iPad on the Mac Mini as a display. - [Matt] Look at it, so cute. - But I see this and I think, well,
clearly I should use this with only the iPad display, right? So I'm just gonna unplug our monitor and it turns off the iPad and
apparently my mom texted me. Huh? So I unplugged the monitor
and it doesn't work anymore. So you have to use it
as a secondary display and it doesn't work as a primary. - [Matt] Wait, I have
something to test it with. - This is... Hello? What you got there? Oh, like a headless HDMI dongle. - [Matt] Try plugging
in USB C with the dongle to trick it into thinking
that there's a monitor. - Right, right. Yeah, I understand
that. But watch, as soon as I unplug this, it does not work. Right. So it just shuts off. Okay, I plug this in. Oh. Oh, well I should- (team laughing) - [Matt] Close the lid. (circus music) - [Ken] Holy it's a laptop.
(Mac Mini shuts) What? Did you break the thing? - [Matt] It came like that? - [Ken] Now, you did. - What happened to Roboraptor? What happened to this box? It's like been absolutely sat on. Also is this Baby Raptor and he also has a Radio
Shack thing on his butt. Hold on, hold on. It's a Mini Roboraptor from 2005? Oh my God. And it says
Radio Shack right here. So this is, okay, you gotta
gimme some backstory here. You tracked down an an original
Mini Roboraptor from 2005? - [Matt] Yeah.
- [Ken] Yeah. - How much did you pay for
Mini Roboraptor from 2005? - [Alex] It was, it was around 40 bucks. - [Matt] 40 bucks. - [Austin] Oh, that's not bad. So as I'm sure you're all aware, the real mascot of the
series is Robo T Raptor. He's been here since episode two or three. All I know is we're about to join the Roboraptor
Revolution, a fusion of technology and personality. I like the fact that you
were able to find this 'cause I did not know that there was ever a Mini Roboraptor. All right, so I'm gonna
gently unbox this item, which is nearly 20 years old now. Let us free our little buddy
who is real grimy looking. Something's up with this guy. Oh my God. His leg is detached. - [Matt] No! - So he is got a leg here, but this does not look like, yeah, that's not gonna go like back on. I don't understand what happened. Also, I don't understand how
he's been broken when he has been sitting in a box for 19 years. Gents, should we bury him, put 'em back into the
earth where we found him? (gentle music) Thank you for joining us today
to pay our final respects to Roboraptor Mini. He didn't have long on this earth, but we're going to celebrate
him the best that we can. Ken, would you be so kind? - Roboraptor Mini. More than a robotic dinosaur. (Matt crying) I know. - It's okay. It's okay. - Take your time. - It's okay. - Roboraptor Mini, more
than a robotic dinosaur, was bound to be a true
member of the family. Since rolling off the
assembly line at WowWee, we never got to see the
curious and playful character he could have been. We couldn't explore, we
couldn't cuddle, laugh together, hear his first tech tip. His life was cut short
by a tragic accident. We ought not to dwell on
the sadness of his death, but celebrate the joy of
his short, short life. (Matt crying) Roboraptor Mini, we will miss you. We'll never forget you and we'll always hold you in our hearts. Rest in peace, our dear friend, our dinosaur, Roboraptor Mini. - [Matt] ♪ Oh, Dino Boy,
the wires are crossed. ♪ ♪ From Roar to roar and
something, lyrics, sad. ♪ I- Sorry. I can't, I can't. - It's okay.
- I can't. - It's okay. It's okay. Come on. (Matt sniffs and cries) - [Austin] Goodbye.
And may you find peace. Thank you very much for
watching this episode of "Mystery Tech". This took a turn that none of us expected, but we will be back once
we gather ourselves back up and hit that review table one more time. Roboraptor will stay strong and Roboraptor Mini will
hopefully find peace. (sighs) (Matt cries) (dramatic music)
