what's up guys as you can tell by the title I bought a thousand dollar keyboard I bought this because I want to know why does this keyboard cost a thousand dollars all right so what is this this is uh this is what it came on a piece of wood it came in like this wooden box and I'm like I'm scared to touch this keyboard so this is what it looks like for those of you that are wondering I I'm like scared holding this right now this is the thousand dollar keyboard I know it seems expensive but it's got all the letters he's right it does have all the letters not the best but what can you expect for such a cheap price yeah he's got a point a thousand dollars is pretty cheap it doesn't work any better than a twenty dollar one if you spend a grand on a keyboard you can't be objective it doesn't work any better than a twenty dollar one why didn't you tell me that before I bought it no longer a virgin this keyboard helped me lose my virginity I think mine's broke my wife said for a thousand dollars it better give you and she was right it did worth every penny oh whoa okay let's lay down some rules you keep your hands to yourself okay mister shipping costs too high this is the best keyboard I've ever seen there's nothing like it I'd give it five stars but I'm knocking off one star for the ridiculously high shipping cost of $15 no I have to agree with this review the shipping cost was pretty outrageous I mean $15 I could barely afford that because I spent all my other monies on the keyboard five stars as soon as I hooked it up and instantly self-type the question to the answer of life the universe and everything also made me a mocha Sabonis my must be broken a design worth the price don't be turned off by the big price this is as decent as a keyboard can get the design alone is really worth the price I don't know I honestly I think it's kind of ugly did to be a hundred percent honest I don't think it looks like it five stars I know what it means to live now I and this guy's right the second I plugged into this keyboard I discovered their meaning to life I would tell you what it is but I don't want to ruin the experience I mean that the keyboard is pretty cheap you could probably afford it you should definitely buy one it will tell you the meaning and purpose of life I don't want to do this to death what an insightful review five stars could not play Minecraft five out of five wait this this keyboard won't let you play Minecraft um John are we able to return this this one looks awesome but it's too expensive no I kind of agree with the price point for this thing it's ya know I don't know what you're talking about five stars it made me jizz huh I guess different side effects for everyone this thing is dumb don't buy it this is junk everyone on here who says it's magnificent is a fake this thing is dumb don't buy it ever it's okay people keyboard it's okay I don't think your junk don't listen to the meaning it's okay keyboard allows you to divide by zero hey you know that whole thing about division by zero being undefined turns out it was just the COS of a crappy substandard keyboards you can do it on this thing no problem really 0/0 whoa dude so that that's what that's what all that makes sense these reviews can't be serious right I'd say they're pretty serious this is a subpar based off of what everyone says this has definitely lived up to expectations it's it's completely changed my life and the five minutes I've had it ripped house it was the keyboard or my house payment rip house huh I'm glad I'm a spoiled white kid and can't afford both extra features has built-in mechanical arms and will tight for you and feed you also comes with a free sleep and made well worth the cup where's I don't see a mate where's my mate do your research and read the reviews fantastic product research VI a the reviews of others has ensured it's well worth every second contemplating purchase and I mean the I'd say this keyboard should be worth like $900 I feel like a thousand is a little overboard feeling this is more $900 keyboard it's too cheap honestly I agree with that review I feel like this could be like a three thousand maybe even a four thousand keyboard but feel like one thousand dollars I feel like they're really under selling this keyboard you know it's so just beautiful I didn't have long to ponder this option upon discovering the jewel of the Nile I was on the list for a liver transplant and who needs a liver I kinda agree with that guy this this keyboards kind of better than a liver 1k for a generic keyboard is just a generic keyboard simply put this is overpriced by the tune of $850 this keyboard is purely for looks and harbors no special functions in fact inside of the gym is totally different keyboard manufacturer all this user did was create a new outside shell and keys but he used the internals from someone else I wonder if they know their engineering was ripped off by this person and being resold why why did people tell me this stuff before I bought it I took a poop on the keyboard and somehow it's still clean now I don't go to the bathroom anymore really I guess it takes time for it to go away [Music]
