the Galaxy S ten is the first smartphone ever to be using Qualcomm's 3d sonic sensor and under display ultrasonic fingerprint scanner and you might have heard about this in passing but today I'm working with Qualcomm to break down what it actually means for you and it's pretty incredible compared to an optical scanner which essentially takes a low res 2d snapshot of the finger this uses high frequency sound waves it fires them into the pores of your finger and then uses the time taken for them to return to detect ridges in three dimensions so that's cool but there's a lot of subsequent benefits to having a 3d sonic sensor in your smartphone it is tiny the 3d sonic sensor is 0.2 millimeters thick the alternative and current best solution out there is an optical scanner which uses a small camera under the screen and is about 15 times thicker at 3 millimeters there's always a compromise with phones that use optical scanners you are they need to have an outright smaller battery a thicker phone or you need to get a custom battery made to fit around the scanner which will still be smaller than a battery you can have with a 3d sonic sensor but also more expensive to make also with an optical scanner you have to press your finger into the display using about 100 grams of actuation force because an ultrasonic sensor is firing waves out it doesn't matter you get away with 15 grams of actuation force which is equivalent of grazing your finger against the screen it can also scan straight through contaminants and in fact is the only mobile tech out there right now that can still accurately detect prints through dust water or even some moisturizer you just put on your hands these would all be a problem for other phones 3d sonic also resists image burn which is one of the biggest problems with having an optical scanner if you've ever seen the vivo necks or the oneplus 60 in action you might notice that the small area in the screen where your finger can be scanned lights up to a brightness level much higher than the rest of the display is capable of an optical scanner needs this brightness so that it can read your print properly but it can have the unintended consequence of leaving a dark pink spot after prolonged use security ultrasonic is just much harder to bypass with a 2d scanner you could take a photograph of someone's print or a sample of the oily residue on their screen and this would actually be enough to get in but if depth is also being detected then this wouldn't work so I actually just had a call with the team who's behind this technology and it turns out they've actually built three-dimensional anti-spoofing capability Qualcomm has trained the sensor to understand the properties of real skin like its elasticity so even if someone managed to build a 3d mock-up of your finger it still wouldn't work but I guess maybe the coolest thing about it is that the 3d sonic scanner can do all of this whilst still being faster than the optical scanner the entire unlock process from start to finish can be done in 0.2 seconds with this compared to 0.35 so it's nearly twice as fast as objects and this is only the current generation of scanners there's quite a big future here the potential to detect what is happening and not just on your finger but also up to four millimeters behind it it could detect your blood flow or your heart rate in an instant also at the fact that this tech sits behind your screen and doesn't need your screen to be on to power it can save a lot of battery with an optical scanner the finger has to be brightly lit up and considering that the average person unlocks 200 times a day it all adds up I'm also pretty excited for larger fingerprint scanners this tech can be quite easily scaled and so the idea of having an all screen 3d sonic sensor is not an impossibility all right guys thank you so much for watching and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
