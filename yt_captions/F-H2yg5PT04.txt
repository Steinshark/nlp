when do you think the first human will step foot on Mars I think it's a good chance in 2030s that we will be on Mars in fact there's no physics reason why we can't do it it's an engineering problem it's a very difficult and dangerous engineering problem but it is an engineering problem and in my book future of humanity I even speculate beyond that that by the end of the century we'll probably have the first starships the first starships will not look like the enterprise at all they'll probably be small computer chips that are fired by laser beams with parachutes and like what Stephen Hawking advocated the breakthrough starshot program could send ships ship to the nearby stars traveling at 20% of speed of light reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years time beyond that we should have fusion power fusion power is in some sense one of the ultimate sources of energy but it's unstable and we don't have fusion power today now why is that first of all stars for mammals for free you get up punch the gas large enough it becomes a star I mean you didn't have to do anything to it and it becomes a star why is fusion so difficult to put on the earth because you're not a space stars are monopoles they are pole single poles that sphere are there aspherical asymmetric and it's very easy to get spherical symmetric configurations of gas to compress into a star B just happens naturally all by itself the problem is magnetism is bipolar you have a North Pole and a South Pole and it's like trying to squeeze a long balloon take a long balloon and trying to squeeze it you squeeze one side it bulges out the other side well that's the problem with fusion machines we use magnetism with the North Pole in the South Pole to squeeze gas and all sorts of anomalies and horrible configurations can take place because we're not squeezing something uniformly like in a star stars in some sense are for free fusion on the earth is very difficult but I think it's inevitable and it'll eventually gave us unlimited power from seawater so seawater will be the ultimate source of energy for the planet Earth why what's the intuition there because we'll extract hydrogen from seawater burn hydrogen in the fusion reactor to get give us unlimited energy without the meltdown without the nuclear waste why do we have meltdowns we have meltdowns because in the fission reactors every time you split the uranium atom you get nuclear waste tons of it 30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year and it's hot it's hot for thousands millions of years that's why we have meltdowns but you see the waste product of a fusion reactor is helium gas helium gas is actually commercially valuable you can make money selling helium gas and so the waste product of a fusion reactor is helium not nuclear waste that we find in a commercial fission plant in that controlling mastering controlling fusion allows us to converse us into a type 1 I guess civilization right oh yeah probably the backbone of a type one civilization will be fusion power we by the way are type zero we don't even rate on this scale we get our energy from dead plants for God's safe oil and coal but we are about a hundred years from being type one you know get a calculator in fact Carl Sagan calculated that we are about 0.7 fairly close to a 1.0 for example what is the internet the Internet is the beginning of the first type 1 technology to enter into our century the first planetary technology is the internet what is the language of type 1 on the internet already English and Mandarin Chinese are the most dominant languages on the Internet and what about the culture we're seeing a type 1 sports soccer the Olympics a type 1 music a youth culture rock and roll rap music type 1 fashion Gucci Chanel attack when economy European Union NAFTA what have you so we're beginning to see the the beginnings of a type 1 culture and a type one civilization and inevitably it will spread beyond this planet so you talked about sending it 20 percent the speed of light on a chip into Alpha Centauri but in a slightly nearer term what do you think about the idea when we still have to send biological our biological bodies the colonization of planets colonization of Mars Decius becoming a two-planet species ever or any time soon well just remember the dinosaurs did not have a space program and that's why they're not here today how come they're no dinosaurs in this room today because they didn't have a space program we do have a space program which means that we have an insurance policy now I don't think we should bankrupt the earth or deplete the earth to go to Mars that's too expensive and not practical but we need a settlement a settlement on Mars in case something bad happens to the planet Earth and that means we have to terraform Mars now to terraform Mars if we get raised a temperature of Mars by 6 degrees 6 degrees then the polar ice cap begins to melt releasing water vapor water vibra is the greenhouse gas it causes even more melting of the ice caps so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy it feeds on itself it becomes autocatalytic and so once you hit 6 degrees were rising of the temperature on Mars by 6 degrees it takes off and we melt the polar ice caps and liquid water once again flows in the rivers the canals are the channels and the oceans of Mars Mars once had an ocean we think about the size of the United States and so that is a possibility now how do we get there how do we raise the temperature of Mars by 6 degrees Elon Musk would like it detonate hydrogen warheads on the polar ice caps yes well I'm not sure about that because we don't know that much about the effects of detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps and who wants to glow in the dark at night reading the newspaper so I think there are other ways to do it with solar satellites you can have satellites orbiting Mars that beam sunlight onto the polar ice caps melting the polar ice caps Mars has plenty of water it's just frozen you
