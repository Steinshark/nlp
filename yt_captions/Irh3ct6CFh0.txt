you know people say Jeff Bezos isn't generous but I've been on WhatsApp with him for 10 minutes and he's sending me money just gotta put in my social security number real quick all right all right that was a bit of a joke but it's in honor of a new scam that we need to talk about involving Jeff Bezos and Amazon because it's all over YouTube right now it's a crypto scam and here's how it works recently you might have seen something like this in a comment section these comments are everywhere thoughts on AMZ 15v or comments about some big pre-sale and you might be wondering what this is all about well if you're curious enough like me you'll search it and here's what will come up a verified YouTube channel called coin market cap news now for context coin market cap is a legitimate company that provides news coverage stats on cryptocurrency when you go to their homepage it seems like they are associated they have real coin market cap YouTube videos there so because everything appears to check out you might be tempted to watch the next video when you do you'll hear about an exciting new opportunity hey guys what's up in today's coin market news episode we talk about something that might be the breaking news of the Year Amazon is making the first moves to join the crypto scene the US tech company under CEO Jeff Bezos has opened up the pre-sale for their new AMZ Amazon token private investors can use Invitational links which are currently available to jump into the pre-sale to get some AMZ before its planned launch in March or April obviously this video is a bit sketchy right but there's a piece of your brain that's going to think man if you could just be the first to invest in an Amazon crypto it's going to be huge however when you finally go to their website this is where things start to look a little scammy first of all there's a giant timer to create a sense of urgency there's the promise of 200 percent bonuses if you spend enough money and when it's finally time to buy a Bitcoin address is given to you to deposit to supposedly they're going to send you back some Amazon tokens or whatever except that's never gonna happen because Amazon and Jeff Bezos aren't associated with this at all you've been scammed what the hell is even that but to understand how this all works let's rewind how did they achieve all of this you see this scam actually exploits one of YouTube's features on people's home pages see you can put your own videos on your homepage but did you know you can actually put another Channel's videos there as well and these scammers use this fact to highlight the real coin market caps videos on their scam Channel which they bought to that subscriber count and they fake a verification or whatever and then they turn it into coin market cap news to all give the illusion that they're associated with this legitimate company and then all they do is they upload a single video which you can see on their videos tab which is the scam video in question and they buy a bunch of Bot traffic and likes to the video to make it seem popular then they don't stop there they write positive comments they don't let real comments through they even buy fake likes and fake replies to their fake comments and all of this creates a mirage of real excitement legitimacy and human activity but of course this too is an illusion this is all a trap for their viewers and so now that the Trap is set how do you get people to actually find this video this is where the spam comments come in a fake Channel like this would be outranked by popular ones and recommendations but by discussing something really cryptic and specific like AMZ 15v or AMZ 200v it sounds vaguely financial and importantly it's also specific enough to make sure that if anyone searches it nobody else has that keyword so only their scam video shows up and it appears legitimate and when I first saw this I was so taken aback by all the work they put into this it made me wonder who's on screen endorsing it that's part of it a human face that brings trust and I quickly realized it's probably not one of the actual scammers themselves but instead a Fall Guy someone they hired and I decided to find this person to a inform them that they're being used for a scam and B I wanted to confront them maybe they can give us details on who hired them for all of this so I spent the next few hours combing through all the popular freelancing sites and at first I found nothing however on page three of Fiverr when you search through the terms Green Screen Actor I found a familiar face a guy named Josh yep that looks like him so immediately I messaged him to try to get in touch and see what he'd say and to my surprise he answered but to my bigger surprise he mistook me for someone else for that like TTI dot social no this is for this is for that Amazon it was like an Amazon commercial basically like it was like Amazon crypto coin or something okay have you tried contacting me before I have not okay yeah so I had someone trying to do this recently and they saw like yeah I did a video and they ended up using my photo and said I was a developer and I was like I contacted them and said hey take that down so I thought that's maybe who you were hmm apparently this has happened before with Josh people contacting him about a scam he's been associated with I thought this was all pretty strange and I'm even though I'm sure he's being duped as we talked through this he explained to me his policy on these things and it made me understand why this wasn't the first time most video those were you know I say something that I don't know is true I start the video by saying that and then they'll just edit it out and you know that means I can prove hey when I sent this video I did this and if they edit it that that's wrong I'm not okay with that but you know I don't know what else to do about it wait what this guy's policy about saying things he thinks might not be true is just make a disclaimer that he knows they're gonna edit out anyways like what kind of excuse is that yes I did know it was a scam but did you see that disclaimer that they edited out uh no because they edited it out oh well I'm sorry I can't be held responsible then I mean the audacity to admit that what you do it's just it's just kind of funny to me and look to be fair to Josh uh you know I didn't find any involvement Beyond just like the five or higher so I don't want to make it sound like he's some big Mastermind I just want to point out how sometimes people can just be complicit by being lazy with their vetting besides my main goal was to just try to find the people behind him anyway so I didn't really push the issue with him I really wanted to know who paid him for this job but this is where we hit another dead end uh yeah I'm not seeing it in my emails not sure what that means they might not have gone under the channel coin market news they might have tried to like yeah so you might get a script I my email body has the entire script so if I search I should be able to have an exact phrase and I should just pull right up so I'm not sure why that is but okay if we take Josh's word he can't find anything in his records now I asked Josh if he wanted to be part of another voice acting gig paid of course where um he would basically be disavowing the ad he just made for these guys uh but unfortunately he told me he doesn't feel like he's the best fit for this role apparently Josh had started getting a little more careful with the jobs he took either way for now this case is headed into the cold case files fortunately we can't close it yet until we know who's behind this but for now I think there's only one thing left to do after a Long Day's Work
