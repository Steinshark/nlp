hello everyone and welcome in this video we're talking about why today's electric vehicles are bad for towing and we're also going to look at tesla's cyber truck and talk about whether or not this might change things now i'm not here to bash electric vehicles in fact i think they're far better than most people give them credit for however i do think there are two major problems with today's electric vehicles the first one being priced they are still quite expensive and then the second one being energy density energy density meaning that the batteries are still very large they weigh a bunch and they don't hold all that much energy now this isn't really a problem if you're just driving yourself around town throw a kid in there heck throw two kids in there you're gonna be just fine you've got plenty of range as long as you've got a place to charge at home you come in and you've got a full battery every morning when you leave for the day so as far as daily driving electric cars today they're doing just fine the problem comes in when you then try to tow something and so that's what this video is about and i know looking at this this looks like an absolute mess but really the only thing all of this is showing here this mess of numbers is energy equals force times distance that's the only thing we're interested in here is how much energy is required to move around this electric vehicle and how much energy do we have so if nothing else that you get out of this we're just looking at force times distance that's a pretty simple equation i think everyone can follow along with that give me 65 percent of your attention and i think this is going to blow your mind the conclusions of this video are very cool so i encourage you to bear with me here so the first thing for a little bit of background we're going to look at several different vehicles so the first thing we're looking at is energy how much energy do each of these vehicles have on board so we're starting with our model x p 100 d it has 100 kilowatt hours of energy sitting in that battery pack next we have the tesla cyber truck and so we're going to assume that the 500 mile range version of this with the tri-motor is going to have about double the battery pack of this model xp100d so about a 200 kilowatt hour pack that's pretty consistent given its range and then we're going to look at something different an internal combustion engine in the form of a ford f-150 which has two gas tank options a 23-gallon tank and a 36 gallon tank now one gallon of gasoline is the energy equivalent of 33.7 kilowatt hours meaning this ford f-150 with a full tank has either 775 kilowatt hours worth of energy with the smaller tank or 1200 kilowatt hours worth of energy with the large tank so you can see there's an enormous difference in how much energy you're starting with at the beginning of your journey then we look at range and this is where electric cars really start to shine so we see that our model x can travel about 330 miles cyber truck they're estimating about 500 miles ford's range given its combined 19 mpg with the epa rating multiplied by the gallons that it has on board it's looking about 437 miles of range with the smaller tank 684 miles with the larger tank so what does this mean well our cyber truck with about a fourth of the energy of the f-150 here the one with the smaller tank is able to travel further so it's insanely efficient that's what's so cool about electric cars they're so dang efficient versus these internal combustion engines they have all this energy and what do they do with it the same amount of work that an electric vehicle does with it okay so let's say we want to go camping everyone loves camping right it's fun so we're in the city we want to get up in the mountains and enjoy some time out in the woods so the mountains are 100 miles away and our city is at about sea level and the mountains are you know let's say one mile up 5 280 feet so the distance we're going to travel this is on about a 1 grade you can do the math pythagorean theorem it turns out it's about 100 miles because we're going super far this way not that far this way so we're going over to this campground here up in the woods and we need to figure out to travel this 100 mile distance on this one percent grade how much energy does it take and remember this all comes back to this equation right here so we already know the distance we're traveling we're traveling 100 miles we're about 160 kilometers we just need to figure out what is the force required in order to push this system our little truck and our trailer our camper up to the campground now i didn't tell you guys this video requires a little bit of trigonometry but trigonometry is gross that's why i wrote ew if you do like trigonometry well here's the equations for figuring out theta the degree of our angle here here's our normal force and here's the force of gravity pulling back on our system if you don't like trigonometry ignore that nonsense you don't have to know it for the conclusions in this video now for our first example we are going camping with a tesla model x so there are some variables we need to know about our vehicle so the model x p 100 d weighs about 5 500 pounds we're going to say we're going to have 500 pounds of cargo that's you know your family whatever stuff you're bringing so all the people and all the stuff inside 500 pounds now we're also saying that you are towing a trailer the model x is rated for about 5 000 pounds so we're pulling a 5 000 pound camper along with us now the model x's drag coefficient is 0.25 that is insanely good however when you stick a trailer on it kind of ruins that entire system we're going to give it a drag coefficient of 0.4 this is still actually really generous what happens with that air is it hits the vehicle and then it wraps around and then it comes back and hits that trailer so it's kind of hitting you twice and you want that trailer and vehicle to be as close together as possible but of course there's going to be a gap there and as a result the aerodynamics are very poor and then for the area of the trailer here we're using 40 square feet as the frontal area of our trailer where did i get this number well i look at standardized weight ratings for trailers and what their area ends up being saej2807 and that's where i got this number from so those are some variables we need to know and we have our system and is moving up this hill we need to figure out what is the force required to get it up that hill and move those 100 miles so we have three things resisting this motion we have aerodynamic drag there's air pushing up against our vehicle as it travels along at whatever speed it is traveling we have rolling resistance so we've got energy that's being lost through the tires and then we have gravity of course gravity is pulling us down this hill so let's get started with aerodynamic drag the force of resistance here is equal to one-half air's density which we have right here multiplied by our velocity squared in this case we're traveling at 75 miles per hour it's about 120 kilometers per hour we multiply that by our drag coefficient of our system right here we're guessing 0.4 and then we're multiplying that by our area 40 square feet is the total frontal area of the system so when we multiply all of that out we get a force of 230 pounds next we have rolling resistance so our force here is equal to our normal force multiplied by our coefficient of rolling resistance this is the coefficient of rolling resistance for a tire on cement or asphalt we're going to go with about .015 and then we have already calculated our normal force over here so we have an 11 000 pound system we multiply that by cosine of our angle and multiply that by our coefficient of rolling resistance and we get 165 pounds force finally we need to account for gravity so we have an 11 000 pound system and we're multiplying that by sine of theta which is giving us the component of gravity which is pulling us down this hill multiplying that out you get a 110 pound force okay hang with me here this is the mind-blowing part so we take our force we multiply that by our distance which is 100 miles and then we multiply that by a conversion factor because once we multiply the force by the distance that is now in units of energy we simply convert those units into the form of units which we like which is kilowatt hours and so if we do that 230 multiplied by 100 miles multiplied by our conversion factor for aerodynamic drag alone we need 45.8 kilowatt hours moving on to rolling resistance if we multiply this number by our distance and our conversion factor we now need 32.8 kilowatt hours to overcome rolling resistance and doing the math for gravity we need 21.9 kilowatt hours so if we add each one of these up all of our resisting forces here how much total energy do we need in order to get to this campground 100.4 kilowatt hours what houston we have a problem we need a hundred point four kilowatt hours of energy to achieve this task but we only have a hundred kilowatt hours worth of energy it's literally not possible and so here's where we run into the challenge with towing with electric cars because if you have an electric vehicle like the tesla model x and you actually use it for towing it cannot do this task it can't even go 100 miles it doesn't have the energy to do it so while it is insanely efficient and if you're not towing around you can actually go a pretty good distance you can recharge all that kind of nice stuff if you put it in this towing scenario it literally doesn't have enough energy on board to complete it it doesn't matter how efficient it is even if it was a hundred percent efficient it cannot do it and so that's the struggle here now you might say jason why were you driving so fast while you were towing and my answer to you would be well i want to get where i'm going and i'm driving the speed limit but let's say you wanted to drive slower because you think with it while you're towing you should drive slower okay let's analyze this looking at our entire system moving at 60 miles per hour instead of 75 or about 100 kilometers per hour the total amount of energy required to do this exact same scenario here is 84 kilowatt hours and so we're now still assuming that we have 84 system efficiency in order to be able to complete this task and that's not including things like if we need to run our heater or the ac other internal systems we're not including any of that just looking at you know the energy efficiency of the vehicle would need to be at least 84 in order to complete this task it makes the case very hard that it would actually be able to do this and then on top of this you know either of these scenarios you're going to be stopping about you know every 75 minutes in order to recharge so you drive for 75 minutes you charge for 50. it's not going to be great as far as towing on a road trip and then just as a bit of a sanity check i wanted to look at how much energy would this model x require if we were not pulling a trailer we're just taking the model x and we're going up this hill and we've got better aerodynamics and less overall weight and it would be 51.3 kilowatt hours so significantly better and you can see that you know it's very possible when you are not towing in order to complete this task simple to do with the model x unfortunately once you stick that trailer on it kind of kills the whole thing okay so our next question can tesla cybertruck save us here we just want to go out in the woods and go camping so looking at the three motor cyber truck with the 500 miles of range we're assuming a 200 kilowatt hour battery pack double that of the model x we're giving it a generous weight of 6 thousand pounds i think it's probably going to be significantly heavier than that 500 pounds for occupants and stuff it has tesla claims a tow rating of 14 000 pounds elon has tweeted they might be able to get the drag coefficient down to 0.3 would be super impressive if they could and then the overall system we're going to give it the same aerodynamics as our model x to be generous and kind to it i looked up standardized trailers for 14 000 pounds and the area the square foot area of the front of that trailer is about 60 square feet so we do all the same math each one of these different systems here and we look at how much total energy does it need for aerodynamics for rolling resistance and for gravity for aerodynamic drag we're looking at 68.6 kilowatt hours for rolling resistance 61.1 kilowatt hours and then gravity pulling it back down this hill 40.8 kilowatt hours and so the total energy you sum all of this up 170.5 kilowatt hours and remember we're starting with a 200 kilowatt hour battery pack so that means we need to be at about 85 efficiency in order for this to work out and that's not using any of the other systems on the vehicle heating cooling you know if it's cold outside it's going to reduce the efficiency so it's again very tough that this thing is going to be able to do it if in fact it does have a 200 kilowatt hour battery pack now if we travel at 60 miles per hour instead of 75 miles per hour yes we do save some energy we're at 145.8 but we're still at about 75 percent of our total battery capacity in order to travel 100 miles the thing about that we're traveling 100 miles then we need to recharge a 200 kilowatt hour battery pack that's going to take some time even with 250 kilowatt uh chargers so we're going to be spending a lot of time charging if you are in fact pulling a rated load with this cyber truck now here's another very interesting point if we do all this with a ford f-150 and we look at the total energy required in order for it to do the same thing as this cyber truck the f-150 actually can't tow quite as much it's about 13 000 pounds for it's still rating but it has worse aerodynamics either way the math ends up working out to be about the same 170 kilowatt hours of energy that it needs in order to complete this task but look at how much energy this thing has it's an insane amount of energy that it starts with and so as a result it only needs to operate at 14 efficiency in order to make this task work so it's able to do it these things can operate at 14 efficiency no problem the thing is going to be able to go these hundred miles and yes it's going to be expensive to refill because you're refilling a 36 gallon tank that's quite massive but it is able to do it you refill the tank and you're back on your way so that's why it's so easy to do with an f-150 and the challenge today with these electric cars is that the battery size is so small even if they're really efficient you just don't have enough energy to do this task now i can feel it you're looking at me and you're saying jason you're being unfair to the electric cars who drives a mile up okay let's get rid of the whole mile up thing i wanted to go camping out in the mountains you guys don't want to go camping it's fine we're not going camping we're going to go to florida and we're just going to drive in a flat straight line forever for 100 miles so we do this in a flat straight line in florida with our model x with our 5 000 pound trailer and how much energy does it take 78.6 where does that come from well we take the total amount of energy we don't have to worry about gravity anymore so we're subtracting this out we get 78.6 kilowatt hours required in order to do this on flat ground still 80 of the battery to travel a hundred miles not that far okay but what about regeneration certainly what goes up must come down so if we're going up into the woods to go camping once we turn around and we're coming back down this hill then we get to regenerate energy the whole way back and we have a nice full battery when we get back to the city right unfortunately not right so if you want to calculate how much energy does it take to go these hundred miles downhill we still have the same amount of aerodynamic drag we have the same amount of rolling resistance we then get to subtract the energy for gravity here because it's working for us instead of against us and so the total amount of energy required to go these 100 miles here are 56.7 kilowatt hours more than taking this model x uphill by itself so yes we are going downhill but it still requires a ton of energy because of aerodynamic drag we're traveling at 75 miles per hour and because of rolling resistance rolling resistance becomes pretty significant once you have a really heavy system which we do here because of adding on the weight of that trailer and the fact that the electric car is pretty heavy so unfortunately there really aren't any good scenarios for the model x to travel at a decent distance while pulling along its rated load okay conclusions and as it says right here some good news so the overall theme of this vehicle electric vehicles are plenty capable of towing things they have the torque they have the ability to do it they don't have the onboard energy to do it at a meaningful distance so that is the real challenge here is that it just simply requires a certain amount of energy to move a mass from one spot to another and while electric vehicles are insanely efficient they don't have much energy in them and so unfortunately the math just works out where it's very difficult for them to be able to complete tasks like this especially at rated load now what is the good news well the good news is let's go back to this ford f-150 for a second it only needs about 14 efficiency to complete this task in reality this thing's probably operating at about 30 percent efficiency so it can probably do this task about twice meaning it's about twice as good as this tesla cyber truck here so if battery technology improves simply two times especially if it improves three times if we triple our energy density or double our energy density of today's current battery technology then we are in the sweet spot and electric cars are going to be running away with this all day so there is the potential for it to happen we have seen this kind of improvement in electric batteries and there's no reason to assume why they won't do this in the future so as we continue to improve electric batteries simply two to three times perhaps on trailers you can incorporate solar panels you know if there's enough efficient energy generation coming onto that trailer you could help extend the range so there are solutions that probably will come out in the future especially if energy density of batteries is improved we just simply aren't there right now today so thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below
