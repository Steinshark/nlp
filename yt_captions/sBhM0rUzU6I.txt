over the span of 100 years the Shaw Brothers built a massive Empire with business interests first in Shanghai Hong Kong Malaysia and Singapore the multifaceted Empire came to dominate the Hong Kong film industry during its peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s Shaw Brothers Studio employed hundreds of people working around the clock to produce dozens of high budget flicks but did legendary Tycoon run run Shaw really love making movies or was it just about the money in this video we will follow the story of four brothers that dominated Chinese language media for decades but first let me talk about the Asian Armature patreon Early Access members get to see new videos and selected references for those videos before the release of the public it help supports the videos and I appreciate every pledge thanks and on with the show the sprawling Shaw Brothers business Empire starts with the four Shaw Brothers they are and we start with the eldest ranje run D run May and finally run lung or run run the Run shared by all of their names means benevolence their fathering was a textile pigment Merchant from the city of Ningbo Morris dang was also born there like many of his kin Sal moved to Shanghai to pursue business opportunities the father gave all of his sons a good education with both Chinese and Western influences but the youngest brother runrun received the most westernized education attending an american-run English school in Shanghai eventually built a very successful textile dye business however it closed after his death in 1920 mostly because none of his sons had any interest in becoming textile merchants saw the eldest brother trained and worked as a lawyer but retained a love for the Arts in his spare time he wrote scripts for Chinese operas to be performed in local theaters then in 1923 ranjir Shah acquired his first theater it became such a success that he acquired a few more and he encouraged his brothers to join him in the business but theaters need a constant flow of content to show and inevitably the theater owner gets frustrated with how little good content is available thus in 1925 ranja Shaw got into Film Production with the studio tiene film or unique film tne started with five thousand dollars a bunch of costumes some scripts and a theater cast from the start the studio was a true family affair with the four brothers all working there run Jess served as general manager and also directed the movies run D was the accountant run May ran film distribution and despite still being in school at the time run run did the marketing he sometimes also worked as a cameraman all three of the younger brothers wrote Scripts in its first two years the studio produced 11 movies all directed by run Tia Shah their first hit was heroin Lee feifei about a female Knight who rescues a woman who was about to take her own life after a forced marriage other movies include Madame Whitesnake in 1926 flirting love in 1926 and Mulan joins the Army in 1927. the first such movie about Hua Mulan was just one of many chinese-owned studios producing movies in Shanghai then China's Hollywood that domestic Chinese movie industry struggled however in the 1920s due to intense competition from foreign imports tne's business strategy for surviving through these difficult times was to make cheap low budget content adopted from local folklore the company was run very conservatively a characteristic of ningbour businessmen you might summarize it as low cost short Cycles fast production and big turnouts in a 1933 interview ranja Shaw said Tian Yi has one characteristic we don't accrue debts all our materials are procured with cash this is what you don't see with other film companies the business grew well on top of these sound fundamentals ranjesh Shah bragged in that same interview that his Studio's Capital had grown from ten thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars with annual cash flows of 70 to 80 grand y's competition in the 1920s included Ming Shing literally meaning star and Great China Lily Ming Shing was China's largest Studio of the 1920s founded in 1922 by Pioneer dang chitwan the company was originally set up as a stock market exchange but dang changed his mind and started a film studio instead in 1926 means Xing banded together its competitors to form a film cartel Lee Hue or united six in an attempt to gain leverage over the Hollywood Imports tiene did not join the cartel which put them in opposition with the United States the name sounds like something out of a comic book the cartel quickly called for a consumer boycott of quote-unquote cheap movies they also saw the domestic film Industries over reliant on costume films most of which were apolitical romances has not been in line with the country's current nationalist fervor in other words tiene is cheap Opera based films were entirely unacceptable to the cartel the cartel not only applied political pressure but also pressured theaters into exclusively showing their own films and not tianese it should be noted that tne also pledged to support China's nationalist goals but at its heart the company was politically neutral their focus was on making money United 6's strong armed tactics succeeded in crushing many local competitors in 1927 sources listed about 179 domestic film companies three years later in 1930 less than a dozen were still in operation half of the 113 feature Productions submitted for censorship in 1933 were made by one of the three largest Studios realizing the difficulty of the Chinese market ranjesha decided that the studio had to diversify so in 1925 and 1926 he sent two of his younger brothers run May 1st and then run run to Singapore the two brothers arrived at Singapore to find that many of the locals there watched films from Ming Shing tiany's great Nemesis ranjia then just 25 years old and run run a mere 19 years old were shanghainese and thus regarded by the Cantonese teochu and hoki and people as Outsiders nevertheless it was a good Market the growing tin and rubber export trades boosted The Fortunes of local Chinese Merchants such people and their families needed entertainment and longed for content from back home the duo traveled around Malaysia's Villages testing their content with the locals with a mobile Cinema packed up in a few Vans run May recalls we went to all the small towns all no Cinema we just try to place one place two then next place we just started like that from this very beginning we tried traveling shows you know just like that some places had no cinema at all we had a tent you know traveling if the villagers liked the movie then they bought some land to build a theater they also bought the land around the theater betting that it would grow more valuable too classic Land Development strategy what began as simple diversification became a profitable Revenue stream and later an Empire by the late 1920s a single film print generated about 2 000 yen in Shanghai during its brief run in the theaters but overseas one estimate found that Chinese Studios can earn another 2400 Yen by selling the same print to Singapore and Malaysia 1800 yen to Thailand 2700 yen to Indonesia and 800 yen to Vietnam the early 1930s saw the introduction of sound movies to China ranges seized on the opportunity and sent run overseas to acquire the necessary equipment and produce the first Cantonese talkie 1933's white gold dragon the movie was a hit in and outside of China so in 1934 ranjia Shah opened a tne branch in Hong Kong originally named Unique Hong Kong it gained a new name nanyang Studio or literally South Sea Studio this movie was originally made for production reasons Hong Kong harbored a rich pool of local Cantonese Opera talents it also offered a safe haven from the mainland's increasing censorship of films like the martial arts movies that were tiene's specialty but then Japan invaded Manchuria on false pretenses in 1932 and uncertainty and Chaos descended upon China in light of this ranjia eventually moved all of tiany's equipment and operations in Shanghai over to Hong Kong Shaw Brothers geographical diversification to Southeast Asia paid off in a huge way throughout the 1930s in mainland China the film Market collapsed due to the impact of economic uncertainty as well as Warfare both inside and outside of the country Ming shing's cartel the united six failed to stay United as the other Studios feuded over Ming xing's overbearingness meanwhile the Shahs prospered in Southeast Asia by 1939 the Shahs oversaw a large entertainment business that included 140 theaters and nine amusement parks these theaters were quite diverse some were outright owned by the Shahs other were joint ventures some were large and luxurious capable of seating 500 to 800 people in leather seats with armrests others offered just ceiling fans and wood benches this theater chain needed a steady flow of content so in 1937 Shaw Brothers announced that they would start producing films in Malaysia in 1940 they built a twenty thousand dollar Studio a mole Mine Road in Singapore directors and Equipment were brought over from Hong Kong to produce family dramas romances and horror flicks over 300 Malay films were produced during the Golden Age of Malay Cinemas runger had big plans for Hong Kong however those plans suffered a devastating setback in 1934 run jia's first wife Tanya Ying passed away then shortly thereafter in 1936 two fires broke out and the nanyang studio in Hong Kong destroying a large portion of the company's early film works run gen never recovered from this dual tragedy believing that the fires had been deliberately set by competitors he largely retired from the business however he still helped informally traveling between Hong Kong and Shanghai until the Communist Revolution the second brother run D Shaw moved to Hong Kong to take over as the head of nanyang Studio despite tiene's various diversification moves they could not avoid Japanese aggression in 1937 a year after run D took over the Japanese invaded Shanghai tiany's remaining Studio Assets in Shanghai were destroyed bananyang studio in Hong Kong continued to produce cheap Cantonese films for the brothers theaters in Singapore and Malaysia Randi ran nanyang Studio differently from his brother he had little involvement in producing films for that he hired the Chinese director Hong Chung ho rather he managed accounting keeping budgets small and tight records in 1938 showed nanyang filming five movies all at the same time with each film finished in just three weeks and costing just 6 000 Hong Kong dollars this flow of content kept the company going then in late 1941 Hong Kong 2 fell to the Japanese Army which confiscated the assets of nanyang Studio run D Shaw fled back to Shanghai and stayed there with his elder brother until the end of the war a few months later in 1942 the Japanese invaded and took over Singapore run me and run run intended to flee to Australia but the government imposed an exit ban on all young men in the city the two families were eventually captured and briefly imprisoned for the next few years during the occupation Shaw Cinemas were made to show Japanese propaganda films until the wars end after the war ended run me and renran started rebuilding the business supposedly by digging up the gold they had buried to keep away from the Japanese for a decade thereafter the Shahs held a near Monopoly position in film distribution throughout Colonial Malaysia after the war's end run D also returned to Hong Kong to rebuild nanyang Studio he had six Sons which back then was considered a real asset and not just because you can set up a whole basketball team with them he founded the company Shaw and Sons nanyang was reorganized within the Sean's son's company the other two Shaw Brothers relied on nunyang to provide the Chinese language content needed to keep their South East Asian theater Empire running Hong Kong had grown massive during the post-war period as War raged back in the mainland like Randy many of the refugees were shanghainese bringing with them their film knowledge and Heritage this flood of talent helped Hong Kong produce many Mandarin films throughout the early 1950s alongside the Cantonese ones already being made there for a long time Hong Kong had separate film Industries operating for separate audiences but as this industry heated up nanyang Studios output stagnated Randy Shaw had never been too interested in making movies complaining that the studio business was just too competitive and a bad business to be in meanwhile Hong Kong's post-war population explosion had fueled a big run-up in real estate prices Shaw and Sons slowly became a property management company that also happened to make movies on the side Randy sold the land under the original nanyang Studio due to a zoning issue but then reinvested the gains into the Hong Kong property Market this disinterest became a big problem from run May and run run the other two brothers then still living in Singapore in 1955 the Singaporean Cinema Tycoon Lo cuanto and his theater chain Cafe organization set up a movie studio in Hong Kong motion picture and general investment or mpgi this Film Studio enlisted talents there and abroad to create fun modern films that embraced Hong Kong's urban life an example film is 1957's our sister heedi which tells the story of four sisters and their father in Hong Kong an upbeat funny film that embraced both traditional Chinese and Western values it won the Best Picture award in the 1957 Asian film festival films like these became quite popular in Southeast Asia which Vex run May and run run whose theater Empire competed with cafes the brothers were paying Shaw and Sons 250 000 Hong Kong dollars per movie for this low budget old-fashioned content that didn't satisfy the audiences down south what gives frustrated run run already 50 years old then decided to pull a Thanos and do it himself in 1958 run run relocated up to Hong Kong with 5 million Hong Kong dollars and set up an ambitious new studio called Shaw Brothers Randy's Shaw and Sons was shun to the side relegated to simple film distribution and exhibition Shaw Brothers started off with a splash run run intended from the very start to build a company with a global Focus he hired International talents to help realize his vision the most notable hire was the Studio's head of publicity Raymond Chao Chao had been a reporter for the Hong Kong standard and a producer for Voice of America such hires helped inject the company with world-class westernized talents to upscale the look and feel of their movies at the start Shaw Brothers competed with cathay's mg and pi to be the first to produce a particular popular story or version of another movie and then in 1964 cathay's founder Lo Juan toe died in a tragic plane crash apparently caused by communist agents on the plane trying to hijack it not sure about that one but had to include it anyway Cathay afterwards changed their strategic plans and dialed back on Film Production throughout the mid-1960s then in 1970 they left the business entirely leaving Shaw seemingly unchallenged in Hong Kong in 1961 Shaw Brothers opened a brand new 46-acre movie making campus in Hong Kong's Clearwater Bay called Movie Town Movie Town had 12 sound stages 16 outdoor sets 86 000 costumes recording facilities a film lab and even apartments for workers it was the largest integrated film campus outside of Hollywood runrun had to cut 60 feet off the top of a hill to build it the launch received a great deal of international publicity the Hong Kong colonial government wanted to dispel the colony's reputation then as a sweatshop and showcase a new era of modern industry throughout his career in Hong Kong Run cultivated excellent ties with the British colonial government such ties were necessary for Shaw Brothers as businesses and would help him gain even greater wealth later on Movie Town operated like an assembly line over a thousand workers worked eight to ten hour shifts producing movies 24 hours a day in the 1960s movietown produced an average of 40 to 45 high budget films each year most of these movies were costume and martial arts dramas 1967's one-armed swordsmans for instance the first Hong Kong movie to make over 1 million Hong Kong dollars at the local box office but Shaw smoothly switched between genres that made musicals youth movies Capers comedies whatever was popular in the movie theaters then they even remade Japanese action and spy flicks the hiring of Japanese directors inoue umetsuku and nakahira KO despite the nastiness of the recent War run wanted his Studio to be world class the Shaw Brothers logo even looked like that of the Warner Brothers shield and the business ran like the old 1930s style Studios the goal was to produce everything in-house and to do it faster than the competition this is a souped-up version of the old tne Film Studio model more films faster and more efficiently such a model brought Shaw success over Cathay to keep costs down he signed talents like actors and Craftsmen to multi-year Deals compliance Stars got featured in more Shaw Brothers movies unruly stars were shunted to the side Albert O'Dell who worked for both Cathay and Shaw Brothers said the difference between Cafe and Shaw is when I was associated with Cathay you don't know where you are with so much biting and politics this and that with Shaw you know where you are you are nowhere whoever is working for the Shaws know that if they think they were big shots outside the shaw family they were only kidding themselves remember that last sentence run run oversaw every part of the business every day he woke up at six a.m ate a small bowl of noodles for breakfast and did Qigong in his massive Mansion at Clearwater Bay he then takes a five-minute ride to the studios in a Rolls-Royce in the mornings he handles the creative side reading scripts and reviewing recommendations alongside Raymond Chao in the afternoons and evenings he shifts gears to focus on the company's film distribution and exhibition businesses across Southeast Asia Shaw's in-house structure was incredibly profitable in 1969 Raymond Chao estimated that it cost Shaw about eight hundred thousand to 1.5 million Hong Kong dollars or three hundred thousand dollars U.S to make one movie most of these movies returned about three times their cost being a family-run company Shaw Brothers balanced a number of clicks but Power always belonged to run Run's family in 1969 run run began favoring the singer Mona Fong within the company while still married to his wife run run and Mona first met in Singapore in 1952 when he was in his 40s and she was 17. Mona was made head of the Shaw Brothers purchasing department which gave her oversight over guys like Raymond Chao smarting over the consistently low pay and feeling increasingly frozen out Chao left in 1970 to set up his own company called Golden Harvest Golden Harvest bought cathay's old movie studio in Diamond Hill their first few movies were martial arts dramas but then they reaped a Golden Harvest by stealing a rising star right from under old runrun's nose some guy named Bruce Lee perhaps you've heard of him after a series of supporting roles in Hollywood Lee wanted something more he was advised by a producer to go to Hong Kong and make a Chinese kung fu superhero movie to Showcase his skills in 1970 he first approached Shaw Brothers his ask was ten thousand dollars U.S per title and the right to pick his scripts nothing particularly demanding by Hollywood standards but run run counter-offered with a maximum of 9 000 Hong Kong dollars per title A pittance and the Shaw Brothers standard long-term contract Raymond Chao swooped in with a 7500 US dollar offer and more creative control with Golden Harvest Lee starred in four breakthrough films some of the most profitable in cinema history the 1971 movie Big Boss for instance grossed 50 million dollars U.S against a budget of just one hundred thousand and was the highest grossing Hong Kong movie until Lee's next one Fist of Fury Lee's untimely death in 1973 caused issues but Golden Harvest survived by signing new stars like the comedian Michael Huey and Jackie Chan their style of signing talent-friendly Arrangements helped attract Stars away from Shaw Brothers Golden Harvest eventually felt confident enough to even Venture into the United States there they produce successful b-movies like Cannonball Run in 1981 160 million against 16 million dollar budget and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in 1990 202 million dollar gross against a 13.5 million budget ultimately run run was like his elder brother movies were fine but in the end he wanted to make money the movie and theater business was fun when he was the only game in town but after Golden Harvest crashed the party he concluded that film was a quote-unquote sunset industry and shifted his interest towards something much more profitable back in 1967 run run had acquired a large stake in TVB a television channel the channel had originally been set up to show Cantonese and English language content mostly news talk or variety shows the company also had a small International syndication division which purchased the rights to Regional content and resold them to other TV broadcasters in Taiwan Singapore and so on in the mid-1970s new competition from channels like Asia television and Commercial television forced TVB to expand into new types of content they decide to start producing TV dramas tapping Shaw Brothers film experience to do it this was a smashing success shows like the 59 episode long legend of the Condor heroes in 1983 were some of the most watched Series in Hong Kong history syndicating this content to other Asian broadcasters Taiwan most of all was such a money host that in 1982 TVB set up a separate division to do it over time they became Hong Kong's biggest TB company then expanding into news and the internet run run remained in control of this TV Empire until 2011 when he finally sold this 26 stake to a Consortium like with his father run Run's first two sons did not seem to be all that interested in continuing the family business in 1981 Mona Fong largely took over the Shaw Brothers operations from run Run's first two sons the sons apparently now do real estate development in Singapore taking over for their Uncle run May Shaw shortly thereafter the company began dismantling its filmmaking operations as part of a transition towards producing and syndicating its TV dramas the cinemas were leased to a fellow Tycoon from 1988 to 1997 Shaw Brothers still produced movie up to five movies in a given year however the mass production film Factory the late 1960s and early 1970s went away and in 1986 movie town was converted into tvb's Studio City or TV City the names are a bit confusing TVB recently moved its HQ leaving the old area largely abandoned Mona and run run eventually married in 1997 when he was in his late 80s run run died nearly 20 years later in 2014 at the astounding age of 106. Mona died three years later at the age of 83. run run ran his Studio first and foremost to be a commodity content machine first for his profitable theaters and then for his profitable TV channel to quote him we are here to make money Shaw Brothers movies might now be looked upon with some nostalgic fondness some like one armed swordsman or come drink with me are even considered Classics of the genre perhaps some of the best of all time but I can't help but feel that that was more the exception than the rule accidental products of a factory line May despite their circumstances rather than because of it alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the Channel Sign up for the newsletter and I'll see you guys next time
