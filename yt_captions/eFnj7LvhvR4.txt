this is an Apple computer but unlike the ones that you've used before it's not pretty because it's intended to be hidden away in a server rack I know right like what I mean when you think of Apple you think of consumer electronics because that's the only thing that they advertise but they not only made servers but they quietly did so for over 20 years and by the time they reached their final form these things could be found in businesses and schools throughout the world being used for everything from file serving to Media workflow acceleration to Microsoft active directory Services played an apple server for a Microsoft anyway the point is they were unlike other Apple products in many ways for one the x-serve lineup was positioned as a budget alternative to premium solutions from PC makers upside down World it raises so many questions like why was it so cheap did it have any redeeming qualities why did Apple ultimately pull the plug find out we bought the last x-serve machine that Apple ever produced and we're gonna take it out for a rep this is gonna be fun bud fun like this segue to our sponsor said app owning this doesn't turn you into a professional by Design it's more about great software and how you use it if you're someone who creates value with the help of your Apple devices you should check out all the superpowers that the apps from setapp can give you link down below we consider the 2009 exer31 to be the last real server from Apple because while there were server versions of the Mac Mini until 2012 they were basically the same as their desktop counterparts just with some minor tweaks to the specs with third-party accessories they could be used to fill the apple shaped void in an organization's rack but it was pretty clear that Apple's Focus had moved on and over the next 10 years they would slowly chip away at the functionality of their Mac OS server software until its eventual death in 2022. but enough about that we've got a Mac server in its prime and this is my first Hands-On what exactly did they think different well for a server she's definitely pretty slick and stylish and weighs only a mirror 40 pounds with most of the drive bay is not populated the system identifier button is on both the front and the back when you press it it flashes both of them which is a nice little quality of life feature that makes it easy to locate on the rack on the other side of our front USB is our ethernet port lights then right of that are the system activity lights if you hold down the power button and the identifier button to boot that allows you to use the lights to select a boot method without requiring a monitor or any input devices now given its utility as a file server and a media server you'd think it would have a lot more Drive Bays it has only three by default ah an excerpt server would normally be paired with an x-rayed which as you probably guessed is a rack mounted raid enclosure that would sit either right above it or right below it giving it an additional 14 Drive Bays now obviously we're not going to deploy this thing so we don't need one of those but we do need at least one and we were missing all of them out of the box so we had to order one off of eBay as it turns out the sleds are proprietary which isn't uncommon but the connectors are also proprietary which is uncommon we received what may have been one of the last remaining sealed x-serve drives in existence fun fact by the way for both the excerve and the x-rayed the drives themselves are just standard SATA and SAS hard drives and then beyond adapting them to this proprietary interface Apple also went a step further and vendor locked them through the firmware so even if you could get your hands on random extra sleds you couldn't simply upgrade them with off-the-shelf Replacements bastard they weren't the only ones who pulled this kind of crap that doesn't make it okay I can't wait to take this apart this thing is just kind of wild to me right some stuff may not be normal today but was at the time like having a slim optical drive in the front of your server but other things were weird even then like the fact that it has firewire ports and Mini DisplayPort instead of just basic VGA how does Apple always manage to make Hardware look so pretty and what are you you look like a weird little Drive of some sort yo Tanner yes what the devil is this little guy here that little guy is the primary hard drive for it so even when Drive yeah even when all three of these are empty your operating system is still going to go on there and it uses a proprietary connector because just it can I'm assuming I'm going to find the fans under the cool little shrap yay so there they are they may be short but boy are they ever thick what is this card this thing is chock full of what appears to be both nand Flash and dram Tanner when you told me this thing is basically just a 2009 Mac Pro but in server form I didn't think I was going to be finding whatever this is would that possibly be a raid card oh yes that is very possible confirmed this is a RAID card and you could apparently buy this raid card as a pcie card as well that is hilarious and if I had to guess I would say this plug right here is the same one that this one is using for its backup battery because I don't see a backup battery in here and under normal circumstances you would want to have a battery on a hardware raid card because that way any data that was in Flight like sitting in the cache on the raid card about to be written to the hard drives in the event of a sudden power loss could be preserved by keeping the card powered so that it could be flushed to the drives after the fact or it's possible that Apple assumed that if this thing is sitting in a data center somewhere oh no that there should be no reason for it to suddenly lose power I need to find all those screws fortunately I've got the LTT store screwdriver complete with magnet screw finding bit hopefully these are Ferris screws ah yes they are oh good one two got another dual gigabit network card here I'm assuming this is just gigabit right yes yeah all right nothing special about that but what I'm really interested in is this card under it you know what this looks like an mxm module is that what it is is this a GPU yup why the hell are they putting laptop gpus in servers huh oh and it's Nvidia this is before they started quarreling and uh didn't use any of each other's products anymore for anything what is this I believe that is a gt130 I love when Apple Builds an upgradability into their products and then completely abandons them like the 2019 Mac Pro you know this reminds me of the 2019 Mac Pro in more ways than one you've got the unrealized upgrade potential and then you've also got the fact that it's uh rack mounted server version of what is essentially the same Hardware running the same software Macos it's just that when the 2019 version rolled around and we thought oh maybe they'll you know pay attention to the server space again clearly that didn't happen and oh wait yeah I guess that's not really a difference because that also happened here they were also both based on Intel platforms with risk-based CPUs that would proceed and follow them one difference is that I wouldn't describe the x-serv lineup as a failure so where did these things come from well it was ultimately Apple's strong foothold in the education and media sectors that really kept these things alive so naturally those are two areas that remain strong targets when their Enterprise equipment first started rolling out with the new OS X created as a Rebrand with the return of Steve Jobs and the later release of the iPod so to continue to fit into these markets they allowed easy integration into existing Windows heavy environments easy creation and maintenance of workflows for things like Network installation of newly purchased Macs and a video podcast creation system that required minimal human intervention that ran best on excerve this last point is also important because it allowed Apple to help saturate the podcast section of iTunes with videos that were made to be viewed on things like the existing iPod video and then later the iPhone Educators could put lectures online media companies could expand to new mediums and enthusiasts were rewarded for their purchase with some of that delicious sweet content content oh yeah right we're supposed to be making content about this uh let's turn it on wow those are just about the brightest network activity indicator LEDs I have ever seen I'm here for it I appreciate that hey look at that uh what's my name LTT daddy oh sorry what we're booted up into snow leopard but the way we got here was very complicated with no drive for it the system initially booted into recovery for Yosemite but recovery would get stuck because it required an Apple ID well Apple IDs these days require two-factor authentication which is something that was missing from the sign-in process on our Yosemite recovery Drive the workaround is to put the 2fa number at the end of the password but then it refused to authenticate because the TLs and SSL encryption that were baked into the operating system were using expired keys and there was no way to update them the newest Mac OS version that supports the excerpt is El Capitan so you might say just install that right wrong when you try to create a bootable USB installer on something more modern like a 2017 MacBook Pro it'll tell you that El Capitan will not run on the machine and refuse to create the device Apple if you need a working operating system on a machine in order to install an operating system on that same machine users with faulty drives on older systems are forced to take their devices to The Genius Bar I am not rolling up to the Guildford Apple Store with this thing they hate me enough already so we settled on Snow Leopard server it installed fine though it still refused to run the installer for El Capitan because we needed to install software updates software updates wouldn't install because there was no app store and the Apple website couldn't be accessed to download the App Store in Safari because the old version of safari doesn't support apple.com's security so we had to download Chrome to download the App Store to run the updater to run the installer to update the operating system and then finally with El Capitan installed all the server software was missing as it turns out after snow leopard server Apple stopped producing server-specific versions of their operating systems made the old baked in programs stop working after the upgrade and then they released the OS 10 server Suite as an app in the app store it only cost 20 bucks so no big deal except that they stopped selling it in April of 2022 and we have no way to get it we settled then on dual booting so that we can show off both the latest software and the X serves features Apple we're not saying you have to support your old Hardware but to intentionally make it impossible to use that's just plain rude the last server super cool uh wait okay so sorry is this the page oh yeah very cool right out of the box then the web server is running and we just have to go to the IP address of the server that brings us to a portal for various web services that are available then on the dock we've got the default server applications that set this apart from the regular snow leopard that would have come on your late 2009 MacBook server preferences allows you to change basic settings for users and groups file sharing which functions the way you would assume a file sharing server would mail an iCal which would allow it to theoretically function as a replacement for Microsoft Exchange ichat The Familiar chat client from the era though this time posted for use within work groups which allowed organizations to maintain their own chat logs in-house and they could Federate with xmpp servers to allow for chat between members in different organizations it's got web which handled the web server with the UI making it super easy to implement simple internet Pages VPN which allowed users to connect using layer 2 or point-to-point tunneling time machine which has the server function as a storage place for other Macs in the network to dump their time machine backups and security which is pretty much just firewall rules there are also some icons to see general information text logs and system usage graphs all of this stuff looks very Apple so far right in a yeah it works but it can't be customized much going away and if that's how you want to manage your server it's kind of a great product because that's how it'll function for you but right beside server preferences here is the server admin button and this is the real powerhouse this window gives access to much more minute details and some other functions that were hidden from View and preferences for some reason puzzlingly this is the only way to access things like SMB for acting as a PC compatible file server QuickTime streaming and podcast producer podcast producer was a pretty cool idea that allowed networked users to easily record video podcasts following workflows that were created beforehand in podcast composer two cameras could be connected to the server and then could be recorded from at once with the recording process controlled using the web portal or the podcast capture application on Mac once the recording was complete it would automatically be encoded and could even be published automatically if that's what the workflow called for if there were multiple servers in the network configured through xgrid CPU heavy tasks like encoding could be offloaded to those servers this was probably a pretty great system to record things like University lectures without requiring too much human intervention or tying up all the compute power from a single server moving on there's work group manager which is is exactly what it sounds like podcast composer which allowed management of things like the workflows used in podcast producer screen sharing which worked like most VNC remote access tools but was Mac specific and system image utility a super cool tool for creating customized Network bootable and installable images of snow leopard this could be used to deploy standardized installs to a lot of computers at once or to have networked computers boot right off of the image on the server considering that this breadth of features came baked into a server OS that had an easy to use GUI with no cost added on top of the hardware it's a little surprising that the product wasn't popular enough to survive especially when you account for Windows servers absolutely ridiculous pricing structure I mean not only does Windows Server cost more than desktop Windows the client access licenses or Cals mean that you have to pay an additional license fee for every user who is going to access that server or come to think of it maybe that's what makes all of this not surprising at all like any Corporation Apple's raison datra is to make money and being a forward-looking company Apple would have clearly recognized that the world was moving to cloud-based storage and services rather than locally hosted ones so with that in mind are they better off trying to bitterly compete and increase their one-time licensing costs for these bare metal servers or are they better off charging users monthly to build up their own centralized infrastructure and subscription-based revenue well I think we all know the answer to that but that doesn't mean the x-serve is totally dead there's an active Enthusiast community that is dedicated to keeping these machines in service turning them into personal servers budget Mac Pro Replacements or whatever Frankenstein monstrosities their Little Mac loving Minds can come up with LT and Frankenstein monstrosities actually go hand in hand and what better way to monsterify something than to turn it into a formidable gaming machine now unfortunate unfortunately we ran into some challenges getting that going for today not the least of which was that we wanted to upgrade the CPUs for better performance and it turns out Apple uses delighted xeons like what are they the play it safe fruit company or are they a bunch of mad scientist enthusiasts I can never tell anyway let me know in the comments if you want to see a follow-up I think that would be a lot of fun fun like this
