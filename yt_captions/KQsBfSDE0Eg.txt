you might have already seen the headlines that huawei's us ban is gonna cost them billions that they've already had to cancel product launches and if they're building a small phone without the u.s. is impossible buffed always mate 30 pro will apparently be a massive step forward and there is potentially a light at the end of the tunnel let me explain where the worry is coming from while we can't do business with US companies and we've already talked about how this means they can't work with Google on the software front but there's arguably an even bigger hurdle because of how complex these modern-day phones are they almost always use components from every part of the globe the u.s. being one of the main contributors let me give you an example you might have heard of arm the uk-based semiconductor company responsible for the designs of pretty much every mobile chip out there including Huawei's what this company does is creates new chip designs and then just sells the licenses to users designs and you might have already heard arm is one of the many companies that is pulled out of working with hallway to which you might be thinking why arm as a UK company and while waistband is with the u.s. not the UK but it turns out that some of the technology that arm UK uses has originated from the US and even that is enough to cause a problem now I've already talked about how huawei's Hong Lang operating system could potentially allow it to bypass not being able to work with Google but the question here is how on earth can it possibly get around all the rest of the companies it's been working with just bear in mind that it might not come to this it's still possible that what weighs band could be retracted or even that the US could add exceptions to it but this is the current trajectory so if we take a look inside for ways p30 pro phone there are a few poor problem areas components that would need to change should the band continues and this actually starts with the glass on the front corning the company that makes gorilla glass is American good start now i fix it is actually taking a look inside the phone where a few more issues pop up you've got a us-based storage module and what could be particularly difficult to change us-based radio chips which the phone would need to get 3G or 4G signal around the world add to this that arm has pulled out on the chip front and it's not a pretty situation but the fact that Huawei is such a broad powerful company could just be there saving grace if this had just happened to any old firm they almost definitely would have been crippled but Huawei specifically as a chance you might have heard of high silicon it is also a semiconductor company and is fully owned by Huawei they make the Kiran chips that you see each year in Huawei phones which are in part based on technologies from arm hence why that company has had to pull out but in the same way that Huawei has been sort of in the background preparing to be able to work without Google it also looks like they've been preparing to work without arm over the last few years these high silicon chips have slowly been using fewer and fewer technologies from arm and according to Bloomberg their next carrying 985 chip which is what the mate 30 probe would be using is not affected by the u.s. ban on top of this even if it turns out that the chip is still somewhat based on arm they might still be okay because of how soon the chip is meant to be coming out its design and licenses will almost definitely have been finalized before the ban came into place and so it is likely that Huawei has already stockpiled them it's more the future chips where or we might start to have a problem essentially the company has got a year they would have a year to redesign their current chips so that they're not using arm technology all without losing compatibility with Android applications it is by no means an easy task but it's possible especially when Huawei the stakes are so high if they don't and this is kind of the overarching message here it is difficult but it is possible even when it comes to the us-based storage modules in the p30 Pro we know that Huawei is already working on its own storage solutions they've actually come out with their own brand of nano storage cards and so creating internal flash storage for future phones is not out of the question and let's not forget that on these upcoming mate phones there are many components that wouldn't need to change at all most of them actually the OLED panels on the front the batteries and qualies pride and joy the camera systems that can practically see in the dark wouldn't need to be altered at all from whatever the original plan for them was I also wanted to add to this that this original plan that seems very exciting pretty much everything we liked about the p30 pro + more power and what is shaping up to be a super fluid 90 Hertz refresh rate add to this that according to Lika ice universe the mate will have a very fascinating design that goes beyond what any current renders have shown and the current renders he's referring to are actually already a pretty big change for Huawei anyways I'm personally still hoping that while we get to slice to use Google back I don't think many consumers are really benefiting from this situation at least not in the short term but at the same time it's kind of reassuring to know that even with everything it's stacked against them like this always still might be able to come through I think that's really exciting if you enjoyed this video a sub
