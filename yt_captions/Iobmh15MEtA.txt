the three gorgeous dam is china's biggest and most controversial dam part of the reason for that controversy had to do with the immense three gorges reservoir with the filling of the three gorges reservoir some 600 square kilometers of land behind the dam would be lost to the rising water levels people living there oftentimes for generations would lose the only homes they've known their entire lives millions of people had to be moved in an equitable fair and economical way in this video i want to talk about the challenges china's government faced in doing so but first i want to talk a little bit about the next asiometry email newsletter i'm recently starting on a new draft for um the follow-up on the video that i've done a long time ago that had pretty good number of views the tsmc briefly explained video and i think for people viewers of this channel you know i talk a little bit about this company from time to time um but for those who are interested and kind of want or kind of jumping in the middle in the middle of the stream and want to go back to the very start and just get a you know breakdown of the whole thing i'll be working on that next so start look forward to that um like i said the newsletter comes out every four days at 1 am taiwan time you can find the link in the newsletter in the video description below or just go to asiometry.com much thanks so um china has had a lot of experience resettling people for the sake of a dam the 20 years after the communist takeover saw the most dams ever built in chinese history some 7.8 million people were moved for the sake of these dams during those years the chinese government did not give much in terms of financial compensation nor did they have much so they coerced the people to give up their homes and move by telling them that it was for the good of the nation those who were not convinced by words and political feelings well they're forced to leave anyway the government did not plan these be settlements very well fact is they hardly did any planning at all government officials did not much consider the consequences of moving all these people an example of this took place during the construction of the danjang ko reservoir on the hanjong river in 1958. in order to make way for this reservoir located in the ghanan and herpes provinces chinese government officials cleared out some 100 000 people and i mean cleared out in the most literal way they did not bother figuring out where those people would go no farming land housing or land residential land was allotted for them what happened was that they made an announcement and gave a bag of r b to the people to be displaced a seriously small bag like in some cases as little has 50 rmb per head like as if they were homeless at a silicon valley encampment what happened next should not surprise anyone 66 000 of the displaced refugees tried to come back the resulting social and economic costs were great peasants sold the clothes on their back trying to get transportation back home a home that no longer existed because it was underwater fights broke out between migrants cutting down firewood for their homes and senior party members had to be brought in to resolve the issues has china emerged from the chaos of the cultural revolution it became clear that it could no longer treat people in this way anymore the state council raised the amount of money given to the people for resettlement new resources would be dedicated for future efforts where beforehand almost everything was budgeted for construction alone the three gorgeous dam resettlement would thus present the government's greatest resettlement challenge yet the three gorgeous dam would be the biggest dam china has ever attempted per survey made in 1992 1.3 to 1.6 million people would need to be eventually be relocated out of the way of the rising waters the three gorgeous dams reservoir would inundate 4 000 villages 140 towns 13 cities and 100 000 acres of farmland the vast majority of that farmland would be garden plots and rice fields which are crucial to to farmers making a living and feeding themselves the loss of such rich and fertile lowlands to the rising waters will be especially painful worse yet 78 of the three gorges area is mountainous finding enough farmable land there had been an issue even before the dam's arrival the land higher up on the slopes is steep and rocky with thin soils not to mention the higher altitude weather would be unsuitable for certain fruits or vegetables there remains some forested land in the three gorges area but drew wrong the chinese premier at the time declined to open it up to resettlement the problem being that cutting down those trees would compound the area's already bad soil erosion issues and i talked a little bit about that in a previous video village residents were understandably upset about having to relocate in this way they would repeatedly ask government officials how can we earn a living on the slopes worse yet as more migrants needed to be relocated the uphill lands got more crowded which raised the risk for landslides per survey at the time just eight percent of the migrants were confident that their economic and social situation would improve after the dam's completion 47 percent of the migrants who answered felt strongly against the relocation forty-five percent of the total surveyed population refused to answer the question at all obviously conscious of the repercussions government officials rethought the plan of simply rebooting agricultural migrants up the slopes they had to really not only because the original relocation plan was unpopular but also they were literally running out of new high slope areas to put the migrants on each marginal migrant had less and less land to resettle on so they launched a new plan to move one hundred and twenty five thousand rural migrants to the chongqing city and herbei province areas these migrants would be uprooted from their homes and sent to new distant lands these new lands would be a mix of rural and urban the government told the three gorgeous migrants that this would be a way to improve themselves economically new job opportunities in the city the migrants again had big issues with this distant urban relocation plan families don't want to be torn out of their communities farmers don't want to have to farm in conditions they aren't familiar with and unlike your traditional rural urban migrant they can come back home a survey of over 250 families found that 64 preferred to be resettled higher up on the slopes so it was a decision between bad and worse they picked the bad furthermore the central government imposed this new situation onto its local governments many local governments were already struggling with unemployment issues at the time and now they have to deal with thousands of new people coming in from another province looking for jobs and competing with the natives for example there were plans to move 180 factories and 67 000 workers to chongqing city but chongqing's economy at the time was over capacity they had a hundred and eight thousand five hundred unemployed of their own and other they couldn't handle the the new surge other provinces asked take migrants or hainan xinjiang and inner mongolia none of these that i would call thriving metro areas now let's talk a little bit about corruption the government initially budgeted 11.76 billion dollars aside for the resettlement project but that estimate quickly ballooned to a staggering 26 billion as the work got harder and more people needed to be relocated and certain leakages started to happen the budget of money is meant to compensate for lost land as well as pay for the new infrastructure and moving costs how much would actually end up in the hands of the people is not certain the central government decentralized resettlement as efforts empowering local officials to achieve their goals the way they see fit this gave officials flexibility to carry out their work without the government looming over their shoulder but at the same time opened up opportunities for corruption wherever lots of money are involved with little oversight and planning there is the risk for corruption and multiple reports emerged of corruption involving local resettlement officials for example in 1999 china's own national audit office discovered that some 232 million rmb which is 31 million usd have been embezzled by local resettlement officers they were discovered inflating claims taking kickbacks from unqualified construction companies and delivering shoddy work the corruption case was discovered through the petitions of peasants in the local union county one of the many to be inundated the scmp mentioned more such claims from over 10 000 resettled peasants complaining of bait and switch tactics where they were promised the good life only to show up to see nothing they would be promised fair compensation for their land in amounts of 5000 us which is not a lot if you think about it but in the end got just 700 in 2005 349 people were convicted of misusing resettlement funds totaling 7.1 million dollars of that 5.2 million was eventually recovered in 2007 the audit office announced 36 million usd missing from 1.3 billion of resettlement funds allocated for the hubei chongqing locations to be honest 36 million out of 1.3 billion doesn't feel like a big percentage and this data is self-reported by the government third-party watchdogs implied that much more money was lost to corruption some measurements found that nearly half of the construction companies chosen to build the new infrastructure for the dam's resettlement homes and locales were done in improper ways and awarded to shoddy builders half it is needless to say that mega dam construction is an immensely painful and complicated task to deal with the three gorgeous dam is an amazing achievement that only a powerful national government could have pulled off and has likely saved many human lives but it would be an error to say that it didn't cause some human suffering in of itself the three gorgeous area was a densely populated location it was full of people practicing agriculture for generations poorly educated they lived off the land and could not do much else that was not their fault when that land was taken away from them they had nothing left the government made the three gorgeous resettlement happen through sheer force of will people were moved out like as during the old days using force protesters and petitioners were jailed it caused trouble not only for these new migrants but also the various local governments around the country and their own people trying to host them as the government ramps up the exporting of its infrastructure expertise which includes dams it's debatable whether or not other countries are capable of exercising the same amount of force and the same type another infamous mega dam hints that they are not all right everyone take care of yourselves crazy world out there see you guys later
