ladies and gentlemen there is an ancient proverb about the game of chess and it says chess is a sea so vast that in it a gnat May drink and an elephant May bathe and that's exactly how I feel about the garbage games that some of you extremely Brave volunteers send in to me make no mistake both I and players even stronger than myself play absolutely catastrophic games of Chess but sometimes y'all submit these games to me that are just so bad that I think they're fake and sometimes I've caught a few Liars people have sent me games that they played against their friends they're definitely not real games I look for games with a crescendo of action a back and forth like a movie you never know what's coming when's the villain gonna be defeated well in today's video I will be sharing with you a game that I actually dug up from no less than eight months ago this was sent to me in July 2022 by a subscriber named Nevin and this game was spectacular buckle up throw you throw me up on your smart TV or refrigerator or microwave or wherever you can broadcast chess nowadays and let's go let's get rolling Nevin is with the white pieces from Serbia Enzo is with the black pieces from I believe that's Argentina and Enzo apparently is 106 years old because as you know any number that you put in your username means your age so you can put 10 000 and that is now how old you are uh this game begins in a very normal way no it doesn't E4 you know recently I had a game that went four nights it was just like this like this was and that was a 200 ELO game of chess uh but uh black plays Knight F6 so Enzo plays Knight F6 right away now the move Knight F6 is only okay if you're actually playing the ayokin's defense which after E5 black goes here and then tries to attack the center like this and is kind of okay jumping around a lot but based on the next few moves I am willing to bet black has absolutely no idea how to play the ayokin's defense and just played an incorrect first move uh I think black is trying to play a pierce defense with D6 and G6 and that's very clear to me because black does this now if you can attack an opponent's Knight and either force it to go back to its home square or out to the edge of the board it's probably a good move now there is an opening called uh the North Sea defense or the rat and it goes like this and then the Knight goes to G7 and Magnus Carlson has played this before no I'm not just calling Magnus Carlson a rat uh he has played this opening before um but this is not the same thing it's not the same thing because white actually hasn't played D4 yet it's close I guess it could transpose but white goes F4 now black plays D6 so black is playing trying to play king's Indian period setup the whole time so just start with D6 but I got news for you it very quickly goes from bad to worse I mean white is playing great I love what white is doing I think white you know being my subscriber must be a Vienna practitioner uh but again I also implore you folks just because you play the Vienna Gambit against these two moves and F4 that does not mean you can play E4 F4 Knight C3 against literally everything you just can't do that I know you're not gonna listen to me all right but I'm gonna keep telling you just like your parents if you don't do this you're not gonna do well in school you don't do well in school you won't go do good college you won't get a good job you know blah blah blah blah it's a snowball effect so um yeah okay D6 Knight F3 and now of course black should just play Bishop G7 and castle and we have a very combative and interesting game instead of that Enzo plays Bishop H6 now moving the bishop out that far is basically never good it's good like one time in 50. uh if even that I mean the bishop belongs on G7 why because here it's just much more susceptible to being traded not to mention to being attacked the bishop needs to be there why is it a problem if the bishop is traded well if the bishop is traded why'd you make all these weaknesses I mean you it's like breaking holes in the wall of your house and not putting windows in it's just a big draft in mosquitoes God mosquitoes are awful so now black has to go Bishop G7 which just doesn't I mean you know their 900s because at least by some miracle of God they saw that the Bishops see each other which if they were even 300 points lower rated black would have played here and white would have gone here and this game would have ended in 10 moves and we never would have gotten a YouTube video out of it so uh black goes here but why is black going there when black coaches went to went there we go and we're wasting time we got to our desired position but we got there with three wheels instead of four one fell off while we were on the highway uh now white takes on G6 now what I don't like about this position this move I understand the appeal of because you're looking to trade what I am now going to caution you with is you need to finish your development you are not castled you are not in a position to attack anybody because you're not castled all right so you've got to play something like Bishop to E2 and at least get your king to safety or in the game Bishop E3 Queen D2 and get your king to safety do something like this just get the king out of the way and then you can start you know throwing bombs Bishop E3 computer says black is better because apparently black can go Knight G4 they're 900 they don't know that A6 all right now of course finish the development this is a terrible move Knight D5 is is just not it's just not good this is not a good move first of all what does that mean like in chess there is a conceptual reason to move is bad and a concrete reason that it moves bad that move is bad because black concretely because black can just take and then black can just win a pawn and Black's just gonna be a pawn up now conceptually what's wrong with the move Knight D5 you cannot explain what it does number one you just don't have like you cannot explain what it does can't explain uh maybe white could if I got him on here on a zoom call which I don't plan to do uh but uh that's number one number two you're breaking the principles of Chess your King's in the center what are you doing why are you going to battle with the Knight and uh and then like not you know not night [Music] you're losing one of your only pieces that's out and you're not getting anything good in return there are winners and losers in trades all the time all right so uh but black goes C6 all right black doesn't even see that and now white is actually winning there's an incredible move here which uh if you are a good subscriber of mine you'll find white did not find it white is not a good subscriber of mine the point is that the Knight is hanging so of course white did this but danger levels every time a pawn moves you gotta think oh that pawn moved right and now you're like oh it's attacking my knight I'm just gonna take easy but that's not like I am or I am urging you to do better than that because that weakens that and danger levels and now anywhere the queen moves the next move is Knight C7 and The Rook is just completely trapped completely trapped black has to go here losing The Rook for the night the engine here is so disgusting it says don't even take but just take just take the rook and come back and be up in exchange I don't care if the computer says it's not the best way to play all right you did a great job all right um so Knight takes F6 Bishop F6 and of course even though the trade happens this way white still finds a way to blunder the pawn terrific uh again this is obviously not good please don't play chess like this anytime a piece stands on the Square you gotta think what can they do to me you're only thinking for yourself you're not thinking what can they do to me you're not thinking the other way around there's a person on the other side the board trying to beat you right Queen D2 think about getting in a fight with a person on the street I don't recommend doing this I've never had this except when I was like 11 years old I fought this little I fought a kid I was also little we fought each other on the street it was uh hilarious I got punched he got wrestled down so according to the UFC judges I won the fight anyway uh uh and and like imagine you're in a fight with the other person that you're just swinging like you're gonna call the cops on you send you to a psychiatric ward uh this is not right this is not good and it very quickly goes from bad to worst now here I think basically my subscriber decided all right look I could play the natural move which is rugby one or I could try to make it into a Gotham video and do something brilliant so I'm gonna go Bishop D4 I I okay I am hoping to the gods that that my Subs saw that The Rook could get taken but I think his idea was that now this is open it's actually a very creative idea and the point is that let's say something like this and you know you got mate coming now of course my subscriber missed this move after which he's completely lost uh that move completely blocks the bishop which means there is no attack and you are just down a big amount of material you can still try to play moves like D4 which is exactly what he did now here the move Pawn takes D4 would be a horrible mistake all right not all trades are equal it's not one for one there's May coming you try to stop one mate you might get mated in the corner all right this is like a very common oversight so I love here Enzo despite being 106 years of age plays Bishop G4 keeps the tension I love that now of course computer always has some argument Bishop G4 um now we have Pawn takes we have Pawn takes and um this move loses on the spot but it's very hard to see why uh you're much more likely to see this uh and uh yeah the the reason is and this is why you always look for checks literally in this position is exactly why you always look for checks always look for checks because they might win you the game in this position white has two checks one of them loses the queen but the other one is unblockable because you'll take with the bishop and if the King goes here you go here and black skin can no longer run he has to block with the Rook you win the queen you win everything so a check might even accidentally win you the game I don't mean that you have to play a check if it's there but you have to see the check because you never know anyway of course that doesn't happen if it happened this wouldn't have been a video Queen H6 and now black starts firing away on the other side of the board and is completely lost again okay so we're getting there right Bishop C4 is plus 13 now it's minus four now it's you know plus a million again um excuse me I'm getting a phone call uh got some food outside hello yeah just leave it at the door please thank you there you go I've never done that before first time for everything you just witnessed history a food delivery call on this channel that's my coffee by the way I got a little coffee little breakfast I'm exhausted I'm recording this game no coffee this is my coffee oh God this is also my therapy so Queen B6 coming down to B1 Bishop C4 could win you the game by accident again uh but again remember how like seven moves ago or whatever uh after Bishop A1 Bishop A1 I told you white just only like thinks about G7 right so everything that white is doing now is about the G7 Square to White no other squares exist just G7 now we have Queen A5 check and finally if white just blocks the check white wins because this is coming and queen G7 and uh that's it I mean game is over but then this would not be a YouTube video instead of that we have Knight to D2 tragically removing the guard of the bishop and now it's over now it's over because white has absolutely no attack there is no mate you can check me now admittedly if I go here I blunder Mateen one which you never know always look for checks but the bishop would just come back to E6 so white plays H3 and uh the game is over like wins black wins the game because even though the bishop is hanging black finds that they can check the white King by going oh [Music] okay game on dudes and dudettes let's go Queen G3 that was made in one that was that was game over right there boom and it was closer too but I guess humans are inclined to you know go to the right check that also looks like mate by the way but by the miracle of the chess Gods the it's Mate A King has no moves but the Knight blocks check King D2 now this whole video is in reference to the white king I would like you to know pay attention to the journey of the white king D2 Rook F2 King D3 Queen takes is a check Queen D1 is a check Queen B5 is a check okay Runs Out to the center don't go here that hangs a rook Pawn check Queen check Queen check and don't hang your queen nice oh my God oh my God E1 dancing around the back Rank and now we are going up Queen C5 is made in one and you just made that move so this is right there but you can also get your knight in the game and you also have this queen check and you also have this queen check and that Queen check oh oh we don't find it he doesn't find it now the only legal move is here King to D6 the only legal move King D6 incredible and Rook F6 is a check Pawn to C5 is a check Rook to D2 is even a check and even if you lose it I think you have a mate somewhere on C5 and that's exactly what happens Rook D2 black blunders The Rook all right Queen takes D2 is right there and I I don't think black did that on purpose but the bishop blocks and now King keeps going the King has now traversed the entire board he has climbed to the tallest room of the tallest tower he has scaled the mountain and he now suffers his fate by trial by tribulation it is Checkmate multiple ways if the queen slides over by accident to one of these two squares the bishop guards the Knight the queen will be guarded on either Square the game is over and black delivers the Fatal blow with Queen V8 okay only legal move into D6 now what's funny is you can actually repeat moves here and do it again you can try one more time oh that wasn't made all right let me do that one more time but black plays this okay that's fine there is still an m on the evaluation scale but suddenly King takes C5 folks those of you who are keenly observing and are not just putting me on in the background because you think I'm funny and good filler and watching my videos is a part of your day I do sincerely thank you very much you are what they call lurkers on Twitch you just sort of hang out you don't have to write anything you don't beg the streamer the Creator for the attention you might not always interact but you're always there listening in the background and enjoying yourselves I do appreciate you very much because if you think about the math of YouTube the video has a million views it has something like 30 000 likes that's a massive chunk removed from a million views and there might only be like a thousand comments we get really good engagement on my videos a lot of you comment talk about my snare other things but think about that that is a tiny fraction 99 of viewers don't complain they just enjoy the show I thank you sincerely for being part of that 99 second society and economics and whatnot right anyway King takes C5 and the king is running back I think those of you who are keenly observing the screen are about to pick up on something the white king ran they Ran So Far Away I just ran don't copyright strike me I'm not singing uh flock of seagull so I'm not using that song it's over even if the King has made it all the way back the game is over King is back on C1 this move is winning even this move sacrificing a rook is winning because the attack is so strong all right but can we just get an instant replay of that the white king went from E1 to D2 to D3 to D4 to E5 to D6 to E7 to D6 to C5 to B4 to B3 to B2 to C1 I mean are you kidding me this dude did the cardio for the whole team unbelievable stuff and he is still losing despite that entire cardio Journey he's still losing because he's got an overzealous Queen and he's got a rook cause with sleeping his bunker he's not actually up to help the king Bishop C2 we need three I think you might have just seen the eval shoot up that's because after sacrificing The Rook on the C2 Square black needed to just be patient for a moment and then regroup and finish off the attack but the problem is black spent the entire game hunting the king and by this point in the game black had no time see black was so bewildered by the king run strategy that black malfunctioned black went on to lose the Rook the queen and then the Rook again in three moves black lost 5 14 19 points of material and then another three and then lost the game Queen d8 check it's not checkmate black resigned because black could not believe what the heck did they just witnessed [Applause] once again in this game there was checkmate in one there was checkmate in many many many many many sets of two and three there was Checkmate in one there was Checkmate in two and three there was Maiden one and the white king walked forward and marched all the way back and then white regrouped won all of the black pieces and then won the game you know what the lesson is here the lesson in this game is that when you are chasing down a king don't just attack the king attack the squares that it's trying to go to because as I keep telling all of you in chess there are two players there might be three if your opponent is cheating but in chess there are two players and your opponent is looking to escape via certain squares and if you don't cover those squares while attacking their King you are a selfish player so be better you will gain as much Hilo as the chess gods demand a view that made no sense get out of here
