[Music] so when her friends over a pug do mobile reached out and wanted to sponsor a video to celebrate the second anniversary they told us to think big less we have a project oh boy well so for playing the game on the phone can we take advantage of USB C's capabilities go out to HDMI to like a TV or so yeah a TV a display and build some experience around that well actually if we're gonna be putting a TV in a crate you were pretty much halfway to an arcade cabinet at that point so fill me in a little bit on pub G even though I'm obviously a very avid gamer remind me a bit of sort of the general aesthetics of pub G mobile so think like brown rolling hills with like some kind of brown buildings sort of around so one of the main things in the game is when either you kill someone or when something drops from the sky there's like sort of smoke so you could be like a kind of a mile away if you see smoke generally speaking you want to run toward that because there's going to be something there like okay weapons armor grenades whatever the case is all right look let me start sketching something out here so if this is a side view of sort of your standard arcade cabinet how wait how do I get do you think we can build an arcade cabinet in just a few days I think we should do is we should look for one of those prefabricated kits that they sell their fully bore loans if I can go down to Micro Center today I know that they sell a kit and if I can go down today and snag that that'll save us a ton of time around thinking about the concept though if this is oh boy I know how to spell side yeah so smoke you said is sort of a big element of this game right yeah yeah so what if we took some of this empty space up here that would normally be reserved for speakers okay we could actually probably stick a fog machine up here sort of angled down like this I've seen smoke for some reason but obviously fog is such a better yeah yeah let's uh I'd rather not actually light it on fire but you know if the project goes wrong yeah screw it go down in flames well actually you said it has kind of like a whole military sort of feel camouflage yeah well actually I feel like I've seen these big blankets that look like a ghillie super they're like a full blanket but if we just take a ghillie blanket and we sort of drape it all the way around the thing and then we cut out the notches here they sort of the cabinet really at all this looks really cool if we can get all the part can we do that like this seems like this is it's gonna take a while okay so this is starting to shape up so what all have we missed the last 24 hours you've missed me getting covered in black paint before we actually cover the whole thing in like that ghillie suit material we're gonna be putting on some piping and ducting for the fog to come out and just generally looking steampunky and cool you gotta train the background that that sounds very authentic I actually really like trains I've ever told you about that you tell me about trains Wes my 26th birthday is we're gonna be putting some of these all around but if we have the fog machine up top I'm thinking we'll put a tee in the back but then we'll continue the piping over to the sides and I thought maybe we could extend a couple dumps out just have a little extra flowing out and put some flicker bulbs in there to make that sort of fire smoky effect but the other big challenge with this is you may notice that this is a hole yeah and there's there's no hole here so how do you how do you think you'd go about cope up making that hole I got it yeah there you go yeah you're the strong one here so wow that sounds great yeah it's really dangerous so you drill the pilot hole and then this thing just starts boring in wait what's this oh so I stepped on I ordered a custom marquee for the top you know black tape is black on one side but you often forget it's white on the other but that's okay this is just sort of a proof of concept and what's really cool do you want to preview with a ghillie suit oh yeah affection eye ghillie suit it's a ghillie blanket so this is a five foot by nine foot mossy forest ghillie blanket that we're gonna cover the entire thing with we just sort of do a little something like this oh yeah you can start to see the general idea of what's going on here I mean obviously work in progress but I feel like having the marquee really sort of sells it as an arcade cabin especially want you light this out I think this just covers like we don't have to deal with anything inside like this is like this is the best sheet everything [Music] can we feel that how I feel [Music] it's so bad Oh Wes what have you done oh my god it's so good look at the way that the smoke is coming down our customer keys all lit up yeah yeah and the flickering does so much to add to it yeah right so the chiller inside is now loaded with a full four pounds of ice and you can see it's really making a nice cascade enos we have lights piping into each of the ducts on the side food the last bit I added at the very last moment is a little bit of rust even if you want to take a peek there oh my god we've got a little special right door one cable and we're ready to play some poker mobile [Music] [Applause] [Music] dude this is such a cool experience I'm just sitting here also it's nice because the fog is like very cool I've got like some like air-conditioning action so I'm bright now I'm playing on a one plus eight pro and I'm there's literally it's as if there's no latency at all like as soon as I move on the screen the the arcade cabinet is just immediately showing up it adds so much to the ambiance to hear the far machine churning as I'm playing the game there we go this is a real arcade game I would dump so many quarters I do it I would just be sitting here playing all day huh whoa wait for me wait for me if somehow you've never heard of poke gee mobile it is one of the most popular games in the world with over 700 million downloads it's of course a free-to-play mobile game where you and your friends can parachute in on a 100 player battle royale it's exactly who will be victorious and
