all right so I saw this thing right here people were losing their damn Minds over apparently iterm and AI are now combined so I haven't read anything about this I just saw people losing losing it all on the internet so it's a thousand one words it's a palindrome it's worth the read right so iterm 2 is the most popular ter terminal emulator on for Mac OS machines so already I don't even have a problem because I don't even have a Mac OS so think about that I've used it for years and I've gotten it uh and it has gotten out of my way it's great software recently an update was released that among other things included new AI integration AI add AI powered natural language command generation enter a prompt in the composer and select edit engage artificial intelligence Engage The E AI uh and you'll need to provide an open AI key and uh since GPT costs money to use a new AI feature in the tool belt uh code s I'm not sure how to say that term uh lets you set uh a goal and then walks you step by step to completing it by watching the terminal contents it requires you to supply an open AI key I don't understand this feature like I think I see where this is going like generally I'm just going to throw this out there if I can avoid learning uh FFM Peg and that every now and then I need to convert one video to a different video format just that like that one time or combine a bunch of jpegs into a into an image or into a video if I only have to do that you know once every 10 months I am fine o I always just look it up I just look it up every single time so like for me the engage artificial intelligence would be very awesome code conier oh code conier yeah but it's not it's coder right it's not code conier anyways so like I like that idea I like the idea so Part of Me loves the idea of command line tool execution by AI like I I do love that idea but part of me you know gosh this must be the trog in me or the Lite in me or whatever the hell you want to call it in me where I can't help but to think there's some set of tools that you want to be able to just use yourself such as JQ JQ is a perfect example of people who would probably really really like to have JQ just be used by Ai and you just kind of explain what it does and then be able to have it just just run and do the JQ but the fact that I had to use JQ for like a month or two months uh and and and really focus on how to use it super well I gained so many skills and I could do so many cool things parsing huge sets of data from [ __ ] through JQ into other queries and all that that it would be so hard for me to want to actually give that up to an AI and I could foresee that if you had an AI at your side again it's like phone numbers you quit learning phone numbers once you had a cell phone right like who how much of us just knew exactly like so many people's phone number and then you got a cell phone and then you never learned a phone number again like would you actually hamper yourself would you just sit there and just be constantly asking you know keep on asking over and over again trying to coers the AI into doing what you want and all of a sudden the thing that sped you up in the simple case slows you down in the long case that's my worry the simple case is it's just like I don't care that's why I call the FFM Peg case cu the FFM pay case is just like give me the answer cuz I don't ever want to look up FFM Peg or learn it because I will never use it more than once every 10 months the once every 10 months case it feels like engage artificial intelligence is a great Comm absolutely love it uh the difference is uh phone numbers aren't important to know by heart well some phone numbers are some phone numbers you should always learn by heart like I have my mom's phone number memorized forever 555 5555 55555 right it's very very easy to remember my mom's phone number or I have my wife's phone number memorized right do I need to know all phone numbers no I don't but do I know my wife's yeah absolutely I have your mom's number memorized too damn damn and so it's just like there's some tools that you want to learn and not engage Ai and there's some tools that I think make natural perfect sense I see the I dude I I swear people are going to just think I'm aite all the time it's just that's my only worry about AI is that you you just act you just you pigeon hole yourself into in uh inability here's what the feature looks like okay cool let's watch this bad boy convert uh input move to oh my goodness look FFM Peg oh my goodness it's FFM Peg look at it go like that's exactly this is exactly by the way you got to learn how to type faster man this typing is so slow uh this is like exactly the reason why I want it like this is precisely it to a te this is the exact this is it pre-at feels weird man thinking thinking yeah they FFM Bank dude FFM Bank oh thank you pre-at let's go FFM B dude of course it's a pain in the ass that's so funny it's a text box that you can enter a description of the command and then generate the command for you it's a lot like the former GitHub co-pilot for CLI wait the former uh but built into your terminal just a command e away uh and you also get the following models okay cool uh I wasn't able to get GPT uh 40 to work but GPT 3.5 turbo worked fine I'm not totally uh wowed by the feature uh but it it is a thing that exists and I'll probably use it once or twice mainly when I'm dealing with FFM commands let's [ __ ] go I love I love the fact that FFM Peg is some sort of Universal painful tool it's just so funny that you can you can just be like you know there's one there's one tool I'd use this for FFM Peg and then somebody writes an article you read the article and they they too have FFM Peg there's only a few people that really actually know FFM Peg and the rest is just it's it you know it's it's like that old meme on the internet with stack Overflow where there's like that one dude on stack Overflow answering every question with rexes and actually knows how to use Rex's and then there's everybody else that just copies and pastes Rex's into their code base this is the same thing the there's one person that knows how to use FFM Peg and everybody else just copy and paste it into their terminal and I I cannot wait for the amount of Havoc by the way that this is going to this is going to cause CU if you don't even know how to uh do command line like especially a bunch of pipings you're going to end up piping some sort of file removal and you're going to hate your life one of the main bits of feedback I've seen from people online is that ierm 2 having AI involved at all is enough to get them to want to switch away to another terminal emulator for me this isn't really a big deal right because you have to provide your own open API key so what what the hell is the problem with that like right you don't like these things aren't on by default it'd be way too expensive for any company to have that so it's like is there really a problem for it to have that I don't see why this would be a problem um it's okay I can always get get up co-pilot to explain my shell command oh shoot you have you have Chad gity to generate you the command in which you pipe to co-pilot to look at the command man that's a sad State of Affairs they cited the reason as exhaustion due to over exposure to AI hype this is actually I mean I'm feeling this too like AI in everything do we need AI in Everything is Everything AI pilled like do we have to have this it feels like no matter what you're doing it's ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai and I think VCS are to blame you know why CU I think VC's specifically Tech VCS are the worst form of this because they are just technical enough well who said this um I want to say it was John Lennox like he effectively says that Bachelors of Science are the worst of people because they have just enough science to like think they know everything but they know literally nothing and so they're just like we're the smartest we know right you you see this all the time like there're the people that are just so dang full of their own you know full of their own [ __ ] but they actually don't know anything but they have the illusion of knowing stuff and so it's like there's this curve that exists that people that don't know anything it's it's literally the midwit curve right the midwit curve is The Bachelor of Science curve you have just enough science in you to think you know stuff but you actually don't know anything whereas the dumb person and the smart person are both like yeah it's actually really complicated out there it's like really crazy and so I feel like the VCS are the the VCS are the midwit curve they have just enough science and just enough programming to understand like Tech talk but they don't actually have enough to really know why things are good or bad and they just completely midwit these things and just like AI pill everything because there's they it's going to solve the universe and so they just like just dive into it um I got one more thing thing to say I'm going to say something about Investments okay here we go we're going to do this are you ready for this hey are you ready for this I have a new running Theory are you guys ready for my new running Theory and this is going to piss off a lot of people I think if I were a VC and you tell me that you do not need unit testing your code I think you are building a product that is so sufficiently simple that you may be first to Market but it is so so easily replicable it's not worth investing in I've been thinking about it all morning okay I've been thinking about that all morning I've been get I don't know how to formulate that into a tweet but I realize something that when people say they don't need unit test they're building sufficiently easy software to replicate and it's not it's not Uncle Bob style right like I I'm not saying unit test everything but like the the Doom thing that we've been making this this little Doom this little Doom pixel stuff like it is literally impossible for me to be able to make this without a without a decent amount of unit testing cuz it's like impossibly hard and so like imagine if there there was this there was actually a market for making asy engine games and I had a service that could compress all your stuff send it down efficiently and make it live playable across a bunch of stuff then yeah it's like my like the fact that I have a bunch of unit tests that are actually testing complex stuff is a good sign that I'm actually building something that is sufficiently complex enough that someone else can't just simply be like oh you're just wrapping a few apis and calling it a product it's not a product it's just a rapper okay dude lithium lith lithium said it imagine doing the exor stuff and not testing it I know exactly anyways just throwing that out there that's my personal thought is that if you don't even have unit test I am now convinced that uh your your company's too easily replicatable that effectively what that means is that you aggregate Services you don't actually do something couldn't you be a VC if you want the criteria for becoming a qualified investors aren't that crazy I could become one quote unquote but I it requires so much time and thought and effort like if I were to really try to do it I'd really want to be involved AI is the current meme among investors in techspace Microsoft putting AI button on your keyboard slack is training AI on your messages of course they are you ever you know isn't that crazy that you pay a monthly fee for slack and you are probably also getting uh you're probably also getting data collected this is I mean again I think dhh is right people want to return to like owning their own [ __ ] cuz this is this is absurd this kind of stuff uh open AI is in hot water with Scarlett Johansson that's right if you guys haven't seen this this is wild she was just like yo open AI you're not allowed to use my voice and then open AI is like nah we're going to use it anyways he literally tweeted her and within two days her sued him like how great dude he got heard right like dude oh my goodness it's so funny it is so dang funny dude Chad move and own um anyways uh let's see uh it's everywhere it's exhausting part of my job requires me to keep up with the latest advances in Ai and I'm unable to everything happens so much yeah it's the thing is is there's no advances okay there's been no advances in the last eight months in AI GPT 4.40 Omni or omen or or Omega or whatever the hell it is it's it's not an advancement it's it's it's just slightly faster GPT 4 and sometimes it's not even as accurate like there's not anything to it it feels like a uh and apple we just want to make you buy more adapters release they're not like it's it's there's nothing that amazing about it right it there has not been any real progression in the last little bit the hard part also is we went from nothing to llms everywhere and llms I still remember my first experience with an M which was programmed this was uh this was co-pilot and I programmed in a uh a a flip the coin gamer or a guess a number game and I had it so if player one is closer than player two they win else if player two is closer than player one player two wins else and then it printed out it's a tie and I remember thinking holy cow that was incredible and it was it was really incredible like that was such an incred incredible experience to be a part of to see this like this autocomplete complete semantically for me what I was trying to do absolutely they just I'm still Blown Away to this day by it uh I I'm not somebody who just thinks it's it's just stupid technology I actually think it's really really cool but there hasn't been really great advancements with it since then it's still is largely inaccurate you still can't really r on it you can't replace your knowledge with it it's not a knowledge replacer it is a you can only use it to advance you should never use it to replace and once you use it to replace you will start using it it will solve your simple problem and the moment you have a complex problem you're in a complex problem without the beginner knowledge needed to get to that complex problem and I feel like you're double screwed at that point because then you are up a river without a paddle and without the skills to be able to wade into that River itself whereas like if you started from the beginning you had to Google and learn your way to get to that point of complexity now you don't even get that it's wild anyways the type command for me feature has caused a lot of Buzz online to the point where people I know are just Flatout ripping out iterm 2 in favor of programs that don't have ai integration in them this is way crazy overreaction you know you would think that people who program would be a bit more logical they're not logical hell even uh the mention that tool is going to get AI integration as people uh preemptively ripping it out of their systems because of that uh opacity a terminal emulator is probably also a fairly bad place to implement this because it's probably one of the most privileged programs on a developer machine this is a good point careful uh it deals with all the secrets in the world and the threat that it could be used to upload them all to a third party is great enough that people are willing to switch okay so this is actually a really fair statement if it uploads things that you have no control over or you or the surface itself is opeg would make it feel very scary and I actually agree with that I actually fully agree with this this this last statement it is a very privileged program and I can see why it's uh why it's terrifying uh let's see uh oi I don't get it it's a very optional feature that you have to go out of your way to enable Supply your own API key enable something that is not enabled by default why are people reacting so strongly to this edit an earlier version of this post assumed that I turn 2 was closed Source it is not I apologize for the error here is the amended version of the paragraph a lot of this boils down to having this shoved down their throats in fact uh it's the fact that they're being added to a tool without the user having an agency to decide if they want want it to be added or not that being said here's a commit that added the AI feature in question it's apparently been development at some level for 2 years or so I guess it predates most of the AI hype it's been going on nothing like anime girls and and furries telling you all about this this is absolutely fantastic uh I get why people wouldn't want this in their lives I really do I think it's one of the greatest errors that was made uh uh that was made with putting this in iterm to was making a big show of it and by not letting you use local models local models would have been cool instead of having open AI be the only option yeah but I mean it's so hard I mean I get why anyone that's done any sort of programming having a plurality of models and stuff like that of having a plurality of any service options becomes a super difficult I mean just look at nun LS or null LS trying to even have a bunch of formatters and linters in a tool is hard enough it's just difficult uh it would be really cool if it was distributed with an optional add-on with their python API as an example of how to extend it turn to an arbitrary waste this would obviously be the best is having a thirdparty extension or having a first-party extension that you can add that would uh that would allow AI to jump in this would honestly be the best this would be the best and then no one can be upset uh okay this is pretty cool it's pretty cool that uh I mean I'm not going to lie to you I think this is a pretty cool feature in in just like it's in theory like I love the idea of just FFM Peg absolutely love it um huge amount of dangers with AI though the security the security Vector of AI is not only large it's completely unknown we don't even know what we don't know about security implications yet I'm pretty sure we have low-level learning in here or was in here I bet you he might pipe up and say yeah that's probably about right which is it's just it's just such an unknown territory right now and I just don't see why anybody why anybody would want to take some of those risks currently llm is a security nightmare it is because you don't like like we just don't even know we don't even know yet okay look the uh author of ierm 2 has responded hi I'm the author and I wanted to comment on this uh optin uh AI features are entirely often if you have any ethical consideration regarding the use of AI you don't need to enable these features don't provide an API key and the AI functionalities will remain inactive I don't have VC funding and I'm definitely not footing the bill for you okay good concerns the issues with copyright in the context of AI especially code generation is complicated I think the principles of GPL align more with using code for model training purposes but I'm not a lawyer okay yeah I mean this is obviously like that's that's this is a whole can of worms on itself uh let's see energy usage the energy conception required for training these models is a huge problem but that's a sunk cost the decision to use AI involves weighing uh weighing the environmental cost against the benefits it is not my place to make this trade-off for every user each individual or organization must evaluate whether the productivity gains and other advantages justify the en energy expenditure uh users are going to use llms to help them uh use a terminal emulator whether support is built in or Not by building it in the tool is more useful for these users that's fair I mean this is a very fair tradeoff the less screens you have to jump the more useful something is I think that's just a completely Fair statement llms uh make a mistake all the time but in my experience quality is good enough to be useful um yeah I mean I think this is a I think this is a pretty fair take considering how much just Onslaught this guy is experiencing on the internet right now this is a fairly mild a fairly mild manner manner to take being like hey you know it doesn't turn on by itself you have to opt into it I don't have funding I'm not going to pay for you if you are worried about it don't turn it on and people who are going to use it are going to use it anyway so why not give them a quick and and and and close experience the GPT argument well he's just saying well because people have copyright concerns I don't understand copyright so I'm just going to say nothing about copyright how is it any different than just installing co-pilot CLI it's not AI cannot even count the RS and strawberry of course it can't count the RS and strawberry it's it's because it's not precise it's close enough remember AI is like horseshoes you just have to be close enough that's it it's not it's not going to be ringing a horseshoe every time it's just going to be close enough anyways okay it's it's wild the amount of hype hey if you're if you're listening to this and you're hyped up out of your mind over this okay I just want you to know one thing don't get hyped up out of your mind over things often most most mole Hills are just mole Hills few are actually mountains um I think the copyright concerns is like a real real issue with llms and I think that copyright should be something that I I really do hope that a ton of lawsuits come out and absolutely destroy some of these companies these llm companies because I think they deserve it they've been just brain raping people regardless of their licensing and just calling it a day and so I do hope that that happens as far as o please explain horseshoes to me horseshoes is a really simple concept if you don't know what horseshoes are horseshoes is a game in which there's two poles across from each other over a distance of you know I forget how many feet right and then there's a back stop there you go this is Horseshoes and you throw a horseshoe and if it lands within one horseshoe range so in other words if you can turn this horseshoe over and touch the pole it's worth one point there's an old phrase close only counts in Horseshoes and Hand Grenades you know people be like oh I was so close that this the response is well close only counts in Horseshoes and Hand Grenades well now it close only counts in horseshoes hand grenades and llms right because you just have to be close enough okay that's that's really my take on this stuff I think that I think a lot of this stuff is is fairly hyped up and it just doesn't need to be and I I hope that what I hope the takeaway that you guys get out of this is that this is a potentially cool feature this is potentially uh very useful for avoiding FFM Peg and I think a lot of people will get some use out of it please in theend at the end of the day the tools use regularly learn them well the tools that you use once every eight months it's like a phone number I don't think you have to I honestly don't think you have to learn all of it that's it the internet is literally AI goes one of two ways it either goes in the way that grows quadratically in which we in which we uh all lose our jobs and AI does everything or B it it grows logarithmically and we fill the universe with gpus just to generate pictures of anime girls and and Cat girls that's it AI girlfriends right here we go she has creepy fingers yeah a little creepy fingers you know that's that's part of the AI is creepy fingers it's just part of it the name is it feels weird to be a middle ground AI person I feel like there's not very many Middle Ground people I feel like Middle Ground aiing is just this weird part where everybody hates you because you say a phrase like ah AI is not that great and they're like yeah bro just worried about his job being stolen and then other people are like you would use that unethical [ __ ] you're probably a bad programmer and you're just like dang man all I said was just think it's pretty neat like it's kind of Novel and it kind of makes me excited when it does pretty cool auto complete it just I don't know I I think it's it's it's mildly interesting a Jen
