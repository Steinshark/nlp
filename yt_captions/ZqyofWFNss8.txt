logan paul just launched cryptozoo his latest crypto project and i need to get you up to speed basically it's looking like what happens when you give a five-year-old some photoshop some photos match together and somehow they sell it for millions of dollars now in some ways this might actually be more embarrassing than dink doink logan's last project and that's really saying something let's just get into it ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla the internet detective now before we begin let me say first of all pump the stock it's free so getting into this video let me say some of you uh will want to judge logan paul after i tell you what i found out but i need you to cut him some slack it's not easy paying four percent taxes in puerto rico the pandemic has truly hit everyone logan's hurting and he needs the extra cash so i need you to keep that in mind while we talk about his latest project so look i'm gonna make an in-depth video on this but uh this is like a first look at cryptozoo logan paul's newest project like i said it's hot off the heels of dink doink which cratered almost immediately losing millions of dollars and losing logan as i guess their ambassador but never to let fans losses hold him down logan immediately has pivoted to his latest project being cryptozoo and i'm gonna be honest logan at this point isn't carrying a lot of water with me when it comes to crypto i like when you're the guy behind this when you're behind that your next crypto projects are going to carry a certain scammy vibe but almost immediately logan said that this time it's different this is a project he believes in that he's invested in i think there needs to be a fresh take and this project that i have uh is that fresh take we have a massive team behind it and are probably out of pocket like a million just because we believe it's gonna work wow one million dollars already invested in this project so what is cryptozoo actually about looking at their official white paper they say cryptozoo is an autonomous ecosystem where users can collect breed and trade exotic animals on the blockchain so basically it's an nft breeding game and i want to tell you right away this is not a fresh take uh tons of these exist crypto kitties axia infinity wave dunks there are millions of these so basically cryptozoo is logan paul's own spin on this idea the idea is you buy an egg it hatches into a base set you breed it trade it logan calls it a game and he insists that it will make you money it's a really fun game that makes you money now setting aside the highly sketchy fact that you're going to make money from this when in actuality the real person is going to make money is logan paul and setting aside the fact that the concept's far from unique i guess the real draw here is that someone of logan's resources should be making a very polished game right like this should be some amazing artwork so when i went to check the game out i set my preconceived notions about logan aside i said hey maybe he really tried on this one maybe he's really giving this one a fair shake so i went to check out what a million dollar game looks like i went to their instagram and to my surprise the photos of cryptozoo are basically a bunch of stock photos from adobe that have been poorly photoshopped ladies and gentlemen i mean look at this penguin plus shark penguin shark need i say more uh video over actually work video no that's it look these are adobe photoshopped stock photos ladies and gentlemen poorly photoshopped might i add like look look at their white paper meet the panda font and then you have this abomination the naming is about as original as the artwork which is not at all now to confirm these were taken from adobe i went and i hunted down this exact image and here it is cute giant panda bear climbing in a tree does it look familiar ladies and gentlemen can you see similarities here can you tell that this is the same exact image i mean look at this point logan paul is creating squidward levels of art here he's taking someone else's work slapping a nose on it and calling it art and then selling the idea for millions of dollars to his fans and look maybe you're thinking this can't be true no way the guy who created the artistic masterpiece dink doink would be so lazy as to make nfts out of stock photos i mean look at his already legendary contributions to the crypto space my beloved assistant and dick doink what's up hey get your hands off my boss's dink doink quick logan distract them with your biceps [Applause] ah yes comedy but anyways i went through a lot of these photos they released like the penguin shark and found the accompanying stock photo they basically took from they called this one the litton because it's a lion and a kitten get it but either no one noticed or no one cared because when these crypto eggs were released everyone immediately bought them within minutes and i calculated how much this netted all logan paul and it's 1.3 million dollars on ethereum alone and half a million dollars on bmb and this is before the game has even launched this man managed to convince you guys that stock photos were worth a million dollars so of course when i found all this out i did what any self-respecting person would do i posted my findings on twitter and immediately their telegram was furious asking their admin bin roth for answers so any truth to the adobe stock rumors can you confirm that the whole adobe stock fun news is fake this is important to in the adobe stock foot just didn't make an announcement about this bin roth so it's safe to say these guys were in pretty hot water with their dear investors and eventually after mounting pressure the crypto team responded these nfts are not adobe stock all of the nfts we created are specifically designed by us and our team wow okay interesting maybe i'm confused maybe i'm the one confused maybe these are just placeholder images and they aren't nfts at all in fact their own investors hopped up on opium speculated that this was maybe logan's 10 000 iq play so all images are a decoy and logan is shooting youtube video for dropping the mic on all the futters oh yeah logan's gonna drop the mic on right i get this the admins actually played into this idea maybe all the pictures are a decoy says the krypto zoo telegram team wow maybe i'm getting trolled here maybe logan's million dollar artist didn't just pull from photoshop and mash two photos together maybe i've fallen for their trap card so i kept looking at bin roth's other messages he is one of the admins after all uh and that's when i found this someone asking for an actual real in-game nft no more of these teasers and to my shock ladies and gentlemen ben roth agrees to show what drum roll please guys here it is the million dollar art that logan paul has created that's going to make all of you rich this is it guys this is uh one of their hybrids a totally original definitely not photoshopped stock photo but actually hang on this this does look a little familiar it's quick to make a digital asset with you know unique randomly generated characteristics we handmade art for the past six months bro approval very specific notes 10 different artists making art for our project oops guys call me crazy but i think that these two stock photos together kind of make this but to be sure this is really true i'm gonna try to create this art myself replicate it see how hard it really is to make million dollars art in photoshop [Music] time well what do you guys think how do you think it stacks up against the million-dollar art here would you pay 1.3 million dollars for this right here let you guys let me know in the comments below because i'm thinking of quitting my job and asking logan paul if i can have a job with him work for him as an artist now later on bin roth seems to sort of admit that these images are maybe stock photos by saying that if they were stock photos they would definitely be licensed stock photos guys they're licensed okay so you bought a license yes absolutely wow and that all but confirms it ladies and gentlemen everyone who bought these eggs or invested in zoo um you should have invested in adobe because that's what you're getting a combination of adobe stock photos and adobe photoshop and you're paying hundreds of dollars for it i mean at this point why not cut out the middleman and actually get a valuable asset i mean because what else are you getting with logan paul it's quick to make a digital asset with you know unique randomly generated characteristics we handmade art for the past six months bro approval very specific notes 10 different artists making art for our project 10 different artists making art for this project they handmade how's that handmade art looking now guys [Music] it's beautiful ah i mean uh this isn't us nft i put nft takes more time you can't just nfc willy nilly you gotta go by the book besides you got the nose wrong [Music] what a shame what a shame you're a fraud are you the same as so you're saying no you're not
