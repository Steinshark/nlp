there are six 10 000 computers completely submerged in here like no really this entire rack is filled with a solution that cools better than water dissolves in water and it's absolutely 100 safe but how can fellow canadians hypertech get away with dunking in this very expensive gear like their luke aka slick pc i'll tell you how right after i tell you about our sponsor msi msi's back-to-school sale is on now where you can save on laptops desktops and components there's also a giveaway to win some sweet prizes learn more at the link below or at the end of this video [Music] anyone who's been a fan of the channel will know that we've built several total immersion mineral oil pcs so like what's new here well this isn't mineral oil nor is it some flammable alternative this tank which is a show tank that's about half the actual length is filled with a dielectric or non-conductive mixture that's significantly lighter than most popular alternatives while also being better at conducting heat given that's pretty much its only purpose any improvement there is obviously welcome to add insult to injury the mixture is also a lot better for the environment it breaks down safely in water mineral oil by comparison is a petroleum byproduct with a laxative effect at best and is a carcinogen at worst i'm told that this mix is straight up safe to drink not that i really wanted to try it after being on the showroom floor for three days but i did end up getting some splashed into my mouth so i can tell you that it doesn't taste great that was warm also i tasted some i'm assured that it's not 3m's novak 649 as well that stuff likes to boil and is dangerous to inhale they wouldn't tell me what this stuff is exactly but it's also not a hydrofluoroethane like novak 7000 either your guess is as good as mine oh and they're making the chassis out of ocean recycled plastics by end of year as well at least that's what they hope to do but let's back up a sec server racks in data centers are already cooled by high-end air coolers and even liquid coolers so why are we even talking about this well there's a few reasons first and foremost this rack has zero fans and is basically silent by comparison it works by pumping the coolant through a loop to an exterior box that looks a bit like an hvac unit that box exchanges the thermal energy from the hot mixture to a cold water source in a single phase arrangement that means practically all of the noise it does make so the pump basically ends up well outside of the room because the installation doesn't require raised floors or bulky chiller units inside the data center it's relatively easy to retrofit into existing architecture what's more because all the heat is exchanged well outside of the rack the rack itself needs no hvac to cool it something we've struggled with in our own relatively tiny server room that means significant power savings because not only does hvac that's beefy enough to cool an entire server room or data center require a massive amount of juice so too to the high performance fans that you hear screaming inside of those racks hypertech claims a 30 to 40 percent reduction in cooling costs compared to hvac alone along with a 60 percent better hardware lifespan and to achieve that they painstakingly remove all of the fans from the hardware inside of the systems and replace their rpm sensors with sensors to monitor the temperature of the cooling solution as well as updating the bios to understand that this results in far less moving parts which are typically the most likely to fail all while retaining the original warranty thanks to their partnerships with hardware vendors like our good friends at nvidia speaking of nvidia they're part of the reason why hypertech is here to begin with with this immersion rack rumor has it that the upcoming newer generations of gpus and cpus alike are going to be designed to draw more and more power meaning that traditional cooling solutions will struggle to keep up without more exotic cooling solutions like hypertexts hypertech says that their solution can handle basically any load they can foresee up to nearly a hundred kilowatts and they can tailor the installation to meet the demand if for some insane reason that's not enough to dissipate all the heat your rack's blasting out or i guess soaking out now in a traditional data center the systems inside it generate a boatload of waste heat like effectively 100 of the electrical energy a computer consumes ends up converted to thermal energy or heat then we had to use even more electricity to get rid of said thermal energy which we call cooling now we've already told you how this takes the cooling electricity draw out of the equation but what if i told you that the heat electricity draw which there's no way around we need that for computers to work could be used for something else hypertech claims that 99 of the heat generated inside the loop can be captured as water they already have deployments that dump the heat into a building's hot water loops and in-floor radiant heating to either provide extra thermal capacity to those systems or even power them outright that works out to a significant energy savings because not only do you then not have to deal with hvac you're also not footing as big a bill for water boilers especially otherwise you'd have to upgrade a loop as your knees expand one thing you might be wondering at this point is aren't those ports submerged too and yeah i was wondering the same thing when we built our mineral oil pc we let the i o ports on the motherboard and gpu exposed but here all hardware maintenance is done with a dielectric mix already in the tank and that includes plugging and unplugging connectors i'm told that the mixture is thin enough that electrical connections can be made reliably although fiber optic cables need to be plugged into their sfp transceivers first because of how sensitive they are a thin film of dielectric is enough to prevent reliable transmission if you were to just shove it in there and speaking of shoving things in there like while you don't have to worry about dust build up as you do on traditional air cooling you're meant to work directly inside the dielectric so that means oils bacteria and yes dust particles will collect inside the loop from time to time that's where the loop itself comes in because the coolant is constantly cycling they can filter it later down the chain in the easy to access panel that makes cleaning much easier than a traditional rack where you'd have to dust them individually from time to time they told me you could theoretically drop a coffee in there and it'd be okay thanks to that filtration although i'm sure they wouldn't recommend trying it if you can help it under normal conditions they expect that the coolant will last for about 15 years this compared to the two phase coolers that are available now that use evaporation that need topping up every two years because they're actually losing the coolant and when the time comes for the solution to be recycled the solution can actually be reconstituted with a simple dialysis you don't even need to drain it and replace it on the show floor here they're trying to attract media companies with render farms that need massive gpu horsepower a full-size tank of one of these can contain 144 xeon render blades with gpus and with the stuff that nvidia has been showing off with photogrammetry and ai digital twin simulations it's becoming ever more important for some even smaller outfits that have access to that kind of compute if the tdp rumors are true of nvidia's upcoming rtx 40 series aka 8 and lovelace then achieving that will come at a significant cost to upgrade existing server racks and that's to say nothing of the environmental impact traditional setups will have not just running but cooling all of that extra hardware it's unorthodox but it might just be a crazy like a fox kind of situation that makes more sense the more you think about it maybe i can convince linus to submerge our server room so we don't have to stop filming every time the door opens and maybe i can convince you to hear about our sponsor msi msi's back-to-school sale is on now looking for a new laptop for next semester they got those or what about a desktop pc that is totally for school and not for gaming mom i swear well you're covered there too and if you're into building your own pc they even have components on sale msi is also doing a gleam giveaway where you can win sweet prizes like a full-blown gaming desktop or a msi geforce rtx 3080ti gaming x trio graphics card you can find out more about msi's back to school sale and how you can win these prizes in the link below thanks for watching guys we don't typically cover siggraph but this year we felt we almost had to for more server room shenanigans go check out our end game storage solution of 270 hard drives oh right i guess that means that it can't be submerged oh well
