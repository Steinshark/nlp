electric trucks suck at Towing that's not actually true from a capability standpoint Towing is rather effortless for plenty of electric trucks on the market but there's a pretty big asterisk here because when it comes to longdistance Towing yeah eveve struggle four years ago Tesla who has absolutely dominated the Eevee Market in the United States announced a product that had the potential to change the narrative on the story of Towing the Cyber truck and 4 years ago I explained why I didn't think it'd be successful in doing so not because I doubt Tesla's capabilities but because there are fundamental challenges when it comes to an Eevee towing a trailer long distances but today I've never felt more optimistic about this problem being solved we're actually getting very very close surprisingly though it's not the market leader that's pushing that boundary so we're going to split this up into four sections first of all car and driver has a really cool test that demonstrates what the problem is Mercedes then has a really cool test that explains why the problem exists and then we're going to look at the Tesla cyber truck as well as the Chevy Silverado EV in terms of long range Towing so let's start off looking at some of the existing options out there if you're trying to tow with an electric vehicle you've got the F-150 Lightning you've got the rivan r1t and you've got the GMC Hummer EV now all of these have a range in the low 300s pretty similar as far as their range however they have very different battery sizes so the F-150 and the r1t with the battery around 130 KW hours versus the Hummer EV about 210 kwatt hours so why is their range about the same even though they have very different battery sizes well if you look at the EPA Road load data this explains why that is the Hummer isn't very aerodynamic it weighs an incredible amount and it has Massive Tires and all of this translates into a really inefficient vehicle and so if you look at that road load data again for a rivan versus a Hummer at 80 mph the Hummer has nearly double the resistive Force at that speed meaning it takes about twice as much energy at 80 mph for the Hummer to travel down the road than it does the rivan but something really interesting happens when you start Towing so what car and driver did is they took these three trucks they hooked them up to a 6100 lb trailer and they traveled at about 70 mph on a highway Loop to see how much range these vehicles had now the results are pretty wild the F-150 only had about a third of its claimed EPA range while Towing once it was Towing it cut back that range so much and the same story really occurs for the rivan as well so both of these dipping from low 300s to now about 100 110 mil while Towing an insane drop but the Hummer didn't quite see that same drop it goes from 329 down to 140 MI and so why do we have these percentage differences where the F-150 is getting 33% of its range but the Hummer is getting 43% of its claimed range and the easy answer is well it has a larger battery right so it's able to tow farther but that doesn't explain why that percentage drop is so much different for the F-150 and the rivan versus the Hummer Mercedes however conducted a fascinating study on electric vehicle Towing that explains why this occurs so what Mercedes did is they compared the aerodynamics of an electric sedan versus an electric SUV first without a trailer attached and so what they found is that the coefficient of drag multiplied by the frontal area of the sedan turned out to be 61 M squar for the SUV that turned out to be95 M squ now you don't really need to know what these numbers exactly mean all you need to know is that what this means the difference between these two is that if both of these vehicles are traveling down the highway at the same speed the SUV is going to have about 50 % more aerodynamic Drag versus the sedan because its CDA is about 50% higher so what happens when you then attach the same trailer to both of those Vehicles so for the sedan trailer combo the CDA increased to 2.14 M squared or an additional 250% now for the SUV it increased 2.09 M squared just an additional 120 % so as you can see with the trailer the SUV despite having much worse aerodynamics than the sedan is actually more aerodynamic while traveling down the road than the sedan combined with the trailer all right so what in the world is going on here why would a vehicle that has worse aerodynamics than another vehicle suddenly have better aerodynamics once Towing so a lot of this comes down to the vehicle's wake so the SUV because it's a larger vehicle it has a large wake behind it and as a result the air flow doesn't really stack up in front of this trailer so you have a small high pressure region on the front of this trailer versus the sedan which has a small wake a lot of that air flow coming up and back down over and then ramming into the front of this trailer it creates a large high pressure region on the front of that trailer and a Mercedes study they found that that high pressure region was the largest contributing factor as to why that CDA increased so much what this demon rates is that Towing is the great equalizer maybe you created a really aerodynamic vehicle but once you start Towing you're at the mercy of that trailer as far as aerodynamic losses so you've probably heard electric car companies say things like hey anybody can use a larger battery we like to work smarter meaning creating a very efficient aerodynamic vehicle so that you don't need a massive battery now that's absolutely true when it comes to a vehicle on its own but once you start Towing it is all about the size of the battery because again Towing here is the great equalizer as demonstrated between the sedan and This SUV all right so how does this relate to the Tesla cyber truck for a pickup truck the Cyber truck is actually pretty aerodynamic but what this could mean is that you have that air flow come back and then Ram into the front of that trailer and thus create that large high pressure region reducing the aerodynamic efficiency of the overall unit so if you were to use a more traditional pickup style you may have a larger wake thus meaning while Towing you get better aerodynamics so if you were to design a vehicle that you knew was always going to be Towing you'd probably design it differently than if you were to design a vehicle that wasn't always to be Towing now obviously for most users most of the time you probably won't be Towing so that seems like the obvious choice in which to optimize for but it is worth pointing out that this is probably going to be a challenge for the Tesla because it's so aerodynamic so what is the Cyber truck's Towing range well I was trying to find a test that was similar to what car and driver did and I found one by tfl truck where they were looking at the Cyber truck on the highway at about 60 MPH with a 7,000lb trailer now they were getting an efficiency of about 900 W hours per mile and if you have 123 KW battery divide that by .9 that gives you a total Towing range of 137 Mi now if you adjust that from 60 mph to about 70 mph using the epa's road load data and doing a bit of guesstimating there it gets you in the range of 110 Mi at 70 mph so very similar to both the F-150 Lightning and the rivan r1t in terms of Towing and that you know again comes down to it has a similar battery size now Tesla has said that they're going to release a range extender for the Cyber truck which will bring its range from 340 Mi EPA rating to about 470 Mi now these ratings are generally a bit higher than what you'll actually get in the real world but regardless doing some quick math you can estimate that battery pack the additional range extender is going to add about 50 KW hours uh giving you a total of about 173 kwatt hours for the truck in other words in these range tests it'd be getting around 160 to 190 Mi now the downside here is that this range extender is actually taking up some of the bed space so you're losing a big part of the functionality of your truck so sacrificing bed space and your real world Towing still isn't an incredible number it's certainly better than what we're getting with today's options but it's still not that great all things considered the key takeaway here though is that it's all about the battery which leads us to the Chevy Silverado EV now we don't actually know the size of the Silverado E's battery pack because for some annoying reason manufacturers have decided that they no longer need to share useful information with consumers or the media now you have to to dig through EPA filings to try and figure this stuff out however there was a test another test done by tfl truck where they took a Silverado EV charged up to 100% And towed a 6,500lb trailer to see how far it could get and the result is very impressive they were able to travel 232 Mi while towing a 6,500 lb trailer and they still had 15 M of range remaining as indicated by the onboard computer they used a total of 205 Kow hours with an average efficiency of 1.1 m per kwatt hour which would give you about considering the extra battery remaining a battery size of about 218 kwatt hours now another test they conducted was on the highway to see what's this thing's range without a trailer they took it from 81% battery down to 57% battery using about a quarter of the battery and in that quarter of the battery they traveled 128. 4 mil miles so if we take 128. 4 we divide that by 0.25 that gives us a total range of over 500 Miles absolutely incredible the range on this electric truck very impressive to see and if you do the math there to figure out what's the size of the battery well it gives you something around 223 kwatt hours now both of these numbers do not take into consideration regen so as you're putting more energy back into the battery pack as you're regenerating and then using that you could get an inaccurate reading of the overall battery size there's not going to be a ton of that especially while Towing if you're staying at a constant speed on the highway but regardless it's something to take into consideration so you know it is possible this battery pack is basically the same as the Hummer about 2133 KW hours but again that's still 40 KW hours more than the Cyber truck with the range extender and if you're towing the bigger the battery pack the better so that is exciting to see and hey with the Silverado EV you still have full use of the truck bed even with that larger battery so electric vehicle Towing is an interesting challenge the way I think about it is from the manufacturer standpoint their biggest goal is to get consumers to buy the vehicles that's tough all on its own but in order to convince any truck buyers who tow to go electric I think you have to address three fundamental challenges first there has to be a truck capable of long range Towing second there needs to be a charging infrastructure that allows for Ev Towing and third the price needs to be affordable in this case the Silverado EV checks that first box the range while Towing combined with the crazy fast charging speeds of 350 KW means technically you can have an electric Towing experience very similar to just driving an Eevee on its own that is a remarkable step as far as charging infrastructure the biggest challenge today is a lack of P pull through options meaning you have to detach the trailer at many stops then charge the vehicle then reattach in addition charging speed is critical if you're limited to 150 KW like many of today's stations you could easily spend an hour or longer at each charging stop not ideal but the network is constantly improving so I don't doubt that solving this is feasible and finally regarding price yeah electric trucks are expensive but price parody between combustion and electric vehicles seems to be shrinking and with volume production scaling up and fuel savings taken into account this to seems feasible if you don't need to tow there are some great EV truck options if you do need to tow but only short distances again there remain many great EV options and if you do need to tow and you need to tow long distances props to the engineering team at Chevy as the Silverado Eevee looks to be the most compelling offering for an Eevee pickup for those traveling the Long Haul if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching
