- We are currently at
an abandoned hospital with over 100 different rooms and six different
buildings surrounding it. This is $100,000 in cash
and whichever one of you I touched last, keeps it. 10, nine.
(scream) Eight, seven.
(screaming) Six, five, four.. - I'm going this way. - [Jimmy] Three, two. - I Gotta hide.
- One. I wanna get someone quick, let's go. - I Think we got these boys. We ain't getting out first,
we ain't getting out first. - There's so many rooms. - Going outside. - They're not gonna get me,
they're not gonna get me. - I hear them over here. - Climb up this ladder. I think this will work, I'm on the roof. - Oh, wait a minute. (intensifying music) - I see Nolan, I see... - Oh, fudge, there's Jimmy. - Oh no, he's so far away. - Oh no, he's booking. He's booking it. - Wait, I can cut through here. - I'm getting out here. - Where'd he go? My gut's telling me he
went in this building. - Jimmy was just back there. Karl, Jimmy was just over there. - I saw you run in here. He was over here somewhere. - All right, we're rolling, we're rolling. - [Jimmy] No, I'm so tired. - Oh no.
- Oh my god. - [Sam] No.
(buzzer) I broke the camera and everything. I ain't running five years, man. - I gotta escort you to jail. - But I don't wand to go to jail. - We all do things we don't wanna do. I don't wanna run. There. One down nine more to go. - Tried my best. He just got me real good. We ain't gettin' out first. - Attention, everybody. The first person out is Sam. He tripped, and I tagged him. - That's so sad. - No way. - Yo, they caught somebody. They caught somebody. - Got the first personal. - Oh no, Sam. - Sorry, Sam. Eight more people to go. - Also, I'm tired and Chris is
gonna help me hunt you down. - You're going down, Karl. - Oh, no. - Chris is gonna help? We gotta find a better spot. - Chris, do you know the game plan? - No, not really.
- Tag people. - Is it... okay. - I'm under a trailer right now, I'm about to move like further back and let this thing just sitting here. - All right, yeah. Here's the stairs to the roof, baby. - So, let's search this room first. - Okay.
- And then we'll... He left. He just ran away. - I know Jimmy was that way. I haven't spotted Chris yet. Not a, not a wild Chris. - I feel like people are gonna be on the
outsides  There's so many people. Move, Frank.
(laughing) Oh God, they're so fast. - Oh, oh. Oh, they're running,
Jimmy, they were running. Chris found somebody. (screaming) - Wait, wait, wait.
- Chris, oh, someone. - Check this.
- Some people went the other way! - [Jimmy] They went the other way. Chris! - [Jimmy] No, why is there an end here? - Chris! Chris! - Chris, help! I'm in... Oh, oh. Wait for it.
- Wait, Chris. - Oh my god.
(buzzer) I got him. Oh my god, we got him. Sam, we brought you a partner. Attention, everybody. We officially caught the second person. Mitch is now out. - Mitch. I was just with him. No way, that was so close. - Mitch didn't win a hundred grand. - Hey, give, give me my picture back. - Let's go take more money from people. (intense music) - You want him to finish? - [Chris] Oh, ooh, I see. (excited breathing) There's like at least four. - [Jimmy] I'm coming through,
I'm coming through, whoa. - [Chris] Jimmy, yes, go that way. - [Jimmy] Why is this locked? This door's locked. (pained groan) - [Chris] Ah, that's my
knee I had surgery on. - [Jimmy] Where did they go? - That way.
- That way? - Ah.
- I see them. Come on, did they go in here? It's locked. All right, Chris, where you at? Meet me at the front, right now, pronto. - Roger, Delta. (intense music) - [Chris] Go, go, go, go, go. (excited screaming) (screaming) (screaming) (screaming)
(buzzer) - [Jimmy] What happening? - Literally circled around the tree and I saw this yellow frickin' shirt. - Chandler's currently on the roof. He doesn't realize that
I saw him laying down. I need you to go camp the
stairs of the roof for Chandler. I'm gonna take him to jail, okay, break. The stairs are that way.
- I knew that. I knew that. - Adam, we gotta be quick, come over here. Adam has officially been caught. Three down, there's seven remaining. I'm coming for you. All right, gotta go, Chandler the roof. - I'm gonna go rogue and go
up there and get Chandler. (intensifying music) - [Chandler] You set me up, Jimmy! - Chris, did you find him on the roof? - In the back quadrant, east.
- This way. (rapid music) According to my calculations,
they should be around here. (rapid music) Fine, fine, I'll admit it. My calculations were slightly off. This is hard. (screaming) - [Camera man] Go Jim, go Jim. - [Jimmy] Tell Chris, go to that door, the front door, he's there. (panting) - [Camera man] Jimmy, he's gone. Jimmy. Jimmy, he's leaving. You were so close. - I was so close to dying,
do you hear my oxygen? Nolan one got away, he's on the Southeast four 90.
- Roger that. - I don't know what that
means, I made it up. - I don't know what that means at all. - [Jimmy] I thought I'd find him here. Nolan, how are you up there? - I'm unstoppable. - You go to quadrant two, I'm going up. - Go, come on. - [Chris] Oh, god. - Stay back or I'll do it.
- You're not gonna jump. (intense music) He messed up the jump
pad, I can't get down. He's at the jump pad, Jimmy. Where are you? - Chris, can you hear me? - [Karl] Don't tell anybody,
I'm hiding under the money. I'm under the money and
now I have Chandler. There's no chance they'll ever find us, we're gonna be final two. - You don't think somebody could get up on top of these, right? (deep yawn) You think these'll hold me? I see him. (startled shout) (crashing) - [Chris] That's so far. Why are people jumping off the buildings? What am I supposed to... What? No, the crash pad's not there. What am I supposed to do, jump off of a building? - [Camera man] Ah, Chris
is stuck on the roof. He needs, you. - Take the stairs.
- No, no, no, like. Like stuck, stuck. - There's stairs.
- Not where he's at. - Jimmy.
- Oh, stuck. Wait, he was up there?
- Yeah. - Let me guess, so it's curly-hair guy. - Yeah.
- That curly hair guy just seems extreme. How'd you get up?
- Over there, but now it's too scary to go down. - You just keep scouting
while I go get a ladder. After I got Chris off the roof, Sapnap called us with an offer. What did you say, Sapnap? - How much money would you give me if I told you exactly
where Karl is right now? - What if I tweet out your channel if you told me where he is?
- All right. Karl is right beneath all the money. (gasp)
- Chris, let's go, go. Sapnap said he's beneath the money. (intense music) - Smells like Karl.
- It does smell like Karl. You told me when I was on the
other side of the hospital, I couldn't get him. - A deals a deal, I told you where he was. - [Jimmy] Karl was a dead end but then I spotted Rick
on another rooftop. What is with this guy and roofs? Hey, hey Rick, don't move, don't move. Stay there, I just want peace. We can work something out. - Okay, what are we talking? - I tag you, you lose a hundred grand. - No deal.
- This guy's sneaky, be careful. (intense music) - He juked you up.
- Ooh, that's so close. Shh. - I'm literally looking right at you. - [Chris] Jimmy, Jimmy, he's jumping. - Is he jumpin'? You oh... I got you. (buzzer)
- Oh, god, it's deck. - Oh. - You good, man?
- Yeah, I'm good. - Chris, come on down. - Can you get that ladder? - All right, welcome your new inmate. (cheers) - Come on in.
- Come on in, guy. - Hey, guys, they got me.
- Rick has been found. Also, I forgot to rip yours, as well. - I think I played a good game. I think I gave them all
a run for their money. That's okay. - You know how there's a
cafeteria in the hospital? And I'm totally not gonna be
here so you can come get food. - [Narrator] A few moments later. (intensifying music) - [Jimmy] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Help me!
(laughs) He's getting tired. I thought the good old
walkie throw would work. But now I just don't have a walkie talkie. - My boys.
- Hey, can you get out? - Oh, I see, okay. - We're disguised all the way up. Hiding inside of Jimmy's car. They're not gonna know.
- Oh. - There's no chance
they are gonna find us. - I don't know if you could tell but we were exhausted at this point. Honestly, it's kind of fun walking and enjoying the sunset with you. - It is nice. We don't do this very often. - Should I get lower?
- Yeah, try to get lower. - Someone in my car?
- He definitely see us? - [Chris] Did you leave
your keys in your car? - Three, two, one. - Oh, oh, Jimmy go. (laughs) - [Chris] They just stole your car. (laughs) - [Jimmy] Oh, they're getting
out, they're getting out. They're getting out, go, go, go, go. (screams) Catch up. He's right there. Go, go, go. Go, go, get over...
(buzzer) Got him! Get me up over his body or just fall down. Here's your new prisoner.
(groans) Now, before I put you in jail.
- Yes. - Were you hiding under the money earlier when Sapnap bribed you out? - I was directly under that.
(laughs) - So Sapnap was telling the truth? - 100%.
- Sapnap, I love you. Get in jail.
- Oh. (laughs)
- Dude, how do I get out? Look at these, these
are literally titanium. - I know.
After jailing Karl we thought things would
die down for a bit. But out of nowhere, Chris just found a bunch of people. (intense music) - Jimmy, come to the front. I got Sapnap. Go, go, go, go. John, I got it, I got it, I got it. - [Jimmy] Sapnap managed to
ditch Chris in the forest. So we had to switch up our plans. - [Chris] There's a ladder. - He had another race. I'm sure I'll see him again
sometime soon and do it again. - Nolan is in the back parking lot. - Oh shh, oh no. - Oh, Nolan's in the back parking lot. (intense music) - Oh no! - Tag, you're it.
(buzzer) - I was lured.
- Yeah. - Like an animal into a trap. - Gentlemen.
- Oh. - Welcome your new inmate.
(cheers) Nolan, you're no longer rolling. All right, you can enter.
- Nolan's not rolling. - No!
- Nolan's not rolling. Nolan's not rolling. - Jordan, Chandler, Sapnap, and Chris are the only four that remain. In the middle of the hospital is a briefcase full of $10,000. You can come get this,
but if you do grab it, you have to carry it around. - 10,000 in the middle. But somebody's gonna be waiting. I know somebody's gonna be waiting. - I'm not following for that. I've been here too long
to know that's a trap. - Karl, can I borrow you?
- Okay. - Chris wiped out, here's the clip. (laughs) You didn't even see it. Karl is searching with me,
he's filling in for Chris. Chris hurt his leg. We are constricting the
zone to just the hospital. I'll give you guys like
five minutes to come inside. Ready or not, here we come. Karl, we haven't worked together much. - Yes.
- You can point that down. - We're gonna find somebody right now. You know why? 'Cause I see you. Maybe not. 'Cause I see you. (screams) There is a bug, there's a bug.
- Oh. I want you to search that side, I'll search this side. Break on three. Break on three, break on three. - [Both] Break on three. - Break on three.
'Cause I see you. - Thank God I got rid of that nerd. Chandler, where are you?
- I'm in the hospital. - Hey, this is Tyler, make sure that you. - Why is this sink running?
- 'Cause I see you. (yells) - No one. Someone's under those stairs. - They're right there, they're so close. - Someone's definitely under these stairs. - [Karl] 'Cause I see them. - Karl, oh.
- Hey. - [Jimmy] Where are you? - Oh, come on out, I see you. (laughs) (buzzer) It's the worst spot ever. - Where was I supposed to
go in this wretched place? - Taylor, you're fast. You should've just been running around. - Oh yeah.
- Oh. Saw other people hiding, so I thought that was the strat. - Oh yeah?
So where'd you see them hiding? - Definitely not where?
- Not in the cafeteria? - No.
- Could you just sit down real quick?
- So. - We're gonna?
(upbeat music) - Oh, this cafeteria's ginormous. (screams) - They finally got me.
- There's no running, no. (buzzer) - Yay!. The two fastest people made it easy on us by hiding in confined
spaces instead of running. We did in fact catch Chandler.
(shocked cheers) Hey, and wait, wait.
- They got me. - We caught Chris.
- The got me. - Hop on in, hop on in. Boom, boom. Karl, I need you to go back in jail. - Welcome back, buddy.
- Welcome back. - I hate him. These last two people, I'm
gonna hunt all by myself. Jordan and Sapnap. I'd like you to know that I'm standing in front
of the $100,000 in cash and only one of you is getting it. Now your boys all on his own. (crack) There goes the flashlight. If I was Sapnap, where would I hide? Not there. Interesting. Someone is using the bathroom? You know, it'd be kinda weird to catch someone in the bathroom. Nope. This hospital is huge. Breach. (intense music) This hospital is ginormous and
there's only two people left. I bet you one of them's around here. (squeak)
(intensifying music) Did you see that door? Wait, that door moved. That door did move. Wait, hold on. That door moved. Someone in here? I see you. It's a lie.
I was hoping if they were back there, they would say something. - I can't believe I got away from him, my plan worked beautifully. - I heard someone, dude, I heard someone. The door moving, I heard noise. Yeah, we're on someone's tail. Who is it? Sapnap am I on your tail or is it Jordan? Who am I around? Not feeling very talkative? (screams) (screams) - [Camera man] Oh, got
her, go Jimmy, go Jimmy. (indistinct)
(screaming) - She locked herself
in the men's bathroom. - Am I allowed to kick down
a door in the hospital? All right, fine. Jordan, I'll leave you be. I'm gonna go look for Sapnap. (heavy footsteps) - [Walkie Talkie Voice] Desmond,
we're out on the grip truck and we have a sledge hammer. (screams) (screams) - I got her, I got her.
(buzzer) (panting) Jordan, I don't want you
to walk home with nothing. So we're still gonna give you $10,000 even though you didn't win. You just won 10,000. Kid, all right. Sapnap, congratulations,
I just found Jordan which means you just won $100,000. - Yes, thank you so much. Let's go. I found somebody and they are Jordan. - No! Join us, join us, join us. - Sapnap, please meet me at the prison. - Yo, he's over here?
(laughs) - Congratulations, Sapnap. Do you want to call Dream and tell him you won a hundred grand? - Yeah, I'll call him. Hey, Dream, guess who won a hundred grand? - What?
- And every single person that competed today gets $5,000. 'Cause why not?
