my unlimited budget Wi-Fi setup has some problems the only one I've talked about so far is the weird interference on the wireless speakers in the family room but I'm also getting disconnections on Apple devices when I'm moving around my house and my phone takes forever to connect to the outdoor access points when I pull into my driveway which wouldn't be a huge problem except that I have no cell service in my neighborhood so I can't open my garage I mean don't get me wrong when it works the speeds are really solid but in spite of that it's like there's this voice in the back of my head you know Wi-Fi 6 Wi-Fi 6 Wi-Fi 6 it almost sounds like Jake I knew it I knew it okay but hear me out ubiquity Wi-Fi 60 gear might not be technically enabled in Canada yet but there's a hacky workaround and the speeds are absolutely ridiculous I've had issues with ubiquity Wi-Fi gear in the past though which is why I went Ruckus in the first place but I will give them one more chance I mean given that it works great everywhere else in my life including at the office it should be fine and if it's not Jake has promised me that he will personally reinstall all of my existing Ruckus access points just like I'm going to install this segue to our sponsor it's freshbooks thanks freshbooks for sponsoring this video freshbooks simplifies accounting and bookkeeping ensuring you're

that I've run into so far Ruckus Unleashed might not be as featur as their dedicated or their Cloud controllers but it does have most of the basics it's just that the basics haven't helped me fix my issues so far and besides they won't upgrade my Wi-Fi 6 access points to Wi-Fi 6E anyway which is a lot of the point of what we're doing I wonder if part of the problem is these access points are just so Overkill I was looking and Unleashed and my phone and laptop were grabbing the AP upstairs and we're there's one right there what what's going on literally right above us I even turned the power down to minimum as a troubleshooting step recently and it was still happening well it's still happening right now because it's turned down right now let's have a look at what we got here I actually haven't seen any of this Jake surprised me actually everyone surprised me I didn't even know we were doing this video I was at Disneyland well for inside WiFi 60 this is the UniFi 6 Enterprise each one of these APS can handle I think it's 600 plus clients something like 10 gigabit of throughput theoretically this is the sorry 10 gigabit of throughput well like connectivity between all the clients good gravy we've got a total of then five of these for the inside one for the garage that's six because we learned absolutely nothing about how having two many access points can actually be problematic I just turn it off the Wi-Fi 6E could actually help us with that we'll talk a little bit more about that later and then I have two outside which doesn't explain why you have four well I wasn't really sure what would be the best option these ones kind of look nice you see it's just like a little tube and you can just mount it under the S these ones aren't y560 but since it's outdoors anyways you know 6 gz is not really ideal nor needed you just need to open your garage right yeah we're probably going to go with the long range plus because it's really long range it's got a very powerful 2.4 gig antenna I didn't even ask we can show this one cuz it's technically EA but I'm sure it's fine haha got them these are Wi-Fi 6 on both 2.4 and 5 the cool thing about these ones is they're sealed like you could put this in a bucket of water before we go any further we should probably explain why WI-Fi 60 is so important this is not just a little speed bump it's more about the fact that we're getting access to an enormous uninterrupted 1200 MHz of spectrum that up until now hasn't been used for any Wi-Fi Communications it's in the 6 GHz range and it's a whopping what is it like seven 1200 MHz 7 160 wide channels the problem with 5 GHz Wi-Fi there's all those like little sections that are blocked off so you can't have big channels and then there's like the radar thing it's and the width of the channel is what gives you the speed yeah plus since this spectrum is completely empty with none of my neighbors realistically using it I could have every single one of my APS on a completely separate 160 MHz wide band so they don't interfere with each other at all plus because it's higher in the frequency range it's faster and when I say faster you can do 1 and2 gigabit both ways to a single client if it's supported if you're wondering why I'm wearing gloves so I don't get like shmear on the ceiling a finger goo ceiling paint is very not glossy and it is really hard to clean unfortunately the mounting holes are not the same I maybe they are do those look the same e and e oh my God they are all right there we go now we just need to adopt the AP it popped up here already it's going to have to update and then we should start receiving Wi-Fi from it now we just have to repeat this process seven more times two of which are outdoors and it's raining I can shoot from inside oh these drywall anchors are crap they like painted over them so they're stuck in most dry ball anchors when you run the screw into the anchor kind of like break apart in the back to hold it in place and prevent that from happening I think what happened is they use screws that are too short so it's not broken open in the back and it can just screw right out like we're saying easy I will say the Ruckus ones huge pain in the ass I mean just look at it you have two little key holes that you have to get the keys perfectly lined up on for both and then it slides on but when you can't see you're trying to get the stupid screws to line up it's kind of a pain in the ass you can even see all the scratches from when we tried to mount these things this AP is going to suck to change can I help you boys this is terribly awkward why it's really not heavy at all oh my gosh there's a dead spider ew it's not dead go away you're doing such a great job lonus keep it up and die helped oh yeah woo for those wondering this is not an ideal place to position an access point usually you want them in the center of the ceiling of the space that you're trying to fill or the center of the wall if the ceiling is not available this particular wire was supposed to poke through in the wall but I guess they didn't read the plans right and put it in the ceiling instead so um yeah it it lives in the corner of the wall now come on oh oh hey nice damn it they're deck screws fortunately everyone chirps the LTT screwdriver for this it has Robson so I can actually take these out it's quite the size difference eh I like this it's got a little bit different design for where the cable plugs in usually they plug in here and it's really hard to get it in but they did it at an angle with a little bit bigger hole so it's much easier to plug in I got it I don't actually it's not even showing up in here what is wrong with your app I don't know it's possible that I'm just not signed up for Early Access access yeah basically what Jake's trying to do is he's trying to enable access to Beta firmwares for devices because those Early Access outdoor APS you can't just run production firmware on them obviously because they're not even production devices but we don't have the console mine does maybe it's just the difference between the IOS and Android app I think we still need to do it on a computer really yeah I need this to say like it should say release candidate and then Early Access and Early Access is what we want but it is not working in the meantime I think I'm just going to mount the AP and he can adopt it in a few hours when this recognizes the change okay all eight of our access points are hung up now so the first thing we need to do is create a Wi-Fi network for Wi-Fi 6E because it's a separate band I guess you could technically have one that is 2.45 and 6 all with the same name but then you're not really going to know which network you're connected to we're going to name it Wi-Fi 6E for now password 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and then go to manual turn off 2.4 gig and 5 and just select 6 GHz this is going to require us to use wpa3 which is the new security protocol for Wi-Fi 6C it's very similar to WPA2 but with stronger encryption so that's the best option just add our Wi-Fi network boom we'll give that a few seconds and we should be able to see it on this laptop here which is Wi-Fi 6 enabled it does support 160 MHz wide channels but only in a 2X two stream we might not be able to get above gigabit on this one but we should be able to get really good speeds and we can connect to the 5 GHz Network to compare the two and see the speed difference cuz it should still be substantial I went to just double check to make sure that the Wi-Fi 60 is working and it says the 6 GHz radio is disabled because we're in Canada there's some weird certification stuff that's going on with Wi-Fi 6C despite it being approved just like the states so to get around it we go into our UniFi control center here and change our country from Canada to the United States probably not super legal but we're doing it anyways now that we've switched over I want to try the speakers this isn't going to be a definitive test because the problem that he was having is kind of inter anyways [Music] but oh yeah never mind it's still screw we probably need to go tweak the channels and maybe shut 5 GHz off on the AP that's right above here but I wasn't super confident this was going to fix this problem anyways ah look at that there's our Wi-Fi 6C Network we're in business uh speed test okay let's go stand under this AP 300 down is not bad not incredible either to be honest I think the peak we saw there was 850 megabit upload that's pretty fast 326 780 I didn't tweak anything everything's set to automatic okay let's walk around with my phone really quick before I would walk between one room and it would completely disconnect and I it's not like it would you know be disconnected for a little bit it would stay disconnected until I manually went in and reconnected to the network I want to see it on mine too cuz I know about how fast it should be on mine this is a fold three right so you should have 6E do you see a Wi-Fi network called Wi-Fi 6E you really called it Wi-Fi 6 just for now like there it is sick it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 oh it's a good thing we have WPA 3 okay go that's only 300 just wait till it goes to the upload well why is down slow I'm not 100% sure even on 5 gig it's kind of slow why am I cursed I was getting like 600 plus before you just downgraded my Wi-Fi no no no it's great trust me what do you mean great that's not great Jake you done you goofed dog no it's fast you goofed oh it's great look when I walk around your house it doesn't disconnect anymore okay well that's an improvement so Jake you basically downgraded L's Network just so your iPhone wouldn't disconnect when you walked around the house so this wasn't about me at all then was it you know what it was about well it looks like we found the problem there were a couple of issues one is that we didn't have flow control enabled on the switch uh that got us to 800 900 megabit a second with the old switch but here's the thing my old Poe switch was is gigabit which is actually a bottleneck even for a single client so we've actually swapped out the switch to their new Enterprise 48 Port that has 48 ports of 2 1/2 gig and then four 10 GB SFP pluses it should then be ripping fast all I got to do is set up a network that uses 6 GHz and I'll maybe I'll also have to get a little closer to an access point [Music] 700 let's Let It Rip 900 wa more than gigabit up there she goes Jake has these same APS at home has actually seen speeds in excess of 1.5 gbit as cool as all this is though so far I'm finding it a bit of a challenge to actually take advantage of 6 GHz Wi-Fi the issue with that is that iOS devices and modern Android phones no longer allow you to set an order of priority for your wireless networks there are third party apps that do it but not natively as far as I'm aware so ridicul ully what my phone does is it just grabs my 5 GHz Wi-Fi network literally all the time then what I tried next was to just enable 6 GHz on my 5 GHz Network and it's 6 not 6E it's right there how much closer can I be but as I'm driving up the street to my house can I connect and operate my garage door action leave and we did it oh wait did I did I hit the sensor darn it [Music] so this wasn't about me at all then was it you know what it was about our sponsor
