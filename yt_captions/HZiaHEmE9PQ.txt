is your laptop old and crappy download Chrome and make it snappy are you trying to be brutal bye bye Windows okay why do I have to pick one what no I'm tired of it for years now consumers have been stuck asking do I go for a Windows laptop or a Chromebook knowing that neither of them can fully match the features of the other and that once they pick a path they're completely locked in until they replace the whole machine and it's so frustrating because the actual Hardware in these computers is especially in some cases darn near identical at least that's how it has been this summer Google reversed course and released their Cloud Centric OS to the General Public for free which means that you yes you James Smith can install Chrome OS anywhere you want that disgusting laptop you use for cooking videos in the kitchen Chromebook your great aunts anemic Windows PC she somehow manages to break every month boom now it's a Chromebook but is Chrome OS the solution for an aging computer to find out we voluntold our team to bring in any old laptops they could find to see if Google could breathe new life into their aging hardware and I gotta say it is looking pretty good it can even play this Segway to our sponsor build Redux build Redux makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help along the way they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a PC yourself so head to build redux.com Linus and start your new build today so you brought in this laptop for us to uh test out here's your laptop tell us about it what what is it it's an HP G56 it's a think FedEx 230. I bought this uh geez what did I buy 2012. to be like 2014 or something like that oh I have no idea probably I got it in 2001 2001 yeah no in 2011. 11 oh 11 yes 2011. yes 2011. I bought this laptop at the Best Buy that I used to work at back in like 2014 my wife and I were doing a long distance at that time and she had a real piece of and so she needed a new one and so I surprised her with this now this is a bit of a PC too because it's been so long I'm a distracted person I was trying to do some writing and I it was very hard so my dad's like I'm buying you a computer that won't be connected to the internet that it was so it's so cumbersome and slow that I didn't it didn't help uh I bought it anticipating that I would do a lot more traveling that that I've ended up doing this is like my school computer I got it because it's like it just so gigantic so we're gonna do is that we're gonna install Chrome OS on it I'm very curious if it's gonna help sir appreciate it to quantify any gains that we might get from Chrome OS we need to do some baseline testing before we install Google's operating system and that's going to be a little trickier than usual because Chrome OS does not have the same robust Suite of benchmarking tools that PC enthusiasts have come to expect on Windows machines but we did find a few browser-based benchmarks and we were able to create some of our own real world benchmarks to fill in the gaps first up we measured how long it took to boot the device open a browser and start watching a YouTube video you know the basics we also timed waking up from sleep tested the number of chrome tabs each could handle we're calling 36 tabs a pass and counted how many concurrent 1080p streams we could get running without any stutters we Then followed this up with a battery test to see if Chrome OS can not only make your system faster but also run longer and just how slow are these computers pretty bad Lloyd's old MacBook took almost 30 seconds to wake from sleep sleep more like mostly dead and horse hpg56 that took over five minutes to reach YouTube thanks to its ungodly slow 3200 RPM hard drive making matters worse it only managed a single 720p stream before giving up the ghost as for performance in a browser in our tabs test the HP and Asus units almost got a pass crashing out right near the Finish Line with Lloyd's pretty much blowing its engine right out of the Starting Gate failing at a truly pathetic four tabs then in our 1080p playback test Jaime and Adam Pease machines both managed four 1080p YouTube streams with no drop frames while horsts and Lloyd's devices failed to play even a single stream at full HD in the battery test every machine sucked frankly but that's kind of expected given the age of the cells in these devices the MacBook does take its first W here though at nearly three hours of time away from the wall we also ran our canned benchmarks but we're going to talk about those a little bit later since it's already clear that some of these computers are struggling hard maybe Chrome OS is the medicine they need so let's get started the Chrome OS Flex install process is less than elegant but if you're Chrome curious and halfway tech savvy you should be able to grab a USB stick and follow along at home when you Google Chrome OS Flex you get taken to a Google Enterprise site you then click try Chrome OS flex and it asks you to sign up and fill in your company's details you can safely ignore that what you actually want is this little link right here then it takes you to an installation guide great but you need to download a Chrome extension to create the installation media seems kind of random but there is a reason for it it's because this is actually a chrome recovery tool that's designed to repair your existing chromolis install on your Chromebook they've just repurposed it at this point it confusingly asks you to choose from a selection of Chromebooks and it's here that you select Chrome OS flex and then Target your preferred USB drive note that this will wipe out any other data on that drive once you've created your installation media you can plug her into your device and non-destructively boot from the USB drive to try out the OS and at this point I could see you thinking this is super cool maybe I'll dual boot it hold it right there if you decide that you want to install Chrome OS to your SSD or your hard drive rather than running it off of a USB stick you need to know that for some probably stupid reason Google's Chrome OS Flex installer does not allow you to choose where to install it so even if you've set up one partition for Windows and one for Chrome OS it will wipe out both of them eliminating all of your data making matters even worse if you have two completely separate physical drives it might Target the empty one or it might Target your main drive and completely wipe out its data you've been warned so make sure you've either backed up everything important or as an alternative you can whip out your handy-dandy LTT screwdriver available in four colorways and remove your main drive so you can keep your data safe while you install Chrome OS on the spare one that is not okay yeah bunch of googlers what is okay is our test results sorry spoiler but it's the truth they're not great just okay let's start with the canned benchmarks that we mentioned earlier webgl aquarium it's a bit of a mixed bag with both our ThinkPad and our Asus machine recording drops in Prof performance while horst's HP took a huge leap forward then in Whirlpool HTML5 the story is the same with only the HP improving in any meaningful way in speedometer 2.1 our story gets even less compelling and we see a consistent drop in performance across all devices Chrome OS isn't looking so hot but maybe this reigned in performance is one of the ways that Chrome OS manages better battery life uh well if our testing is anything to go by sorry Chief not really the three laptops that we could measure all performed similarly to Windows but slightly worse and this was probably the biggest surprise for us because anecdotes from around the web have suggested that Chrome OS Flex should have a huge positive impact on battery life with some people reporting 25 to 50 percent gains maybe on these models Chrome OS didn't automatically kick on power saving mode or maybe their battery life tests were run under different conditions I can't say all I know is that at the moment Chrome OS Flex is feeling a little more like Chrome OS flaccid fortunately these lower scores that we've seen so far do not tell the whole story the experience of using these devices improved massively across the board and you can see that in our real world tests look at these boot times to be clear a minute it's still pretty slow but it's a lot faster than 5 minutes and 45 seconds we also saw more 1080p streams on every single device faster wake from sleep more tabs and just subjectively less chugging while navigating the operating system but don't listen to me listen to our volunteers whoa wow it's like a different laptop oh my goodness that is fast oh that's pretty fast the q key has stopped working that's yeah there's something wrong with the keyboard yeah if you could fix the keyboard then this would be a solid like write your novel at Starbucks sort of computer it's a trackpad work too oh so so does cool and the nub works sorry the track Point uh works perfectly fine look at that it's running incredible as an apple it's like clay cord unfortunate news for you what Chrome OS does not work oh okay ah that the key night among you might have noticed that Lloyd's MacBook was conspicuously absent from our test results and this seems like as good a time as any to mention the minimum requirements for running Chrome OS Flex you will need an x86 64-bit compatible device 4 gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of internal storage with the final caveat being that components made before 2010 may result in a poor experience but all of that is well below the specs of Lloyd's old MacBook so what's the deal here well the thing is you might also have a poor experience if you install Chrome OS Flex on a non-certified device Jamie's ThinkPad here was actually our only device that happened to be on Google's list and it worked so well that it might as well have been a Chromebook in the first place almost we'll talk about that in a second as for the others we saw issues that ranged from mildly annoying like mislabeled function keys or non-functioning volume controls all the way to completely game breaking like not handing off rendering to the dedicated GPU on Lloyd's MacBook even though we could tell that Chrome OS was totally still running behind that blank screen do you want to activate Chromebox the built-in screen reader for Chrome OS if so press the space bar it's important to note that even if you install Chrome OS Flex on a certified device it doesn't quite have all the features of regular Chrome OS and the big one here is no support for Android apps that reduces your options for non-web apps to basically zilch and is a huge hit to the versatility of these things your zombie Chromebook also won't get features that are exclusive to Google Certified devices like access to their Linux shell of course you tinkery types can remedy this by using something called the brunch framework it's a community project that uses an official recovery image to install Chrome OS on any x64 device but without any of the limitations that Google imposes on Chrome OS Flex so at the very least you get your Android apps back which is a big plus since it's honestly kind of confusing that Google locked it off in the first place we didn't have a chance to give brunch framework a shot though so those of you who have let us know what your experience was like in the comments down below bottom line would we recommend Chrome OS Flex installation caveats actually yeah it really can breathe new life into an old device and is great if you just need something that's easy to lock down to give to a child or you want a device for light Computing tasks around the house if nothing else it takes about 15 minutes to get the installer onto a USB to try out so it's at least worth giving it a shot and if Chrome OS isn't your thing hey there's lots of other options you could go with a lightweight Linux distro like lubuntu or anti-x or if you want to stick with Windows the single best upgrade for older devices is an SSD Jamie's 10 year old ThinkPad felt like a totally different machine with a solid state drive in it and we're going to throw a couple of super affordable options in the link down below where you
