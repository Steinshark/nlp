Welcome to The Ultimate Showdown in the programming World okay whoa whoa whoa what the hell are we watching Vim vs emac War okay I'm ready hi YouTube say hello Welcome to The Ultimate Showdown in the programming World folks no we're not talking about C versus C plus plus or PHP versus old arguments you know what I mean these are old arguments okay no one argues about this [ __ ] anymore okay it's all about neovim versus vs code that's a hot one it's all about typescript versus JS docs that's a hot one you know what I mean uh it's all about bun versus node or Dino oh it's Dono thanks thanks I love I love it I love it I love that you guys love correcting me on such stupid things hi YouTube shut up stop saying YouTube press the Subscribe and like button node.js we're talking about the ultimate holy war Vim vs emacs it's a debate as old as time itself or at least as old as the internet this somehow looks like a real image and it bothers me okay either ai's gotten too good or people are too good I don't believe you I don't believe you it's real this is a real image I see AI has ruined our life okay I just hate this you know we used now I don't even know if it's fake photoshopped or what it has torn friendships apart caused Twitter Wars and made us question our existence the level of passion and dedication that programmers on both sides feel for their chosen editor is nothing short of absurd it's like asking a parent to choose their favorite child over emacs Vim users swear by its efficiency Speed most of those were really good okay most of those were really really good okay uh I'm not I'm not really sure what all of them have to do you know because some of them just because I swear by its efficiency two two squirrely braces it's just two paragraph jumps I'm not sure why you have to do two to make it into something you know like why not just one I don't get it why you gotta be like that and the fact that it's included in almost every Unix based system the emacs used by the way that doesn't apply to me nearly as much as it should do you know what I mean like in the sense that I always just use neovim for personal development I like the fact that I have good muscle memory so when I have to go on a server which does happen every now and then by the way go on a server hit some Global marks and hop around like it's 1984. it's fantastic like I know what I'm doing out there and it feels real good we're on the yeah but no everyone uses emacs via the GUI version very few people are terminal terminal emacs users it turns out the only way to use emacs is truly in the GUI users on the other hand praise its extensibility customization options and the fact that it's more like a complete operating system than just an editor both sides have their pros and cons he missed the joke right what's the joke emacs is a great operating system it's just missing a good text editor where's the joke cons and at the end of the day it all comes down to personal preference some programmers swear by Vim claiming that it's the only editor worth using correct they'll tell you that it's lightning fast yep Ultra efficient it's so simple that even a caveman could use it they'll also tell you that it's customizable to the point of obsession nice neovim I love the neovim going on right here I don't like the fact that you're doing implicit function calls okay I don't like that about a little but everything else looks great and that you can practically code with your eyes closed once you've mastered its Arcane key bindings of course they won't tell you that you'll spend the first few months stumbling around like a blindfolded baby deer before you can even write a hello world program false but hey absolutely user-friendly interface space when you can use a million different commands to accomplish the same damn thing as for the Vim Community it's full I'm not gonna lie to you I don't I want to hear a good take you know what I mean I want a good take I want a good take I want to hear a good take okay it feels like this feels like an old and tried and true take that's not actually that great love quirky characters and hilarious memes from Vim is my co-pilot to yank and paste they have a language all their own some might say it's a cult but they prefer to call it a community of passionate users and let's not forget the classic Vim tutorial which feels like you're learning an entirely new language but for Vim enthusiasts the Steep learning curve is worth it for the speed and efficiency they gain so if you ever meet someone who uses Vim just nod and smile because you might not understand their quirks but they're probably writing code faster than you can speak he's not wrong okay he's not wrong also is that Doom in Emax is that Doom Max does Doom Max come with a Doom distribution that I was completely unaware of is that true emacs enthusiasts on the other hand will argue that if you want an editor that can do anything emacs is the answer want to edit text with one hand while sipping coffee with the other Emax has got you covered perhaps you need to run a terminal emulator inside your text editor should never have to do that okay those who write those who run terminal emulators inside their text editor have already screwed up okay you are you're you've already screwed up all right you're not living the past extreme okay you're not the full the Flop the philosophy emacs can do that too want to play Tetris or read email while writing code emacs has modes for that playing Tetris while reading email sounds like the most terrifying activity ever that means I'm not reading email in short If You Can Dream It emacs can do it now if you're an emacs user apart from being a Richard stallman Fanboy you're part of a community that takes its editor very seriously it's not just a tool it's a way of life emacs users are known for customizing their Editor to the nth degree creating complex macros and scripts to automate their work and obsessively tweaking their setup to get the most out of it and then there's the infamous emacs pinky a condition caused by the strain of hitting the control and meta keys so frequently that some emacs use no I don't like like I don't like this image or laughing at this image because if this happens to be a real image oh it's a real image this would make me sad because someone got real hurt but at the exact same time at the exact same time emacs just so beautifully so beautifully describes this pick is definitely out there being like oh Julie users actually develop a callus on their pinky finger but for Emax users it's all worth it for the power and flexibility of their beloved editor yeah while the Vim versus emacs debate may seem like a modern phenomenon that's the truth is that these editors have been around literally for decades Vim for example was first released in 1991 and was based on the vi editor which was first it's actually technically based on the Stevie editor if we're going to be real with each other okay Stevie you may have heard of Stevie the stop gap between VI and Vim VI Stevie them it's kind of like a a succession of Kings you know created in 1976 emacs on the other hand was first released in 1976 and was created by Richard stallman one of the pioneers of the free software movement over time both editors have evolved significantly with each Community adding new features and improving upon existing ones so now it's time to answer the ultimate question which and we all know it's not space Max it's do Max everybody knows everybody knows the final progression is do Max I've actually ran this entire this entire list I actually did when I started out programming notepad I did go to Vim I went from Vim to emacs for for some amount of time and then I actually even went from emacs to do Max and space Max and then went back to Vim well actually then I spent six months in an atom Microsoft vs code like hell for a while and then I then I went back to Vim editor is better Vim or emacs and the answer is neither you gotta have an opinion you gotta have an opinion it's clearly them okay okay it's clearly then gotta have an opinion State and opinion some programmers may prefer the speed and efficiency of Vim While others may be drawn to the power and versatility of emacs by the way you can't do a lot of these things in non-editor or like in without the GUI mode right you can't just terminal a lot of these things okay Helix he licks these nuts okay we don't even talk about that okay literally oh my goodness oh my goodness you just you just you guys you guys just did this for me meme generator uh guy uh beat let's see beat up baseball bat I don't know I don't know let's see what's what is the mean where it's like the two guys talking and then there's a third one that comes in and then they beat him to death what is that one what is that one meme uh beat baseball bat I don't know the name of it what is the name of this this meme I'm afraid to go too far down on the internet uh where is it where where is it imager where's imager let's go to imager Imager imager all right where are you imager all right there we go let's go to this one let's let's look up uh let's look up baseball bat you guys know which one I'm talking about right two guys beating wait no see that nope see that's that's how it goes that's how you get in trouble on the internet okay you can't just be searching up two guys beating each other okay that's how it happens uh beat let's see a baseball a bat okay baseball bat oh my goodness dude okay does anyone know what it is I gotta know you know that it's like the two it's like the two it's it's the two guys and then the third guy comes in and then they beat him two guys beating a third oh no here we go dude guys I'm beating a third meme [Music] two guys one bat there's two bats no there's two guys there's not a cop involved problems stress paint oh damn am I not gonna be able am I literally not gonna be able to find it this is too bad this was gonna be such a good one yes it's this one holy cow I would have never guessed Mac PC Linux meme generator I would have never guessed that I would have never guessed this one okay I could have been here for my entire life and I would have never guessed this one okay Vim emacs Helix there we go this just seems right okay this just seems right there we go I would have never guessed that one this seems this this is this is it this is the one save image it's kind of low quality low cue okay almost no cue hit him on the Twitter go on the tweets go to the images hit him with this tweet it okay that's all I do on Twitter this is all this is this is it this is what we do on Twitter okay I make fun of Helix users vs code users I make fun of typescript to the point where people make long messages on Reddit about me and that's all we do okay that's all you gotta do around here okay that's all you have to do you know you've successfully successful when you get Ever everybody bad okay and then finally when they think you're gonna like okay Reddit is still dead whatever the Reddit is stupid Reddit is stupid at the end of the day the best editor for you is the one that makes you feel most productive and comfortable so we encourage you to try out both editors and see which one suits you best and who knows you may even find that you love them both equally all right this is true story it's true sorry no no I didn't mean to press it um anyways so real talk real talk first off that guy had an amazing voice and second off there was a real good piece of information in that video this idea I hate when people say you should just use the editor that makes you feel the most productive because usually what that means is you should use the only editor you should know and that's it right I'm inflating My Views I am but that's literally what that usually means is just use the one you already know and that's that because if you were to use something else you would slow down and that's kind of annoying um it's a stupid argument because you don't even know what's out there the good thing from that video though that you should really take away which is you should try them all I've tried do Max for months on end I've tried vs code for months I tried even stupid Adam for like multiple weeks okay multiple weeks you know what I mean it's not about it's not it's not just about which one's gonna feel the best for you but which one like which one makes you look at software differently and get like and get good at it because the problem is is that one big thing that stunted me for a long time was the fact that I stayed in netbeans so when I stayed in netbeans all I would do is use netbeans and when I wanted to debug something I would press the bug symbol when I wanted to run something I would press the Run symbol but guess what I had no idea how it worked at all and so I was purely limited to only being able to work in things that worked inside of netbeans and I just would never remove myself from that and it's because I never actually learned how things work and those are those are hard times and you know I wish I would have been a little bit faster at learning how things work instead of taking my sweet sweet ass time but then you know and then I moved to IntelliJ and the same thing happened right I still didn't know how things work and so I will just only do what I could do in the like in the box that I understood then I kind of grew out of that and also yes Java build systems super also on that team absolutely the name is the Java gen Java Jen the name is the vs cotogen what should we do the name the name foreign I want to play Tears of Kingdom that's my name okay I haven't even played it yet I haven't even played the game yet I've been waiting you know what I had I had my sweet dear's wife's like we were at a soccer tournament and then I I couldn't play it this entire time and that's all I've been wanting to do is play Tears of the Kingdom tears tears of the Kingdom okay that's it I have no idea how the game goes my son was got to play it on the road trip up while I talked to my sweet beautiful wife and guess what I never played it and all I want to do is play it right now so you know what the name is the man who is wanting the wanting
