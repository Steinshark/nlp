okay welcome to this week's meeting C plus plus block roll highlight um not a lot of topics to cover this week um there is some announcements for my conference and I wrote an announcement about this deeper class user groups in this month um there are some releases like from Poco SPD lock tree frog framework um and then there's some security from the open Messages Plus team block and um if you're interested in security you probably also should read the article in an increasing Security First testing and C plus plus which is a Guest block on my block which is related to the tool and book fair which I run online but you know again this timeline shows you know I gave it a bit away this time again chose to um feature my own block for the first time in here because yesterday I wrote a little rant on hiring on C plus plus I gave a presentation on hiring on C plus plus this week as I usually give a presentation on this once a quarter to promote my job fair on LinkedIn and also saw this article which is basically the next slide then the pool of talented deaths is running dry um I thought I write down my thoughts on this because I've been hearing about this for 10 years and I can't hear about it anymore um you know um yes it's there's it's a tough competition about C plus plus deaths and if you're not willing to make the changes to your organization which are required to you know be competitive in today's um world you will find that your pool runs dry and maybe your pool is also leaky because it is better to work for your uh competitors or for other fields in the industry because it's a better experience maybe they pay better Finance doesn't have a problem but maybe the problem in finances that you already spent so much on your developers that you're not willing to spend on quality of life of your developers or the man that they you know come to the office because your code is super secret and stuff like that and so this post is on a page which is not in my RSS readers though I can't really put it into the block role and I don't really think the article would be worth covering without my without my rant and without me being this week focused on hiring in C plus plus um the pool of talented C plus plus developers is running right as they claim you know for that uh in finance it's impossible to find people with really high level of C plus plus skills with just exactly what every trading company wants well I I understand and it's always been that those folks are hard to find because they literally can choose to work for any employer they want okay they do not have a problem to find a job um unless there's some other problem with them um so there's a ton of people which want to join the industry and there's a ton of people you could educate and have exactly what you want within one or two years probably but you would have to invest on that that seems not to be what companies want in our industry which is sad um and they could run a grim um and they quote them about the state of C plus plus education in Germany and I assume that you know right now this yeah that's true but also they do not mention that Runner Grim runs a mentorship program for C plus plus table Lopez where you actually can fix your C plus plus education and there's many other sources like what I do uh to get you up to speed um but not everybody like you know is having also C plus plus as a hobby of theirs which we have to accept so to address this situation I have started two years ago an online job fair and the next Edition has three employers which are currently signed up and it was a like announced in October um so I do have the other problem that it seems not enough enough companies seem to be interested to actually you know get in contact have CVS mailed I have resumes shown to them have the visibility which meeting sequence plus can give them in the community um and also on the other hand I seem to more reach the C plus plus divs but then it seems that even if the C plus plus devs you know forward that to the HR person's the HR persons are not that interested and it's kind of for me hard to to reach out to those companies um I published some of the graphs which I get through this job fair there's a form where you uh upload your CV and I you know the first page um gives you a smaller profile and I can aggregate the data from those profiles like the chosen skills that's a multiple choice form where you just click what you're interested in and or what you know about C plus plus and yeah C plus plus 11 is the most popular or the most chosen one on this population of developers that have been looking for jobs last year and this year's graph is not much difference there's a bit more C plus 17 and you know things like cmake have been becoming more uh popular in this population one of the reasons for that is that cmake was not available in all the events last year to choose from um and then of course it's you know that people some people maximize on this so they choose a lot and some people choose only what they really specialize to know what they really really know well so that's kind of you know a bit of not data on the on the global Community but on the community which covers the uh deaths which are looking for jobs in the last year and the the data for this just similar and the the fields of work again um is an overview on the folks that came to submit over my platform and of course the companies which attend my events have a large influence on who shows up right if I have finance companies actually attending which I had in some cases but so like for this event we do not have sign ups from the finance uh world right now um and so sometimes they should they show up and it's like gaming last year was really down this year will be way more up because in the last event in October the beginning of October we had King King present and King is still listed on the phone for for the next few months and um so this is what what uh population I have been seeing through this form and again if you're looking for the experienced folks for 10 years and more I have those also submitting I have people like that um I cannot answer the question if that's exactly what you want if that's like the idea experience step that you want but on the other hand I have a lot of devs which you know um in a good employer environment can be trained and can be integrated in your teams and can do a good job um and we'll show you looking for entering the industry and for entering you know flowing through your pipeline and having an in-house hierarchy having an in-house road map for their career then you can retain those folks and you have another recurring problem because you can be keeping hiring from the from the pool of Junior deaths which there is you see they exist um so this is my blog post which is about in OEM that the industry may you know should get their things together and fix those things and stop complaining um there's actually you know organizations in our industry which like mine which try to you know help people with that and um there's a lot of C plus plus trainers as I mentioned in in this article which can help you with the training for your own developers and of course there is more demand than we have trainers Etc though for C plus plus Educators there's also a drug Market um and maybe you want to you know also kind of you know open a position for that you should have someone in your team if you have a large code base you should have at least one two people which have their training drop which which do you know specialize in training people for your job for your code base that's what you should have and I know a few companies which do and with that brings me back to this week's block role I don't want to rent too long about this um there's also some C plus related blog posts this year and this week and this is probably the last of the videos next week there will be a block roll but I probably don't have the time to make a video maybe I have let's see um and I mentioned the last time I wanted to include the videos these are the two videos uh Jason Turner made an interesting 20 minutes uh 90 topics videos which I still want to watch and then the video which I mentioned which is the presentation I gave on LinkedIn via live stream in this week to kind of you know let people know about um what meaning C plus plus does for hiring and what kind of Statistics I can present to you about that and with that um thank you and um I mentioned the I'm always strong parent that's going to be the next video on this channel looking forward to that
