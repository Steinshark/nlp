if Vim makes you faster then by the way you can see some I3 gaps is what this looks like or probably this might even be something that's like written in Haskell X monad or some nonsense let's find out what's going on here at the end of the day you have X monad you have Arch Linux you're going all the 10 000 yards to be the most amazing hacker of all time and boom you're programming in PHP so let's do this does we make you fast no is vim particularly good at customization no emacs this is emacs to learn it's not his blur as we make you look cool makes you look this way okay it looks fine I mean we can force it to look good now when is it that you look cool you look cool when the others like you okay so if you don't tell them you use Vim they discovered themselves and then you tell them do you want to try it I can show you a trick if you want to try typing on my computer this can make you look cool yes now if you like the social skills to begin with then we will not make you look cool to the others uh I think it does make you look cool okay um right guys can you type one in the chat if you think I'm cool because I use Vib you can just do that now you just type one just type one just type one in the chat okay I'm seeing a lot of not ones in there right now and I don't I don't think I like this okay hey first off stop typing one no one wants to see one okay maybe I mean Juan's a cool guy but still come on doesn't give you this doesn't give you that and doesn't give you that it will probably make you uncool it will probably make communication even harder with the others so why does it give you yeah what does it give you I will tell you what it gives you yes yes the problem is you don't care what wait that's not giving me anything that's my disposition the values that you don't believe in it saves you from a world that you may not have realized exists I genuinely hope this is an emacs I genuinely hope this is an Emax uh you know because I I obviously I'm a Vim Warrior I have a huge appreciation for the emacs uh the Emax priests cast you know like I get it uh we're different we're obviously very very different people I don't program and lisp right I'm not on that higher plane I'm in neovim kind of grunting it through you know able to just kind of just kind of Sucker Punch my way into into development so I get it we're different we have different functions in society I get it um please please be emacs what do you think of the intro well the idea of looking cool being fast fast well full of adrenaline oh yeah because adrenaline driven development is old man draw faster old man I can move my hands faster than that move faster whoa when are you already done how did you draw all of this with so little time this is what fast actually looks like it doesn't look full of adrenaline usually especially in context of expertise so when we're talking about speed we're talking about feeling fast and when we're talking about customization usually we don't mean hooking up Galactic and whatever this is definitely an emacs or you can it's happening it's happening right now I'm talking about customization will mean cosmetic stuff so we have this modern world where machines move your money around machines tell you where to look machines to tell you what to like what you should be like you spend four hours a day on a machine you talk to the machine and then you wonder where your free time went well your free time is five hours a day in four days went there so that's where your free time went machine theater time damn this is by the way was there a bird chirping in the background let's keep on going let's keep on going Tech Jesus this is fantastic all right keep going keep going and now you are our only hope you're the program I don't know how this relates to them but let's keep on going first we'll see you I'll say you're a programmer uh you're my savior because the one who can talk back to the machine through me you can roll them back false alarms I'm your knight I'm the one who saves you can I look at your monitor I want to see your problem I want you I want to see you save me yes you can look at my Mantra his looks at your monitor I want to see how you conquer all of these candy looking uis how do you win how do you defend yourself this is literally what happens to me every time someone has to do any form of pair programming I toss them some random IP address with some credentials and say meet me in tmux in them and if they can't even answer that they don't even get to be a part of my little Society okay if you don't even know how to attach slash jump in you know you don't you don't know what you're doing if I say hey can you can you can you toss the global market and you say what terminate your credentials terminate your session get the hell out of here you don't know you don't know you're not allowed to be a part of this from the machine the way that I couldn't and he looks at your machine you can't defend against the machine in fact your monitor looks like the website his visits it looks like Instagram you have you already thought which looks like some social media app with pop-ups and rounded corners and everything looks like candy and it doesn't give up a very professional feel it definitely doesn't give a savior feel it doesn't give an engineer feel and I want to show you this okay I'm not going to talk you through exactly what I'm doing but I'm going to tell you this is VI compatible in VI you don't have file trees if you want to go to a file instead of a fighter you use what you have already so let me move this out of the way I hope you can still hear me there's no guarantee so he's using neovim by the way the over deal of him by the way neovim but this just went completely in a direction I did not see coming I thought it was going by but it turns out it went or I thought it was going Emax but it turns out it went VI I did not see this I did not see this this this one coming I this is a Twist like we we covered social media addictions we've covered looking cool we've covered everything and then boom one of the standard Unix like commands is find five star does this yeah what am I really well there's any of them you can go bang bang LS well Bang Bang fine star and importantly I can take this okay in the Azure could go plus five bank and we can put it in a command oh nice with the plus five no way that is really good and so I actually do I actually have something for that exact thing I use this I I actually use this surprisingly a lot I will do things like uh over my selected range so here let's uh let's see here we go I'll get something real nice where am I I'm in the man I have way too many things let's go like this let's cut out our package.json I'm gonna put it uh into xsc there we go so now I have this thing right here this is our package I just on right looks good huh huh huh all right so let's take that thing let's pipe it into JQ first and then go to xsc so whoopsies that I believe that still is like that yep let's go into uh Dash C for compact there we go for those that can't see it put a little uh Dash c in there okay so now that I have that I have this thing I often will highlight this thing and then hit him with the bang and do it just hit him with the JQ look at that look how cool that little thing is how great is that little little JQ in right if you're not Jake quellin what are you doing you need Jesus so I I love I love what he's talking about actually this is super cool stuff the way you open the file in VI is this way edit edit temporary a I've already used it let me delete and this is the fifth stack at this point I don't care what fine start type file oh this is gonna be the standard input command oh that is so brilliant shell the southern output the output of the find command will be given to the shop the shell because the shell is going to make it its own standard output so here I'm going to see here we're going to see the standard output of the shell he's still using the oven by the way standard sale now you can GF you can hit him with that girlfriend I know a lot of you are users don't have that but you can definitely make okay I need to show you something else as well so this is k k k k k k all right laughing in uh Brazilian by the way if you're wondering that's laughing in Brazilian if you didn't know that I'll save it in the register called the you can see down there the keys I press foreign because KKK does this okay so I'm going to do basically that I'm going to transform you know how I did this edit edit and file name I'm going to transform this line into a macro I'm going to execute it can we appreciate how early this feels like we would not make something like that you and I this was made by engineers whoever made you know I'm not okay okay well I know GF I know I know girlfriend um what just happened he used okay so he he deleted a line okay so what just happened here is that when when you do something right so if oh my goodness okay I see it's just happening I'm laughing like Brazilians here so when I go like this quote and then I type in he he used T I have now said put whatever I'm about to do into register t a register is just a key value bucket right I have a bucket named T so when I press y i yanked it now if I go like this reg and I look all the way down to T you'll see console line blah blah blah blah you can see what I just put it's right there it's in my it's in my little register area so now if I go quotes t p I'll just paste from my register T so what he did is he actually did macro t he played what was in the register as the macro and so by doing that by doing something like uh here what's the file in here uh let's go to server okay there we go so if I went like this e back back uh server took that and went quotes t d d at T it went it edited backpack server interesting right now obviously the problem is that my my current working directory is already at the base so this actually just went somewhere else right so that's what he's doing I just totally screwed up everything so don't don't worry about that but nonetheless I mean it's clever what he's doing this is super clever but you know I I personally I just prefer to press uh like Ctrl P or control PF if I'm doing something without any sort of get ignore in there and just like you know selecting out a file you know I'm more of a fuzzy find kind of person than I am uh like but okay to be fair there was something about that that was super cool can we all agree that if you had to go on a server and you had to go edit some stuff the fact that you can actually do that like I never even thought about that go like this like hitting with a find dot taking this and just uh dot bang um wait is that what he did is that what he did dot bang what what did he do oh man I don't even know how he did that uh can I just I don't even know how I don't even know how he took this and executed it in there without using some sort of like register uh T yank uh hold on with alcohol and dopang doing this thing taking that going a quotes t uh yank ing that thing and then hitting it with a what is it ATI unknown token type yeah see I don't even know what I'm doing I don't even know what I'm doing but I do like that idea where you can go like this uh find here you'll get everything right there I do like that there's something kind of cool about that there's something cool about the idea of being able to do uh find dot take that and execute it can you not execute it oh man I don't even know how to execute this thing see I don't even know how he did it I don't even know how he did it but it was brilliant bang bang to exec the current line oh Bang Bang uh so you go like this so you go find Dot and go wait hold on I did bang bang and then it did this and then we get that oh oh I can hear my computer heating up oh no oh no oh no t-box kill server okay I I just I like literally just Fork bombed myself okay whoa whoa whoa slow down slow down okay I'm not a don't put me on don't put me on a server peace must look like an engineer with a hat I'm not an engineer but this is cool like I guess I've never played with a lot of this stuff I understand half of it but not the other half but there is not our DNA in bi this is not VI this is newvin do I do this fine command thing not exactly I don't do it for file trees I do it if I want to put a bunch of file names inside of quotes inside of parameters yes I'll look it then I also May search for a file if I'm not sure it exists I can search it this way can we agree he has beautiful hair doesn't even use his own diet he does not use his own idea but I I actually want to learn about how I did some of those tricks because there is something super cool about being able to go uh I don't even remember where I was at JavaScript performance all right uh Vim here we go uh let's just go to out and make this a little bit safer and go can I just go find Dot how do I get that in here all right there we go so I got it all in here there is something about this that is kind of interesting because you can do a uh Source slash this and then hit him with the girlfriend right so if I was on you know if I was on uh hey whoa whoa uh the irony of being in a JavaScript performance repo when watching this video okay I mean to be fair he's in a PHP repo okay at the end of the day maybe we've slightly over engineered our setup for what we're actually doing maybe his hair is nicer than mine I would like to say that my hair is really nice too look at that look at that nice hair I'd say that I have beautiful hair I just keep it a little bit shorter okay I keep it a little shorter and we do have our DNA in neovine plugins not copia plugins for any of them may absolutely look like oh you're struck his hair rounded Corners flashy stuff pop-ups candy-like colors all of that but the eye gives you what you need to eat it gives so why doesn't they use VI you know what I mean why doesn't he use VI you as an attrition you need as a programmer people have frustrated you over them then screw it you may go for something else that gives you the same nutrition stop asking me about by the way if someone has frustrated if you overbeam the solution is not to use him the solution is not to not use wind meter you need to talk to the person that's the only solution you cannot solve this problem by using or not using Vim what do you gain by doing this complicated well can we take a moment to appreciate is this a live stream I wonder if this is a live stream I just did with the fine command not cool not fast not efficient it's cultivating it turns you into the one that the people need helps you remember that you rule the machine to help the people you don't help the machine to rule the people you don't ask the machine what it wants from you you talk to the machine you and the Machine work together it's hard to learn you are a programmer I believe in you I I understand it's hard we under pressure we want to make money people tell us what to do we are thrown into this environment that nobody knows how to code we are being thrown around we're being told what to do we feel very prescient all the time to go faster because we have to go fast because we think we have to go fast we don't mature Dragon lie to you that's actually a really insightful phrase right there that's a really insightful phrase which is sometimes we're so focused on finishing the race we didn't take time to learn what we needed to learn I think a lot of times people want to just get you know this is really what this is like the Silver Bullet answer right just how do I do X well the problem isn't how do I do X the problem is is that you don't understand X fundamentally and therefore doing X is really really hard you know if someone says hey can you just start a quick HTTP server like I know what that means you know like I know what that means I could even program from TCP a really stupid basic HTTP server and so it's like there's a level of fundamentals that is really good to understand because it just makes the rest of life more simple you know what I mean it just makes some things easier to just kind of get I haven't started to work yet so I better not talk about that so I'm not saying it's the best it doesn't serve you at all points but I like I like the point see what they say I like the point where he's like he's using these Corey utils to like drive his machine and maybe it's not something you want to always do right use control p I see myself taking a day and maybe using a bit more of this and seeing what can I do to become better right what can I do to go faster what can I do to like do something pretty cool with this so I I like I actually really like what he has to say about that now maybe his delivery isn't for you whatever blah blah blah blah but there's actually a lot of wisdom in this moment which is use control P use whatever but take a bit of time to understand how everything works take a little bit time to just learn to learn how to use the tool like right I I might have almost just Fork bombed myself in some sense but you know we still did it we still got it done um it was interesting yeah be the unit's Philosophy for a day or two what you need is what you need facts it's an arguable statement if you came here to the piano that's my sister by the way she's downstairs playing the piano this whole time I thought it was background music and it's literally his sister serenading us the man has live birds chirping in the background live classical piano making your day better I mean this guy truly this this man lives a Chad lifestyle I I don't even I don't even know I don't even comprehend if your positions make this version over long so far the first take was the best but it was naked naked I don't think there is a way to tell and how long the video was dragged on for have a slight hole wait hold on is Hebrew he's recording everything via FFM Peg is that what we're seeing right now should you drive him screw that you should try to be a good person I think [Music] is that hand repent and thou shalt use them let's go so I wish you a good journey I'm not sure this is a good industry to grow whopping I'll try my best myself be someone people can trust and rely on because I need someone to you know tell the machine what to do sometimes you can't just tell us what to do so that's it okay I did shut up shut up oh my goodness that thing started usually gives you like a countdown or something okay first off great video okay a lot of Bobs honestly this guy this this actually you know I think we don't have enough of these kind of videos on YouTube everything is very very polished everything is very very like intense about YouTube everything is very like set in a certain way you do a certain type of edits everything is super super fast there are no mistakes there are no long pauses there are no just waiting for someone to do you know for someone to think through a thought instead it's all just like immediate but instead this is like a long thought kind of process and even though I don't really like like I don't like what he had to say on a part of it but there's something about this that actually was really good and so I want to appreciate this right I want you to appreciate this I want you to take a moment and appreciate it even the box art is just straight up straight up not even great at all but yet it's fantastic it's beautiful thank you Theodore dude oh my goodness is whoa wait a second is there something about people named Theo and having like hair is there something about the word Theo and hair that somehow goes together in a way we cannot understand I just want to ask this I just want to observe that we are seeing a trend okay I know correlation does not equal causation but if you look hard enough it might the name is good people end up using them
