of all companies Lenovo has just announced the most powerful Android phone in the world this is the Zed 5 pro GT and it's already got the next generation Snapdragon 85 chip 12 gigabytes of RAM the most we've ever seen on a phone and a screen that pretty much fills the front and to be clear unlike the original Zed 5 that was a complete letdown this is real this is the final phone that people have actually had hands-on time with it looks kind of like the 1 plus 60 McLaren Edition on drugs and svet 4 spec if we measured this up against competing firms like the note 9 or the mate 20 pro you'd think it would be $1,000 maybe even $1,200 but right at the end of the event Lenovo dropped a bit of a bomb on us they said that the price is not going to go higher than the equivalent of six hundred and forty dollars so what's the catch first of all it is huge a combination of the design with this sliding mechanism has made this phone let's just say bigger than it should be it's got a smaller display and battery but at the same time is somehow thicker and heavier than the Galaxy Note 9 and already that's not exactly a very palatable device also whilst it looks great in renders I actually think in person at the back of the phone looks remarkably mid-range the cameras look almost clumsy instead of elegant but then we've got the fact that it takes all the standard shortcuts most of the things that don't normally show up on a spec sheet just are there there's no water resistance headphone jack micro SD card slot or support for wireless charging it's USB C port also only supports USB 2.0 speeds compared to the more expensive phones that tend to have USB 3.1 for more bandwidth but I am glad that they've added an infrared face unlocking on the front ok let's talk about the RAM the top-tier version of the Zed 5 pro GT has the 12 gigabytes of RAM which is great but also I think it's there for the wrong reasons I think lenovo wants people to look at this figure and just assume their phone will be twice as powerful as someone's current six gigabyte ROM device but that's not the case brand prices right now are lower than they've been in a war and so piling on 12 gigabytes into this phone is not the most expensive move but here's the thing on Android right now you will struggle to use even 6 gigabytes you could argue that having 12 gigabytes is going to help to future-proof the phone but the problem is that by the time Android can properly take advantage of that amount of RAM the rest of the hardware and software knowing lenovo's update cycle is going to be out of date extra RAM isn't exactly gonna hurt the phone but at the same time it's just a little annoying that it's being used as a hype tool as opposed to something that will actually increase performance then we've got the fact that the camera sucks probably because as the name suggests the Zed 5 Pro GT is a souped up version of the Zed 5 Pro and when it comes to camera ass not good news when I briefly tested the Zed 5 Pro I had real trouble focusing photos were bland and the night mode was a bit of a joke in terms of video it lacks not just optical image stabilization but electronic too so the second you start walking it is shaking all over the place in fact there are $300 phones with better camera setups now I say that the camera sucks probably because this phone is coming with a more advanced chipset which does contain potential improvements for the camera but given how early this phone's releasing and given lenovo's past record they probably won't take advantage of these benefits and then we've got conversion rates you see the problem with these Chinese phones is that when they're sold in other countries due to a combination of tax and also consumers that are just willing to pay more these phones end up costing more for example xiaomi's mimics 2s when you convert the chinese price it comes to 370 pounds in the UK and yet the actual end retail price over here is 519 so if we did the same calculation with this 640 dollar figure we have I reckon you won't actually be able to buy it from a physical store at less than $800 now I know the angle of this video sounds pretty negative but I do want to emphasize I'm actually excited about this phone but the point of the video is to be cautiously optimistic not blindly optimistic it does have an in display fingerprint scan up to 512 gigabytes of storage which is huge and the Super AMOLED screen looks good comparable to a oneplus phone and don't forget this is a display that fills the front of the phone made possible by this addictive sliding mechanisms the battery is a little on the small side at 3350 milliamp hours but at the same time this is somewhat counteracted by the father you've got a next generation more efficient seven nanometer chip so with all of this in mind what do you think it's easy to be initially blown away by this one and I'd say I was but when you dive a little deeper it's not all sunshine and rainbows but considering that it does come out as early as this January it's going to be one of the most powerful phones on the market and that does count for something alright guys thanks a lot for watching and if you enjoyed the video it would mean a lot to me if you could smash that subscribe button down below my name is Aaron this isn't Stu his boss I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
