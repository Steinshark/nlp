wizard asks can you tell the tale of hedgy sure so edgy is a stuffed hedgehog stuffed animal maybe let me show him first that made an appearance and I mentioned on the episode with simon Sinek and he's been making an appearance in a couple that i've already recorded haven't released yet maybe let me put him on a on a throne of plastic which is what all the great kings sit on there you go so I decided to include him on the video shot in the podcast because some people mentioned that I have a very boring scene usually and it's nice to add some some flavor I don't really own much stuff at all to add much flavorful stuff to add to the scene but happens to be one of the things I own some but the reason I wanted to do this as an AMA is I think there is some interesting lessons in it I haven't attempted to articulate yet that I was hoping to explore a little bit to see if there's something valuable there because I think this this this stuffed Hedgehog is somehow a reflection of my personality and the way I approach life that may have some flaws in it but maybe has some lessons for others that might be inspiring or a serve as an example of what to avoid so first the story of how how I got to own this stuffed Hedgehog I found him at a thrift store many years ago now I was at the sister store and there's this kind of box of stuffed toys maybe kids that have grown up and then given up on their childhood heroes in the form of stuffed animals I don't know but it was just like a bunch of like Barbies and and bunnies and stuffed bears and they all have thing about stuffed animals now I don't want to generalize but allow me the stuffed animals I've seen I always have this kind of dumb smile on their face this kind of vapid empty look on their face like like please love me even though I feel dead inside but I'm gonna keep smiling so you get to buy me and keep me now all of this obviously is anthropomorphize ation of objects they're not actually alive but and I'm being mostly humorous with this discussion but there's little kernels of truth in it I think to me most stuffed animals were kind of at least in my imagination if I kind of have this dumb vapid look on their face of shallow happiness and the reason this Hedgehog jumped out at me from this bin is he had this like deep almost menacing but really like a profound seriousness about him that he was disturbed both disturbed about the way the world is and deep and thought about how to fix it I mean that's how I felt that look he came out to me almost like a like a mix of the you know I think I myself of like Prince Myshkin from the sea of skis they D it and I think of hedgy here as the main character I don't think he is a name but the main character from notes from the underground by Dostoevsky basically this bitter brooding character and so I don't know there's an immediate connection that symbolized something to me so I knew I had to get him I I think there is this connection and I think you experienced that connection people sometimes and with things with ideas with books they it just jumps out at you as something profoundly unique I also think that there's layers of humor and absurdity about first of all the idea of this Hedgehog and the brooding Dostoevsky character amidst the sea of shallow smiling stuffed animals and the fact that I own very few things and gave away most things I own a couple of times in my life and the one thing that survived through all of that is a stuffed animal from a thrift store that seems to be pissed off at life so I think this just makes me smile the absurdity of it all and that's why he's you knows hopefully until like the building burns down or something he'll be a lifelong companion I wanted to use this opportunity using hedgy here as a chance to talk about three related things one is minimalism stoicism which is very much a part of my life of how I approach life the second is on the robotics side it may be just interesting psychological phenomenon of anthropomorphize a ssin that i think is fascinating and finally friendship so on the idea of minimalism I gave away most things I owned a couple of times in my life so just down to a few clothes jeans shirts underwear socks a pair of shoes in this most recent time also a couple of suits stretch shirts and ties and a laptop now there's probably way too much to talk about there and mostly I think it's probably not interesting to people but I did want to mention or try to describe my thinking around these steps and why I did it and what kind of lessons I learned I think so I think there's something extremely powerful when you sit in a room and it's as barren it's empty and there's something about that experience that puts you face-to-face with your own mortality and the reality that nothing lasts forever there's something about material possessions that allows you to live in an illusion that you can actually own things that that there's a kind of infinity to your existence because you can own things and thereby hold on to them the idea that you can own things it's probably a hopeful chance to escape our own mortality or at least escape having to come face-to-face with it often enough and also a chance to lose yourself in the acquisition of more and more material possessions I mean I can wax poetically about what down-sized material possessions have I don't know maybe it's just a bunch of psychology but the reality is when you're sitting in a room alone and you gave away almost everything and it's just you you get to really be alone with yourself in the way that I think the best of meditation aspires to is removing all the thoughts all the distractions of the world and really just being I think material possessions have that same just like thoughts can fill up your head and for most distractions or social media or the internet and digital communication in general can be distractions in the same way possessions can be distractions to your mind and that empty room does wonders I mean it's such an exceptionally powerful thing the other thing I did and it coincided with moments in my life where it was a big transition step I think giving away stuff gives you the kind of freedom it liberates you intellectually physically to take big bold risks I think I often hear this kind of statement especially when people have a family and kids or this other or they have mortgages or they have responsibilities like quote-unquote adult responsibilities they say well it must be nice for you to be able to take this big risk or take this take on this big challenge but I don't have that freedom and I think I am very cognizant of the fact that we use these very real constraints as excuses on ourselves to hold ourselves back now they're real to me like having a family having kids or having a mortgage is a superpower that shouldn't that puts a fire under you that when you take the big risks that you better succeed I that's a beautiful fire instead a lot of people I feel use that as an excuse not to take the big risks and in the same way material possessions may hold you back from taking a wild journey of moving of taking the whole new career you know it kind of weighs you down it slows you down in the in the in the aggressiveness and the size of the leaps you take so for me giving way stuff was a kind of catalyst to say I'm gonna take this big step and I'm going to take in the biggest boldest way possible on the practical side I was surprised how difficult it was to actually give away stuff how painful it was how even though you haven't used something for years you think well you immediately when coming face-to-face with a thing you think like well that's an awesome thing why don't I want to keep it in my life well the reality is that life is short and we can't do all of the things so when you come face-to-face with a thing in your life that you haven't actually given any attention to for a long time that shouldn't be a burden there shouldn't be a thing that weighs on you that you want to hold on to the step of allowing yourself to realize that damnit like life is finite that here's a book for example or a board game that I will most likely never get to again like allowing yourself to realize that and let go of that and feel the pain of it because it's ultimately coming face-to-face with your mortality that life ends there's not enough time for all of the things that's what giving away stuff is that's what that exercise is that's why it's painful if you're being honest that's why it's painful and and actually going through with it is is really liberating the other thing I want to mention is it's kind of funny I don't have a particular connection with stuffed animals of any kind so it's funny I have this stuffed hedgehog in my life he does represent another interesting thing that is more serious in my robotics work which is anthropomorphize ation you might think as a process of downsizing of giving away stuff that I would get rid of a stuffed animal and I very much wanted to but there's a kind of funny fact that he has set aimlessly on my computer desk for many years you know I didn't give him any attention but he kind of saw a lot of the experiences that I've been through all the struggles all the all the all-nighters writing papers the coffee programming all the people who were in my life isn't he's we like silly to say it's not like it's not like I talked to a stuffed animal right but you know or think about him at all but we shared a set of experiences so when I looked at this particular stuffed animal he doesn't just represent a stuffed animal he represents a set of experiences that we were both in the room for this might be kind of silly to describe but that there's something there and I think that's a really powerful idea that's a really powerful idea of shared experiences it's it's true for it's true for human to human interaction to I you know some of my close friends are people like it doesn't really make sense that we're friends but I think what makes us friends is the experiences we've been through that's what makes great relationships - I think there's different flavors of love I think one sort of like romantic love one is that there's the spark in the beginning the the magic that kind of clouds all your thinking all of that but then there's the the love that develops through a bunch of shared experiences and especially difficult ones struggle loss trouble of any kind I mean hardship there's something in experiencing hardship together that brings us humans clothes I don't know that it's kind of interesting that the depths of relationship is formed not in some kind of mathematical compatibility that we like the same books or we like the same ideas or we had the same upbringing but in all those things might help I don't know but the deepest glue the strongest glue I should say is in the things we've experienced together there's something in that that that I would the the fact that I would have a silly stuffed animal still with me through all of that downsizing I mean I gave away a lot of really valuable stuff and a stupid stuffed animal sorry man has survived all that it's interesting and speaks to the the bond form to sharing experiences I'll probably elaborate on that in technical ways and in the robotics AI work that I'm doing I think it's really interesting set of ideas there but I thought it's just fun this whole video is pretty fun and absurd really I just wanted to do something different I like being silly on occasion to kind of lighten things up it does bring up the idea of friendships and relationships in general that I'll probably discuss in detail at another time maybe not I don't know and certainly something I think about its I do think it's a interesting contradiction that given how much I value friendship love relationships romantic relationship family that don't have I'm not in a relationship and I don't have a family I think about that quite a quite a lot that all the passions that are in my life may be somehow interfering with my little it's probably just time but interfering with the opportunities before me to meet others to have the magical moments of connection it's interesting it's a tragic in a kind of the old Russian melancholy way that perhaps makes for better poetry and better music but there's still time so I am a part of an amazing community of positive people that I just love love talking to love interacting with I love the work I'm doing I love interacting with people with through the medium of like videos like this a podcast and so on my life truly is amazing I'm deeply grateful for all elements of it so there's zero complaint here and I'm not sure if hedgy is a conscious creature like if there's consciousness according Pan psychism there's consciousness and everything so he is in fact conscious under that definition but I think if we're being honest then we look at notes from underground by just es key the main character there now he comes off as bitter but I think he's actually deeply appreciative of life to him that bitterness is beauty that's his mechanism by which he discovers the beauty of life and that's where conscious or not I believe hedgy resides so he is deeply appreciative of life as well so thank you for watching and listening to this most absurd of a maze but I want to give you a little look into my minimalist existence a part of which is the stuffed Hedgehog thanks very much see you later you
