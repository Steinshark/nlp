[Music] [Music] hey what's up guys mkbhd here and these are the powerbeats pro that's right i'm reviewing beats so you may have seen or heard about these in various ads like the one you just watched and i do gotta say even though everyone in that actual commercial was technically a professional athlete i still think the word pro is overused in products like why are these the powerbeats pro but that's a rant for another day at the end of the day these are just headphones so when i started using these i just wanted to know how good of headphones are they and are they worth the money because they are 250 so they better be good then again they are beats now it turns out spoiler they are pretty great i still think they're overpriced but as wireless earbuds they're pretty great so you can think of these as air pods but if apple actually cared about them staying in people's ears so easily my favorite part about these powerbeats pro is how they're built like i've never been a huge earbuds kind of guy but for working out and for moving around and things like that you have to have something lightweight so that's when i prefer earbuds and they just gotta stay in my ears and be comfortable air pods never really fit in my ears i wasn't as lucky as a lot of you guys but there are two main differences with these versus air pods that actually keep them in my ear so number one similar to jaybirds i've had in the past these have a soft touch replaceable ear tip that you can put different sizes on so instead of having just hard plastic one size fits all these are soft touch and they fit pretty well and then number two this piece that goes basically over and around your ear and then holds it snugly to hold the earbuds in and these i mean you can either get the kind that go into the ear up here or over and around i actually really like these the first pair of earbuds i ever really used a lot in high school also had these and they're they're not coming off so just generally i like the design i got the black ones so they're all matte black plastic sweatproof of course and the clamp force while it is snug it isn't too tight uh and the sign of any good pair of headphones is that you can wear them for a long time and after a while you just kind of forget you're wearing them that's good okay they also differ from airpods in a couple of not so great ways the first one being this case it maybe looks like a small case which is me holding it in my hand but this is a huge case i mean i guess i do love that they include a matte black protective hard shell case with them with built-in battery and charging there's a little light on the outside of the case and there's a pair button on the inside that's all great but this actually makes me really appreciate the air pods and their super small wireless charging case of course airpods are smaller but the airpods case is actually pocketable easily the beats case just is not so that's kind of a big deal sometimes if you're you know walking around and you just don't have a bag if you have a gym bag you can toss it in there but if you don't this is not great in the pocket and then the case only charges via lightning so no usb type c and no wireless charging so even with all this space and even putting them actually in the case was this motion that for some reason i never quite got used to obviously airpods you just drop it in there and there's magnets and it's super easy these have magnets too and you can see the pins but it's not quite as smooth you have to get the angle just right i don't know maybe that's just me but then the best difference with these versus air pods is the actual bud so number one they actually do sound better yeah you know they're a little bit bass heavy but i mean come on what'd you expect they're beats i'm not looking for a flat sound signature here they're fun good sounding headphones the seal that you can create with the rubber tip in your ear plus the clamp force on the side and them not coming out they're a rich good sounding pair of headphones but then number two the actual physical buttons on them there's no touch points there's real buttons so on the right ear the beats logo is a button and that can be your play pause of course double tap for the next song triple tap for the previous and on top of each earbud is a volume rocker so this is better than voice control better than the swiping across panels of the sides of headphones it's just simple and easy regular volume rocker not over engineered love it of course if you still want to use voice control you can they have the h1 chip so you can do a little hey siri action if you have an iphone and they'll still respond to that sorry for triggering anyone's homepod if anyone still has homepods out there but anyway that brings us to the couple of ways that these are similar to airpods by the way i'm comparing these to airpods because well apple bought beats so beats are apple headphones now but also because they're just the most popular headphones everyone has so there's that so the powerbeats pro have the h1 chip in them which means they do that sweet instant pairing with an iphone or just regular bluetooth pairing with any android phone just like airpods and there's also auto play pause when you take them out your ears and put them back in they'll also do the siri voice command if you're into that or if you're on an android phone you can long press the beats logo to trigger google assistant or whatever assistant you use and then the battery life is just as good so thankfully eight plus hours of playback easily it has automatic standby if you put them down when they're not in the case they can go for me like a week without charging if i start with a full battery and a full case and on top of that there is fast charging so if they're dead you can drop them in the case for like five minutes and it gets you over an hour of listen time so that's pretty clutch so airpods 2 are already pretty expensive at 160 bucks but like i said these are 250 dollars for a pair of powerbeats pro so while they are better than airpods yes especially for someone like me i still don't know if i can say they're worth 250 dollars i guess if you absolutely must have the completely wireless you know no wire between the buds then you know i guess that makes sense these are some of the best ones especially if you're an athlete if you need them to be sweatproof you need them to stay in your ears while you move around a lot you need workout headphones i wouldn't blame you if you got these you'll probably be very happy with them but just because these are so expensive i feel like you can easily recommend something i've used in the past the jaybird x4s they do have a wire between them but they're super lightweight great battery life sweat proof they stay in my ears just fine and they're somewhere around like 100 110 bucks so i'll leave links to the alternative stuff that i'm talking about right below the like button as well as links to the beats but i think the price is the only thing holding these back overall the stamp of apple is very evident on the powerbeats pro from the h1 chip to their very high price tag but overall there's not much negative there's not much bad to say about these so i'll give them credit for that they actually made a good pair of headphones um and they live up to the ads so that's that's good too no regrets i think i just recommended a pair of beats on video thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
