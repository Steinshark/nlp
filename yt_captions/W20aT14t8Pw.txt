Self locating strings are to do with
decimal places of irrational numbers so we need a number with an infinitely long
decimal expansion that is irrational of course
so we're basically gonna do PI you probably guess we're going with pi
so these are the first few digits of the decimal expansion of pi and what we want
to do for these self locating strings is to label each position after the decimal
point so we're going to start with the the first number so this is the first
position the second position the third and then the question you ask yourself
to find the self locating string is you want the number to match its position in
the decimal expansion so here we've got our first one straight away the very
first digit number one is in the first place so that would be our first self
locating string and then what we want to do is continue along through the numbers
and see if we can find any others of course the expansion is infinite so
we're going to hope that there should be some more so if the second number there
had been a two that will work as well whether it's a four or so exactly so if
this is a this would need to be a two this would need to be a three four five
six seven so none of these work yet and the other thing is once we of course get
to double digit or triple digit positions if we were for example
considering the twelfth number of the decimal expansion we would need the 12th
position to be a 1 and in next to it the 2 so you actually would need a 1 in the
12th position and a 2 in the 13th position if you think about that a
little bit you're probably that sort of most common near the beginning when you
just have one number that needs to be in one fixed position and then when you get
to two digit 3 digit 4 digit you have several requirements that need to happen
in a row so your probability gets smaller so for position 1 million you
would need position 1 million to be a 1 and then the next six positions after
that to all be 0 exactly so that's very very unlikely let's be honest right
compared to just having let's say you know a 7 at position 7 or something if
the numbers are truly random which is generally what we assumed in the
expansion of pi they each one appears approximately equal probability
if that is indeed true then you know you're gonna see or expect to see more
of the lower down self occasion digits compared to the higher up ones further
along we've got a first one to a good start so what we now need to do is I
need to write out more digits of pi so I'm gonna have to load this up I'll be
honest that that's about as good as it gets for me as I'm doing pi what people
want for seven decimal places you know you don't really need more than seven
decimal places 100 there we go the first 100 digits of pi that was painful we've
got our first self locating string here at position 1 and what we can now do is
continue to look through these numbers and we're not even doing this I can
already tell you there aren't any more the next ones are really really far away
so after one right at the very first digit we get ourselves a casing string
it's super exciting we think they're gonna be really common they're not the
next one is at sixteen thousand four hundred and seventy so I'm definitely
not writing out 16,000 digits of pi back that's that's a job for the viewer and
then after that we then jump up to forty four thousand eight hundred and ninety
nine then we go up to the big one at 79 million eight hundred and seventy three
thousand eight hundred and eighty four so that's our first one in the very
first position then we go to our second one at sixteen thousand the third one
forty four thousand and then the fourth self locating string at 79 million (Tom
would you guess that there are an infinite number of these) I'm
inclined to say yes with with the idea being that pi is an infinite string of
decimals and you you might expect that because it's infinite you would hope
that every string of numbers should be in there at some point but then you've
got this extra condition that not only does the number have to appear to appear
in a certain place so that's why these are quite rare it's a difficult question
for sure it's a good question all right there's another way to look at this
there is indeed so and this is the reason why I did write
the first 100 so I'm gonna take a different color because you may have
wondered why I labeled the first position here the one as as index one
because you could also of course completely you know it could be
completely valid to label this as zero so if we call this now the zeroth spot
and then this one the first and the second and of course we continue in the
same way we now have a slightly different index we're going to 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 bingo so we've got our first one now at the
6th position indexing from 0 and then if we carry on 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 so there's a 2 in position 20 but then there's a 6 so it doesn't
work 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 we have a 2 and then we've got a 7 so we've actually
found our second self locating string in positions 27 or 28 we've got 6 we've got
27 and then we jump up to a number kind of near sixteen thousand thirteen
thousand five hundred and ninety eight is our next third self locating string
so it's not too far away from the 16,000 on index well then we go up to forty
three thousand six hundred and eleven again maybe it's a coincidence maybe
it's not but it's quite similar to what we saw before and then finally this one
is is less close but at least has the same number of digits we get 24 million
six hundred forty three thousand five hundred and ten and that is the final
that's going to be what five so we actually have one more self locating
string in the first 100 million digits of pi when doing it indexing zero so as
I said there isn't a convention between index 0 or 1 but we're gonna now stick
with index 1 from now on just just to be clear and that perhaps more interesting
question about these it's super cool finding them and you should totally go
away and try find your own but the other interesting thing you can do is ask the
question of do these things loop back around on themselves so what I mean by
that is if I pick starting point for example 169 that
suppose it's my favorite number well actually let's suppose it's the favorite
number of Dan Sikorsky who is the guy found this out so this is Dan's favorite
number and what we do is we then look for where where does the number 169
appear in the decimal expansion of PI and we should be able to spot it there
it is 169 is down here and because I did this earlier this is going to come in at
position 40 starting here so the number 169 so we've got 48th 41st 42nd appears
in position 40 so now you say we started with 169 and that is sort of taken us to
position 40 in the expansion so then you say well now where does 40 appear in the
expansion of pi so we're going to try and create some kind of pathway through
this infinite decimal expansion I mentioned 40 appears all over the place
exactly so we're gonna look for the first occurrence of 40 that's sort of
this the lowest down one that's the idea so 40 is going to appear at the 70th
position so the fours are 70 and the zeros are 71 so we started at 169 40th
position we looked for 40 that's taking us to the 70th position so now we look
for 70 that's the idea so 70 is coming in right now on the bottom and this is
why I wrote out a hundred digits so 70 is down here in position 96 is the
starting number so we've gone 169 244 72 96 and now we're going to look for 96
and we're going to carry on and we're going to see where we end up so 96 is
going to take us miles away to 180 then we go this is a pretty long route we
then go through 3664 then we look for that number which appears in the 24,000
717 position then we go to 15,000 492 then we go 84,000 198 so I think this is
the highest point of our path that descend into the madness of the decimal
expansion of pi so that then goes back down to 65 4 8 9 3 7 2 5 there is a
point to this I promise then we get to 16 9 7 441 702 3 7 8 8 5 7 5 7 1958 14
six oh nine six two eight nine two forty four seven four five and then we go to
nine three eight five and finally we get one six nine again so we loop back round
to 169 which appears in the fortieth position so the mathematical question
here is given any random starting number that we just choose have any number of
digits do we always get a loop that's the the mathematical so it seems
like a bit of fun but there's like a really deep mathematical question into
this do you always get this loop that's going to happen given any starting
number will you always find a loop the loop can be of any length it could be
very short it could be quite long it could but you know as long as it's not
infinite length then you would loop back around and we have no clue as far as I'm
aware this is just a sort of puzzling question and but there is one thing that
we can say which is that not every number will have an infinite loop
because this is where we come back to the self locating strings and my new
favorite thing at the moment because if you end up at a self locating string so
if you somehow come across one or sixteen thousand four hundred and
seventy you don't move because one is in position 1 so you get to one and then
you just loop back around or you get to 16 thousand 470 and loop back around so
they're like dead ends or they're basically dead ends so that's our the
self locating strings stop these loops from happening and I do have an example
of one loop which which terminates at one if we start at 211 so a random
starting number this appears actually back in here at position here two one
and then one down here so annoyingly over two lines but we've got a number
here 211 and this is at position 93 this one here the 93rd position so we go 211
to 93 where does 93 appear 93 but there's an earlier one
hey there's good so you always go to the earliest this is the the it's just a
rule you it's an arbitrary rule and you could change the rules but for purpose
of our loops we're going to the first appearance of that number so you're
completely correct but this is going to be the one and this is at position
fourteen and now where does fourteen appear in PI I think you know this one
Brady may be right at the beginning so fourteen is in position one so we've
gone 211 293 to 14 and then we've gone to one and then
we just loop back around forever and we're stuck at one so one our self
locating string here is the dead end you either have this big loop that goes
or you know some size of loop where you just keep going round around in circles
you either reach your dead end as you called it the self locating string which
just circles back to itself forever or can we find a path and there's again far
as I'm aware no one has found such a path where you just keep going forever
and ever and ever as far as I'm aware there's no point to this this is I said
I found this on the PI search page it's recreational maths but then it does lead
to quite a deep question the patterns of numbers within the
expansion of pi so whilst even if we were able to answer that question it
probably wouldn't tell us much about PI itself but the the methods and the
techniques you're going to use to do such a proof are going to probably be
brand new and lead to all kinds of other awesome stuff it's like the classic case
of you know trying to climb a particular peak there's not really that much at the
peak but it's everything all the other Peaks you scale to get to that one it's
all your the new stuff you discover then has all these other amazing uses and
loads of really big results in maths come from recreation or playing around
with numbers this kind of thing this is the first five million digits of pi
printed on two thousand pieces of paper and if you would like your very own
piece of pie I'm gonna be signing these and sending them out to numberphile
viewers to find out how to get one have a look in the video description or go to
patreon.com/crashcourse member so we say it's not just great in the one it's much
greater than one so sort of a thousand and above turbulence and your equations
so we've got rid now
