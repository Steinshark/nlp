thanks to Jane Street for sponsoring this video 
applications are open for the Jane Street Academy   of Math and Programming fully funded positions 
available for high school students graduating   in 2023 I am very impressed with the James 
Webb Space Telescope partly the spectacular   images it's taking of our universe and partly the 
spectacular geometry it's based on a little model   I made of the primary mirror or mirrors they're 
all hexagons and you may have heard this set on   the internet that hexagons are the hexa greatest 
and I've seen better models than the one I made   I was at the Blue Dot festival and I bumped into 
the folks from the University of Suffolk and they   had made a giant model of this out of bathroom 
mirrors they bought from a hardware store very   high tech although that's it they did give me 
a little pin I got like a little Badge of the   primary mirror which I'll pop on right now 
there we go look at that all right so Space   Telescope it's very cool however NASA who were 
traditionally very good at you know spectacle   and big reveals and you know dramatic emotional 
press conferences they decided to announce the   first ever like publicly released proper 
image from the James Webb Space Telescope   by getting one 79 year old guy named Joe 
talking to another 79 year old guy named Bill   and now let's take a look at the very 
first image from this miraculous telescope that's administrator Nelson I'm going to turn this   over to you so will you please 
tell us about what we're seeing who held the grain of sand on the 
tip of your finger at arm's length   that is the part of the universe that you're 
seeing just one little speck of the universe   and what you're seeing there are galaxies   uh you're seeing galaxies that are shining 
around other galaxies whose light has been bent   and you're seeing just a small 
little portion of the universe you know a hundred years ago skipping over 
Bill's uninspired space ramble I will say   there is a grain of sand difference between this 
the 2022 James Webb Space Telescope image which   was the first one revealed we just saw it 
totally non-awkwardly put up on the screen   and everyone eventually clapping in that press 
conference and this image taken by the Hubble   Space Telescope decades earlier I mean look at 
him look how wildly different they are obviously   that's underway they're the wrong way around 
sorry wrong way in another word they went the   right way around the whole time you can't tell 
they have gone on to release all sorts of other   spectacular images taken by the James Webb Space 
Telescope I just thought it was a bit of a weird   choice in the first press conference to have a 
shot that looks so similar to the one that came   before it I'm sure it's higher resolution blah 
blah blah but the one thing that was very cool   that I noticed and the way you can tell these 
images apart is the old Hubble shots the Stars   have four points whereas in the new James Webb 
shots they have well eight point well six six   points and two bonus points the difference in 
those Starry spikes or diffraction spikes as they   technically are is down to two different parts of 
the geometry of the telescopes and I think this   is just so incredible so this model I've made 
of the James word Space Telescope is to scale   um actually it's roughly five percent of the 
original but that was by accident but nonetheless   very pleasing and it's to scale compared to this 
this is the mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope   it's about 2.4 meters across and our friend 
here James Webb we're talking like six meters   like it's way way bigger and very different shapes 
different shapes different sizes different colors   different pretty much everything because they 
focus on different wavelengths of light however   what they do have in common other than being in 
space is they have a space there's a hole right   in the middle of both of them hexagonal for web 
and circular for Hubble and that's because the   way they focus the light coming from space onto 
the sensors to make an image as the light comes   out I use one of the lights in the room here with 
me hits the mirror it then reflects it forward so   I'm gonna actually I reckon I can aim that right 
at the camera there you are so I'm deflecting the   light right towards the camera but what actually 
happens is it hits another mirror out here which   again made a scale model so uh this on the James 
web is about 74 centimeters across the secondary   mirror this is the primary mirror is circular 
classic and that sits oh I don't know to scale   how far out but the light comes in from the Stars 
hits all of this gets focused up onto this mirror   and then reflected back through the center and 
then onto some sensors behind and the same thing   happens for Hubble I've almost lost there it 
is it's only 30 centimeters across that is the   secondary mirror for Hubble the issue is somehow 
you've got to hold this mirror up in front of the   primary mirror but you don't want to block too 
much of the light coming in here's how they do it   on Hubble they have two supports or four supports 
depending on how you want to count them however   when the light the photons coming from these 
distant Stars hit these supports they diffract   the problem with photons behaving like waves in 
some situations we're not getting into it is when   they hit an edge of something they will defract 
and the amount they defract depends on a bunch   of physic things but what It ultimately means is 
if you've got a bunch of photons coming in like   from a point source like a star and then you've 
got a like vertical strut they're going to be   diffracted out to kind of spread out side to side 
they spread out at right angles to The Edge which   is stopping them from carrying on as such not a 
physicist oh I did marry one so I think that's how   it works anyway so now if you've got the light 
from a single star coming into the Hubble it's   going to go past these supports that way I guess 
right and then each time it hits one of these the   light gets spread out side to side but then it 
all gets focused back into the one point and I   don't want to over simplify what's going on here 
but if you've got a star admitting light it emits   light in every direction so if you look at a star 
you're like oh I can see it from here I can see   it from here I can see it from here because the 
light's going in every direction but wouldn't it   be great if you could get the light from here and 
the light from here and here and here and combine   it all into one image that image would be a 
lot brighter that's what the mirror is doing   this is actually a paraboloid I mean I made it 
out of cards so it's not but it's a Hubble close   enough is good enough and the paraboloid then 
focuses all the lighting on to one point which   is basically collapsing the light from a big area 
down which means it collapses the light which has   been spread out by this one it's been diffracted 
this way that gets overlapped with the light from   this and the light from this and the light from 
this and what you end up with is a cross shaped a   a four point star starring effect on all Point 
sources in the Hubble Space Telescope images foreign the data taken for science purposes has obviously 
processed a bit different to the way that the data   used for pretty image purposes is processed 
and there are ways to mitigate and remove the   starring diffraction patterns but they are still 
a bit annoying you can deal with it from a science   point of view and a lot of the images that relate 
to the public they leave it in looks kind of cool   so that's how that works on Hubble but what's 
going on with web Webb could just do the same   thing as Hubble and stick this on some cross beams 
like that hold it at the front no worries except   web has some extra problems that Hubble didn't 
have and that's down to the geometry the hexagonal   nature of the mirrors because Hubble had a single 
circular like a one big disk paraboloid mirror   the mirror itself does produce some diffraction 
effects but it's super symmetric so it just kind   of does it the same in every single Direction you 
don't get a starring effect and what direction you   do get of course once again you can post process 
the images to deal with it hexagons give you a   different pattern side point these hexagons are 
regular hexagons they are designed to be part   of once again a paraboloid shape and there are 
three different types of hexagons in the James   Webb Space Telescope you've got type A which are 
the six in the center you've got type B which are   the six that poke out in the corners and you've 
got type c which are the ones that are kind of   on the edges all the way around they're all each 
type is subtly different and the point is they're   all trying to get the light focused as neatly 
as possible paraboloid style onto the secondary   mirror but for all real intents and purposes 
they're big old regular hexagons and because   they've got all these you know sharp edges and 
Corners they defract the light different amounts   in different directions and actually it's the 
hexagonal mirrors which give us those six big   diffraction spikes we see in the images but 
what about the supports well they decided to   use three supports when they were holding up 
the secondary mirror on the James Webb and you   could think well we'll just use one minimize 
the impact you don't want this mirror moving   relative to these mirrors right you want to strap 
that thing down so they're going to have three   of them and then somehow and there's no tube as 
well because they put the Hubble in a tube this   is very much a mirrors on show Affair there is 
a big Shield to block it from the sun because   if you're detecting infrared you don't want 
to heat things up apparently but the mirrors   themselves are all just kind of joined together 
so these supports come out from the primary mirror   all around the edge and they hold the secondary 
mirror up and you think well where are we going   to put them what they decided to do was to hide 
them they decided to hide the diffraction effects   from the supports inside the diffraction effects 
from the shapes of the mirrors very clever right the diffraction occurs around the straight 
edges of the mirror so this straight edge   here it's going to cause the light from anything 
that hits it to kind of diffract out in this this   of you know orthogonal direction to the edge of 
the mirror and actually it's going to line up   perfectly with the light that's diffracted 
off this one over here so actually you get   one diffraction line that way you get a second 
diffraction line this way and you get a third   diffraction line this way and I've only drawn 
one mirror but all the mirrors all get overlaid   as they focus the image so the geometry of one is 
the same geometry of all of them and that's where   the six you know really prominent spikes come from 
in the images so now you want to put in a support   such that you hide its diffraction spikes in some 
of these let's say we want to hide it in this one   here so if we want the diffraction spikes to go 
this way the support has to be at right angles to   that it's going to be perpendicular to that so 
it's got to be like well it's going to be here   but you can't the support's not gonna be out 
here obviously it's going to be all over here   attached to this and so actually the support 
is going to go straight down this way that's   at right angles there straight down this way 
and because of the geometry of the hexagon they   after all the hex are greatest it's going 
to go straight through that corner there   so actually they're at from the up and down 
Direction they form an angle there of 30   degrees you don't have to measure that though 
because that 30 degrees just lines up with the   corner so as long as the support goes from the 
very center out to one of the corners we should   be good you can then put another one over here 
hide the second one there that's also 30 degrees   believe me and then for the third support I 
mean they could have done more supports and   hidden them but in the end they decided ah we 
just put the last support straight up and it's   going to have its own diffraction pattern coming 
off this way and so that's why in the images   you see the six main ones from the shape of the 
mirror these ones are hidden and then a vertical   support gives you those little bonus side to side 
ones let me say side to side it's in space yeah right I've attached the mirror to 
the three supports I just need to   stick it on to the primary mirror here 
and what I'm going to do is just line   these two up with the corners there for 
the little round to stick to the top done hold up like okay I think that's yeah look at 
that that totally works now I want to make it   very clear while all the mirrors are themselves 
to scale with each other across both telescopes   this distance is not to scale I didn't bother 
working out how far out this has to be but you   get the idea so they've now got that one support 
at the top there that's the one that gives you   the horizontal star horizontal uh the side to side 
starring you can see in the images and these two   ones down here which as you can see have perfectly 
lined up with the corners give or take so I'm   on the wrong Corners that's like it to the wrong 
Corners this is why my wife is the space scientist   who works on spacecraft and I work on arts and 
crafts okay now there's the top one which gives   you the side to side starring and then you've 
got these two ones at the bottom here that stick   on those Corners there because they perfectly 
ready out from the center of that hexagon there   um and that's why like unlike the perfectly 
equally spaced supports from the Hubble secondary   mirror you've got this weird slightly not 
asymmetric but you've got two at the bottom spaced   out and one at the top and it's because it hides 
a diffraction starring from these ones lovely   I mean the mass is lovely the the model is 
adequate last point is that the diffraction   spikes and all those aberrations do also depend 
slightly on which instrument is being used to   record the data on the web Space Telescope and 
there's actually a python package which will   show you all the theoretical uh point spread 
functions for all the different instruments   on the web it's called web psf for point spread 
function you can install it it's a little fiddly   if you don't already have your computer set up for 
doing Astro python things but I got it working and   you can have a bit of a play and look at oh just 
look at the pretty images look at them ah lovely   finally there is a ground-based telescope being 
planned where they're going to put this down here   sorry to interrupt future mats here because 
James Street have open applications to their   Academy of math and programming for 2023. this 
is for people who have had some kind of hardship   in their education so far and Jane Street are 
very broad with their definition of hardship   so do check out the website for details this 
is for students who are finishing High School   in 2023 and going on to study something math and 
programming related at University it's a five-week   residential and James Street will cover all of 
your costs so it's in New York they'll get you   there they'll cover your food your accommodation 
and give you a five thousand dollar scholarship   all of that on top of an amazing course where 
you learn math and programming and have some   interesting guest speakers including this guy 
I dropped by last time and you know I'll do   it again so if this sounds like a course that 
you would benefit from or you know someone who   would benefit from it importantly they have to 
be able to work in the US without a sponsored   Visa because of all the money and support changed 
you're giving you that's one of the requirements   from a Visa point of view but other than that do 
check out the details apply and maybe you'll see   me there it's a lot of fun okay so I'm going to 
hand you back over now to past Matt and I don't   know whatever they're talking about telescopes 
blah blah blah finally there is a ground-based   telescope being planned where they're going 
to put the supports for the secondary mirror   positioned between perfectly lined up with the 
gaps between the different sections of the primary   mirror very clever however that's fine if you're 
building on earth if you're building something for   space that's a lot more complicated or indeed just 
building a model of something in space it's pretty   and stuff that's it that's the video thanks for 
watching thanks to will Roper from the University   of Sussex got a bit of a chat with me about these 
things and thanks to my wife for being a space   scientist no one sent her this video a hundred 
years ago we thought there was only one Galaxy   now the number is unlimited and in our 
galaxy we have billions of stars or Suns   and there are billions of galaxies 
with billions of stars and Suns
