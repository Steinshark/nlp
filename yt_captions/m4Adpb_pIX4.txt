ladies and gentlemen in today's video we're going to be doing two very exciting things in the first one we'll be analyzing a game from start to finish played by two individuals with chess elos of one thousand we will be dissecting and examining the brains of two humans that have an ELO in chess of a thousand which you always know is going to be a fun exciting uh exhilarating uh and very disturbing at times activity and the second thing that we'll be observing about this game is that it ended with 0.1 seconds on the clock which if you like any type of sport is always very fun like in football in extra time the six minute of extra time is about to end and if the ball is kicked out to Midfield the game is over in basketball the last shot that kind of a thing well enjoy yourselves this game was played uh by an individual from South Africa named uh Warner and an individual from Nigeria named obina now they both get honorary Grandmaster titles they are not actually Grand Masters but uh you know we'll uh we'll we'll we'll still we'll still manage and the game begins with lo and behold a London Bishop to F4 and I don't know do I have uh animations turned off or something oh weird to F5 in fact I'm already choking because they played the London um black liked uh White's idea so much that black said you know what you want to play the London I also want to play the London now there is nothing inherently wrong with this but remember that black goes second in chess so the way I recommend you playing this is to play Pawn to E3 and then C4 and the reason for this is you will get your queen out here much faster and Mirror Image only lasts for so long uh black can get themselves in a lot of trouble very quickly uh with Bishop B5 and queen A4 and the center is falling apart so uh what you want to do when you get hit with mirror image London is try to turn it back into a Queen's Gambit although I don't hate the move Knight C3 and clearly white is trying to play a Joe Bava London and try to play Knight to B5 so black plays E6 and white does in fact play the move Knight to B5 now by the way this is actually a pretty high level game of chess of course it does have a very chaotic ending in the middle game but you're gonna laugh in this video but this is actually a lot less of a how to lose a chess episode and much more of just like a let's just enjoy a video of two people rated like 1100 a thousand close to 1100 and learn from it black plays Knight A6 which is a completely reasonable move generally it's bad to move Knights out to the edge of the board but in this case it's not a huge deal because whitesnite has moved twice already and when you kick it out it'll move a third time and then black can actually utilize the knight's position so E3 C6 yeah the Knight is sent packing and now black plays the best move which is Queen B6 played instantly by the way three seconds and immediately taking advantage of this I think the person playing with black actually has a lot of experience playing London because you'll notice that they very quickly brought the queen out to Target the weak pawn and what white should do here is play Rook B1 what you don't want to do is play B3 this is a very very very fundamentally uh large uh misunderstanding of the position you do not ever want to destabilize a piece that is so easy to pin to your king okay listen to what I just said you don't want to destabilize a piece that's easy to pin if the position was something like uh this was just very hypothetically say then then the move B3 doesn't matter because Bishop to before you always have this okay however you want to avoid getting a piece pinned to your king when nothing is defending it because what black can now do is apply maximum pressure and if you're unlucky the Knight will go to E4 and you will get yourself in massive trouble in fact in this position what you should do with white is you should probably defend yourself with the Knight this move is extremely dangerous extremely dangerous because after Queen A5 not only are you are you pinned you are pinned to two pieces you have your two most valuable pieces stuck there not just your king but also your queen which means that your knight is completely immobile now you have to play Knight E2 all right black is already applying gigantic pressure here and white cannot develop blackplay's Knight F6 why does a move away from being completely lost okay in eight moves seven moves after playing the move B3 Knight F6 there is a threat the threat is Knight E4 and if you allow it that is GG you just lose all right you do get a little bit of material back I suppose but then black plays Knight before Knight C2 it's game over it is absolutely game over so the only way to defend against Knight E4 white cerebral F3 excellent move literally the only move all right if you you know if you like never play moves like that you never play F3 you're worried you're gonna weaken your king nobody cares about your emotions about the move F3 in this position you have to stop Knight E4 now if I'm playing Black here I'm playing Rook C8 C5 that's my idea black castles now what white should do is literally just get out of the pin At All by all means necessary or play A3 why because black being gluttonous and pinning themselves like this very nice and you have Knight takes D5 here hitting the queen if they take with check you have take take and you get the bishop at the end and now white is much better in fact according to the computer white is winning because of White's positional Advantage potential to kick out all of Black's pieces and Black's inability to move pieces forward anymore so white plays G4 however alright white is trying to get aggressive Bishop here and now Bishop here I love this it's a very high level game of chess we are dissecting the brain of two one thousands but this is high level stuff now what type of position is this all right we are out of the opening we're in the middle game let's start to uh let's start to learn let's learn let's try to learn five to ten things from this game shall we okay terrific um first things first it's a closed position because both sides have eight pawns uh and the more pawns you have the closer the position is to being closed now what should black do here consider improving their pieces by moving the pieces or moving pawns this is a pawn break this move massively improves Black's position why because after it occurs black now has pressure on the C file and white has lost the center Pawn black plays this move Queen d8 now I'm going to give you a rule of thumb seven or eight times out of ten as a newbie going backwards is not the right move it's just not you probably have something better going laterally or forward for instance if you want to play rookie 8 or Rook C8 and then C5 it's probably the best move removing your queen like this is not good and now trading a bishop for a knight for seemingly no reason is also not a good move two moves white is back in the game you traded the bishop for a knight you did no damage to White structure no damage to their position your bishop and queen were serving a purpose to break through you should have kept trying to break through and your third move is catastrophic as now you are just simply much worse because you have hung upon and then after hanging the pawn you're probably gonna hang another Pawn um so you'll notice that White's been a lot of time white spent 40 seconds couldn't find anything that's why you got to be able to use your pawns you got to always be looking especially in close positions for Pawn breaks that can make progress in the position all right and not all peace trades are the same three does not equal three now in this position Warner plays H4 this is a astoundingly good move I am shocked at how good this move is many people here would simply play Queen takes Pawn which is probably the best move but H4 is threatening to trap that ugly Bishop on G6 black plays H5 now about nine times out of ten after H4 H5 if you have a pawn it's better to push like you you should just go here and shove the Knight out of the center that's just what you should do that's just the best move no questions asked okay that is just the best move um however it's not always easy to do that all right and uh instead of that white plays Knight G3 which I don't hate the idea of Knight G3 is pontex G4 H5 okay black after Knight G3 plays Knight C7 and white notices that this Pawn is hanging so white is now up upon white is also a moment away from probably winning another pawn and white has an attack going on the king side the only thing that can happen in this position is white can overextend when you are attacking on multiple sides of the board and you are not controlling multiple sides of the board chaos can happen for example if black plays the move Rook C8 here and white says oh take take take yay I'm up two pawns look what happens look what happens Rook C2 you're not up two pawns you're only up one but it's even worse than that because it's very difficult for you to defend your position and as you try to defend your position your position will collapse because I will get in so you can wage a battle on a chessboard on multiple sides but you need to make sure you control those sides for instance you are now controlling this side of the board black cannot break through does that make sense black has no Pawn breaks black has no peace play and now you can go and you can bully but still be careful avoid your opponent getting back into the game control their pieces Queen takes C6 A5 black hangs the Knight complete collapse total collapse black had a monster opening and now has completely collapsed and is just struggling now what do you do in this position with white you're pinned you're pinned you can't move the bishop you can't move the queen far away defend your queen so you can move the bishop Queen C5 the best move here for black is to keep bothering you but if they don't do that if they play like now you can get out and now you can trade the queen when you are pinned and you are struggling to move both pieces the more valuable piece needs to be defended especially in a fair trade if this was a rook you can't do that but it's a queen which means you can trade Queens so find moves like this queen C3 doesn't work nothing is defending it right so Queen B6 is played in the game and now black immediately fires back now there is a very nice idea here Queen takes B5 and you cannot take the bishop because I will take the Rook but as it turns out you absolutely can take the bishop for The Rook because then you can take the Knight that is the problem with pushing so many pawns forward you need to have very good board vision for this but you also need to understand that when you have pushed so many pawns forward many things could be left unguarded this is a very very high level board Vision exercise unfortunately it is not seen or fortunately and now white wins yet another Pawn and black finds this move which is an excellent move and now white finds an even better move which is castling and now white is completely winning but both sides only have five minutes on the clock which means it's time to have some fun alright uh all the way back here it's better not to be greedy it's better not to be greedy it's better to just escape and consolidate Rook will go here you can block the position you also don't even need to block the remember about control control make sure your opponent cannot break through all right don't let them in don't let them in make sure everything is protected nicely because what happens in this game is chaos breaks out and black finds Bishop D3 that's a huge problem the queen is hanging The Rook is hanging what do you do you have to probably move the queen but if you move the queen you have to make sure it guards the bishop maybe a queen before and after this you take back yes danger levels is risky business because you calculate if Bishop takes then Rook takes that's correct but your opponent here has something called a Desperado your opponent realizes I'm going to lose my queen so why don't I lose my queen on my terms Queen takes C1 that is a genius move Queen takes C1 check Queen for Rook but you get back to oh my God that is brilliant that is absolutely brilliant and now the material balance is restored white has a bishop and two pawns for a rook so you just play Bishop B4 and then you play G5 and the game goes on this is what you do this this is how chess is played white is still better why is white better white has more more quality pieces so four pieces versus uh uh four pieces versus four but of course this Rook is extremely strong it controls the diagonal uh the straightaway in the diagonal also white has these two pawns so the computer still thinks that white is better but white blenders again and this is what happens in intermediate chess it's not the first mistake that kills you it's the second one White blundered Queen C1 and just thought damn it I'm gonna lose this game I I need to win a pawn back immediately but no you don't you you don't need to win a pawn back immediately the chess board does not care about your feelings you need to stop getting so emotional when you blunder and you need to just realize wait a minute what's going on these two pieces are still interacting well actually that one's interacting with that one that one doesn't see that one so you gotta move okay that's why you gotta move white blunders the bishop and now the game is truly over because black is just up a full Rook now how do you win this with black you win these pawns you gotta trade the Rooks that would really really help so Rook C5 is a nice idea we just talked about this how to deal with pins Knight D7 is an extremely clutch move and black takes on A3 that's it I mean black is winning those pawns the game is over Rook C3 Rook fa8 excellent excellent I always say utilize the material advantage that you have all right E4 Pawn takes Knight takes Rook A1 check is Sensational now I would bring in the second Rook but I don't hate this move Knight F6 offering a trade it is craziness to trade the Knight here with white you need to play moves like 96 or Knight G5 you need to play Move Like Knight G5 because it prevents the black king from getting off the back Rank and you never know when your opponent hangs this you never know for instance boom boom boom let's say your opponent is trying to get in and all of a sudden they hang back rank mate because your knight covers the king's Escape you just never know what you cannot do here with white as trade you have no pieces left why are you trading now personally I think that the trade occurred because white has this but you can't do that pawn to F4 all all opening up the bishop but but white misses it white misses Bishop takes Rook now we have Rook A2 King G3 and the King it's a walk of shame it's Maiden 7 official on the board the Rooks are gonna swarm always give a check like this you have to give logical follow-ups King will run to the corner now the bishop can go deliver the kiss of death Bishop F1 Bishop F1 you take on G2 that's it I mean the King has made it by accident here Rook H1 is made in one Rook G3 Rook takes it's Game Over You Gotta hunt the king I just said seven eight times out of ten going backwards is not the answer why did you spend 16 seconds here and go backwards black here is worried about Rook C7 Rook F7 that is a crazy thing to be worried about you need to coordinate your Rooks and go Rook to G1 okay Rook C5 fine Bishop slides into D3 white plays Pawn to D5 black takes of course I mean you gotta take right Rook takes D5 the bishop is hanging now the bishop is hanging two squares this way so what should you do here you should move the bishop somewhere to safety The Rook hits the bishop this way so white moves the black moves the bishop here and hangs the bishop oh I don't like that move oh my goodness that's the same exact amount of squares it it The Rook covers that way too how do you do that The Rook was going down two squares and now it goes to the right oh my goodness okay now it's probably a draw because white has sufficient material and if this Pawn starts rolling it's going to be a massive asset black plays Rook G1 check I wish black would have given that check when the second Rook was here and also black still had a bishop King to H2 Rook to B1 now you should move your Bishop to defend your Pawn that's probably what you should do but Rook F6 Rook B3 I don't hate it Bishop E4 King G7 Rook slides over and now black is winning again because black probably has an accidental ladder mate Bishop back to G2 Rook B2 oh no it's over it's over but black only has 58 seconds black only has 58 seconds to win this game H6 put the king in front of the pawn excellent oh my goodness I told you this is excellent stuff here King H3 now Rook takes G2 yup F5 Rook gf2 excellent I I would give checks also remember be cerebral go give laddermate somehow cut the king off and give a ladder mate but okay F5 Rook F2 good time management white is down to 17 seconds so it's just about you know Rook F6 Rook check King runs up rook check all right now you can coordinate these pieces and win this okay not perfect not perfect and according to the computer actually not great because Rook F7 if you're going to have a king run up you got to be very careful so cut off the king's Escape otherwise you are assisting the king helping out the attack now it would be worth going backwards so there is no Rook F7 but okay Rook A7 Rook F7 fine King G8 okay white plays the worst move white has seven seconds on the clock King to G6 now all you gotta do is give a check and just be a little bit careful before you give that check you gotta play Rook A7 not all trades are the same it's not five five anymore because if you trade well then there's going to be uh a queen promoting but in this position black with 27 seconds on the clock versus whites two seconds rushes and instead of giving one more check and simply securing this winning end game black rushes and plays Rook takes G7 white now has two seconds to promote the queen and give a checkmate this move is played with .9 seconds on the clock King H7 G8 is pre-moved with 0.8 seconds on the clock and this move is played in 0.7 seconds white finds Checkmate in one and wins the game Against All Odds with point one seconds on the clock if you are winning by 25 seconds in an end game and if your opponent has only 2 seconds remaining relax find another check you there's a higher chance here that you win on time than anything else Rook G7 Pawn takes G8 Queen Checkmate on G6 wow now get out of here
