so we got to share with the employees because without employees we can't make a profit and if employees make more money they have more purchasing power the economy functions better but we must open up we must it's it's so crucial that small Enterprise that we don't TI them up in Chains and with [Music] regulations [Music] hello everyone watching and listening today I have the honor to speak with Frank stac founder and CEO of Magna International one of Canada and the world's great companies um Frank built that company from nothing starting in the 1950s it's quite a story we discussed the keys to motivating yourself to starting and maintaining a successful and expanding business why that's a good thing for yourself and everybody else the idea contained within within his corporate Constitution it's an economic Charter of Rights which advocates for the input autonomy and profit sharing uh among all all workers management um shareholders Etc and I'm very much looking forward to talking about it with him hello Mr struk it's very very nice to see you um we met a couple of months ago at a restaurant in in Toronto and I had the opportunity to talk to you about your business ventures over the last five or six decades um which I found extraordinarily interesting in in the intervening period of time I've read your I've read one of your books uh the one that's more autobiographical um and um I'm very interested in your story I thought you would make a particularly good podcast guest because one of the things I do with my pod is walk people through the lives of successful individuals because I think it would be better if people believed that they could move forward successfully in the world and that they were equipped with some knowledge about how to do that and I think that's something we could really concentrate on focusing in on I know it's very important to you in this podcast you came to Canada in the 19 50s we'll we'll go through your story autobiographically you came armed with a tiny bit of money some actual skill some determination and out of that you built a massive business Empire let's start let's start with this not everyone listening and watching are are going to know what Magna Enterprises is so would you do us the favor first of laying out your business Empire tell people what it is that you do and what you've accomplished how you spread out through the world what you guys manufacture just lay out the story The the description of Magna okay I've always said life is a question of fate and circumstances being at the right places at the right time with the right ingrediences as it happened uh I was born in a workingclass family and when I finished my schooling and I had one or two years practical experience I wanted to see the world I applied for a visa to South Africa Australia the United States and Canada sometimes I'm a little tough on the Canadian bureaucracy but I'm saying it's still the best because they came first forward with a Visa so I landed in queek city I took the cheapest fair I could you know from Holland on a cold freighter and uh uh so I arrived in qu back in I think was about April uh 1954 and uh the immigration officer asked me do you know anybody in Canada I said no so I said well then you go to Montreal so I moved to so I took a train to Montreal uh uh and but I didn't know anybody my English was reasonably okay and I there were some uh English-speaking people on that ship and so I tried to practice my English so anyway I knew because I had to $100 in my pocket and I knew that wouldn't last me too long if it would if I would right away uh uh b a hotel or whatever it's so uh so the people told me look just walk along the streets and it's customary if you see a sign room to let just knock on the door and then you might get a room so I did work for an hour or two right I I knocked on but there were a few signs I've seen I knocked on the door I think I kind of looked a little rough from uh the long uh journey and uh so they say it's already leased but I did find one I did find the room so the next morning I got up and uh and uh I looked at the road maps and looked at and walked around and I worked in the factory but it was in 54 there was a a major recession I just couldn't find the job right and um during that time I was hungry hungry enough because I wanted to lose weight I was hungry I had no money to buy food and if you experienced that that's a that's a an impression which will last forever it's burnt in your soul right so anyway I run out of money I was hungry I I had an acquaintance not a close friend but somebody know from the same down they came from and uh that was in kitchen right so I saved enough Monies to do I bought a gry home buset and uh and I moved to Kitchen I traveled by bu by kitchen from Montreal and uh so when I got off after the main Square I asked somebody what such and such address is they said look go up there four blocks and then ask again so up four blocks ask well uh go up to three more blocks and then you might have to make it left and so I again I I after about two hours of walking I could find the house where that fell uh lived and I knocked on the door and an elderly lady said uh Max that was the fellow's name there somebody want to see me I was very uh it was a very happy feeling you know to meet somebody uh which you know from previous days so anyway Max came down and he looked at me he said you kind you look a little rough are you hungry I said yes come on in so uh the next day I slept there the next day we started chop hunting uh uh in in the industrial site there was nothing but I did find a jop at the kitchen of waterl Hospital in the kitchen and uh so I I felt so sorry for myself I feel when I come to Canada I got a manly job know cutting trees down or taking out Stones something manly but I was there and the catching with a lot of elderly women nothing against elderly women my mother was an elderly woman I liked her but I felt sorry for myself to peeling potatoes washing salads etc etc so the evening I was just itching to get away to me amongst people in those days there were there was an aan clopping kitchen so I went there and those days they were slow dancing right a lot of music and when they danced with the girl you know uh you know what you do where you from I say I'm from Austria what you do well I work in the hospital my hands were so smooth from washing dishes they thought I was a surgeon so but that was the end they always kind of said no I'm just working in the kitchen then I did I guess they didn't want to dance Clos they didn't want to go out with the guy which works in the kitchen but that's the way life is but anyway after a little while uh I after a about of months or so I did found a job in an engineering and a production oriented company they uh that company worked exclusive exclusively for the Arro a aircraft right which um uh which uh Canada developed and uh and but that um that project was wasn't financed anymore and it was it it it was close the factory the AO aircraft Factory I think was closed the company I worked for was closed so I I had checked a right to from Kitchen to to Oak Fort was building a a new Factory at the time there there were huge lineups I waited about for about 2 three hours before they interviewed me and interviewed Lo uh um yes you're d d you're too young to get have any experiences so I wasn't hired and I drifted to uh to Toronto down had right to Toronto but um years later I had uh had U many times uh you know meeting a lunch meeting din meeting with the president of Ford and I told me you're lucky if I got H at the time I would be the President right so I I could tease him right I knew well enough that I could but any I did find a job there in a very small company you know about 10 people after a year after a few months uh the guy said the own said you're doing a great job I want you to be a partner of mine and uh and my chest swelled a little and that's great and uh nice guy but he'd never wrote it down what it's all about so I I said to myself there's nothing to do with to run the factory so I looked in the paper and I I found the job wake up paid a lot more I moved in a rooming house where the toilets were in the hallway and I saved every dollar after after a couple of years I saved about $5,000 I rented the garage actually it was the gate House of standard products in duffrin and tupon in Toronto and I um the size was about maybe double the the the garage I bought a few used machines I had a $5,000 safe up back in terms today that would be at least 100 150,000 right so I bought the huge machines and all they went hustling I knocked on on Factory doors and they said I'm I'm great in solving problems and they said look if I can't solve the problems you don't have to pay me but anyway after one months I hired a work after year about 10 workers after 2 years about 20 after 5 years about 3 4,000 after 10 years about 75,000 after 20 years 125,000 10 I buil up a company with 170,000 employees and 34 different countries so anyway the message I want to get across is you know when we younger We All Hustle to make some monies so that we can live in dignity I guess I could have lived in dignity in all the 34 countries but I choose Canada I think uh I I I've seen the world and I met just about every president uh you know from uh from Clinton to Putin to Donny Blair just about everybody and I could see Canada perhaps the only country now which could be a role model which where we could uh where we could Implement an economic chter of Rights maget basically is more than a business it's really a culture I call it the F enterprise system the basic philosophy and fair Enterprise is the human chart of rights at l Al is not sufficient we have to fortify it with an economic CH of Rights economic charters of Rights will to economic democracies and economic democracies are the basis for democracy itself but let me explain it a little better because uh we uh we don't talk too much about it you know uh those those conversations are not uh they're not plold right but um let me simplify things now all the politician all business what matter of fact most people agree if the economy doesn't work nothing else will work you cannot feed the hungry you cannot look after the most fragile people the elderly the sick and the handicap but we do not talk what drives the economy the economy is driven by three forces smart managers hardworking employees and investors that means all three have a right to the outcome which is profits the message I want to get across is if we fail or if we do not let workers participate in profits then we got a problem okay because the world has always been dominated by the Golden Rule and still is the people which have the gold make the rules I don't want to be dominated by anyone if I feel that strong then I should not be able to dominate somebody either so thereby the only way we be able to achieve that is why an economic CH of Rights the message I want to get across to Canadians is the human chter of Frights alone is not sufficient we have to fortify it with an economic chter of Frights economic CH frights as I said before will lead to economic democracies and economic democracies are the basis for democracy itself the human chart of Rights alone doesn't mean a lot of things for kid inocent Detroit is free to be hungry so the amazing story about the whole thing is when I put in a corate constitution at magne it was about in the mid late 80s the Constitution basically said or what the most important thing on the on the Constitution was we predetermined what we do with the prophets so the the Constitution said the the prophet sharing said 20% of the profits go to the shareholders 10% goes to the employees over and above the we wages half in shares half in cash 6% management gets 2% charity gets and 7% is reinvested for for research so when I put the Constitution the profits went up the first year about 40% the second year about 100% the third year about 200% when you Empower employees where they share where they where there's a clear concept where they share on the profits you release an enormous energy you know because they're on the front line the employees on the front line they can see what you have to do to make a better product for a better price so that's what it's all about that's the kind of C that's what the world needs you know we stand perhaps at um at a crossroad who will dominate the world the United States is slipping to certain extent the United States has dominated the world for the last 100 years and where freedom and the religious freedom freedom to speak and a lot of freedom great right uh we have maybe followed up and we could do a little better there but United States uh unfortunately has a lot of problems there's cancer in the inner cities the poverty is enormous I don't know it's feasible right but the very the the the very the key question we have to ask ourself what can we do to uh you know because the Divide is too great there so much money sell by just a few and there's so much poverty by many okay so what do we have to do to to to level that out not completely you can never you should never level it out at the same time I say a country which stles its citizen in pursuit of productivity Ingenuity creativity is a decaying this Society because you have the society or the world's made up of different Minds different desires different let everybody choose their own road to happiness okay so but it's very important so I divide I divide actually the program I classify business over 300 employees it's it's a large business below 300 people it's a small business the law would stipulate that the large business which have more than 300 employees that they the law would provide that workers could share in some of the profits and that could be determined right could be an escalated program the small business uh small business basically is the backbone of any country this they pay the most taxes they have the most employment and this is where call it the new products come forward the new te knowy ET so we must do everything we can that's that we take the red tapes off take the chains of small business and let small business operate under the pure FR Enterprise principles so there is the bureaucracy has climbed enormously you know I could never build a magnet anymore imagine starting out in a garage imagine to build 170,000 employees over 400 factories worldwide I could never because I would choke under the first factory right and I could give you examples now how how cumbersome it is right okay and when we look back 40 50 years yes we have a lot of security uh uh our safety measurement and you know buildings have to be built that then will collapse over the snow load Etc but the bureaucracy has climed to such an extent but let me I I like to point out I to bring up a change you won't bring up a change if you point the fingers whose fault it is and you cannot do it with the chains so either so I'm saying it's not the fault of the Bure the bureaucrats in a free Society everybody has a right to find the job whatever the job openings are it's the s system the system we have to change our politicians are trapped in the systems because the politics is whoever brings forward something new any politician or party they won't win because you could criticize them so this is the problem uh politics government can't fix things so it needs it's it needs a private citizen it is it's a coalition of what I would call concerned Canadians which where you could leave the program relative short that you could combine this is what we need to get the economy going because the economy you know I I think it's it's frightening what will happen over the next 5 10 years we don't make things anymore when you look when you see factories the factories are all warehous that we don't make things and when a country doesn't make things they got to inut everything then is where the economy breaks down and where where where there's no jobs where people go hungry so we got to wait that so I think have given you a a bit of a short overview and uh I would be very happy to now to answer questions and uh and uh how can we how can we fix things okay so I would like to know first of all what skills you brought to Canada with you and how long it took you to acquire those skills say on the tool and die maker side and then also what attitude you think you brought to bear to your work that enticed the first person for example to offer you a partnership but that also made you capable of taking the risk and developing the vision to rent that first empty garage so how were you trained how long did that take what made you a good potential partner and why did you have enough daring let's say or Vision to rent that first garage well the training uh I I served High School uh High School it was only eight classes and I proposed to in Canada we should uh high school should end at grade 10 grade 11 and grade 12 we should student should focus we should teach him traits and that doesn't mean that the students after grade 12 couldn't go to university I'm just now uh telling people uh the situation I was exposed to so it was a three and a half year program we had one or two days where we had theoretical stuff where we had to be in classrooms and let's say four days we were on the on in a workshop on the floor learning different things so that was the program what did you learn what what what skills did you acquire it um tool making is sort of for every you need let's say uh let's take this pen here that's not made by hand huh there's so much Precision so much knowledge goes in a in a in a in a writing band The the Ink's got to come out for the next few months is such a minute that just that you can read and write so you got to make machines or tools or or let's people might may understand well let's say a bumper for a car is not made by hand huh okay you need a mold because it's plastic right and it's h you so this is what d making is about right and this is um this is maybe the most important trade uh to uh to get things done to get things made right when you take uh when you take a car might it be a door might it be a seat might it be the pumper right you need tools you need TI and then special Machinery so that will call it the basics would take 3 to four years years and then it might take another few years till you slowly work yourself up that you be qualified to a die [Music] maker we're facing the threat of a government shutdown later this month and yet again the administration will ultimately deal with it the same way they always do with more spending more spending equals a lower value of the dollar protect your savings by diversifying into gold with the help of the Birch gold group and here's the best part when you open a gold Ira with Birch gold for every $10,000 you spend by December 22nd Birch gold will send you a free gold bar just text Jordan to 9898917350 navigate transitioning an existing Ira or 401K into an IRA in Gold don't let your savings become a victim of the further devaluation of the dollar through more spending text Jordan to 9898 98 and so what machines did you learn to operate when you were doing your training and you also mentioned earlier that you were confident in putting yourself forward as a good Problem Solver and so what was the relationship between learning those machines when what machines did you learn and how did that facilitate your development as a problem solver interesting the first when I came out of high school my first day at that factory you know I needed a platform because I couldn't quite reach up right I was 14 years of age I couldn't reach up there was a vice grip mounted on the thing here and then there was a piece of Steel the piece of Steel was about 4 in square okay okay we uh we took two people to lift that steel P up on on the vice grip and then we had a then we had a hacksaw a metal hacksaw we had to cut a piece down 4 in square and that took uh that took maybe a week okay till we cut the thing down and then it took maybe about three four weeks we had to file it perfectly Square so that mean it's amazing thing what that leads to and how you accumulate the Precision work right I did a similar School in Canada where we where we we had a school here to teach young kids how to be D and Di makers right but anyway so you go and then we learn we learn things on the late where you make run things or milling machine and later on uh I uh computerized machines etc etc so you go to a stage right okay so anyway that's what we uh I did my first job then in Toronto as a Dulan D maker we made a Stampy die right we to maybe Punch Out pie of metal and with some holes in it and so that's basically uh what the dollar die maker does and as as you go along it gets more and more sophisticated right right so you got you got familiarized with a wide variety of tools and the ability to make Precision parts now you said you also became a good Problem Solver and then you also developed this idea that you could rent your own garage and start producing your own tools now one of the things you said was that when you went out to sell your services you told your potential customers that you could solve a problem and if you didn't they didn't have to pay you and you know the reason I want to focus on that in part is because I want to know how you develop the vision to rent that garage to begin with but also H how you knew that the proper thing to sell to potential customers was your service as a problem solver right because what you're saying to them essentially is well you guys have a problem and it's plaguing you and you need it solved and I'm the guy that can solve it and I'm willing to you know demonstrate my capabilities which is which is really an excellent approach to sales because you want to find out what the person's problem is and you want to be the solution but how did you develop that problem solving ability and your confidence in it and then why did you think it was worth taking the risk to rent that first garage Jordan you ask great questions you me those have to be answered the reason why I'm sitting here is look I want to roll off the experience I accum ated there's thousands and thousands and thousands of young Canadians out there which could do the same thing if we if we teach them the basics right and I I think a society would be much better off with thousands of smaller companies than one or two large companies right that's what that's that's the idea so anyway so I opened up that factory I I could solve a few problems I got some Waters and I I I like I said after two years I had about 20 people and I noticed my foran was a little different right because when he had just got you worked so closely together his name was Herman I said Herman what's the matter with you lately well he said Frank I'm thinking of opening my own Factory hm I said I sympathize with that I that's what I did to I said look why don't we talk tomorrow maybe we can find a better solution that evening I was talking to myself and I said to myself that if that foran's going to leave me that would stifle my grow I didn't like that the next reason was if that Foreman's going to leave me I got to do all the work myself I like to if less the third reason was if I hire a new foreman and I don't show him how to how to run the business I still got it all the work and I if I hire a new foran and I show him how businesses run it's just a question of time before he goes out it opens up his new Factory I I think the key is we need we we need those experience there is there is this huge potential right this huge energy which lies dor in people we got to teach them the right way so I think it's important while I'm still I have everything in my mind quite clearly that we record that and it's great that you your skill is to to ask the right question how come and how what right okay so I'm I'm delighted to sit here well so you you grew very rapidly so so there's two Mysteries there to me because one of the things I've noticed with small businesses for example is that it's very difficult to get your first customers right it's very difficult to get from zero to one once you have a customer or two the next customers start to be easier because you can refer them to other customers you have but getting those first people to decide that you're the person when no one else has done it or has has been willing to show that faith that can be very tricky so what do you think you manage successfully to how do you think you managed to present yourself successfully to the first people that you offered your services to well sprice and quality doesn't function right and if you have a lot of knowledge and you and you transmit that knowledge to other people then you then you can give a great service better pricing uh better functioning Machinery ped tools so that's the very key and that's what I would like to transmit so uh fortunately um around that time that's why I'm always saying life is a question of fate and circumstances being at the right place at the right time around in in the early 60s you know there was a free trade Arrangement signed with the United States and uh and I see this huge potential out there I should say I didn't finish up when I talked the next day with my foreman where yeah where I said I said to him look why don't we open up a new Factory you're own the third and I said no more overtime I own 2/3 and by by the end of the year we take Pro rers some monies out and we leave some money in for expansions he said do you mean it I said yes we went right away to a lawyer and signed the thing here and the guy hustled like crazy you know he spent more diam in there that was his Factory basically I took the next format the next form and the next form the next form I said business is easy right and then uh when I had about I think it was about uh six or seven factories and the the free trade Arrangement uh came under the being I saw there's enormous potential up there up to that now I only shared with the foran I said if I and then I got to know uh the United States Better Canada better the the power of the unions the size of the unions and I said if I if I uh I would have to do certain things to be competive so um I um I had a friend of mine machinery taer and he said I I kind of explain to him I really shook go public because I want to have the workers also participate well he says I know a I know a fellow which his name is uh I'll remember it's imel but anyway he gave me the name I I met him uh at the ski hill uh we went skiing to get up at uh at church beaks and uh he said look have uh that was magnet Electronics okay he said I have a certain I would like to R why do you why don't you sell your companies in in in in magnet electronics and and you have Clues to control and then you could put that program in that where we also where you can share the profits with workers so that's what I finally did that I was totally grean when it comes down to public company right uh I did not have total control I had a bought there right and they were more in um driving the stock up right in and the def the defense industry was very uh they were mainly magnet electronic did mainly Defense work right and that was very popular and I was an automotive and I said after a year so I said I don't think this makes a lot I said um I I I want to be out okay and I said I sell my stock on the on on on the market so they pleaded with me please sell the stock to us so they said fine no problem and uh give us a year time and I said fine they were basically okay guys but the market kind of went down uh the shares there they didn't have the monies I never suit anybody and I just said look under the circumstances you guys can't be on the board and then I put in different directors and after a while I went to the to the board and read to the public and say I for I for go about uh 25% of my stocks if you the shareholders vote for multiple vote because I came to the conclusion I want to run things and I can't have 20 guys or 50 guys left and right discussing debating forever right so uh I uh I the shareholders voted for that then I said I in the return I also give fting a certain discipline this is why I put the cor constitution in that if I had control I only could take out so much there was uh clearcut control what management uh could do and that sort of uh became the the Magna the the Magna environment but the yeah well let's go back back to your Foreman so you had said that when you made that arrangement with him that you valued his work and you wanted him around and you were concerned that if he left while all of that work would fall on your shoulders again and also stop you from moving ahead and you sat down and contemplated what sort of deal you would have to make with him in order for his needs to be met in yours and there's something very important there about the nature of a deal you know people often think that with a deal you try to win or with a deal you try to compromise but my sense with the proper negotiation is that you want to figure out what you want so that you're thrilled to progress with the deal and you want to figure out what your partner wants so he's thrilled to progress with the deal because if you set it up that way then your interests are aligned and you're both going to work as hard as you can autonomously now you knew your foremen had the same kind of entrepreneurial Vision you did and you wanted to unleash his abilities and so you offered him a third of the company you said you'd take two3 and then you said he was thrilled which is a good thing to have happen in a partner and he went off and like treated this Factory like it was his own partly because it was now and then you said you you duplicated that subsidiary structure across six factories and then expanded much more dramatically and you also at that point also noted that that principle of distributed ownership should be brought down to the workers so you were starting to develop that as an explicit philosophy now why why do you think it was that you realized that your Foreman needed ownership why do you think you were willing to Grant it to him and why do you think that the agreement that you made which was that you would own oneir of the or that he would own one3 of the company and you would own 2/3 why do you think that was a desirable and and uh a compelling motivational arrangement for your Forman first of all a deal you got to be a deal for both sides it's got to be good right and as a company grows circumstances may change a bit etc etc so you make Provisions if you can the reason why I think he he was delighted with the deal is uh when we had verbal Arrangements I never went back on my w I think that's a very key right so he felt comfortable when they say we take out the third right uh we we take out a portion in brada so he felt kind of comfortable right that I uh that I uh that's that's very crucial like later on if I if you know once when I had about 30 40 or 50 or 100 factories and I had a prospective manager which I interviewed I said look there's there the name the addresses of 100 factories whoever manager you want to want to choose and and ask him how I run things okay the message what I wanted to get across if you promise something thing you must keep it doesn't matter what the thing is because you if you got the ability can always make monies if you lose your reputation you can never repair so I think I had a reputation buil up and again when it said uh small companies you don't need uh you don't need a formal structure it's kind of loose it's pure free enterprise like when was small when I had about 20 30 or 40 work CU I showed you my bank book and said look this is our contract we have here if you do XXX I shareed with you right so you don't it's pure free enterprise and that's what I want to get across that's pure capitalism but capitalism if it don't change if you do not look like workers participate capitalistic the system is self-destructive and let me give you a quick story right I spent a lot of time in Washington at one time had a meeting with the leader of the House Mitch McConnell he's the senator from Kentucky he was the president of the Senate I had a farm in Kentucky so I knew him so I said Mitch Let's uh you know I like to see you one of those days so we arranged I met him and they said Mitch America did create why the free enterprise system and without free enterprise there's no free Society so we must do do everything we can to have free enterprise but he said free enterprise got a major problem so he said what you mean by that I said MCH more and more capital is helped by fewer and fewer and I said I said in nature when a species does not reproduce itself another species will take over and the laws of nature are much stronger than any man weight law right and that's what happens now that's the way we going to go so we got to share with the employees because without employees we can't make a profit and if employees make more money they have more purchasing power the economy functions better okay so we must we must have the large companies they must have more of a discipline because they sometimes they run by institutions by by and they have got no more affinity for people that they just look at the share price they look at the the prophets so it's not there right so uh the owners are not there anymore or so anyway we need the discipline there but but we must open up we must it's it's so crucial that small Enterprise that we don't D them up in Chains and with regulations the Bible is the root of all wisdom inspiration and spiritual nourishment

now you highlighted you highlighted three things you know the first thing you highlighted was that the people that you were negotiating could trust you now people who are cynically um critical of capitalism tend to justify that by noting the sort of winner take all problem that you described and then they presume that if you're greedy and you shovel everything towards yourself you're most likely to let's say win in the capitalist Enterprise but you pointed out something very much contrary to that three things actually the first is that you don't develop a reputation by screwing other people you develop a reputation by telling other people what you're going to do and then bloody well doing it and that you should also write down what you say you're going to do so that everybody remembers and knows exactly what the deal is that you said that by the time you were negotiating let's say with a foreman who wanted to leave you had enough track record with him of trust so that he believed that you would do what you said you were going to do and he could Envision a future with you without having to worry about your motivations so you established your trust then you also realized that he was going to be a hell of a lot more motivated if he was an owner in the system right right and so your answer to the problem of capitalism isn't exactly less capitalism it's a much more distributed and generous form of capitalism that pulls everybody the workers and in managers and owners into the profit making structure now you now the other Advantage this is so cool I because I've learned this as I've built Enterprises too if you make a really great deal with someone and the person's good and they're competent and they're honest and they're productive and they're generous if you make a really good deal with them and you can let them go off on their own that means that they're going to take care of a thousand details on their own keeping their own Affairs in order that you don't have to take care of anymore you don't have to micromanage and that means that you can go off and you know expand your Enterprise and do your own thing and so the advantage you gain by Distributing more responsibility let's say to an extremely competent Foreman the advantage you gain is massive freedom and you also gain the advantage of the fact that that foreman who now partakes in the Enterprise is going to be much more motivated to make the Enterprise work and so even if you end up paying him more like a third of the company let's say or the profit share that you described the overall profit is going to be so much greater that there's nothing in it but benefit for you and for him and then you also pointed out and this is a very crucial thing for people to understand because this is where the left-wing critic critics of C capitalism actually have a point although it's not a problem that's specific to capitalism which is that as an Enterprise grows and it doesn't matter what the Enterprise is the benefits tend to flow into the hands of fewer and fewer people and that destabilizes the whole damn Enterprise because you get too many slaves on the bottom and not enough pharaohs on the top and that produces discontent and dissatisfaction and a motivation and that can bring the whole damn system to a halt so you're Your solution to that was to set up this Constitution that you described which also enabled you to grow I'm going to review it again because it's very very important this is the economic Charter of Rights so your management philosophy is to distribute responsibility and profit and to make that an explicit part of the agreement and the deal is 20% of the profits go to the shareholders 6% to the management 10% to the workers 2% to charity 7% reinvested in um research and further development and you make That explicit now the trust you described is also crucial because the workers with whom you're arranging to share the profits aren't going to trust that deal or go along with it if they think you're going to gerrymander the books on the profit side right they have to have actually believe that you're going to play a straight game but if you can explain to them that well you're going to play a straight game because if you motivate them properly they're going to work Ah hell of a lot harder and everybody's going to make a lot more money and the products are going to have higher quality and we're going to sell more then there's absolutely nothing there for people to you know steal selfishly and run away with there's only the possibility that all that distributed responsibility and ability is going to produce more and more well it's going to be more and more productive and more and more generous now I asked you when we met at the restaurant a couple of months ago whether or not you had run into labor problems as you grew because going from you know no employees to 100,000 you're obviously going to be dealing with potential labor issues and you'' said that as a consequence of this Constitution and the trustworthiness of the process that you've had that you've been able to pay your workers a premium rate but that you've also had almost no labor trouble is that is that correct if I got that right yeah that's that is correct cor and uh the interesting part about it is uh we were basically in the automobile industry and the order Workers Union was maybe the strongest Union in America right okay so anyway um the president of the Canadian order Workers Union his name was basag or still is in is his name and I called him and I said MERS let's have lunch the two of us we have an obligation uh what are we going to do to maintain jobs and create new jobs I said let's have lunch so we agreed and then we sat down and said bu it shouldn't be that difficult to put on one page what's important for the workers and on one page what's important for business and we call that a framework of economic Justice after a few weeks we we we managed it a bit we agreed on the thing on on on that structure he said to me I I might not get a true to my membership okay and but he did get it through and we we incorporated that huh we took two factories where we said look we're going to try and see how that works right the part was our workers were very upset they said look all we we find we are happy you want to change a total different thing here I took I took a I said look I have an obl an obligation we live in a society we are a very important part of that Society we got to find ways and means can we learn from that right because when I made my you know if you have a few 100 factories when I made my rounds I made it a haveit always to at least uh every months I see maybe a new a factory which I haven't seen for a while when I made my rounds I got the workers together and they said look those are the basic principles but they said let's make one thing clear no government can guarantee your chops no Union can guarantee your chobs not even magnet can guarantee a chobs but I'm the head of the magnet I can guarantee one thing the basic principles and that is the very key as it is if we if labor and man management work together and make a quality product that's the best guarantee that's the best guarantee and we can make the quality product if we if we communicate and we put a very important structure in in our company right we ordered the human capital it's a very it's a very unusual thing here first of all I put in a hotline I had some trusted people and we got a big uh notice on and and uh in the factories if you're unhappy with something that something discrimination or unfairness or woman get bested by whatever it is call a hotline but you don't have to give your name and I had people then investigate those were thrusted people and now when I would talk with managers they said that's one of the best things you did because the first reaction when it did that they said the man said are you spying on us they were unhappy but now it's other because if you have an unhappy employee unhappiness is contagious if you got unhappy employees there's no way you can make a quality product at a competitive price so that's very uh so we've done that on a verbal thing where we have a then we did actually an a uh written a human audit where an employee got anope with no name on it no no and they could take it home and fill it out you know various question is it safe is it fair discrimination or whatever you could fill it out and there's only one in in in in an envelope no name on it and you drop it in a in a box and it's collected and then we analyze it and we could see right away if there was a problem okay we could see it so that is another worry uh because as a manager let's say uh the average Factory was about 200 people in hour in hour and that's another very important thing to become I always had efficiency experts come to me Christ together with 400 factors reduce it you know reduce it maybe to 20 or whatever that means to have maybe maybe 5 10,000 people per Factory people become a number it doesn't work it doesn't work right so we look you should never forget the human side right by having smaller factories and we let's say the factor is located more in the Northerly region it's run like a factory right if hunting season comes and some people want to take some time off other people jump in I said like I cover for you I work the extra time it's it's it's everything relates the people to work has got to be an equal and I said to myself and I said to the managers your number one thing is every day you got to work are you respected by the workers that's your main name you got got to be respected and once when you build that thing then you be productive right you be they think of the workers think of better ways to make things right and there and business is easy all you have to do is make a better product for a better price that's as easy as it is according to a recent report Planned Parenthood continues to rake in billions despite dwindling clients the biggest takeaway here is that Planned Parenthood is gener generating vast profits including millions in taxpayer funding with the help of pre-born you and me we are stealing their clientele meaning the babies they are trying to kill pre-born operates on a very slim budget as they rescue over 200 babies lives every day and they receed no Government funding pre-born network of clinics are situated in the darkest corners competing head-to-head with the abortion Giants they need our help now more than ever when you donate $28 to pre-born you will offer a free ultrasound to expectant mother caught in crisis once she hears that Harpy and sees that precious life her baby's chance at life doubles if you would like to sponsor a precious baby's life your gift will be tax deductible and will go directly towards saving babies lives dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby or visit preborn docomo all gifts are tax deductible you will never regret saving a child's life that's pound 250 baby or visit preborn doccom Jordan so you pointed out there are a number of things that are extremely interesting so one of them imagine that you're trying to differentiate your Enterprise as it grows you have 100,000 employees and obviously there has to be a hierarchy between you and them the question is what size should the pieces of that hierarchy be you know there's an anthropological literature that relates cortical expansion so brain size to average group size in primate communities and the optimized group size for human beings seems to be something around 200 what generally happens in Hunter gather societies is that if a society exceeds about 200 individuals it'll break into two separate societies that's very common and I think the reason for that is well I think the reason for that is the one that you just pointed out is that there's a once a network of associations gets to be too big you stop having that personal connection with people and you start to become a number like I've certainly seen this in educational institutions you know the huge universities reduce the University students to numbers they're irrelevant there's no personal relationship and so the students end up feeling alienated and that demolishes their motivation and you know in the typical educational apparatus in the higher education field you have a 40% Dropout in the first year and that OB that's a catastrophic figure and I know a college um Hillsdale College is small place it's only got 12200 people and it's hierarchically organized they've managed to get their dropout rate down to 1% so 40% is an absolute crime now you how do you do you talked about human audit you also talked about allowing employees to put forward their concerns and and and and to indicate their unhappiness with process and to bring new ideas to the Forefront without having to worry that they were going to be targeted for doing so and that was very effective so you set up communication networks in your factories and you kept them small so you could do that how do you guys do in terms of employee wages in terms of per capita employee productivity and with regard to turnover well uh first of I want to listen to you there is in universities uh lecture course or what what is the optimum uh people uh on the leadership Etc and how many people are below or whatever it's 200 right so I should go back to school to maybe learn more about that so that's but in in in practice you you you you you get to know you learn as you go along in practice uh in every business might be a little different right okay but in now thing it it what I could see about a factory with 200 people the manager had to again and practic know everybody by his first name and how is how is Billy your son how is he in football it's it's that kind of environment right a chel and not not a phony one right not not a phony one because employees will realize if it's phony you know or if it's genuinely me right it's very crucial right so so anyway um over the years I gave a lot of lectures in universities and always starts the the students when they started out the success of Life can only be measured the degree of happiness you reach you have but I said let me tell you from my experience it's a lot easier to be happy if you got some monies the smart students always if ask well how can we make some money is so I said Lu if you be around 20 in your early 20s you don't know yourself that well experiment a bit do something what you enjoy when you enjoy something you're going to be good in it if you put in the extra effort you could be one of the best whatever it is if you be one of the best money is a byproduct but I said but one thing don't forget you must not forget get life has been great to you your parent sacrificed that you perhaps went to school you have a right to use that knowledge what you accumulated in school for your own benefits but never forget a portion of that wisdom of that knowledge got to go back to Society for to a better Society but the very interesting thing is it's only the last number of years I came to the conclusion that look we have no faculties right they mean as far as I un as as I can see universities their mandate is to teach young people can we have a more civilized society or be more specific can we teach young people can we as a university participate to develop a structure which could lead to anide society that should be the main focus of of a university yes we in universities we teach great medicine and great art great sport great technology but we do not teach you know what is the structure of an ideal Society but it don't me in the United States about 70% of the universities are subsidized for private IND industry and in Canada 100% under the provincial jurisdiction okay 100% subsidized and management doesn't doesn't want to bite the hand which feeds them okay but luckily I could I could convince the minister of Education of of of universities till around and uh I think I'm doing a series in search of the ideal structure which would lead to night till satday your your workers um you've had little labor trouble formally how do you know that your workers are in fact like comparatively well paid in relationship to other Enterprises of your type and how do you guys do in terms of retention and promotion well we have uh we do constantly a survey the corporate Constitution says the wages got the be average to the competition within the region and the profits uh the profets at lay town we had a formula it's not up to a manager say I like that person or this or that she's beautiful or whatever uh it's we have a formula the formula was based based upon we wanted to reward loyalty and suppose you get a point for year you've been with the company suppose you've been with the company five years you get five points for loyalty and suppose you get a point for the $5,000 you earn and suppose you earn 50,000 you get them points for knowledge right and the more points you have uh the more you share out of the out of the B right but it's preformulated right so we want to we want to reward loyalty and performance the managers are separate right they purely they purely particip participate in their Factory I've always said there is no bad employees only bad managers and the bad or there's very few bad manage or let me rephrase it there's few uh there's some managers which need more learning experience right but there's very few bad man but there's no bad employees okay because we uh it's our thing to it's it's it's our thing to assist them in in learning and what makes a factory run and they care I guess as a businessman it's what makes the economy run in a country the the economy we need a new model of the economy and I I I think I Canada could be the first country with uh with an economic CH of Rights it an economic charters of Rights it's fundamental how many companies okay you've had a lot of success with this particular model of corporate governance and it's allowed you to grow very rapidly to to develop a very large Enterprise and to maintain it across now quite a long time because it's about 50 years 70 years 70 years that's very long in the corporate world how widespread have your ideas of constitutional profit sharing become and what H in your view has been the impediment to their wider acceptance well keep in mind I was for many years on the corporate governance Board of nastic or the New York Stock Exchange okay where we take a look uh minority interest or or the market not uh behaving properly right and we worked at we interfaced with the sex Security Commission and and brought forward that the market needs changing okay there's no different in in in in here it's it's a constant and it should be done within within the company right and uh so it's expected that the management uh live to certain standards employees have to live in society we have to teach standards we have to uh we we don't teach enough our kids what it's all about okay and U I moved to after I finished my schooling in Austria I moved to Switzerland right uh and um I U it was a a great learning experience it's a great country with great people it's made relative easy to to to to demand a referendum okay and so on important things they have a r referendums said about two years I I think it was in the wall stre Journal Swiss Swiss people defeated the referendum to have more vacation I think the referendum was to move the vacation up from 3 weeks to five weeks the the people defeated it and said we cannot afford it right right it's the ultimate democracy so why why why have the ideas that you've put forward in relationship to the corporate Constitution not being accepted and implemented by more companies do you think I mean your model has shown that if you're more generous with the profit distribution and if you formalize that distribution you seem to gain an increment productivity and so why also given the fact that you know Capital tends to acre in the hands of fewer and fewer people what and that that's a problem for the maintenance of the popularity of the capitalist system in general why do you think your economic model hasn't met with more acceptance is it just that it's too new you know I mean new new ideas take a long time to distribute what's the impediment sure I wrot a book to Greed Factor right and Homo sapiens are born with some greed without greed homo saion cannot exist and uh but greed after a certain thing it's the most destructive for us so uh like I said I've pinned uh on the corporate governance Bo it's what an education we've make it too complicated for public companies right the paragraphs like I mean it's it's so complicated that uh um it's just a fe anymore right so young entrepreneurs think Ah that's it's it's and and so everything is more complicated so we got to get back again and there was nothing wrong with Canada about uh about 40 50 60 years ago uh so uh everything functioned quite well so we have we have gotten into that uh where we where we analyze where we where we look when you look at our what the best the best way to to bring it across is when you take a look our our Dax code codex it's a deck book with thousands of paragraphs keep in mind when I fully run maget I had 20 lawyers on one side of my office and 20 Financial exports just on the other side when I went to the lawyers since I like to do XXX is that within the law why say that's within the law I went to the thing here now how is it treated from a tax point of view after after a week you know you got the thing it's so comply it's so gray it could be the way but they said there's some there's some experts down in the city which uh so you gift you you you you sent them the problem or the clarification after a few weeks they get a Big Bill and they they can be either way so everything every every paragraph there's there's thousands and thousands they more convoluted than the others until we have a a tax system black and white where every can fill out down we have how can a society function the Dax system is is slandered in favor of of of uh specialized interest groups that's the Dilemma Al so you mentioned earlier in our conversation that you believe that it would be very difficult for you to start your you know dual garage basic Factory today that the regulatory burden would be just too high and so you know as societies move forward in time they tend to acrew more and more rules right they tend to stagnate themselves and that's a constant danger I mean one of the advantages to the capitalist system is that large unwieldy Enterprises that no longer function get killed by the market and disappear and we don't really have an equivalent function of death let's say in the bureaucratic realm we have elections but that doesn't really affect the bureaucratic state do you have any sense of how it might be possible to clear out some of the regulations that are impeding entrepreneurial development and do you have you had any success in talking to politicians let's say in Canada about how that some of that house cleaning might occur the politicians can't do it I could give you many reasons or maybe some other times we have a little more time but again I want to point out no chainsaw approach every it's not the fault of the bureaucrats it's the fault of the system but one be a civilized way will be not to rehire till he reach a certain status right and it's got to relate to the gitt to uh you know to the to the to the GDP to uh what we what we can create it needs X same as a a management needs X manages the same a society could have where on the bureaucratic side a certain percentage related to to the market to what does the country produce let's talk a little bit about the future now one of the things we discussed when we first met was a new product that you're bringing to Market and um on on the cheap and easily accessible Transportation side especially for urban commuters do you want to talk about the product that you guys are bringing to Market soon and and where you're going to build that and what your vision is for that yes about two years ago the premier called me and he said I got a problem I said what he said Channel Motors is closing you know the car industry I got inducted in the American Automotive h of Fame in 2018 so I said yeah give me give me a few days give me a week I'll bring forward something at around that time I I had to go down down a few times I should say the Magna head office is an aurora which is about um uh about 21 minutes down to the 41 right uh so anyway around that time I had to go down down a few times would used to take me half an hour from the outer ring to the inner ring to Bay Street now would take if everything is fine would take an hour but you could take two hours so I got stuck a few times two hours and I said what a what a waste of human energy what a waste of of nonrenewable energies but most of all what a what a to inhale the carbon monoxide for two hours on the way in two hours home you know I said what what damage that does to to to to the to the health to the wellbeing of people so anyway I went back to the workbench okay I should say Magna is a major Cafe manufacturing company we have one Factory where we produce all the Mini Coopers for the whole world that be shipped out of out of our factories right under the showrooms right across the world we developed the a Martin to repeat you know right from our Factory sh Shi to the showrooms a very unique car no welding no screwing it was built like an airplane it was glued together right but anyway so I I I I think uh I've done that for 60 years I came to the conclusion it's got to be a small electric car I think we qu the phrase micromobility and in loose terms micro Mobility means you need uh you you got to be able to park at least four of those in a regular car parking spot to be more precise if they cannot be wider than three and A2 ft not longer than 7 ft and you can plug it in in any electrical out Outlet 1 then W and uh in a few hours you can go 100 Kil kilometers with it for less than a dollar you can have a quick charging too so it will change uh Transportation its main purpose is to get people from your home to your workplace and back home we also done an equivalent small pick pickup truck which will do in City uh merchandise delivery and I should be in mass production about 2 three months uh the fact is just around we got the first brother dice coming after L and it will change uh it will change uh transportation for many reasons the primary reason is there's only so much oil in the grounds the reason why gasoline prices are relative cheap years the United States is utilizing 120 million tons of grain to convert it into ethanol to keep the gasoline price down you can't do that for long because the next wave will be Or the critical wave for society will be food shortages in the world not triggered by the UK it would have come anyway but will be accelerated quicker by what goes on in the Ukraine because the Ukraine is a major food producer so and the United States can't do that so the gasoline prices will up dramatically I would say will double in two three years but most of all I predicted 8 years gasoline will be rationalized will only be available for essential purposes one of the essential purpose will be electric trucks not electric butd me gasoline trucks will hold the food from the Farms to the cities because the the crit power will not be there for large electric trucks or you will not solve the traffic change because there is the crit power isn't there it would take much time to to and you might have to go with small atomic power stations right but that but that's that's another thing here right but the git system isn't there at uh I built the first hydrogen car with BMW about uh yeah about 15 years ago yes it works but much more Compass are much more expensive and I I see a small electric car you know uh uh that's the answer for now for the next 50 hundred years do you want to talk a little bit about what it looks like and and and and what people can expect what people can expect to see and experience when they when they use this particular vehicle okay they're basically small right we again its main purpose is to go from your home to your workplace and back home okay and that mean means we have stifled uh the the speed at 32 kilm per hour right so basically the insurance be so minimal of practically none because you can't do any damage so and um two people can sit in a car and people in a pickup truck there's four people can sit in there it could be a taxi it could be a uh uh you know merchandise delivery uh vehicle so um yeah I think we we have uh we showed it on the Canadian Auto Show we had the biggest lineups and thousands of people drove it they got all enthusiastic about it and um the key question is how do we got to get around that's the key question right well it looked like it looked like a kind of of a hybrid between electric car and a and a motorcycle essentially and the you mentioned as well you know that many families have a conundrum where because there are two people working and they tend to work in different locations that they need two vehicles and one of the vehicles and both vehicles are very expensive and they're they're overdetermined for the purpose people need um a commuter vehicle essentially as well as an ordinary vehicle to do all the other things they need to do with it and your sense was that this vehicle would Supply a lowcost alternative to people who need primarily need transportation to work and back and who wouldn't be using the vehicle who would be using their other vehicle for primary purposes other than that does that seem about right uh a few changes uh when I look when I look down the road uh now usually call it the metal glasses of two car garage two cars right because um the husband May went to work in must some cases the the the wife do but in many cases the wife stayed home she kids had to bring their kids to school or the shopping etc etc so when I look down the road I think I need a special permit for a large electric car for a family that you could go to the cottage or that for special purpose not for daily commute huh okay and you have two or three uh you can in you could actually could get four small cars in there in a regular two car garage and this is where cats or see their friends or where the wife or the husband go shopping so you to run around right to to things meet up with your friends and go to school or whatever go to work and just uh it's reliable transport at at low cost and no l cleanhouse CES I would I would like to thank you very much for the time you spent today I I very think it's very useful to explain to people I think it's extremely useful to have explained to people uh CH I don't want to flatter you you are gifted to bring out the inner workings of of a lot of Machinery a lot of people and that's you know as a technician yes i' be able to trans reasonable well but you have a gift to transmit it that it be easily understood by the people so I'm delighted that I came I'm delighted that I was invited well it's it's so what what struck me in our conversations was the importance of disseminating your vision for fostering a generous productivity you know you created an Enterprise that's distributed you said that you've made millionaires out of many of your foremen out of people who Rose to the position where they could run their own factories you you've given people the opportunity to have a tremendous amount of autonomy under your overarching Authority and to bring out the best of them as they build their own factories and as they employ more and more people and you've managed also to distribute that responsibility and opportunity all the way down to the workers and you know it's absolutely obvious to me that there's never been a more effective machine for producing wealth than the free exchange capitalist system the data on that are crystal clear as soon as you stop countries from doing absolutely idiotic economic things and free up their population under a quasi capitalist market then everybody becomes richer you then you have the emergent problem of inequality and that's a problem but your system of distributed profits given that it's honestly run is a reasonable solution to that problem and it's it's very good to hear you talk about how motivated you've been to build the company and and to produce all the products you have but also how much you've been able to motivate other people while being productive and solving the problem of unequal distribution so thank you very much for bringing that to everyone's attention I I got I got I had a few more words my motivation was never to be hungry anymore and live in dignity and the reason is it's very important if a manager let's say a magnet manager wanted to make more money he had to replace himself and has to open up another Factory so a manager could replace himself maybe 20 30 or 50 times and then he gets a cut from each Factory where he made a contribution a percentage of the profits and this way some of them uh their yearly income maybe was 5 million or 10 million so the more they made the more the shareh olders made the more more workers made so we when I said it's so important that we have that we have smaller companies that young kids got to see I want to be able to do like like CH BR I want to I want to make 50 million or 100 million or or like the football player like the hockey player we must give him the motivation right but Let It Be Right some people are quite happy with XXX let it be let everybody I love the Beet their song let it be let it be let everybody be let everybody be let everybody find their own rate their happiness thank you my pleasure man to everybody watching and listening thank you very much for your time and attention the film crew up here in Northern Ontario and uh down where Frank is thank you for the Flawless technical um the provision of flawless teex technical expertise on this front to the Daily we Plus for making these conversations possible I'm going to continue talking to Mr Frank stronic for another half an hour on the dailywire plus platform um a Bastion of free speech in an increasingly sensorial world and so if those of you who are watching and listening are inclined to devote your attention uh to that platform that would be much appreciated and maybe increasingly necessary as the months unfold um I'm looking forward to coming and looking at your factory Mr stronic I think that would be very much fun it's I I love looking at Industrial Enterprises because well it's lovely to see that much concerted and harmonious effort working out to produce things that people actually need I really wish you luck with your new vehicle um I I hope that you've hit the market dead on and that people find this vehicle you know inexpensive reliable and useful like many of your other products have been and so that would be a lovely thing to see it would be great to see that happening in Canada because uh we lack a little entrepreneurial Zing at the moment and that's that's not as it should be and so I I I didn't get in the most important message what's my call my main name is my main name is I got about 10 15 years ago very heavily in the agriculture the de I got into it the more I could see this chemical jungle you know with all the pesticide and all the fungicide so 95% of the food eaten comes from industrial Farms on Industrial Farms is see no more Fly Away there's no more pheasants there's no more Rapids we spray everything with Fungicide and pesticides it gets in the air we breat it gets in water we drink it gets in the soil we eat the food and all the kids practice Val cheese and Stage to diabetics ear on the rise so my main aim is my main goal is I don't every I don't want to see any Canadian kid to go to school hungry that means breakfast got to be served I don't want to see any Canadian kid to leave this girl hungry that means lunch has got to be served and by law it would the state it has to be organic I got every reasonable everything in but there's lots more do where the public should know thank you I enjoyed being with you my pleasure man and uh we'll we'll meet in a couple of minutes on the daily wire side and then again in the future and thanks again everybody for for watching and listening today [Music]
