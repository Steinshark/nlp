hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about b-map which is a great way to compare engines and it allows us to answer some fascinating questions like how is the ford mustang's engine more impressive than ferrari's 800 horsepower v12 what's so embarrassing about rolls-royce twin turbo v12 engine how much power can naturally aspirated engines actually make what are the limits to modifying naturally aspirated engines so some very cool conclusions to come from this video and it's all based on break mean effective pressure or b-map so what's b-map inside your engine you have little explosions occurring and those little explosions force your piston from the very top down to the very bottom and in doing so it rotates the crankshaft brake mean effective pressure is the average pressure pressing this piston down from the very top down to the very bottom that gives you the measured torque that you find at the crankshaft so it's not an actual measurement of the cylinder pressures during that power stroke but rather the average pressure and so this is a useful measurement for seeing how efficient an engine is at producing torque based on its displacement so how do you calculate break mean effective pressure that's the challenging question that leads to our very cool conclusions so it all starts with our very simple equation work equals force times distance so if i have a car and i press on this car with a certain force over a certain distance the amount of work that i performed is equal to the force that i pressed on it multiplied by the distance it traveled that's how much work there was now power is simply taking work and incorporating time so how quickly i move the car that's power so if we take work equals force times distance and then we divide that force multiplied by distance by time now we have power so i'm going to write this power equation two different ways power equals work divided by time and because we know work equals force times distance power equals force times distance divided by time so we're going to start by analyzing this equation right here and so we need to understand work and time in terms of engines so let's start by looking at work we know work is equal to force times distance what does that mean within an engine so in an engine you have pressure forcing that piston down it's stroke length and so the force is equal to the pressure multiplied by the surface area of that piston that flat area above the piston forcing it down and the distance that it is traveling is the stroke so we have our mean effective pressure the average pressure that we're pushing this piston down multiplied by the area of that piston top multiplied by the stroke to figure out how much work we have now the area of that piston top multiplied by the stroke is also the displacement of the engine so another way of writing this is work equals the mean effective pressure that pressure pushing down multiplied by the engine's displacement so now we have the work portion of our equation as it relates to engines but what about the time portion so with engines typically for time we use revolutions per minute crankshaft revolutions per minute or rpm now let's get a base unit of seconds and say revolutions per second so going back to our initial equation power equals work over time we can say that power equals work multiplied revolutions per second that will still give us units of work over time so work times revolution per second now with a four stroke engine we only have one power stroke for every two revolutions of that crank shift so we have to divide that work multiplied by revolutions per second by two if this was a two-stroke engine we would not divide by two so now let's summarize everything we've learned by combining it all into one equation so we know power equals work multiplied by revolutions per second divided by two we substitute in our equation for work so we have work equals mean effective pressure times our displacement multiplied by revolutions per second divided by two and so this is one half of the total equation that we need to determine what is our mean effective pressure so now let's go back to our original power equation that we derived power equals force times distance divided by time now another way of writing this is saying force times distance divided by time now distance over time is speed so we can write this as force times velocity power equals force times velocity now again we want to relate all of this back to cars and engines so if we're looking at our equation power equals force times velocity well torque is equal to a force multiplied by a radius so if we divide that radius over another way of writing force is to say force is equal to torque divided by radius now what about our velocity so think about a wheel rotating so we know how far a wheel rotates in one revolution that's its circumference how many times is it spinning per second that's its rotational speed so if we multiply those two together we can get its actual velocity in this direction so revolutions per second multiplied by its circumference which can be calculated by 2 pi r so another way of writing this equation is to say that power is equal to torque divided by r that's our force multiplied by our velocity revolutions per second times two pi r as you can see the two r's cancel out so power is equal to two pi multiplied by torque multiplied by revolutions per second just one step left here we go so now we have two different equations for power we have this one that we derived right here and then we have this one which we derived right here so all we do is simply set them equal to each other so as you can see here you carry this 2 over that gives you 4 pi torque times revolutions per second you have revolutions per second on both sides so you can cancel that out and you divide your displacement over to this side and that gives you mean effective pressure is equal to 4 pi multiplied by your torque divided by your engine's displacement and so this is ultimately our equation for break mean effective pressure so you're wondering where does this b come from well all that means is we're simply taking the torque measured at the crankshaft so our brake mean effective pressure simply means that our torque was measured at the crankshaft now is all of this just a glorified way of talking about torque per liter well yes that's basically what the equation boils down to but think about how much more interesting people will find you at parties when you say words like break mean effective pressure instead of torque they'll walk away from you alright so let's do a real world example and so we're going to analyze the ferrari 812 super fast which has one of the most powerful naturally aspirated engines to ever go in a road car nearly 800 horsepower so this vehicle produces 718 newton meters of torque at 7 000 rpm so if you use metric units for this equation right here that will give you a final result in pascals i'm going to do a little bit of conversion so that my final result will be in bar so break mean effective pressure equals 4 pi multiplied by our torque 718 newton meters divided by our displacement 6.496 liters it's a 6.5 liter engine and then we're going to multiply it by 100 once again to get it in units of bar so this gives us 13.9 bar which is actually a really good number so i looked at and calculated about a hundred different uh break mean effective pressures for a bunch of different cars out there and most of them fall between 12 and 13. a good number of them you will find between about 11 and 14. and so you know here is where our ferrari is kind of on the high end of that scale and then very rarely did i see anything that actually stepped outside of that between about 10 and 15. now here's the fun part of looking at the different cars out there and then seeing where they fall on this scale i was curious you know if anything could actually reach beyond 15 for its break mean effective pressure so just looking through some different examples here the brand new corvette has a bright mean effective pressure of about 13 a 2016 mazda mx-5 perhaps the greatest sports car of all time well that was falling uh you know an average 12.6 uh the lowest number i could find for a modern vehicle 2020 mitsubishi mirage was 10.6 this vehicle doesn't even produce 100 horsepower now something i was very surprised by looking at the new mustang gt which has a 5 liter engine produces 420 pound-feet of torque its brake mean effective pressure 14.2 putting it ahead of the ferrari 812 super fast how unbelievable is that that it has more torque per liter uh than something that extraordinarily expensive and super fast another very cool one porsche gt3 rs 14.8 so way out here the porsche gt3 rs quite an impressive engine in there but wait lexus lfa very high revving naturally aspirated engine 12.6 proving once again that the mazda mx-5 is just as cool as alexis lfa and then finally our king here the highest number i found searching around at different cars and engine variants ferrari 458 15.1 it breaks the scale that i made up but very cool nonetheless furry 458 extreme amount of torque per liter about 400 pound-feet of torque coming out of a 4.5 liter engine so then i started looking at you know what makes an engine fall in this region right here what commonalities do these engines have and some of the common things that i saw uh one a big one was a high compression ratio so ferrari four five eight was about 14 to one gt3 rs that was 13.3 that's a very high compression ratio now that said this was at a 13.6 compression ratio the mustang's at a 12 to one and so it's still got a very high number even though the compression ratio isn't that 14 to 1 like the ferrari also the engines tended to be high revving that were on this side of the spectrum and that tends to leave engines which have a short stroke so that they can rev higher so part of why i believe this is is because as you have those high revving engines you start to have really high air velocities entering that engine and so this is helpful because you can tune your intakes in a way that you can actually have more air go into that engine than atmospheric pressure so outside pressure is what you have to deal with but you want to get the pressure in that cylinder as high as possible 100 volumetric efficiency means you would have that atmospheric pressure within that engine some naturally aspirated engines are actually capable of getting greater than atmospheric pressure in that engine so you use the velocity of the air coming in to help build pressure within that and then you can use the tuning of those intake manifolds the runner lengths in order to make sure that the pressure increases during that intake stroke so you can actually have volumetric efficiencies i saw a study from the 1980s that was saying they were seeing as high as 120 volumetric efficiency meaning 20 higher than atmospheric pressure so getting those high revs tuning those intakes helping you bring in as much air as possible and then compressing that air as much as possible is what's going to give you a ton of torque per liter now it's very important that when you use brake mean effective pressure to compare two different engines that the engines are similar so that's why everything that i compared here is naturally aspirated gasoline power once you start looking at things like turbochargers or different fuels then the comparison is no longer relevant for example looking at a chevy malibu it has a break mean effective pressure of 22.2 bar so it's better than everything else right no it just has a turbocharger that forces a ton of air into that engine so it's able to create really high pressures within the cylinder but all of these vehicles are using the exact same variable atmospheric pressure and yet their torque delivery is very different so again you only compare similar vehicles now if we were to look at one of the most impressive naturally aspirated engines out there we could go to the 2008 formula one season these were 2.4 liters making about 750 horsepower and these had a break mean effective pressure of about 15.5 now this is also of course using a different fuel so it's not straight up pump gas that you would be putting into your mustang but you can see you know ferrari actually getting really close to that with the 458 so it's pretty neat to see you know how close to the limit ferrari really is getting with that four five eight now if we were to look at something crazy like koenigsegg's new two liter tiny friendly giant engine well this has a break mean effective pressure of 37.9 and this sounds insane but then you find out that it has two bar of boost so it's effectively putting three times as much air into the cylinders so if you divide its break mean effective pressure by three well then you get a number of 12.7 so suddenly it doesn't sound quite as impressive so what about top fuel drag racing these are some of the craziest engines out there so one of them was measured in 2015 at having 8 000 pound feet of torque coming from an 8.2 liter engine which gives it a break mean effective pressure of about 166 absolutely absurd but then once you realize you know the manifold pressure is 65 psi over four times the amount of air going into those cylinders and then you account for the fuel's energy density then you get down to a number closer to about 17 for its break mean effective pressure and that's not accounting for timing advantages of that fuel or cooling advantages of having so much fuel being injected in so again it's only important that you compare engines that are similar naturally aspirated engines are really the best case here and one that i found you know this was the most interesting to me was the 2015 rolls-royce ghost which has a twin turbocharged v12 engine producing 575 pound-feet of torque and surprisingly its break mean effective pressure was 14.9 which is like what the ferrari a naturally aspirated engine is able to produce more torque per liter a greater pressure within its cylinders than something that has twin turbos so that was pretty crazy to see now why is this the case well it's because they have tiny little turbos on this giant v12 that spool up really quickly at 1 500 rpm and they likely don't provide all that much boost so you get an engine that's responsive probably doesn't have a whole lot of turbo lag but it is kind of funny that a naturally aspirated engine can actually produce greater pressure within the cylinder than a twin turbocharged v12 now another fascinating thing you can do with this information is try to determine how much power you can make by modifying your naturally aspirated engine for example let's say you calculate your car's brake mean effective pressure to be 11. well that's pretty low so you know that in general engines have a lot more potential to make power let's say this is a 2-liter engine we're modifying and with modifications you're able to increase the b-map to 12. well you could see the peak power increase from 150 to 160 horsepower and if you increase to the very limit of what naturally aspirated engines are capable of still at 6000 rpm and a beam up of 15 like the ferrari 458 well now you have an engine making 200 horsepower but what if you could increase how high the engine revs and still maintain that level of torque if you could increase your rpm from 6000 up to 9000 rpm through modifications well now you're at horsepower now in reality it's unlikely that peak torque would correlate with peak power so your peak power would likely be a bit less than 300 in this example but ultimately if your engine has a low brake mean effective pressure it may have potential for decent power gains without adding boost but if your naturally aspirated engine already has a super high b map you're probably not going to create massive horsepower or torque improvements through modification because the engine is already so well designed for high torque now none of this is to say that significantly increasing an engine's bmap without boost is going to be cost effective but nonetheless it's a tool that you can use to analyze where your engine is at if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below thanks for watching
