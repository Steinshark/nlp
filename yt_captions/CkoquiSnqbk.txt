the f-150 lightning is the iphone of pickup trucks like it's not new new we've had pickup trucks before but this is the first very clearly in a new generation that will all be different and so lightning also lightning so [Music] okay so if you've ever driven around the united states and just looked for more than a few seconds you'll find it impossible not to notice that there are ford f-150s everywhere and it's not just on construction sites it's on the roads it's at grocery stores it's taking the kids to school it has been the most popular vehicle not the most popular truck the best selling vehicle in america for the past 30 plus years in a row and it shows and so that's exactly why the f-150 lightning is a really big deal especially for ford it's kind of like you probably know someone like this people who have older iphones who are not really considering getting any other phone other than a new iphone don't really know which new iphone but eventually they will upgrade to one of the newer iphones it might not be you and i but there's a lot of people just like that here with their ford trucks so i've been driving and living with the all-electric f-150 lightning for a couple days now enjoying its tons of features living in a world of an electric pickup truck and i am very impressed but it's not me they have to impress it's the whole world of f-150 loyalists and pickup truck buyers that are waiting for the next convincing f-150 upgrade before they buy one again basically if the future of cars is electric then this is one of the most important cars in the world so in a lot of ways it doesn't actually matter how this thing drives like i could talk to you all day about driving dynamics but most people buying a truck like this aren't too concerned with that but the fact is it is actually better than a regular f-150 in a couple of ways one it's much quieter you can turn on the propulsion sound which i haven't but it's very quiet for a truck and then two it is much smoother i'm a big fan of the one pedal driving option a lot of evs don't have the option you should always have the option this gives you that so the regenerative braking is pretty smooth the pedal calibration is pretty smooth and overall it's it drives pretty well and if you want to kick it in a straight line you definitely can this happens to be the first f-150 with independent rear suspension and that's actually just a result of the way they built the car with the battery pack underneath but otherwise it drives the same way as the other f-150s if you're used to a big truck it drives like a big truck if you're used to being high above the road it's still high above the road and that's actually important it's got to feel familiar it's got to feel like the truck you're used to and in so many ways it still does just a little better but clearly it does not look too out of place on a road i drive past other f-150s all the time it looks exactly the same from the outside if you don't look at the badges if you don't know what to look for as far as the bar headlights and the bar tail lights yeah this is very much familiar and that's a good thing it's supposed to be we just need an ev version of a car that's already very well accepted and ford did that with the name mustang but they really did it with the entire truck here with the f-150 even if nothing else is different about the f-150 lightning against the gas f-150 lightning the one thing it does have is called the mega power frunk which will make a lot of sense if i open it it beeps for a second to let me know it's going to open then it opens to reveal 400 liters or 14 cubic feet of enclosed storage which pickup trucks normally don't have that's bigger than the trunk of a toyota corolla so it's a real trunk you can put up to 400 pounds of stuff in here there is a false floor at the bottom underneath which you will find space for your charging cable but even without that there's plenty of space for bags grocery shopping you can fit a full set of golf clubs in here like i've done in the past but it's also called the mega power frunk because you can kind of just operate again work out of the front there's four full-size outlets over here a usb-c port a a port or if you just want to use it as a tailgating but what's the opposite of a tailgate whatever as a cooler you can fill it with ice and there's a drain hole in the bottom so this becomes the place where you sort of party out of your truck it's just multi-purpose in every way but really the cherry on top is this is the feature that would visually differentiate it and make it obvious that this truck was different from the others like this would pull up in a parking lot alongside all the rest of the other trucks there and no one would bat an eye unless you recognize the badging or the tail light bar or the headlight bar you wouldn't know but the second the front truck opens that's when other truck owners heads would turn like wait that that's not the same thing as a truck i have so that is the main fun part of the lightning's mega power frunk you can also fit a human body in it so i could point out the work truck theme and how it's present all over the f-150 lightning but it would also be kind of redundant because that's all over every f-150 you know spray-in truck liner how massive this thing is all the measuring equipment on the side but my favorite part is definitely how many power outlets this thing has and everything it can power because it's essentially a giant battery bank probably the biggest battery bank you'll ever have so the trunk has a whole bunch of 120 volt outlets it has a 240 volt outlet that's your power tools your air compressor whatever else you want it to be but then the inside of the cab you've got full-size outlets in there too usb ports wireless charging the frunk like i said also has power but the best part of it is the truck can power your house if you wanted it to so ford sells an inverter you put it in your garage and you plug this thing in and it can back up your house if it loses power for days at a time several times the size of a tesla power wall so that's pretty sick i guess the point i'm making is even though i'm not in the market for an f-150 lightning i love this thing some new evs are super different from the rest of the company's lineup but as i keep saying this one's basically the same and that's on purpose of course the similarity in parts makes for much easier cheaper manufacturing which by the way is already top-notch from the company that literally invented the assembly line and the familiarity of the f-150 brand lends itself to people being more likely to give it a shot but also not only is this just another f-150 but it's the best f-150 ever made the f-150 lightning is more powerful than the most powerful gas f-150 it has more horsepower and more torque than the best gas f-150 it has a massive max towing capacity the most covered cargo space the most high-tech features it has the least maintenance it's the least expensive per mile to run and own and by the way it's the fastest quietest smoothest and the easiest to drive if any of that matters to you so it delivers it delivers on the promise and i can see it making a lot of the pre-order holders happy we even used a second f-150 lightning to shoot this first f-150 lightning so it's already putting in work my only question going in was about range you know you might have remembered some of the things left unclear from my impressions video so this extended range version promised 300 miles i lived with it for a week and i found that real world use gets you a little bit below that which is not surprising about 280 but then there's even a sick feature that measures how much you're either hauling or towing with a built-in scale and then adjusts your estimated range from there which is a great idea for a truck which we'll be towing and hauling all the time so here we are ford's gonna start shipping these we'll see how fast they can ramp up manufacturing and now it's up to the rest of the competition the electric ram the electric toyota tundra even the cyber truck the ones on the horizon it's up to all of them to catch up to this one thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music]
