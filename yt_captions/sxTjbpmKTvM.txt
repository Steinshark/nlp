today the hong kong british colony is looked upon with a little bit of nostalgia the colonial government was seen as competent and well-run especially in its later years and those administrations did do some things quite well for all the people not just the europeans but that view ignores some 130 years of hong kong our history hong kong was founded and for over a century run as a capitalist paradise on the backs of the extremely poor an extreme european inner circle ruling a vastly larger chinese majority in this video i want to talk about some of the racist laws and economic structures put into place by that european minority to guarantee their place at the top of the pile and how long those structures actually lasted hong kong back then was wild and dirty the times of london in 1858 explained that people in england saw hong kong as and i'll quote a place always connected with some fatal pestilence some doubtful war or some discredible internal squabble we cannot wish that the sea should take hong kong back to itself because english life and english property would be endangered but if these could be withdrawn we should very willingly resign any benefits which we derived from its possession 19th century writers man they had such a way with words back then this perception is not unwarranted for hong kong was a group of corrupt merchants and pirates ruled by administrators who saw making money as the number one priority the island colony ran on the back of extremely cheap labor smuggling and of course opium hong kong government revenue from opium in 1918 was over 8 million hong kong dollars a staggering 46.5 percent of revenue sir john boehring hong kong governor in the 1850s condensed the essence of hong kong's operating philosophy best free trade is jesus christ and jesus christ is free trade hong kong made money for its european rulers in unsavory ways those rulers sought to protect those privileges when the british annexed hong kong they told the island's residents that they would be governed by the quote-unquote laws customs and usages of china attempting to adhere to this promise would cruelly create a dual system one for chinese and one for europeans the colonial officials adopted a number of ordinances violating them if you were an englishman would likely lead to just a fine violating them as a chinese would result in a number of cruel and unusual punishments punishments that per ordinance number 10 of 1844 were administered quote unquote in conformity with the usages of china as has his there too been usually inflicted on natives so unquote local punishment for locals this was unusual for british colony and wasn't the case in places like sri lanka and singapore here are a few of these chinese punishments floggings floggings in hong kong were particularly brutal colonial surgeons found that they often created deformities and left permanent scars an 1847 ordinance allowed punishments of up to 60 strikes with a cane or a rattan vlogging would remain on the corporal punishment ordinance until 1990. tail cutting at this time chinese men had a tail on the back of their head to show their respect for the ching emperor cutting it off would make a chinese man a social pariah there are no records of tail cutting has a traditional chinese punishment actually practiced in china proper but the hong kong colonial administration practiced it ever the same public hangings late 19th century hong kong was the only british colony to do public hangings the authorities installed the gallows permanently for public viewing the first public hanging in hong kong history happened in 1845 it was scheduled for three chinese men charged with attempted highway robbery but they committed suicide in prison first it would take 50 years 1895 and substantial pressure from the uk motherland for the colonial government to finally do its hangings in the quote-unquote privacy of the prison grounds many of these rules slowly became less relevant after world war ii but a lot of them are still in the books and can be pulled out as needed by the ruling minority elite and let's talk a little bit and go back to privacy speaking of privacy chinese people had no privacy from british authority an 1846 ordinance empowered the colonial authorities to enter any chinese-owned house or boat every chinese person had to register with the colonial government if you failed to do so then you were fined 50 hong kong dollars with the possibility of expulsion a chinese person expelled from hong kong back then had a big arrow branded on their left ear this way they can always be detected if they were to try to return chinese people could not vote in hong kong they did not even know how they were to be governed because all hong kong governance happened in english how many chinese back then knew english ah and chinese could not be out on the streets of their own city late at night in 1870 a law was passed such that no chinese could be on the streets from 9 p.m to sunrise without a pass and even they had a pass they had to carry a lantern with them this ordinance was not repealed until 1897 27 years later there is no rational reason for requiring a chinese and only chinese mind you both peasant and businessmen alike to have to carry a lantern except for racism hong kong's 19th century british saw the chinese as a lower yellow race to quote a hong kong memoir i have actually seen a european rickshaw passenger throw his fair money to the ground rather than risk touching the rickshaw cooley so naturally the europeans wanted ways to keep themselves apart from the riffraff and here are a few examples of these laws in action chinese can only visit the hong kong museum in the morning for the rest of the day the museum would be open for europeans but only after they first cleaned the museum during lunch all chinese land near the harbor some 1.5 acres of it were forcibly acquired and cleared so to prevent everyday mixing between the chinese and europeans certain areas were reserved exclusively for the british the peak district is today the most expensive in the world jack ma had to pay hundreds of millions for a house there that had been the 1800s and early 1900s all of his millions wouldn't help him one bit the peak used to be exclusively for whites it was as english as any small english provincial town and they worked really hard to keep it that way likewise the southern portion of chengchao island was set aside in 1919 as an exclusive vacation area for europeans chinese were not allowed to reside there when the bill came up in the hong kong legislative council two chinese members voted against it calling it a racial legislation the bill passed as every other legislator voted for it to be a european in hong kong was to enjoy not only the social benefits but vast economic and governmental ones as well colonial hong kong developed a reputation one not totally unwarranted for being a place where quote unquote lower class europeans can go to and get top level highly well paid positions simply for being white all of the top colonial governmental positions were held by white britons a state of affairs that lasted far longer than it should have basically until 1993. the vast majority of hong kong's legal force judges police the like was white 95 percent of the police department were european deep into the 1970s even the british colony of ceylon now known as sri lanka on the other hand they had put aside a third of such positions for the native populous by the 1920s british government expatriates were paid more and promoted faster than chinese people for example a british officer in 1914 can expect to be paid over seven times more in salary than a chinese officer of the same rank in 1991 a newspaper pointed out that 51 senior hong kong colonial government officials had salaries higher than that of the uk prime minister himself expat benefits were also substantial the hong kong government spent over 1.7 times more for a european than the chinese in terms of benefits europeans enjoyed free trips back to europe for themselves and family of up to six people every two years they got partial reimbursement of tuition for exclusive european private schools and let's top it all off with a final fact the average british expatriate in hong kong with a family lives in a house or apartment over 2500 square feet 232 square meters large in hong kong of all places hong kong's population throughout its colonial period was 98 chinese throughout the 150-year long colonization period 2 percent or less of the population ruled over 98 percent without any semblance of democracy or fairness and then the saddest thing at the end of those 150 years the british handed its rule over hong kong 6 million people to china in 1997 and the british stepped out of those positions and the chinese stepped smoothly in alright everyone have a good evening take care of yourself
