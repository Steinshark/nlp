ladies and gentlemen recently Anna Kremlin came to New York City and I played her in a chess match but I played her without seeing any of the pieces I wore a blindfold for the entire game and her mom Grand Master Pia cramling would make the moves for me Anna is 2100 ELO can I beat a 2100 while wearing a blindfold only one way to find out okay here we go all right Knight F6 Bishop G5 the trumpowski I think so okay I don't like playing against the trumpowski I never know what I'm gonna do but I have actually played it once with white and I beat at 2250 which for me was great in a classical game wow with that sound all right let's go D5 E3 with the pawn not the bishop mom you know at some point if it's a little bit unclear if the instructions aren't clear you can do what benefits mean in that position you know all right I'm gonna go 94. since I'm playing blindfolded I don't want a position on the board that I've never ever seen before that's why I went for the trumpowski opening I've played hundreds of games of Blitz in it and I know all the tricks of the position let's see how Anna reacts oh I hung my Bishop oh okay well you went Knight E4 so you have to take the bishop I'm not going to take the bishop why are you 194 is to take the position no I went there to to threaten it okay you know I can see the position you can't see the positions I mean but I can see it right here I see it all right I'm gonna kick your Bishop away with which move Bishop F4 I wouldn't play F6 but yeah um now the question is what do you do ah no okay I'm gonna go C5 that makes sense Bishop uh D3 you're kicking away my knight now I wanted to stay there Knight C6 uh Bishop takes E4 Pawn takes E4 D5 all right should we have some fun oh wait can I no yes it's not a good move don't play it it is don't play it one two three it doesn't work I just I may lose a coin it doesn't work it does E5 it doesn't I knew you were gonna do that and it doesn't work Bishop G3 but now I can take I can go and I am gonna do it um night B4 I understand but I don't have to take on E5 I'll just play Knight C3 okay and I'll uh-huh do you see now I I see lovey I see very clearly because I don't see so I I know you don't see but okay so you're threatening several pawns at the same time like a moment here what if we go for something really fun like for instance some tactics I feel like tactics when you can't see anything is probably good or terrible or terrible it might work out both ways yeah but I'm gonna go Bishop oops sorry Bishop G4 now here anna went Bishop G4 this is a crazy idea she's sacrificing her bishop and a couple of Pawns in the center but she's gonna win my rook in the corner normally this is a bad move but it turns the position into total chaos and as you will see that pays off later it must be bad I'm trying to confuse you Queen takes G4 okay Knight takes C2 King D1 Knight takes A1 Bishop takes E5 all right and now we think probably should have thought before you did this nope [Music] like I don't know I'm not the coach I'm just I'm simply a spectator I'm I'm an exchange up right now I feel pretty good I knew we were gonna get this position and now we're moving on to the next part of the game did you say exchange up the Knight on A1 counts for you of course he's with me he's with me he's not with you he's with me not until you take it I it will not be that long [Music] no okay I think it's Queen D7 were you thinking to play Queen D7 I think it's the best move just saying I appreciate it but I have some other plants okay I want to go let's see this is I think it's mine takes takes push push I think it's okay all right I'm gonna go Queen E7 Queen E7 yeah yeah um I'm gonna go there there are these complicated I also don't know by the way um is that your your weak spot you have no weak spots no weak spots no I'm just like uh Magnus caliber player everywhere uh really how much time do we have oh so much time I feel like Anna has one minute left I have two okay yeah well or maybe 156 I wanna I wanna make a good move here you know is that okay can I can I think and make a good move think as much as you want lovey just take a big thing all right uh I'm gonna go uh back Bishop G3 because you want a castle I do and you know that I can Castle can I can oh I can't what how do I know you can't Castle but you don't okay okay okay yeah I can't Castle I just realized okay whatever we move on I'm gonna go rookie d8 um probably time uh King C1 you're starting the journey yes my king will now kill your horse with his bare hands it's actually very gruesome I also just didn't want to be pinned poor horse the horse will be saved all right um time to kick you away let's go H5 yeah I thought that was the best move for like a while now uh Queen I just didn't want to give you a free Pawn yeah I'm not gonna take it I don't think um but I you know I I uh I appreciate I guess Queen IE too to keep it nice and chill nice and chill that's good okay I mean I'm not gonna lie my my horses now it seemed better they said it's life but all right whatever let's just go for let's just go for G6 G6 um really yes yes Queen B5 check [Music] Queen D7 Queen C4 here unfortunately I got a bit of tunnel vision what I should have done is probably just traded the Queens with Anna and went for an end game that would have made my life a lot simpler but I was really thinking that I was gonna deliver a Checkmate unfortunately once I started retreating she created some counter play Mom I'm sorry I know this is not the kind of Chess you like but yeah I'm gonna go F5 I'm sorry Mom I know it's very anti-pocessional I just want to keep my Pawn alive situation probably demands it um well King B1 [Music] the time has come time has come I'm actually gonna go yeah whatever just just take it Levy A6 ah okay you just again did not say where you were moving yeah I know I know we have plenty of time uh King takes Knight B5 Queen B3 I'm not mad about this foreign B4 that's a little bit annoying night I'm gonna go for a pawn Avalanche [Music] Knight A4 Queen B5 really yep oh you want Queen F1 thought you wanted to see it Abby why do you see those diagonals Knight H3 I don't get it I mean okay C4 yeah that's the problem though I don't know if it's getting any better [Music] Queen C2 Rook takes D5 okay now oh I should I should play a move right now I should play a move all right let's just go Rook d8 Rook C1 was a terrible move I noticed in my mind Anakin played B3 and that move disconnects my queen from the defense for my knight on A4 but it's even worse than that if I take her Pawn on C4 she trades and Rook to D1 is a Checkmate a completely ridiculous turn of events I'm actually losing here but she doesn't see it Rook G8 what's our time nine seconds oh 96. Rook B8 7.97 Knight C7 Knight C7 no no no no no no no no no no Knight C7 you should don't do it you should just resign so I don't lose on time don't do it mom okay come on do it I'm kidding do it foreign and then pre-move Knight takes Queen just tell me where the King goes uh king of seven this Knight takes Queen Rook takes Queen C4 well Anna blunder is not just her Rook to my Bishop but also a fork and here I get super excited because I see that I'm gonna win the game but something really funny happens I asked for a time check and when I heard nine seconds I thought that meant I had nine seconds it turns out I had more than one minute on the clock and there's bonus time every move Anna was the one that had nine seconds so she freaked me out and because of that I started playing faster and making mistakes Rook C7 Rook takes C7 intakes Bishop G Simon A3 you know what I'm not feeling that bad now blundered my piece okay rookie eight Queen C6 should play rookie Rook B eight uh oh that's so annoying Queen C2 no how is this you can't take my phone sure why did I wouldn't do it Rook takes B2 when he takes B2 Bishop takes me too I should just lose the pawn end game [Music] five uh G3 Pawn takes H4 one takes H4 King G6 King C3 F4 King D4 King F5 King D5 [Music] Pawn takes E3 Pawn takes E3 King G4 King takes E4 uh you're so happy about this right I don't know if I'm happy I still can't tell foreign [Music] A4 King takes H4 King F4 King H3 E4 H4 E5 King G2 E6 H3 C7 H2 Y8 Queen H1 Queen Queen A8 check King G8 King G1 Queen takes Queen you played an illegal move I was a king two one I mean King takes a queen as well uh King E4 King G2 King D5 foreign King B5 King D5 King takes Pawn King C6 can you see five you mean King C6 King C6 wall I uh I offer a draw you up for a draw yeah all right we'll take the draw wow I can't believe I saw that whole end game in my head ah yeah because now for you guys watching right now you're always asking me Anna why should I draw Levy has a pawn more but the thing is that his King cannot Escape he can't promote because my king is gonna is basically gonna be uh doing opposition for this King so the king will never be able to get out of this file and promote this pawn my king will always stop him so it's a draw
