this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] all right so so dante wrote this amazing text called the comedia this is what i'm going to be talking about most but he was as you if you studied dante a little bit he was part of a brotherhood of poets uh that were focused on the notion of love now love in the comedy can be seen as the animating force behind everything that dante talks about and not only the animating force in the story but really presented as something like the animated animating force of everything that is the manner in which the world exists and for us as modern people that is a very strange thing to think to think that the world exists through love let's say but hopefully by the time i'm done speaking to you at least understand how we could think something like that or how it is that people could could think that way so dante has dante has is this whole massive experience of going down into hell encountering all these people that are suffering uh for different sins and then all going up to purgatory encountering again people that are expiating some of their sins and then moving up into heaven where there's this slow ascension all the way up into god but when you read the text you realize that for example the people in hell they rush into hell themselves they want to be there and there's a sense in which the people that are at the different levels of reality that dante encounters they want to be where they are and the reason why they want to be where they are is because of love that is it is something like in the lower spheres let's say in hell and in purgatory it's something like ill-directed love or sometimes lack of love or sometimes excessive love of things that are good but that there's too much love attributed to them um so i want to read i'm not going to read a lot from the actual poem but i want to read at least a few things from the from the poem um and so this is taken from the translation by john chiardi and uh i'm going to read a little text from the 17th 17th canto in the purgatory so if you want to look it up later you can look it up and so in that in that moment in purgatory there's a little pause and uh dante's guide virgil uh we'll talk about why it's virgil a little bit later but dante's guide virgil gives him a little speech on love and he says neither creator nor his creatures move as well you know he said but in the action of animal or mind-directed love natural love may never fall to error the other may by striving to bad ends or by too little or by too much fervor while it desires the okay so i think that's that all right so while it desires the eternal good and measures its wish for secondary goods and reason this love cannot give rise to sinful pleasure but when it turns to evil or shows more or less zeal than it ought for what is good then the creature turns on its creator thus you may understand that love alone is the true seed of every merit in you and all acts for which you must atone and so love is basically if i'm going to be simple about it love is basically that which makes you move whatever it is that makes you move in the world you can understand as love now it's strange for us to think that because we always think about love just in terms of romanticism or like let's say the love that we have for children an easier way to maybe understand it would be to use a a word like care for example or attention that is the things we the the reason why we move in the world is always because of care now that can mean something like i need to eat and so i care enough to move to get something in the fridge right it it means that i need like i i care enough about certain things to get dressed in the morning i care enough about certain things to walk out and you know that because you know that when people become depressed often it often expresses itself in a lack of care a lack of love you could say that is as the love in the person becomes cold that person becomes unable to do things and it's not even it's not like necessarily a physical thing it's not like they're they're they have an infirmity in them or that they're they're weak or that they're physically incapable of doing things is that they're incapable of finding motivation that they're incapable of love or their love is cold in them so dante a little bit later in this same in the same chapter virgil says all men though in a vague way apprehend a good their souls may rest in and desire it each therefore strives to reach his chosen end and so everybody in them we have an intuition of that which is good and that is what makes us move and we have a sense that we'll rest in that good so this is very simple like it's not a it does end up in a very kind of deep theological mystical idea but at the basis it's this it's the idea that i'm hungry i eat an apple and i find rest in that good right i'm tired i go to sleep i find rest in that good and so everything that makes us move makes us move with desire towards something which we think that will give us a form of rest from that desire and so love expresses itself as this burning you could say in us that drives us forward towards other things now this is true of course for little things but it's definitely very true about in terms of relationships in terms of erotic love that is erotic love has the same structure right we move into erotic love with the desire to find rest in that moment right in that because a love expresses itself as a kind of pain right as a kind of suffering as we long for that the things that we don't have as we long for our beloved as we long for that which is drawing our attention drawing us towards it right so it's something like anticipation anticipation is actually a form of of suffering it's a it's a strange mix of suffering and pleasure right it's a it's like this this goal that appears to you this shining thing that appears to you in front of you whether it's like i don't know whether it's having a good meal in a restaurant whether it's going to see a new play or whether it's seeing your beloved there's this this thing that pulls you and the anticipation is excitement if it is also a kind of suffering and you you you move towards the the possibility of finding rest in your in your in the thing that is beloved and the thing that you are moving towards now dante says that so the idea is that the people that are everything that is good in you is happens through love but everything also that you need to expiate that does all the bad stuff in you is through love as well and you can understand that in terms of a simple way to understand is like any bad habit that you have right a bad habit is is a uh let's say is sparked by love and so let's say with someone who smokes it's easy to find the very simple bad hat someone who smokes like someone who smokes will have created this pattern of love in them which will both which will make them desire the object and so if you haven't had a cigarette in a certain amount of time you're going to feel that pull and that pull will be both anticipation and suffering and then when you take when you get your hit of nicotine then all of a sudden you feel that rest in the thing that you love and so it's that's true for any bad habit that you have like whether it's ocd washing your hands whether it's like any kind of behavior that drives you you'll feel that anticipation that that suffering and the desire to find resolution in in in the love in the in the object of that which is desired and so the idea is in dante especially is that to a certain extent you could imagine that all things that exist in the world are good they are a good and that we are meant to move towards them as we move towards a good at the level at which they are meant to be loved so he says but when it turns to evil the love or shows more or less zeal than it ought for what is good then the creature turns on its creator and so the idea is when we love something to the level at which it's supposed to be loved then it will be normal but if we love something excessively then it will lead us into hell and of course this is something that we understand like anybody that has been madly in love with someone can understand the danger that that is there because it's especially a very strong attraction if you're very strongly attracted to someone all of a sudden the desire to find that resolution especially if it's unrequited love especially if the person you desire does not does not answer your your desire then then the suffering can be huge and if it's disproportionate it can lead you into total despair right and we everybody knows someone to whom that's happened someone who falls into despair out of excessive love for someone but that is of course something which can happen not only in terms of of a lover or in terms of the beloved it can happen who's someone who's trying to get who's applying for a job and that their desire to apply for that job is so strong it is pulling them they want it they want it so bad and then when it is it is unrequited then it will lead you into into suffering now it's true that way but it's also true that if you disproportionately love something which is not meant to be loved at the level that you're loving it then you will have other problems and so the alcohol is a great example right you know you drink with friends you use it as a social lubricant there's this there's this there's this capacity to engage in uh let's say the pleasure that alcohol can bring you at a level that is normal that a level in which it will only act as a a step into higher loves which is that you know i like to have a drink with my friends because it loosens the mood and then i can really have a great time with my friends and so now this love for alcohol which is which is not wrong in itself is at the right level it's at a level that leads me up towards a higher love but if i become too focused on the lower love then it can lead me into despair because it won't it's as if i'm trying to make it fill a hole that is too big for what i'm using to fill it with because the the truer love let's say the love of a person is much higher than obviously should be much higher than it's something which will fill us more than the love for something like alcohol but if i so if i'm not careful i'm trying to basically i mean you've heard you've seen this trope in any kind of movie right it's like i'm like i'm feeling something i'm missing in terms of love in terms of some desire i have to be loved by my father whatever like or to love by someone else and i'm i'm compensating through something like alcohol um but this can also be true like i said of people that is even the love we have of each other can become excessive there's actually a wonderful version of that in another story which deals with this kind of voyage into the afterlife c.s lewis wrote a book called the great divorce and in this book he has a similar story as dante where he he visits the the the other world and um he gets a let he get it's basically lessons about how we live now it's even dante's book i'll tell you secret it's not really about the afterlife it's really about now it's really about how we live now the same with with c.s lewis's great divorce and so in this book there's a there's a beautiful image of a woman who arrives in the afterlife and as soon as she arrives in the afterlife she asks to see her son who preceded her in death and the angel that is there i forget who the guide is says yes don't yes you will see your son but before there are a few things we need to go through before you see your son and the woman is like no i want to see my son like i i knew when i would die that i would see my son so bring me my son and once again the angel says no your son is here don't worry you'll you'll see her son and she starts to like she starts to get really animated and she said who is this god that will separate me from my son like what kind of god would separate a mother from her son and so i want to see my son now and the answer is no not right now you can't see your son and it drives her so mad that she runs out of paradise into hell where now she asks she demands that they bring her son into hell with her so she can be with him and it's a very it's a very powerful vision of even how our human relationships if the amount of love or if the manner in which we love those around us can become uh disordered and can lead us into cannot only lead us into a way that makes us go to hell but really a desire to bring other people into hell with us um this is something which is which is fascinating something that i've noticed in terms of bad habits for example you can see that with uh with people that uh that take drugs they have a strange desire to get other people to do it and it's very fascinating it's like they actually invert the relationship where their love of the drug is so strong that they they see it as the mediator towards their relationship towards others that is they want to pull other people into their love almost to justify their love or almost to to to help them feel that this love is appropriate and so they'll they'll actually want to pull people into their web into their bad habit with them in order to to kind of justify their love and so people pulling others into hell with them is something that happens quite a bit as well and i'm sure many people have had an experience uh experience like that um all right i want to read you another nice little passage from dante so what dante does is he basically in his way of describing the world he describes what you could call something like appropriate love or the manner in which loves can scale up can scale into each other how the loves can build on each other in order to lead us towards more let's say to higher more lofty loves and not get trapped in these lower loves that we that we all have but that can become dangerous if we don't if we try to fill our existential hole with them you could say um the way that the whole story is set up right is that at different levels of reality you have different people so in dante's poem there are people that are in limbo there are people that are in hell there are people that are in purgatory and there are people that are in heaven and there are people that are at different levels of heaven so the story starts with dante falling into despair he falls into despair he's at the middle of his life he's been exiled from his city he basically has lost all the things that help he helped him understand who he was and so he is faced with these three beasts that are preventing him from going further he's stuck in a deep dark forest and he can't go further he has these three beasts that are facing him um and so he's stuck and so in order to get out of that there appears to him the poet virgil now for those who don't know virgil is a roman poet of the first century who wrote especially the aeneid which is his most famous poem um and so dante encounters this poet who's dead who's been dead for a very long time and virgil starts to guide him around these monsters but has to go down into hell and then come back up to go up the the levels of purgatory but at some point dante asks uh virgil like you know how is it that you came to to to greet me like how is it that you came to get me in my despair and so what dante describes is that virgil is in purgatory he's sorry he's in limbo he's at the gate of hell and then someone from above came to see him so beatrice came to see virgil and beatrice is dante's uh muse you could say it's the it's it's a woman that dante encountered at some point in his life he never had a relationship with her he never um he was never married to her she had her own life but he saw her as this this thing that awakened love in him when he was young so he encountered this woman it awakened love in him and she became for him the ideal of of human love of of arrows the ideal of like erotic love in in the positive sense that this thing would draws you forward which becomes your motor to make you do things so beatrice sends beatrice comes down to to virgil and says virgil why don't you go see dante dante's in trouble and he and and you should go and see him so that he can move forward and she says i was contacted by saint lucia who is dante's patron saint and then there's a hint in which that saint lucia was contacted by someone else by another lady and so it it's not said in the text but it's the virgin mary basically and so so you have this interesting setup where the virgin mary comes down from god come from christ comes down from christ encounters saint lucia and says lucia dante is in trouble maybe we could do something about it your patron saint and now this patron saint goes down encounters uh beatrice who's the woman that awakened love in dante she says why don't we go help dante she goes down to limbo and now she encounters the pagan poet the greatest poet that has ever lived you could say uh before dante in his estimation and now this poet goes out to find dante now we can obviously understand this in a narrative way it's a nice little trope it's a nice little narrative but it's telling us about the manner in which loves work the man in which loves stack up on each other and so now you saw it from top down right you saw basically god calling god telling or christ telling the virgin mary telling saint lucia telling beatrice et cetera et cetera all the way down but now you can also see it going up right because that's what's going to happen with dante so as dante moves up moves down first into hell then goes up at some point virgil will leave him and will be replaced by beatrice as a guide and as it doesn't it doesn't map on exactly but it maps on well enough as he goes up then he then beatrice at some point is replaced by bernard of clairvaux who was a great theologian in the middle ages and then bernardo flavor leads him up and at some point bernard leaves and the virgin mary herself takes dante up into the presence of christ so that he then enters into the presence of god so this is you can understand that this is really telling us about how love works about how loves can build on each other and so dante's love for poetry right dante's love for poetry but not also you could you could say in terms of virgil what he rep what he represents is also all of the secular world right so there's an there's a because he's a pagan he represents let's say secular reality so all of secular reality all of these things whether it's poetry whether it's science whether it's just things that exist in the secular world they are the first thing that draws dante into the possibility of loving and so his attraction to these things his attraction to literature his attraction to poetry let's say awaken something in him now if he stayed there he would become he would become that stuffy professor that lives in books and that doesn't have any connection with reality and maybe you've met people like that that live in a world of literature but have no relationships have no their lives are a complete mess like their their relationships are a complete mess they're they're basically uh like sociopaths but they know they know literature like they look they they're really experts in poetry and all this stuff so that's a possibility but no dante that possibility of of of understanding patterns in in the world patterns in literature makes it possible for him to fall in love and now he falls in love with this woman but this woman is is actually uh unattainable to him and so here again this could be it's both a positive and a negative it's positive because it brings him higher now it's an actual human relationship it's not just fictional or like people on paper it's a real flesh and blood person standing in front of him you know who his who now his erotic love can be directed towards but then again that's the same now it's a very it's something which is positive but could be negative if he just stayed there because someone and again you know this like someone who's in a relationship and that relationship fills all their needs and then they find out that the person is cheating on them or then without then it things spiral out of control and they end up getting a divorce and their lives are ruined forever because all their love was put there something which is good but which is not all good right and so this is now so then dante dante's love for beatrice leads him up towards a now a more spiritual love right a more spiritual but particular love which would be something like his patron saint if you imagine like an angel you can imagine it like the capacity to love something like it could be something higher in general like it could be something like a an ideal you know uh moving towards an ideal working towards an ideal working towards something which is higher even than our just our human relationships and becomes a manner in which our human relationships can be bound together for some people it could be something like a cause you know for some people it could be something like like a team you know like a sports team this is it's lower than a patron saint but it can help you understand how these la these loves can kind of scale up into other loves and of course now this love leads them now cosmically to the highest form of of love which is ultimately this moving into the virgin and then ultimately into god himself as the absolute good you could say for modern people it's hard to understand this like it's hard to understand this because we tend to understand god as an arbitrary being which exists in heaven or whatever um you know that's just his arbitrary being but there's a sense in which the medieval person or the medievals understood god as the source of all good the infinite source of all good and therefore all our love should move slowly towards the good now those goods are like i said they are they are smaller things they move into virtues they move into ideals but then ultimately they also have to move up towards let's say the source of love itself or the possibility of love itself maybe is the best way to understand that and trinitarian theology is basically a description of love trinitarian theology is about how something obviously it's not a thing right how the source of all things is both one and many at the same time if you want to understand love that's basically a definition of love love is the capacity to be both one and many at the same time so if you love someone properly you will want that person to exist outside of you because if you suck them into you right if you basically annihilate them into your desire then they will they'll cease to exist you'll turn them into shadows you'll turn them into dreams but true love is the capacity to both be fully one with that which is loved while letting that thing completely exist outside of you that is true love and in the trinity that is what you find you find basically a kind of self-emptying love in which the different persons of the trinity completely give themselves to the other while not fusing together and becoming just a monad you could call it um so this description of god ultimately this is what it's when we say god is love it's not an arbitrary thing right it's a it's an actual description of how god or how the source of all things animates our experience animates everything that we participate in um and so this is when this is why dante i mentioned it i mentioned this earlier in one of the speeches i read he says all men though in a vague way apprehend a good their souls must rest in and desire it each therefore strives to reach its his chosen end but there's a manner in which that desire for the good leads up into the good itself leads up into the the highest good and there's a manner in which that the lower goods can be transmuted or transformed into something which leads you higher um and this is something which is obviously there in in christianity but it's not they're only in christianity you find it in for example in uh in plato so in the symposium you really do find an image of something like that where the symposium is a drinking party and of course in the greek culture there was uh there was this erotic relationship between between men of different ages and so the older men and the younger men would have these erotic relationships and it would be seen in greek culture it was kind of it was kind of iffy or it was okay but they weren't sure about it and there's a way in which socrates in the in the symposium he comes into contact with alcibiades and alcibiades is a very he's a very passionate person he's an extremely passionate person he's extremely driven he has a lot of ambition and he really wants to he he he's like he takes up a lot of room like he's he's a glorious young man you know and everybody looks at him everybody wants him everybody is attracted to him uh and so ultimately al-shabaai's according to greek uh tradition is the one who will betray greece who will betray athens um but we don't know that yet and so alcibiades tries to seduce socrates and socrates is constantly if you read the text it's wonderful socrates is there with alcibiades as al-sabadi is trying to seduce him and socrates is constantly receiving that receiving alcibiades desire and turning it towards higher goods and he's constantly trying to like say to to bring him to contemplate the forms to contemplate higher goods uh and of course al-sabadi's gets very frustrated in the story he's like he gets very annoyed he ends up let's say um admiring uh socrates but you there's a sense in which in the bigger story of the symposium and the greek culture there's a sense in which the fact that alcibiades was not able to temper his passions was not able to temper his loads now not only for socrates but in general like you can understand that um someone who is extremely uh that has a lot of uh desire to succeed that is extremely motivated to make it in the world is someone that is driven right and is willing to do anything to reach their goal and so in the case of alcibiades that love that strong passion that he had would lead him ultimately to betray athens and so if he had learned to moderate his love and moderate his passions he might have been able to let's say turn them towards higher goods and uh and he wouldn't have uh he wouldn't have gone the dark route that that that he has that he has in the in the story of greece um and so when you look at in the story of dante you can understand that in a christian manner the best way to understand it is something like compassion and so you can understand that the way that the love that moves up is something like admiration or something like veneration something like seeing seeing something as a model that attracts you towards it and then the love which comes down from the higher goods is something like self-sacrificial or compassionate and so it's by it's through compassion that the virgin calls down on these lower loves to then draw dante in and dante isn't ready for the higher things so there's a way in which he must he must let's say truly explore the loves that are there present present to him that is his desire to become a great poet his desire to to learn about poetry is something which is good and he needs to fully he needs to fully accomplish you could say but also always knowing that it eventually has to move up towards higher and uh and higher goods um and so i would say that that was basically like let's say the the basic thought that i wanted to bring you guys and i was hoping that there would be questions because i know that this is maybe something that you hadn't thought about uh and is not maybe obvious at the first glance or maybe it is i don't know so i would love to hear questions from you so that we can continue the discussion i know it's not like say your job to like help fix other people's lives that's not the uh like angle that i'm asking this question from but when you see somebody who's maybe like loving excessively and you can see that it's like to a point of harm as a friend or whatever like how would you like suggest like what advice would you suggest giving to like navigate that and help them maybe see um maybe like a third view perspective of like why it might be detrimental yeah it's very difficult because someone that is drunk on on love is very difficult to reason into reason into anything it's very hard that's why like i i won't lie to you that's why in dante that's why people are in hell there's a sense in which the people that are in hell are completely drunk on their love of the thing that's making them that's bringing them there they're so drunk on it that there's no almost no way to get them out of it it's like they're they're completely blind and turning in their circle of desire um and so it's very difficult to do that but i think that it's possible and i think that i think that um let's say modeling proper love or modeling proper compassion is probably the best way to do this which is that if you have a friend that is that is obsessed with something or someone to a level that it's self-destructive then i think the best thing to do is to let's say kindly tell them take the wrath and let that person know that you're still gonna be there like you're not going anywhere right that is like okay i'm gonna tell you that this i think is is is dangerous to you and then that person will say whatever if you i hate you i don't want to talk to you again and you and you're like okay i get it but i'm here like if you need me i'm here and i'm not going anywhere like i'll still i'm still your friend i'm i i feel important it's important for me to tell you this and i'll be here you know and then when that person crashes which obviously was gonna happen then to be there for that person when they do um but it's tough because love is that right love is the is our driving is our driving force so hopefully that helps a little yeah uh okay maybe i missed this when you spoke about it but how do our loves for let's say our work uh you know jogging um friendships how do they bring us to a higher good well it depends it depends on on the love but let's say jogging is a good but the good of jogging is to make you healthy right that's that's the good you're aiming towards but you know some people that stop aiming towards that and then just become weirdly obsessed with physical activity and the physical activity now becomes like the thing they do and now they're not doing physical activity in order to be healthy they're just doing physical activity as if it had it was the goal in itself and it's the same with work like you know people that like love what they do love their work love what they're doing and you know people that are slaves of their work and become completely enslaved by their work and see it as their only identity as the thing which gives them value and so they'll work insane amount of hours because they think that it's the only thing that makes them exist basically and so then it becomes completely apparent but if you if you're if your work it stimulates your mind it stimulates your it stimulates your um uh you know your capacity to learn new things it brings you into contact with other people that you that you create bonds with that you create friendships with then the love of work becomes something which is balanced with other loves and kind of lead you into higher loves which would be friendships that you develop at work uh you know whatever it can lead you to it can also it also it provides money for you to be able to live out other goods you know which are to have a relationship to have children to to to to maybe focus on certain causes that you want to be involved in certain higher things which are let's say more to the service of humanity like help the poor or whatever it is that you do all these things can can kind of fit together and it's it's usually when we become when we try to put all our identity into one love that's usually when it becomes uh becomes uh out of whack so my question is okay so like i agree with you but how can we ourselves so uh jane was asking okay how can we help someone else realize that that obsession they have for something he's not healthy but if we don't have anyone around us how can we notice that that like okay so it's like yeah you don't need to love since the certain extent and i guess my answer and the answer would be that it doesn't prevent you from going to higher things but how can you detect that maybe they are putting in something or someone it's too excessive it's not proportional yeah if you're a uh if you're a religious person then that is makes it easier like if you're a religious person then it's kind of set out for you which is that there are there are there's a hierarchy of goods and so you have an objective scale that you can look at and realize that you know if if i'm neglecting these higher goods like if i'm neglecting my if i'm neglecting worship that is attending to the highest good if i'm neglecting becoming more virtuous then that is also a good which is competing etc etc like if it's if it's if this good is destroying my relationships then those are all signs that the the the different goods are not in their proper order and so praying itself or i'll be generous to you because i'll say if you meditate for example is something that can help you because one of the problem with these loves is that they they drive us into a circle of passion right it's like they drive us from desire anticipation to fulfillment to depression to desire to anticipation to fulfill and so it's like this wheel that keeps going and so once you're in that wheel it's very difficult because you're you're like a little gerbil running and you're like you're just trying to make it go but that's why something like stopping you're stopping your activity stopping what you're doing and then praying or at least being meditating and just being in silence for 10 15 minutes a day for example is something which will definitely help you because what it'll do is it'll pull you out of the pull you out of the wheel just for a little moment it doesn't even have to be that long but just being pulled out of that wheel of like all the thoughts that are running in your mind for a little while will help you to see more with more clarity the things that are driving you and you're going to start to see them because what's going to happen is when you're going to start to want to pray all of a sudden you won't be able to because these things are going to start seeping back into you so you're if you can't if you if you try to stop thinking about something and you can't that's a bad sign that's a bad sign right if you if you're just saying okay i'm not going to think about this now i'm just going to stop in silence and not think about anything let's say and then those thoughts just come crashing back in then i would say it's a it's a sign that you're in trouble like they're not in big trouble it's it's most people are slaves to some of these things but it's a it's something to be attentive to to know that okay i need to to maybe refocus some of the things that i'm focusing on and something everybody has that i go through it all the time because i love what i do i love my work and then i get all these people asking me to to come speak here and to do this and do that and so i'm all of a sudden i'm like i'm running and i'm super excited and i've got you know like my adrenaline level is super high and i've got all these endorphins coming in i'm like and then i realized okay i'm drunk basically i'm just drunk on this thing and it's really bad for me because you know it's like oh i'd rather do that than call my friend like i'd rather be in this world than than let's say do the things that i know that i need to do um so that's a way to to to be attentive to it but in in terms of like so i'm i'm an orthodox christian and there are a lot of things there to help you do that like confession is a great way to deal with that because when you have to go to confession uh with a priest it's like all of a sudden you have to think about it like you have to think about those thoughts that you've got you've got to think about those actions that you pose and you've got to ask yourself like okay what are the things that are motivating what are the things that are driving me and so it's a good way to to reflect you can go see a psychologist it's not as good but it can help as you know the symbolic world is not just a bunch of videos on youtube we are also a podcast which you can find on your uh usual podcast platform but we also have a website with a blog and several very interesting articles by very intelligent people that have been thinking about symbolism on all kinds of subjects we also have a clips channel a facebook group you know there's a whole lot of ways that you can get more involved in the exploration and the discussion of symbolism don't forget that my brother matsuya wrote a book called the language of creation which is a very powerful synthesis of a lot of the ideas that explore and so please uh go ahead and explore this world you can also participate by you know buying things that i've designed t-shirts with different designs on them and
