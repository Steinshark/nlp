my talk is i think maybe the next step after you pick the topic and this is something that i learned from my experience which is not very broad but still i have some of it so i think it's very important to be able to uh this uh distilling your message uh in in the talk so let me let me explain so let's say i wanna explain to you about a vector and please excuse my very simple example so this code is actually coming from a website explaining about stood vector but as you can see this code is not fitting for the slide you can't give a talk about vector fill in the slide like that so for example the creation of the vector we could basically use initialization list the part of printing you could use a print function and have a comment explain your intention here for the pushback you can do the same notice the comment again and for the pop-up back etc etc so what i'm trying to say in short is that visualization is very important when you try to express an idea on a presentation another example let's say i want to explain the vector more deeply i could use images i could also show just with a simple image what happens when i add an element so please excuse my very very simple and uh not not uh well designed photos but i hope you get the idea here so i want to talk about data visualization generally in a world people don't have a lot of enough time to capture a lot of complex ideas and but when they do come to your talk that means that they're actually very anxious to learn so i think giving them good explanation visual visualized explanations would be very helpful and help them get more connected with the ideas they're trying to express so here on the right you can see it's a meta picture it's a picture talks about a good visualization and this is actually coming from a very cool book called information is beautiful so there's two of them as far as i know and i would highly recommend them i'm not connected to the author in any way but those are really awesome books one is called information is beautiful the second is knowledge is beautiful and in general they talk about how do you express information in a visual way so i think what i'm trying to say is create an experience for your audience also communicate with them and most important care about your audience you want to have them enjoy your talk so to summarize i would say that creating a good talk will include having a good structure usually visualization and immunization in your talk get some perspectives have other people that known know this topic see your talk give you feedback and even just um you know have have more broad perspective of the topics that you have decide what are the takeaways that you want your audience to to take from your talk and of course what tina have said and i think is very important present your own views the talk would not be great unless you put what you feel that is important and what you want to express and also just make sure you bring all the equipment you need this is very important because it's never fun to find out too late but to summarize a good talk is about what you bring thank you and of course i just want to say if you want to reach out i i will be happy to help with talks and presentations thank you thank you that was very good very nice um
