I don't know if we can go back to the higher I don't know if we can go back to a higher standard you know I mean I think he's right I think Jonathan blows right that we definitely are in perhaps I honestly think that the state of web development right now is in the worst place it's ever been ever I think the days of jQuery were fundamentally better not because it was better to work on them most certainly it was harder Docker is an insane insane piece of software that has enabled a lot of Our Lives to be better I'm going with web dev because I don't know if it's the same for all Dev games have always historically been a show and so I don't know if that's like changed at all or if it's worse or better I'm not even sure I have no idea it seems like it's worse to me but I also remember buying Nintendo 64 Turok uh rage Wars The Arena game and only being able to get 49 out of 50 achievements because the 50th achievement monkey tag was impossible to get because the game just wouldn't work it wouldn't give it to you it was fundamentally broken no one during testing beat through the game they just didn't just go they didn't just do the whole thing you know like it's just one of those things that you know that was my childhood there's plenty of games like that so I don't know if games are fundamentally different but I think web dev itself is fundamentally different I think web dev is most certainly in a really bad spot and I think one of the reasons why it's in such a bad spot is that we've increased the complexity in general a huge amount and we flooded a bunch of new people to programming into it but here's the deal we don't teach them Foundation right we teach them how to use these blocks we've created every person that's starting out that's pretty much brand new is trying to launch serverless applications and learn how to program with react right like think about that for a second think about how many Technologies went into that small tiny little bit and people that's like what people are trying to learn on right like how do you even learn when you don't like the um the levels of abstraction are insane right and I mean I don't don't get me wrong I love that they exist I'm super happy they exist I am not happy that is how somebody learns how to program today I learned how to program by building a house by printing out then I learned a little bit more and then I learned a little bit more than I learned about classes and I learned about abstract classes and how they kind of work and how that kind of interacts between the two and then I learned how a linked list works and how you can refer to your class by itself right where you can actually create this memory out and out and out and you can use null to stop the creation of memory and then I'm like oh my goodness I can see that I can see the Matrix this is incredible so a year into programming I'm learning basic data structures these people are building full stack websites it's just so different our foundations I knew how computers work how functions were invoked all of that then got thrown into the real world these people only know the real world and they don't understand why anything actually works you know what I mean like that's it's just such an inversion of of learning and I don't know if it's good I don't know if it's bad I I don't want to be like I don't want to be a person that thinks because it's different it's bad or it's good you know what I mean I think a lot of times you see people that always get upset because it's not what they had what I had was in Java do I think Java is the greatest I'd actually rather wish I would have learned C plus plus way more in depth than Java uh I'd like to see you inverted wow uh but real talk like I think I I can't say that it's it's better or worse I just don't know what it is right I think that I think I feel bad for every last person learning right now in the web world I think it's really really tough I think it's honestly super tough and I feel bad because I feel like you guys have to have some of the hardest hurdles right now to get over you have to I don't know what I would have done if I would have started my first company with web dev and I know all the fundamentals and then I'm sitting there spending days just trying to figure out how to launch do all this stuff instead of like hacking my way around a single server in Texas or something like that right the single server in Texas where I had to start my PHP server I kind of understood the pipeline right I had to start the my squeal database I had to start PHP Tomcat whatever the hell it was and I understood like okay here we go we're like we're just like yeah right like oh man if my database goes down people won't be able to say like I understood it like I kind of knew what was going on it was lamp I was literally on lamp I was using xampp x-a-m-p-p for Windows to develop it right like this is real and now people are using serverless databases on serverless companies launching JavaScript that is uh transpiled six different times like they just like the connection is just so different I'm I am super curious what this looks like and how those people I I wish there's a way I could just like feel what everyone feels right now that's been in in in in web development for like three months I've been in web dev since 2007. yeah I I started jumping in 2007. I made a website I think in 2007 or 2008 called life in America is tough uh where people would post their very uh very difficult things of life such as you know I woke up this morning and we were all out of butter when my bread when my toast popped out of the toaster uh that kind of stuff it was pretty good that was my first website 2007 2008 something like that it didn't I didn't even have jQuery at that point Jake Weary wasn't on the scene yet hello dude it took me like two months to build it was so hard move tools I I'd even have mootools
