[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and welcome to the world of ps5 accessories so first of all if you've gotten your hands on a ps5 congrats seriously congrats it's not easy right now if you haven't gotten one yet my fingers are crossed for you hopefully you get it soon but once you do get a ps5 it's kind of like a smartphone you set it up and you kind of want to make it your own a little bit maybe customize it so now that i've had the ps5 for about three months now i've sorted through some stuff not a whole ton out there as far as customizations for it but once you do actually buy some and try it some of it is garbage i won't be recommending it some of it is actually pretty good so here are the best accessories for customizing your experience so number one is obviously it's a gaming console finding some good games to play and a lot of this is preference but we've we've seen the games library slowly growing as expected with the new console generation a lot of my recommendations are still the same once you get it you gotta play astros playroom just to really get to know the controller and i think you gotta get the spider-man game the miles morales game just because in my opinion it's the most visual immersive game on the ps5 there's a reason it launched with it it feels like it's built for the ps5 has a pretty good storyline i like it uh slack boy a big adventure came out shortly after it's been getting some pretty good reviews and i've personally been playing a lot of nba 2k 21 but let's be real it's pretty similar to last year just with some improved graphics and a slightly different my character story but whatever you're into i'll leave a list of games that have gotten some good reviews for the ps5 right below that like button but that's not really customization right you install the games you go through the ui just like everybody else everyone's ps5 software experience is more or less the same thing but there are some things you can do to change the rest of the experience so first of all the look of the ps5 was one of the most controversial things about it at launch now three months later it's kind of grown on me like i'm used to seeing it next to my tv but maybe you don't like it maybe you want the actual console to look different so that is where base plates come in so you may have heard by now that these uh these pieces on the side of the ps5 that kind of make it look like an alien spaceship are just plastic and they literally pop off so if you pull hard enough from the corners it just pops right off from the plastic and so if you buy a different color face plate like this one which is dbrand's matte black dark plate you can pop it on the exact same way and now your ps5 is different color so this is the most fundamental way to get a very different looking console than the way it came out the box i think it's better than a skin because it's actually way easier than installing a huge skin and it's also impressively high quality like it looks and feels exactly like the same stock sony face plates except for the fact that all the tiny x's and o's from sony's pattern are replaced with tiny robots and skulls for dbrand's version currently it is only matte black which is the best color obviously but i am kind of curious why there aren't more alternate shapes and also alternate colors like i would i think it'd be cool if there was a red and a blue version you could just do whatever color you want for your ps5 i'm not just saying this because they're a channel sponsor they didn't sponsor this video but i happen to really like these so dark plates honestly the real downside is it looks like they're about as hard to get right now as the ps5 itself maybe they'll arrive at the same time i don't know onto some other stuff so the middle plastic part like i mentioned in the review is still this glossy plastic collects fingerprints and dust and eventually scratches there are also skins for this dbrand will happily sell you a skin for the middle part and you can go for this contrasty look you could go matte black everything you could go reverse ice cream sandwich you can do whatever you want with the colors here but what about the controllers these are some of my favorite controllers ever in any console actually they probably are at the top of my list and so is there anything you can do to customize the controllers turns out yes so we've all seen the black and white by now this black piece is actually also a face plate kind of the same way as the ps5 there's a lot more connection points but you can remove it now this one's a little harder to pry off because of all those extra connection points so you may require some assistance in the form of a thin pry tool but this one i got from amazon actually came with this blue pride tool so they thought ahead so i'm going to link this one below just try not to break the plastic piece that you're taking off in case you ever want to go back to it but then this is the controller face plate and it clips on the exact same way as the piece you just took off so i just got the sky blue color because it shipped the fastest and it looks pretty good to me but there's a ton of colors available at that link so you can go dark blue you can go red or orange or gold the world is your oyster and it's cheap it's like 15 bucks for a new color plastic on your controller you know it's not quite as cheap but also still i think 100 worth it is this entirely painted fully customized controller by colorware so if you guys have watched the videos for a while you've heard me talk about colorware before they take apart paint and put together all kinds of devices and they do an incredible job every time so what you're looking at right now is a one of one mkbhd edition ps5 controller they made but you can go if you want fully matte black on your controller the thing about a controller though is it gets the most wear and tear because you're holding it all the time so matte black looks sick when it's brand new but it might not be the way to go with plastic maybe a little matte red or blue or something like that either way you do you you can go on the site and go crazy with the customizer change the body color the front color the buttons make it as beautiful or as ugly as you want it's up to you also compared to the normal prices of some other stuff this is actually a little more reasonable it's 109 bucks which the controller by itself is already 69 so not bad but then there is storage so whenever you get a ps5 whether you get the digital version or the disk drive version you have 825 gigs of storage before the os install so maybe you want some extra storage some games are huge some games sort of require you thinking about storage management the thing about the ps5 is the external storage is only actually supported for ps4 games so kind of a bummer but at least if you have a library of ps4 games you can move it to external storage to give yourself more room on the console for ps5 games so it's not ideal but if you want to do this there are two versions of extra storage internal or external so the external drive it's easy you just plug in a fast compatible drive by usb and boom you just added up to eight terabytes of space to keep all the ps4 games you could possibly want a matter of fact this is an 8 terabyte drive from western digital ps5 sees it when you plug it in you can format it it's no problem the other option is an internal m2 ssd shout out to austin evans who just dropped his ultimate ps5 video where he goes a little crazy with it but you can see inside the ps5 there is actually a slot for internal extra storage and so same deal only ps4 games and it will require an upcoming firmware update on the ps5 to work so it's not going to work right away but hey if you want to do it that way that's one less cable on your tv stand that's one less thing you have to worry about on the outside of the ps5 a little cleaner but i'll link austin's video below if you want to watch the destruction or modification of a ps5 to the extreme so that's the meat of it then there are a bunch of uh not quite as useful but still kind of cool accessories depending on who you are so like the ps5 controller dock that sony made looks like a baby ps5 it's cool and everything it's pretty cheap it's like 30 bucks but it's not actually that great like i found it pretty finicky every time i wanted to try to line up the pins and the magnets to charge the controllers so i was looking into alternate docks and you can get other controller docks turns out they're all pretty finicky trying to line up the pins to charge this one i found here has a few more lights on it and it's a bit more stable but yeah it's it's barely better it's barely better than the stock one but it's still cheap so i guess that's no problem then there's the docks yeah ps5 docks so they're everywhere and they really just hold up the ps5 vertically if you're into that and some will give you extra usb ports so this one i'm going to link below here it gives you some stuff if you want to plug in some lower powered stuff like controllers through the hub and they even put some fans in the bottom to push air up through the ps5 now i really doubt that that's making any difference in performance at all but it's there so it's really just giving you an all-in-one hub for charging your controllers keeping the ps5 upright that's what a dock is good for don't expect like a bump in your frame rate or anything best thing you can actually do for a ps5 is just keep it in a sort of well ventilated area a lot of consoles are a little tight for it you want airflow generally to be able to flow freely around it that's the best thing you can do for performance and every once in a while you can take these plates off and clean it out for dust we've heard ps4s get loud in the past really loud including mine and that's just because the fans are spinning extra hard to get the same amount of air through it so pro tip clean it every once in a while so you can do all that and for a cherry on top you could grab yourself a pair of dedicated like really nice gaming headphones this is part of steelseries arctics and they're they're really high quality they sound phenomenal you can get a wireless version or a version that plugs straight into the ps5 controller so that's nice and then you're set that's that is the extent of good ps5 accessories that you should get that can actually meaningfully change your experience so there you have it good luck getting your ps5 good luck getting your hands on the accessories all the helpful links will be below but that's been it thanks for watching i'll catch you guys in the next one peace [Music]
