[Music] what's up guys I'm kvhd here and welcome to my something called an everyday carry video or what's in my bag what's in my tech bag uh backpack video so I've watched a whole ton of these videos they're all over YouTube and they all feel they're super badass and way more nuanced and complex than mine so like I didn't feel the need to share my bag because it didn't seem that great like you can ask people I don't really carry that much stuff on the regular and it's not even like really a tech bag per se but the more I thought about it the more it felt like actually the fact that it's Unique in that way may actually make it worth sharing so maybe you'll enjoy it it works for me maybe you'll get some ideas out of what you want to do with your Tech bag so as a post student that's not carrying a bunch of books this is what's in my tech bag so this is the bag itself it's called the Herschel Pop Quiz backpack it's somewhat new to me actually I switched from a slightly simpler Herschel backpack a couple weeks ago but just for a couple little better things as far as interior organization but it's also red you don't have to get the red one that screams like red and black you know you can get a much simpler color I'll link this below as well as of course anything else I'll talk about in this video but basically you can beat these things up like they're very durable uh it's also weatherproof it's got this hood on the top all the zippers and things like that are weather resistant so water doesn't get in you don't want to get this thing soaked obviously it's still fabric but it's held up great I toss it around I throw it in my car every single day no problem like I said it's definitely not a tech bag but I like that it doesn't screen team I have hundreds of dollars of Technology inside and of course you can get a more discreet color and like a gray or a black I was using a gray before uh but I feel like those bags that have like a USB port and a solar panel and like a battery Bank inside that's a little much you had weight you add complexity keeping it simple here so okay inside the main compartment you got your zippers up top my number one thing and that's in the back in this laptop compartment which is actually felt lined and you got all this this cool black and white pattern inside too which I actually think kind of looks nice but anyway the laptop that is the 13 inch retina MacBook Pro with touch bar from last year and it's in this in case sleeve with a magnet and I really like the sleeve actually it's got like this heather gray look it peels back up here closes like that with a magnet it holds the 13 inch MacBook Pro but there's a 15 inch version as well has this sort of rubber bumpers on the end and goes through airports like this don't have to take it out it's great and then the laptop itself has held up fine I haven't upgraded to the latest quad core model because I don't do all that much complex stuff on this laptop like if I'm traveling for a video I'm bringing a lot more stuff including the video editing laptop which is the 15 inch MacBook Pro but as far as everyday carry stuff this the most I'll do on it is some light photo editing a lot of web browsing email things like that this is great for that little dbrand skin on the back never hurt anybody and it's kept it in pretty good condition so this is the daily laptop choice and let's see I also have my water bottle can never be too hydrated shout out to all the companies that include uh stickers in their boxes that's uh definitely a nice touch and if I like it it'll probably end up on this water bottle I also have back here the MacBook Pro charger this is the higher wattage charger from the 15 inch MacBook Pro it just charges the laptop faster so I use it for the 13 inch MacBook Pro and also since it's USBC don't tell anyone I also use it for my phone too that's kind of the beauty of having one port for everything hasn't damaged anything as far as I know yet but USBC among all the things has been great but then of course speaking of things that I guess aren't USBC it's the Bose qc35 headphones of choice as far as like over ear especially for traveling getting on a plane I don't fly without these headphones they're noise canceling they have a rechargeable battery but they charge via micro USB that's the sad part about them but everything else about these is amazing and I highly recommend them so that's pretty much always in the backpack and then that's like it for the main compartment this I would say is like my optional accessories bag which is not always in the everyday carry but this is like a zipper bag from Herschel made to go in their backpacks and it's got a zipper on the top and if you unzip this you get a whole bunch of little Tech goodies inside so first up is this media drive it's USBC and it is easily the fastest drive I've ever used it's the Samsung X5 uh so anytime you need to do offline media moving it between machines photos videos raw files whatever it is I use this now it used to be the Samsung T5 that everyone would use and that's still a very popular drive that I have but this is literally like eight times faster so any big files we'll go through this and I also found these these came from a Dave 2D video These are basically a full-size USB to any number of different micro USB lightning or USB type-c cables so if you want to charge something say from a battery Bank plug this end into the battery Bank plug one of these into what you want to charge and it will work so if you forgot your cable or if you need an extra cable or if someone wants to borrow one you can give them this and no matter what phone they have it'll work then we also have this Anker power bank I've had this for how many years now four five years forever I think it's a 20 000 uh 20 100 milliamp hour battery uh the good thing about it is it's got USB type-c so if you want to charge it it uses the same charger as the MacBook Pro to plug this thing up and Juice It Up and then there's two full-size USB ports for again whatever you want this is all optional this is like if I'm going on a long flight or if I'm on a long trip or for doing video stuff I'll toss this in there too and this backpack also has this sort of a extra top little sleeve up here it's microfiber lined I think it's because you're supposed to put a phone in it or something like that the only thing I have in here right now why am I reaching so far is the air pods I use which are the matte black everything ones of course the most beautiful pair of airpods you've ever seen don't put your keys in there that is not something you want to do you don't want to mix that like kind of defeats the purpose of the microfiber but that's what I put in there and then you get to the the least used front section of this backpack so up at the front is this like organizer section I again don't use it very much but you still got that felt like striped lining in here and then some pockets for things like dongles or headphones and then I have a black lightning cable so obviously I have a whole bunch of USBC going on in my life but the iPhone is not one of those things so this is my iPhone charger things like contact lenses business cards and that's it for that and then the final outside is some more business cards a pen and a little microfiber you can never go wrong with having a microfiber what happened to my card reader oh it's still in here I almost forgot so I keep this in the sleeve where the laptop usually is just because I always use it with my laptop but this little thing the Von vanja I'll link it below because I don't know what it's called but it's kind of like the Swiss army knife of media card readers anytime I need to import photos or audio from an SD card bam one side is USB type c but if I'm not about that bam the other side is full size USB or if you pull it back micro USB it is super useful I've let people don't like borrow this I've used this many times with my MacBook Pro micro USB or sorry micro SD cards or SD cards I love this thing I keep it in the pocket with the MacBook Pro all the time it's durable and it's never broken so I just tossed it in there but that's basically it that's what I keep in my backpack every day uh literally that's that's about it this video is brought to you by my wallet actually speaking of my wallet phone wallet keys that's always the things I have with me wallet is this Trove slim wallet I'm pretty sure is what it's called with a little MKBHD engraved logo on it that's pretty special edition thanks tro if you guys are great keys and whatever phones I'm carrying right now which are as you're probably wondering OnePlus 6 iPhone 10. okay that's really it this time thanks for watching and I'll catch you in the next one peace
