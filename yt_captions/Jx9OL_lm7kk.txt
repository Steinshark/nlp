the honest truth is that today's video didn't work out so jake and i knocked off early and we're gonna set up my family room we've got three main goals today number one is to un-this if i the place number two is to get the brand new sony x95k tv setup right there and number three is to deal with the sound setup which is gonna be either really simple or a royal pain in the butt unlike the segway to our sponsor yeah not painful at all signal rgb ditch the hassle of using multiple rgb applications with signal rgb you can control and sync your favorite rgb devices all from one free app download signal rgb today at the link down below [Music] the tv is obviously the most exciting part we got to start moving stuff out yes we do there's crap in the way if we unsort this stuff out my son's going to have a hissy fit so we're just going to go dump it on his bed right yeah i wouldn't recommend it i'm not even going to attempt to organize yvonne's stuff no no you're good oh you're just yeah no don't shoot this way you're killing the rapid cleaning illusion what even is all this crap my aunt bless her heart brings a lot of crap into our house so tell her to stop this is the bin of things for her to take away please i was not sure that we were going to be able to get away with putting an oled in this room because even one generation ago they were not really optimal for rooms with a lot of natural light like this one but that all changed with the release of samsung's qd oled quantum dot oled technology but linus you might say that's a sony not a samsung that's because this sony display uses the same panel as samsung's s95b a qd oled panel but with android tv built in instead of samsung's awful tizen os and with superior image processing oh not to mention dolby vision i like how this isn't like paper thin hey man some of those lg tvs i don't even want to pick it up speaking of lg it should be noted that in response to the qdo led threat lg actually released a newer updated version of their w oled technology that gets pretty much just as bright but after testing them side by side by side we determined that this was the best of the current generation tvs which isn't to say that it doesn't have any downsides for one thing it's really expensive like 33 more expensive and for another it's only available in a really limited amount of sizes i think you can only get 55 65 and 75. i don't even know if it goes to 75 but it works out great for me because this opening right here is actually modified from the original cabinet which is so deep because it was designed for a crt tv and then all of your like cds and stuff so we went we ripped those side ones out and it happens to be exactly perfect for a 65-inch tv it's like it was meant to be yeah yeah yeah but i need a screwdriver i'm so glad you brought that up let me show you my perfectly organized garage let's go the tour begins with my wonderful paint booth oh oh you're doing the are you doing these yourself yeah why not really can i touch it is it yeah yeah yeah let's try yeah you have you sanded it yet kind of feels like crap right now i'm using the oil but i'm finishing with a semi-gloss very thin that's fine yeah but you got to sand it a lot more they look really nice though this one has more coats than that one i ran out of oil at any rate the point is what do you think of my paint booth this is not bad though this only took me like three hours but this is my gloriously organized one shelf the contractors i was gonna say you said garage like this is one shell yeah the contractors are using the rest of the space in here look ask me for anything and i will immediately summon it cat6a keystone jacks yes okay painter's tape painters tape yes um battery charger for the impact driver battery charger for the impact driver oh crap nope that's over here hold on no no no no i've got it right here plugged in well no oh but come on come on i i've got it well you're not gonna test me anymore i'm ready this is a really weird mount i have never seen one quite like this before oh interesting so they hit every vasa pattern by having it like adjustable rather than just attaching little bars to the tv and putting it onto the thing you attach the thing to the tv and then hang the whole thing on the thing okay i can already tell that this mount is stupid uh oh because here's the problem it tells you to put it in the center right this bar should be the equal length from the middle right yeah but the nice thing about the ones where you put the bar on the tv the two little hangers yeah is you just move the tv if it's off yeah this you have to like take the tv off the wall screw with these things there's no way that's how you look center and then tighten am i stupid i mean well i just the height of this is gonna be very important oh seriously i mean we can adjust this a little bit we can go a little bit back and forth i mean you're not going to want the mount to hang off the bottom fortunately this sony tv has this cool pattern on the back makes it really easy to center oh that worked out great for everyone involved yeah we basically have to nail the height or it is not going to sit in front of this noise here yeah well i understand that with that in mind i have an idea do you know what the total height of the tv is i just want to get like this part properly so that this gap is correct i can find the total height of the tv 83 and a half is like there wow it's gonna be i know narrow margins here so we just need this little mark i made here it is to the bottom of that so from the bottom of the tv to this hole needs to be 21 plus whatever that is like 20 and a half there that is two centimeters above the mark where we want the bezel of the tv to sit this is 18 and a half from the top of this plus two is 20 and a half i then take my caveman level and i go a little something like that oh my god the noise oh yeah oh yeah that's not going anywhere boys i do wish there was more vertical adjustment after that it really it says it's level okay is the cabinet level though well that i don't know no oh come on come on really hold on it's not even close jake all right let's put the tv on the wall and see if our maths worked screw it uh can you even fit back there oh now that's using your head oh wait it did do did it do yeah it did do it should be noted that sanus only rates this for 55-inch tvs it's well within the weight limit but it's well within that's why i was gonna say it i was gonna say and i was hosting the video not too slow okay and oh okay let's not do that you good okay well actually close but the height height how did you screw that up man come on so close oh no oh my god that will go there sorry how's your forearm ouchy okay it's in okay can we just leave it like [Laughter] no okay down on the left way too much that's pretty good right now oh that's not no no back up back up i would just leave it there it's actually not bad now we just have to plug everything in yeah let's just put the xbox down there there's so many options i actually kind of love this setup because we had a mesh thing put in here so we can have cooling in here if we really want to um i thought we were putting a subwoofer in there i don't actually think this sub is gonna fit in there oh actually it might i'm gonna i'm gonna take my best shot at it though i'm gonna say it's not gonna sound great yeah oh you know what that actually kind of might work here what the oh this is about to get really fun now okay you ready boys no wait till i pull this uh hide and seek hiding spot on my kids they will literally never find me okay try to come out now thank you very funny there's so much space to work back here honestly it's kind of amazing what we're doing right now oops is i'm plugging the e-arc hdmi port into this little a9 box from sony this is the wireless slash processing box for their super cool a9ht speaker set it's pretty expensive but compared to a single sound bar it is a actually kind of good solution obviously it's not going to sound as good as the home theater setup downstairs but the positioning of the speakers is super flexible and they look really nice so the wife approval factor is very high these got the crap kicked out of them when we were working on that video for sony because jake forgot to take them out of our leaning tower of forgot i didn't make the tower who made the tower oh no anyway one of the coolest things about these is that you can kind of put them wherever you want then they measure the room and adjust now that's a feature that's available on lots of audio products everything from sound bars to actual full home theater setups but because these are four discrete speakers you're going to get better directionality out of them than you can from a single source sitting right under your tv and we did try them and even though it was sponsored they do actually sound pretty good and the effect is very good we won't say things even in a sponsored video that we don't actually think yeah so are you i mean i'd like to have it here but i have no idea where i know if i plug that in the back ones i've positioned here i'm just gonna put it here and then i'll just like tuck the oh my god there's a hole already beautiful you got that there's a hole on the other side no use your tv as a center speaker next yes they have these drivers directly behind the panel and when you use a compatible surround setup you can actually use the tv speakers themselves like like built in here as your center channel so we've got our right we got our left the right our center we got our rear and we got our other the right is not powered yet oh well i'm working on it yeah drill the hole i'm working on it geez i'm trying to tell the people about the center speaker ow andy i have an idea if i go at an angle like this i can go through i can go through the wall here and then the bottom of this empty space this cavity here and meet up with my hole i made here that goes through the wall here oh are you using that up there don't worry about it you can see it oh it's here did i get it yeah mine a problem here's a couch and there's a speaker i'm not sure what yvonne has planned for these but i'm fairly certain that this isn't it oh beautiful now we just need some decor this is an yvonne initiative she's been buying every lego plant thing that they release and she's planning to use them in place of actual plants in our house i actually think it looks kind of amazing though my grandmother gave me this egg what she ever expected me to do with it i'll never know but now it's here my random sword from the richmond night market i need decor items why do i suck at this so much ah fake plans yes success oh god that has to have been done by one of the kids that's not going up how's that one look mediocre at best size wise does this kind of work it's a little small it is a little small it's small man i know it's small jake telling me it's small some more doesn't change anything you sound like yvonne i was gonna say is that a soft spot for you you seem like you've heard that a few times it's better but the frame is awful uh yeah the frame doesn't really work you should paint the frame yeah i could paint the frame but you can do it right now for me no i can't paint the frame right now well i mean you have like gap or tape well you know i could oh really not bad hey andy now for the real maneuver getting everything assembled and on the wall without getting paint on myself or anything else especially not this white carpet yeah you boys ready or the aussie drops it very high okay it's in the glass is in wow look at that it looks better than a dip it's temporary it's temperature it's a solid like i'm gonna give you a six six and a half okay we're gonna try the optimization [Music] it's pretty good it's a lot better than just a sound bar way better than just a sound bar and that was the goal especially in this environment just a sound bar would be awful probably this is not bad though this room like feels good the egg's a little weird oh yeah the eggs here look it's from my grandmother okay works pretty good it's a little bit i feel like it is cockeyed a little bit but you know maybe if i just this is pretty good it's definitely not the theater room no but it's pretty damn good for what it is it was never going to be the theater room i would say this is excellent for what we're trying to do like being able to get this level of surround sound but stealthy in this form factor looking this good in this kind of space was unheard of until this kind of product existed one thing with the cuties yeah one thing with the qd oleds is it seems like they reflect more light so the black doesn't look as black in a lit room like this but it's still way better than an lcd holy look at how red that is you know the tv being the center channel actually helps those speakers being so high not sound so weird yeah perfect world i think what i would like to do is get those out a little bit farther and then move the tv up and get a super slim speaker and mount it under the tv to make up the difference in height because they do have a speaker output on the tv so it'll pass through that's the project for another day though for now this room is freaking
