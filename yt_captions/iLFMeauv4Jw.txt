let me explain a simple strategy that could help you get more software engineer interviews and it's so obvious and simple that anybody can do it getting a software engineer interview right now is difficult for basically everybody new grads interns even people with experience are having issues a job opens up and in 5 seconds there's thousands of applications It's just tough and it had me thinking there has to be a better way to job hunt right and I understand that connections really matter right they help you get referrals you know you get to meet people but I don't know how to start a connection and it feels in genuine messaging somebody on LinkedIn for a connection or referral and so I kept thinking and the answer is so obvious I feel like an idiot right the secret strategy is building in public so what is building in public building in public is pretty straightforward all you're doing is sharing your coding projects and progress online where instead of keeping your work hidden you're going to publish it for the world to see it's basically a portfolio that shows off your programming skills and development over time it lets people roast your code into Oblivion maybe help you out by offering suggestions or even help out with development or of course the main benefit that made you click on this video it could help you get some interviews because it could get your work in front of thousands of people which include Tech recruiters and hiring managers or companies it's a surprisingly easy thing to do and in this Tech Market probably a better way to get interviews than desperately applying to every LinkedIn job because you're actually showing your skills you're proving to people that you know what you're doing there's really no cons when it comes to this strategy it showcases your projects that you should be doing anyways if you don't have experience you get to network with other people who are supporting you along the way and it could help you get interview because you're impressing people with your skills the only con is probably the haters and rude comments but if you can get past that this is a really great way of getting your name known in the tech industry okay I think you get the point and you're probably wondering well how do I even start building in public let me give you the steps so you can start building in public step one set up your social media this step is pretty obvious since you can't build in public without social media these are the platforms I recommend the first one is LinkedIn this is where all the businesses and corporate people are which means it's a great place for anything job related so make an account fill out everything to the best of your abilities and make sure you have a decent profile picture don't use some anime profile picture unless you're already an amazing developer platform number two Twitter or X I don't know I still prefer Twitter a lot of developers recruiters and managers are just there posting random stuff so make your profile and follow those people third platform is Discord this one's pretty interesting since there's a lot of coding communities out there in Discord some communities even post jav openings and sometimes you can even meet people who are already software engineers and you can chat with them pretty easily compared to other platforms just remember to be respectful and not act like a Discord mod so make a Discord and join any Tech communities you're interested in and the last platform of course is GitHub I hope you have a GitHub if you don't have one go make it what the make your profile there since this is where your code is going to live and where you can find any projects you want to contribute to and this is where you're going to meet the most technical people all right great you have your social media set up now what step two post or share some content but what does content mean well it can be a bunch of things you can make some blog posts write some tutorials some guides make sure you're writing something technical this can be your experience using some framework or programming language how you made a certain project your perspective on a certain technology just anything technical include detailed steps images code Snippets and promote it across your social medias you can also make content using projects you're working on by posting screenshots or by talking about certain aspects of your project this could be a cool feature you made and how it works a bug you're stuck on and don't understand a general question on how something should be implemented and asking if there's better ways of doing it or you can simply just announce that you made this project and that you deployed it live somewhere so people can mess around with it the goal is just to show off that you're working on something and if it's a really high quality project then people will notice and talk about it which could lead to some pretty good opportunities if you want an example of what type of content you should post you should check out Cassidy Williams she's an amazing example of building in public Cassidy has been documenting her entire journey in T from her projects her questions her experiences everything I promise you if you check out Cassidy's website or any of her social medias you'll learn a lot on how to build in public now if you do open source you can also use your open source contributions to make content you can make content about the bugs you fixed about the features you added or just talk about your general experience with the project and by doing this you'll show to others that you take initiative and that you're very passionate and curious about the project you're working on and it's a good indic that you have some skills now a quick disclaimer about open source do not do open source only for Content only do open source if you genuinely enjoy the project nobody cares if you updated the read me because of a grammar mistake anyways now that you're posting some content this leads to step number three Network and engage with the community hopefully by this point you've started posting your own content on your social media accounts and you've started to follow some people but you can take it even further by engaging with the community what does that mean exactly one way you can can engage is by replying to any comments or responses to the content you've made this helps you get your content seen by even more people and it's a pretty nice way to network since now you have something to talk to people about not only that but those conversations will be a lot more meaningful and those go a lot further than a simple message on LinkedIn another way to engage is by simply commenting on other people's posts this could be from funny memes to writing helpful replies where you provide resources and assistance next way to engage is by joining online developer communities and becoming a regular presence there the more you engage in a single Community the more well-known you'll be in that Community which will make it easier to network with people and could lead to some amazing opportunities you can take it even further by attending in-person events like local meetups conferences or hackathons and while you're there really try your best to participate talk with people join the activities they have really just have fun and interact plus you get to touch some grass just do the best you can to engage with the Tech Community all right now that you're posting content and you're interacting with the community it's time time to keep this momentum going step number four promote your work consistently share all your projects and posts on all your social medias anywhere you can and ask others to share your work if they find it helpful the bigger your social media presence is the more likely you'll get some opportunities so create some teasers some videos announcements anything that will link to your personal project and not only will you be building in public it'll also make your personal project stronger on your resume if you could actually get some users and the next way to promote yourself is by repurposing content turn a blog post into a video tutorial turn that video into Tik toks try to milk the content you make as much as you can at this point you're basically a master at building in public and gaining an audience but this step is the most important one of the all step number five make it a habit yep pretty simple it's easy to build in public for 1 to 2 weeks when you hit that 3:00 a.m. motivation but soon enough you're going to start forgetting or you're just going to get tired of it and laziness is going to hit you and once that happens all the work you did is going to go to waste not only that but it could take a while to start seeing some benefits from this building an audience is a marathon and not a Sprint the good news is we don't need an audience of thousands we could get by with an audience of a few hundred but getting there could take some time you need to turn this into a habit dedicate some time specifically for building in public record a bunch of videos or schedule some social media posts so you always have a backlog of content to publish set some reminders to engage with your social media networks for at least once a day and and continuously come up with new ideas for projects articles discussions based on your current skills or interests follow all these steps and you'll definitely start getting more attention and it'll slowly create a Snowball Effect since you'll keep getting bigger and bigger in the community which will eventually get you more interviews or maybe you'll end up becoming a tech influencer which has its own perks and one of those perks is today's sponsor brilliant brilliant is one of the best ways to learn math data science and computer science in an interactive and engaging way which is great if
