hey hey there you go Casey uh this is Casey Molly rocket handmade hero this is obviously some sort of take probably from one of his live streams that he does on Twitch and he's just going to talk about various languages yeah rust is I mean Russ is probably a fine language but you know it's not as good as iron ore iron ore is a way better language um also uh the uh the zinc oxide language is very good um I think I think I'm missing the joke here but I feel like there's a joke that's happening and I'm too stupid to understand chemistry Bros I don't get you oxygen monoxide is one of my favorite languages it's got a ton of good stuff in it um you know because Russ has the borrow Checker which people like to talk about um but the but the zinc oxide is a way better language and the borrow Checker has a lot of limitations zinc oxide has the uh theft release feature the the police is like way better than the borrow checker um okay and are those like sagandis I can't quite tell but if they're like the sagandis I mean that's like one of my favorite programming paradigms of all time uh and similarly like like the garbage collection features are like like goes garbage collection is terrible whereas zinc oxide has actually um Recycling and composting that's gonna be composting uh and memory composting is like way more powerful than garbage collection right yeah uh because one of the problems that you get in in languages like oh that focus on garbage collection is that uh eventually there's uh you run out of raw materials right so you're collecting the garbage you know I know this is a joke but I'm currently writing a program in which my services do run out of memory so it's not funny for me okay so executing manual GCS is actually the solution for me right now and so I've been emotionally bruised and it's not funny okay this is not funny right now okay I'm not laughing I see you guys are laughing but I don't think it's funny I think it's stupid I was putting it in uh into the landfill segment and then eventually you know either you run out of space in a landfill segment uh or you end up in a situation where you just don't have any raw materials anymore at all right yeah yeah um so you know in a language like though all the number has to come from the memory Garden The Memory Gardens planted at startup time and uh after you harvest all of the memory in the memory Garden and your garbage collector has collected all of that used memory and thrown it away in the landfill segment uh that's it right I mean the program just stops I mean basically uh not not to mention all the health problems and so one of the things about zinc oxide which makes it far superior um or also I I don't think that I don't even know what he's saying at this point am I the one on drugs I can't even tell I don't know if you guys look at stop lying stop laying is kind of like go but with composting with memory composting right because they recognized the fact um that you know you you have this sort of inherent problem uh with garbage collection where all of the code just just ends up in a landfill and there's you know all of all that memory descends from the landfill after it's used it's a really big problem so stop laying but also zinc oxide because zinc oxide is really like way better uh right um yeah stop playing I feel like you know he's avoiding talking about the sagandis it's like on his lips but he's just not committing to it it was kind of just only internal uh uh to fugle um and you know they they sort of have it out there but it's not really whereas uh zinc oxide was more of an open language took more feedback from the academic Community we all know how good the academic communities of sign language is very good the fact that they never writing a code doesn't you know shouldn't be held against him uh so anyway zinc oxide has in that has the memory composting so what that allows you to do is after you use uh some memory from the memory Garden which obviously you know all of them has to go through memory card at some point uh in order to to have the memory be nitrogen fixated when it's initially uh created uh unless you're in in plisk obviously plisk code and data are interchangeable and you can and you know everything everything is a flip uh in that language so that's like a different kind of language so I would I would say uh yeah don't don't take that one too seriously I don't even get that joke at this point I've officially I officially have left my ability to understand what is even being made fun of at this point I think this is a lisp a joke but I don't get lisp I'm not a cool kid I don't know how to program lisp so therefore I don't even know what I'm talking about uh it's just a little bit weird but assuming that you're using zinc oxide or stop laying um you know that compost review is really important because you know then instead of all of the garbage selected memory just getting thrown away all of that uh you know that that nutrient-rich used memory is put into a bin right it's put into a memory bin until it kind of has a chance to let you know usually what and I know this seems weird but this is very serious security research was done on both stop playing and sync oxide and so a lot of those other languages that you're that you're talking about there uh a lot of those other languages they don't appreciate the fact that there's a lot of other malicious code normally running on the machine there's like malware you know viruses but those things are actually helpful right uh because what those things can do is if you just give them your used memory then what will happen is those malwares will actually they will metabolize the used memory and turn it back into re remember you can use in your actual program right so a typical language like like stop laying or zinc oxide that has some of these more modern memory composting features they'll take that used memory after you know you use as deep as it gets you know I didn't realize that virus we've been we could have defeated viruses this whole time by just giving us giving them the garbage the garbage memories it's all time is it in your actual program to do some computations and store some things in they'll put it into the memory composting bin and that bin is essentially you can think of it as a memory sandbox right that is running all of the malware on your machine and it's it's allowing that composted memory right to be metabolized by the malware in back into usable memory and so that is a really uh you know again very Cutting Edge uh very very very Cutting Edge language feature wow that things like stop playing and zinc oxide have uh and you know it's one of the reasons why you know those are really great languages I can see why everyone always comes on the stream and asks me what I think of them I forgot what it was like to take acid but I think I remember again I think I fully get it now you know because you know obviously when you're in the zone you know these things are natural they're obvious you know they just come to you this is why the sophistications out there but afterwards you you forget but here it's like I got to live I got to live it in real life actively and this idea of being able to recycle memory by letting your your viruses and your malwares clean your your garbage your garbage memories composted to be usable Again by the program it's just brilliant it's honestly just brilliant see this is why this is why I could never be a security researcher I'm just too stupid for it I'm honestly just too stupid for it one day though one day I'll get it the name's the primogen
