I'm going to show you how to write down different Infinities the very first one is the lazy eight symbol so this was introduced to mathematics as Infinity in the 17th century when say John Wallace apparently it was used before and the term for this was a lazy eight uh which I really like so this is just Infinity just Infinity you say it like it's just a trivial thing yes now let's go back to the 17th century for a moment step into the time machine if you will at the time mathematics as you know it was more computational in a way what you might expect mathematics to be or you know if you grab somebody in the St like tell me what is mathematics and they will tell well it's Computing things this infinity symbol really just meant something that never ends and you know continues and then you can study vaguely how it work so you know it tends to Infinity it gets closer to this value or so so and so so for example 1/ 12 1/3 one4 1 15 and so on if you go to Infinity it approaches zero there's no point that you find zero in the sequence but it gets closer and closer and closer to zero in that sense that was fine when we arrive to the 19th century in part because of so many other secular developments in the world the the concept of infinity becomes more tangible in a sense and people start asking what if those an actual object in mathematics that's infinite so for example if you just write down the natural numbers all right so this is zero and one and two and so on but you can say let me just put all of them into one big collection so just one set it contains all the natural numbers we're not Computing this set we're not trying to build it slowly one step at a time it just exists it's just the then what right and this was actually the start of set theory and what can we say about this it's an infinite thing and we can actually talk about how many things are inside of it right so there infinitely many but the first thing G Kanto who developed set theory the first thing he noticed there are different sizes of infinity so not just different types or meanings to Infinity but actual different sizes some infinite things are strictly smaller than others famously the natural numbers if we put this absolute value to them are strictly smaller than the real numbers right so the real numbers are all the numbers you can really think of so um pi and E square root of 5 and so on on the other hand this this has the same size if you will as the complex numbers so this is the real numbers but also the imaginary unit the square root of minus one everything else that you can generate from this so Kanto said well we need these are new numbers they we need new symbol for this eventually he settled on the ALF notation so Alf is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and he used Alf zero or Alf not or Al null to denote the size of this natural numbers so this is an infinity and the real numbers turned out to be the size of it is two to the power of Alf KN okay right that we do know the correlation exactly yes right now Cantor had made a very why two well that's well it can be a lot of things actually could be three and four and five it could also be Alf knot to the power of the Al Al notot are those numbers are the same all give you the same result why did you use two then just because it's the first number yeah okay yeah so Cantor had noticed that there's two ways in a way to generate larger Infinities so this is why we have this zero here right so there's Alf one which is the next largest Infinity right so there's nothing between them and next to that we have Alf 2 there's nothing between them yes so two to the alfn or these ones here yeah they're smaller than Alf one no so since this is larger than Alf not yeah right then we have that alf1 is less or equal than 2 to the ALF not right and canor actually hypothesized that they're equal this is what he formulated as the Continuum hypo is famously he tried to prove it for years on end and failed and after mathematics had been formalized and set theory had been written down into the ACs we know today actually Paul Corin and Kurt goodle prove the two parts of this theorem we cannot prove this and we cannot disprove this so it's possible in so mathematical universe that they are equal and it's possible in some mathematical universe that this is strictly greater than that so when so the the real numbers the set of the real numbers what Infinity are they are they they're not alf1 but maybe they are yeah so there are two to the AL not yeah which is an exact value yeah but where does it sit on the ALF kind of scale we can't prove okay we can there's some limitations that we can say oh it can be this or it can be that but those are very minor ones and and it can be almost anything what is there anything that there is Alf one of or Alf two of or so that's a great question um it's hard to describe this right but uh Alf one is in fact a size of something very concrete very abstract mind you but in in as far as concrete as you can get in these kind of things however it's not something that you can describ by it this collection of real numbers has size out of one so it's it's not very simple to explain what it is uh I'll say it in just two lines because some of you might be interested uh if you consider all the ways you can well order the natural numbers and if if you group them together by saying this is the same type of order alf1 is the size of how many types you can get uh from well ordering of the natural numbers but it's not all the different ways you can rearrange them it's not it's not no that is actually two to the ALF not what number does Alf go up to do we get Alf 10 Alf 20 so you can keep going and going and going and then eventually you reach something that we call Alf Omega now in some places somebody might write Alf Alf not cuz you've gone through all the natural numbers so now so that's Alf Infinity yes but the there's a slight difference in the notation which is a difference in context which is why we use the Omega and after this you can put Alf Omega + 1 and Alf Omega Plus plus two and so on so it's infinity infinity + 1 infinity plus two and all the way up to infinity plus infinity and further and further and further there's no last Alf there's no largest Alf this just sounds like a kid saying you know when you say to a kid is there a number bigger than infinity they'll just say oh infinity plus one and then they'll say oh infinity plus infinity and they're not wrong no yeah this is kind of the the the thing right Infinity as this was understood this original Infinity in from the 17th century infinity + one makes no sense once you have put this into an actual Concept in mathematics it starts to the question makes sense now and it has an answer so the reason and this is exactly why we put Omega and not Alf Z cuz if you think about sizes Alf 0 + 1 is just Alf zero but Omega indicates something else so Omega GA + 1 is strictly greater than Omega so those are two symbols in fact for the same Infinity in away but the context where you understand them is very different I feel like when I when I challenge you to tell me something that was Alf One MH you kind of gave me something you said okay and it was to do with re all the different rearrangements of the natural numbers can you do that for all the numbers like if I start saying oh what's something that's Al of s or what's something that's Al of 4 that you could you could construct something it's exactly the same thing you say okay take something of size Al one look at all the different ways you can rearrange it in you know in something called a well Order Group them by type how many types did you get Al of two this is how you get the next one okay right all right so it's just rearrangements of the rearrangements of the rearrangements yeah is this as big as Infinity gets it gets bigger and bigger until eventually you run out of set how can you run out exactly we end up with kind of a concept like this like this 17th century Infinity uh although we refer to this nowadays as a proper class so it's a collection that's too big to be a set but we can still describe it and talk about it you know in a way um because I guess all the different ways you're rearranging your rearrangements is tending towards something just like the natural numbers we're tending towards something exactly yeah and there's some very good analogy between how we treat proper classes which are this objects so big they're not collections of they're not sets anymore they're not Bonafide mathematical objects and how you treat Infinity if you're coming from the natural numbers there's very good relationship between those two canor actually gave that concept a name he called it t which is the last letter in the Hebrew alphabet that one did not catch on at all uh but he already knew that as a concept it's kind of inconsistent this kind of absolute Infinity uh absolute Infinity I like that yes and so that's where this chain you showed me of the alfs is heading towards yes absolute Infinity yeah exactly or and that's what Taff is as well yes but again nobody uses the symbol there's no yeah a that's a shame a little bit so what is the current biggest thing the Des like what is what's current thinking about if I said well where does this all end what's the current Grand so the thing is that you can ask okay uh let me study a mathematical universe and ask about this kind of you know sizes that it has and between different universes one of them could have more than the other or they might have the same ones but disagree on you know where something Falls or whether something is Alf one in the one universe is actually Alf 2 in the other or maybe it's not anything now we're veering very deeply into mathematical philosophy uh and you want to ask is there a one Universe of mathematics in which case you just have all of this you reach this absolute infinity and you're done maybe there's a Multiverse of mathematical universes and then maybe they all have the same absolute infinity and they just disagree on the placement or maybe there's just increasingly higher and higher absolute Infinities and whichever one you're working in has its absolute Infinity but you can move to the next one that has a b one cuz it feels like with these alfs you were showing me once you'd finished that process finished in quotation marks you could then just rearrange those ones right and then you know like it just feels like you could just keep compounding it and compounding it and yeah and here we get into kind of the the the subtle and and very important issues in set theory about what if is you know a set versus a proper class and why can we do this and not that that's a whole other video let me ask you this I'm not I'm all about pure research right sure I don't care if this can be used to build a bridge or send people to the Moon you know I'm I love that mathematicians think about things just for the sake of thinking about things but I do kind of wonder where this is going like what the point of this is like because it doesn't feel like it would even inform other mathematics well it turns out that it really does so for example uh even if we just focus right now on what is this size uh the two to the ALF not 2 to the ALF not yes so it could be Alf one could be alf2 could be Al three right one of the axioms that you can add to mathematics uh and they're called forcing axioms and we're not even going to touch that they imply that two to the ALF not is Alf 2 now on its own this implication is not very interesting but the fing axioms themselves have a lot of useful applications that will affect things in analysis vaguely out there but they do affect things in analysis which then affect physics and engineering and eventually Computing and Building Bridges with those computers all of this study turns out to to be way Upstream from this but it does lead you somewhere and the way I like to describe this is this helps develop the language through which you can come up with ideas which will eventually influence mathematics sometimes when I talk to astronomers and people who study space for a living I say to them when you're talking about the distances to the planets or the distances to the Stars or the distances to the galaxies and you throw around these numbers Tri trivially yes do you think you really understand how big the universe is when you're lying in bed do you really think you're comprehending how far it is to Andromeda mhm now I'm asking you a set theorist who deals with infinity every day and throws around Infinity like pieces of candy do you think you're really grasping the seriousness of infinity so that's a great question um yes and no it's kind of a double thing uh on the one hand you sometimes sit down and you just overwhelmed by this and and it's just and other days if you close your eyes and you focus really really intensely you can see the differences and you can understand in what sense this is smaller than the the other and and so on these are even small compared to what I normally deal with um other people in set the will give you very different answers the important thing is we have a definition that is very concrete and you can work with that definition if you do it carefully you know you're fine it feels to me a bit like when you were talking to me about the alfs here you're basically just taking Infinities and turning them into normal numbers and then just doing powers and permutations and things and playing with them like they're normal numbers except they Infinities yeah but they are normal numbers right CU what is a number it's just an abstract quantity put into a concept so this is just the concept of how many natural numbers are there right so let me ask you this so we have seen that the real numbers are so much bigger than the natural numbers uh okay so the natural numbers are a subset of the rational numbers half you know four quarters which is one and so on which are a subset of the real numbers so we know that there's a jump in size between those two yeah where would you say that there rational numbers where where would they sit my intuition is that they might fit at the same level as the natural numbers mhm why because it feels like it feels like they're graspable or attainable in the way that the natural numbers are whereas the real numbers there's always feels I don't know the real numbers just feel more slippery the rational numbers feel more like I can get my hands on them what's the answer well you're absolutely spot on uh the there is in fact a way to put you know all the rationals kind of into the natural numbers in this kind of sense so it's an Alf n yeah it is yes so I'm right yeah yeah well done I keep telling you you could be a set theorist yeah so even though you know because the intuition says like well okay for every natural number there's infinitely many real numbers right between zero and one there's a whole lot of them but there's also a lot of rational numbers in fact between any two real numbers there's a rational numbers and yet the rational numbers are so much smaller than the real numbers and this is very mindboggling and a lot of people have a very hard time wrapping their head around this and again this is why we have conrete and specific definitions and if you work with them slowly eventually you get used to them as John fman said you don't understand things you get used to them and then it makes sense if it's got a greater than zero chance of hitting that point the same goes for every other point on the dart board and there's infinitely many of them in fact there's a big Infinity of those mathematical points when we add all those chances together to give us the chance that the dart's going to hit the dart board at all we end up with an infinite probability we can't have an infinite probability
