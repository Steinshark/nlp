- Oh, you have no idea what
you are getting yourself into. - No! - Oh my god. - That's extra? That's not extra. - Dude. - MrBeast and Simon just changed my life. - In this video, $100,000 will be given to completely
random Twitch streamers, swear on my life. And just to clarify, only
$50,000 of this $100,000 is mine. I'm actually collabing with
Miniminter on this video and so half of every donation
is actually going to be him. He's doing $50,000, I'm doing $50,000. So together, $100,000 will
be donated in this video. If they win a game of
"Fortnite," they get $10,000. If they lose, the money gets carried
over to the next person. So if three people lose in a row, the fourth person gets
to play for $40,000. You'll understand. So this is our first victim right here. We've already established it,
if he wins this next game, not this game, the next
game, he gets $10,000. If he loses, the person after
him gets to play for $20,000. - "So nervous, you better not lose the next take when 10K is on the line." Dude, I need that fucking
10K, you have no idea. Oh, you have no idea what you
are getting yourself into. - Nothing do with him but I
kinda hope some people lose so other people have to
play for like 20 or $30,000. 'Cause that'd be like super intense. - You could buy a car
if you win this game. - I could outright buy
the motorbike I want and pay for the next
license and the insurance. - Then you better win, man. This is not a joke. All he has to do to win 10 grand is win this game, that's it. - Stop reading and focus. - Dude, what if he died by like a trap? - Dude, I would feel so bad. ♪ Here comes the money ♪ - Stop reading and focus. This is the most important
game of your life. - Good old MrBeast just rocking
the nerves ever so slightly. - This is probably more
than he'll get in donations the rest of the year
on the line right here. Oh no. No, he did not just do that to him. Dude, this guy is insane.
- Thanks, I love it. - This guy is insane. He did that without taking any damage. - I'm actually shaking, I can't aim. I'm shaking, dude. Legit. - Extra, no, no. - Fair enough. - Hey, if it makes you feel better, the next person gets to play for 20 grand. - Man, so I appreciate that 153. MrBeast with the 140, I appreciate it. - This next person plays
for 20 grand, jeez. That's a lot of freaking money, man. Oh, we could do mynameschai. He was in the last one. - Oh my god, he did it.
- Wow. - He did it.
- Chris, is it against the rules
to let Chai play again? - There are no rules.
- Oh yeah, you're right. We write our own rules around here. - Time for round two.
- Oh shit. - Check Simon's DM on Twitter. This time, the stakes are higher. Win the next game and you get $20,000- - Next game, yeah bro?
- From me and Simon, no joke. - I did it before, I'll do
it again, fuck that game. - Is he gonna drink some orange juice? - I need my OJ, I need my sweet, sweet OJ. - Orange juice.
- Orange juice. - That better be orange juice. - Is that orange juice? - Shut up. - Hey Simon, do you think he will win? - Hey Simon, do you think he will win? I'm not too sure, man, but we are all winners thanks to Quidd. You are right. As long as I have Quidd
downloaded, I'm a winner. - Oh, gunfight. $20,000. You can see he's starting
to remember, oh shit. - Boing. Dude, he went up like
Mario, like boing, pow. 11 people are standing
between this man and $20,000. - You gotta be downloading
Quidd from the app store, okay? - He spelled it wrong, it's two D. We'll give him an A plus
for effort, right Quidd? Timeout, before we go any further, I need to tell you guys where
all this money came from. The king has returned, welcome home Quidd. The app that has sponsored all these videos you see on your screen. The app that has allowed me just to change an insane
amount of lives is back. Now if you don't know what Quidd is, it's an app where you can
collect rare cards and stickers and because there's a limited amount, you know they have a
little bit of value to 'em. But regardless, "Naruto"
is my favorite show. I've seen all 500 episodes of "Shippuden" and when I saw they added
"Naruto" stickers and cards, I went insane and instantly
collected them all. It is my favorite show. But if anime isn't your thing, they have cards and stickers
for whatever show you like. Like "Game of Thrones," they
have everything up there and then you can take these
cards that you collect and you can text them to
your friends who also like similar shows or even cooler,
you can create a shelfie. A shelfie lets you showcase
your rare cards and stickers to all the other people
that friend you on the app, which by the way if you
friend me on Quidd, MrBeast, I'll be messaging some of you guys back. Now there is something I
really need you to do, okay? When this video goes public, two packs will go public on Quidd, okay? A MrBeast pack and a Miniminter pack and we're having a competition to see which pack can get 100,000
cards collected first. But if you open up a MrBeast pack, you can't open up a Miniminter pack. If you open up a Miniminter pack, you can't open up a MrBeast pack. So you have to pick one or the other. I need you to go to the app store, download Quidd and open up a MrBeast pack so I can reach the 100,000
card collected goal before him because I do
not want to lose to him. And yeah, let's get back to donating. Oh, oh. - Wait, what?
- This man needs to focus. - I'm freaking out.
- I know, right? Flashback to last time when I donated, his sister was like
"You can pay rent now." - "Oh my god, you can pay rent." - Why'd you jump? You had a clear shot. Four people left besides him. No.
- Oh well. - Since Chai lost, the next person now has
to play for $30,000. If this person, bluesdank
wins this next game, he gets $30,000. - Win this next game and you get $30,000 from
me and Simon, no joke. - Okay, so next game, all right. 30,000 is a lot of money. Yeah, you could say that. - I want this guy to
win, he needs the money. I want to make him more nervous but I don't at the same time. - Don't get nervous, it's only $30,000. - Shut up. Ugh. - If you win, you can buy over 10,000 copies of sherk. - Sherk? You spelled "Shrek" wrong, oh dear. I think we know who
needs the 30 grand more. - I'm taking my 30 grand and I'm leaving. Thank you very much. I really want him to win,
I'm done talking to him. - I'm not gonna drink
the other half-shield. I'm not drinking the other half-shield. Yeah, I should download
Quidd, you're right. Oh yeah, you're right, thank you. No, oh! - No.
- Oh my god. Oh no. Oh my god, Jimmy, oh my god. Thank you for the $1,000 donation, my man. Or 768 pounds 50 pence. I could work as a cashier,
I might have to now. - I didn't think people
would lose this much. So we're doing 40 next?
- $40,000 next game. - Yep, that is a lot of money. But rules are rules. ♪ Every day I think about
the money, let's go ♪ - MrBeast6000, "Win next game and me and Simon donate 40,000,
this is a YouTube video." - Okay, I was just gonna donate, oh okay. ♪ About the money, let's go ♪ - "It has to be solo
winner, you get 40,000." Okay, let's go then, baby. - Not even joking guys, he wins
this game, he gets $40,000. No joke, no BS. All he has to do to get
$40,000 is win this game. - Please. - Oh, what the ? - Dude, how is he this crazy?
- What? Where is he? Did he go to Mars?
- Yeah. - I can't tell. - Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I had to kill him.
- No. No. - No! No, dude. No! - No, no.
- No! - My ears.
- Nah-uh, my ears. - Sorry about the loss as well but the game ended, so have to move on. - Okay, MrBeast and Miniminter, listen. I appreciate you guys so much. - Don't make me nervous. "I'm not joking." Ooh. - Wait, MrBeast.
- Okay. - It's 50,000.
- Okay. - Oh, 50. Wait.
- 50,000. - Just say 40 so she doesn't
get confused but hey viewers, it's actually $50,000, so
she's in first surprise. I hope she wins.
- Touch down right here, boys. - If she loses, that
means we gotta do $60,000 and if they lose, that's 70. - "[Streamer] Think of
everything you can buy with 40." - Put the minis in the one slot. - What? - "Boi, who puts minis in my first," I put minis in my first slot.
- Why? - What is wrong with you?
- I put minis in my two. Ah man, screw you. "40,000 could buy you a lot of stuff." - I hope she wins or I'm
gonna feel really bad. I know I said that about everyone but I just want to keep reminding you. If they lose, I'll feel really bad. - Ooh, she got a supply drop. - Just don't get comfy.
- I just said "Don't lose all your health." - Don't lose all your health. - That's how you win.
- Dude, that was great advice. - I can't look at Tilted, bro. My FPS drops to 40 every
time I look over there. - Why?
- You should win. Use the 50 grand to buy a better computer. Three people left. I'm gonna remind her she has
a jump pad just to be nice. - I remembered, I got that. - All right, all right.
- Holy shit, who's over there? - I'll just stand over here,
I'll mind my own business. See, I would say "Why the are you shooting at someone so far away?" But nope, nope, I'll just
mind my own business. Oh, there's two people left. I'd let them fight it out. Honestly if I was her,
I'd let them fight it out. No. - She's getting sniped at too. - Oh . Oh my god. Oh my god. - She has no clue where he is. Oh. - Oh. Oh dude, dude. Oh, dude. - Right beside you. - No Chris, no! - Ugh, oh well, he had 14 kills. - Simon. - Let's watch him win.
- My heart. - Yeah.
- Watch the nutcracker win. - I was so confident, I was so confident. - I know.
- Oh well, we tried. - What are we giving her? Let's give her 1000 each.
- Yeah, $1000 each. - Dude.
- I guess so. ♪ The party is on ♪ ♪ Let's go, shots, shots,
shots, shots, shots ♪ ♪ Shots, shots for everybody ♪ - Opening parenthesis. Are you serious? ♪ Let's go, shots, shots,
shots, shots, shots ♪ - There was a second place
or third place prize. - No, there was it.
- Thank you, both of you. - If you win a solo game,
me and Simon will donate 60. - Thank you for the tip, MrBeast. "If you win a solo game, me
and Simon will donate $60,000." I can win a solo game, just not like a specific
solo game, you know? Also I've had a beer.
- Next game. - Miniminter, thank you for the tip. "You don't win the challenge,
it's gonna cost $60,000." I know, that's a freaking lot of money. Let me put my lucky backpack on. - That is true, none of the
other guys had lucky backpacks. That's probably why they all lost. - I'm tempted just to
drop Tilted for the meme. - She just said she's , my body believe those words. $60,000 and she's like "I need to go to Tilted for the meme. I don't want 60 grand." - "Think of what you
could buy with 60,000." Is this how it's gonna be? I'm gonna be distracted
the whole time as well? I could just play it safe,
would that be really boring? - Oh my god, no. What if she hits like a
crazy headshot right now? - It's not gonna happen.
- Why do I get sweaty lately? - She has 19 health in a firefight, bro. - Oh my god. - Oh well, what a shame. - Simon. - Why?
- I know guys, my fault. - That was $60,000.
- Sorry. - I just got a DM from Simon and MrBeast saying that they will donate me $70,000 if I win this next game of "Fortnight." I am shaking right now. "Good luck man, 70,000 is a lot of money." Calm down, Jack. You practiced for this moment. You've watched those MrBeast videos. What should I be doing? What else can earn me money right now? How many blinks in 15 seconds? Ah. That's gotta be worth some sort of money. "Don't lose this, this isn't a joke." Oh, I know It's not a joke. - Dude, if he doesn't
win, I'm gonna be mad. - MrBeast, "It's Quidd,
this time, don't lose. Thanks to Quidd, we all love Quidd." We love Quidd, download Quidd. Get stickers. There's three staples
in life, death, taxes, loving Quidd. - He nailed it. Pretty accurate.
- If I lose, I'll probably never have my
parents speak to me again. They will probably disown me. Win the tournament for one, go, P90. - Who needs a "Fortnite"
tournament when you have this? Wow, luck is on his side. No bandies? He's too cool for bandages. He's like "I don't need
'em, I won't take damage." - There's already only 73 people left. - Dude, he got some
killer loot too, he's set. I think he won. "Spam Doritos as a snack to Jack." They're spamming Doritos. Honestly, I hope one day I can have a live stream chat that's
as supportive as him. When he's stressed, they give him Doritos. - This is so messed up, dude. Hey MrBeast, go back to making freaking, oh my god. - Freaking what? Say it. - I can't even think of a joke. "Think of everything you
could buy with $70,000." MrBeast, stop dude, you're not helping. My hands are already shaking enough. Just actually stop, dude. I have almost 1400 wins. This is all I've done for the last nine months to prepare for this moment. - That's so true, that's the 21st century. Win a video game, two random
guys will give you 70 grand. - So if I get sniped right
now, I swear, I swear, I swear. Llama. Oh, it's a sign. - What? No, dude. - I'm literally kicking my feet. Oh my god, oh my god.
- Oh, it's a trap. This is where it all goes down. - Just run, man, we're
not gonna judge you. - We really won't. Someone took his Llama. Courageous, oh . - Oh, we don't like this
position at all, folks. - I don't like it. Dude, I'm nervous. He's gonna be out of med
by the time he gets there. Oh no, this is not good, this is not good. - Oh dude, he's so low on med. - Oh, he's moving 'cause of the zone. - Live to fight another day, boys. - What?
- Let's go, baby. - All right, there we go.
- Not done yet. Hey yo Quidd, I'll link the PayPal, baby. I'll link the PayPal, Quidd.
- You don't have to. - Oh shit. I might be done now.
- Quidd was like "What?" - Not done yet, Quidd. - I will say out of everyone so far, he does look like the
best chances of winning. He has a really good loadout. - If I died of the zone here, MrBeast and Simon, can we
cut this like 50-50, fam? - Aruba sounds good this
time of year, you know? Like that? Hey, y'all hear me loud and
clear, Simon and MrBeast? - Nope, sorry.
- Nope, I can't hear you. What, what? - No, we are not 'fin to do that, kid. That ain't it, buddy. That ain't it, bud.
- No sir, kid. I feel like I'm way more
nervous than the other people 'cause I genuinely want this guy to win. Jesus Christ. Wow.
- Wow. - Courage, calm down, man. - That ain't it, chief. - Just in case you weren't
aware, "That ain't it, chief." In case you guys didn't
know, that ain't it. This next one might be
it but that ain't it. That better be the top
comment, "That ain't it." - I need materials so bad. Where the hell was that even from? Top 10, baby, let's go. Simon, you gotta stop, bro. - Do you think he's got this? - Honestly, I do think he's gonna win but I'm like genuinely nervous for him. I'm kinda starting to shake.
- I'm so scared. - I know. Dude, like he seems so
happy and just positive. Like I really think he deserves the money. Jack, you've trained
your whole life for this. Don't let us down, man. - Yo, no matter what, MrBeast and Simon. - Yeah?
- Quidd, I love all you guys. Obviously you guys are collaborating but I mean especially MrBeast, what you've done for so many
content creators out there. Dear Lord, if you're out there, whatever higher power everyone
believes in, pray to it. - He's like a little kid
but at the same time, an adult which is what I like about him. - End on me, zone here. - Wait, what is that? - Half the zone's halved. - Dude, that's a tiny circle. - We gotta let these guys
get in a fight over here. - Just hide in the trees. Jack, hide. Dude, he cannot land a shot. It's like a three-way
stalemate right here. - Oh no, no, no, no. - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack. Jack, Jack! Jack! Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack. Oh, the zone's outside
the zone, this is it. Okay, this is it. This is his chance. - He's gonna try and trap him outside. - Oh my god.
- Nice. - Oh my god.
- Dude, he trapped him outside, holy shit. - Oh my god.
- I thought he died. All right.
- Oh my god. Oh my god.
- Simon, we have to donate. Donate now.
- My god. - So 35,000?
- Yeah, 35,000 each. Do it as quick as you can.
- Okay. - GG.

very popular YouTubers. One is named MrBeast, the other one is named
Miniminter from The Sidemen. They just joined my stream and said "If you win this next game,

already $35,000 from Simon and MrBeast is sending another $35,000. Oh yeah, one sec. Here we go, ready? - Thanks, Quidd. - I love it. $50,000 from MrBeast,
"It's bugging for me." What is happening? Oh my god. Oh my god. Wait, MrBeast just donated another 9,000. Oh my god. So Mini donated 35 grand
and said "Unreal, GG." Then MrBeast donated 15 grand and said "It's bugging for me." Then MrBeast donated 9,000 and says "I have lots of little donations." What on earth? - $1000. - $70,000. "It won't let me donate
the rest, PayPal sucks." Another 1000 from MrBeast. - All right, I got the
