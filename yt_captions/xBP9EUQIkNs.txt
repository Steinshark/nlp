- I've got some red solo cups and a lot of money I don't really want. All right, the objective for the video is to give away a bunch
of money using only cups. The rules are simple. One of the cups will have $1,000 under it. Pick the right cup, keep it. Jake, pick a cup. Now, you can do double or nothing. Would you like to do double or nothing? - Yes, please. - Pick a cup again. $2,000 Would you like
to do double or nothing? - Yes. - $4,000. And you get the point. They can do double or
nothing all the way up to a hundred grand, that's the limit, and if they do it, they can win it. Just pick a cup. If you pick them off money
under it, you can keep it. - Pick it up. - Oh.
- Aw. - Yeah, I wanted you to pick this one. - Oh, wow. - Hey, look it's-
- Put on the blindfold. All right, we're good. - All right.
- It's this one. - Nope.
- Aw! - All right, pick a cup. - He didn't even open his eyes. - No, I swear to God,
I kept my eyes closed and I thought to myself, "whatever." - All right, you doing double or nothing? - I like money.
- Yes. - This guy wants to play a game, right? It'll take two seconds.
- Seriously. That's what I'm talking about. - Yeah, I'll play. - All right, pick a cup, win the money under the cup. - I pick this cup. - Ah.
- Aw. We should start putting it under there. It was under this one. - Consolation prize. - Give him the consolation prize. - It's worth 10 seconds.
- Just pick it up. If you pick them one with money under it, you get to keep it. Hey. Here you go, seriously, it's yours. - Thanks? - You're welcome.
- You're welcome. - If you pick the right
cup, you win $1,000. - Tails, heads.
- Ooh. He's giving us a show. - Siri, flip a coin.
- Heads. - Ding, ding, ding. So now, a thousand dollars. You can do double or nothing. - No, I'll take it.
- All right, there you go. - No way. That's crazy. - Before we can go further,
I need to tell you about the company magically putting
the money under the cups. TikTok is an awesome
video app that allows you to create short clips doing
literally whatever you want. You can be original, like
PewDiePie, in your videos, or you can just react
to other people's video. PewDiePie recently did a video on TikTok and ever since then, Chris
hasn't put the app down. Like, it's a little crazy, you know? - I can't sleep. I've been watching it for days. - But yeah, to us,
TikTok's like the new vine. It's actually pretty entertaining. There is dos ways you can use TikTok. You can use it as a
source of entertainment, like YouTube, or you can
use it to express yourself and create cool videos. There's over 100 emoji stickers and even Halloween face
filters that are pretty cool. And to show you how cool
they are, we made our own. Hey Chris, you wanna see something cool? - Yeah, sure man. Show me. - Did it, did it work? - Oh Jesus, change it back, man. - Oh. It's not going back. What do I do? - Oh my God, we gotta go
to the hospital right now. Let's go. - But not only did I make a
TikTok, so did this person. Wow. This one's my favorite. That person should message me. We should be friends. You probably think something this great costs a million dollars. Well, it doesn't. It costs $0. It's actually free. - But what kind of phone can I get it on? - I'm glad you asked. It is available on iOS and Android. Just go on there, search
TikTok, download it right now. If you wanna allow me to blow more money and just be completely irresponsible, I'm gonna need you to click
the link in the description, download TikTok, go follow me, that's my name right
there, use the app a bunch. If you support them,
they'll support me more. Again, it's linked in the description. Click the link, download TikTok. Thank you, TikTok. You're awesome. I'll do my best to post
a couple times a week. Guess the right cup, you win $5,000. - Pick cup one or two. - Most important decision of your life. - Number two. - Hey.

- Okay, cool. He's gonna do double or nothing. So you won $500. If you win again, now you get a thousand. - Number two again. - Two again? - Dang. It's like he read your mind. - That's a bold strategy, man. - Yes, let's go. - Now you could do
double or nothing again. - I'm staying there.
- And if you win, it'll be 2000. - I'm staying there.
- Do it. - Do it.
- Do it. - Do it, do it, do it. Come on. - This would genuinely
