ladies and gentlemen it really feels like on a weekly basis at this point we have a teenager chess Prodigy ready to take on the best player in the world Magnus Carlson he's not the world champion anymore because he stepped away from the title he still holds the Championships in Rapid and Blitz chess but he's still the number one player in the world and it's pretty much um not a debate now I have taken a step back from making so much Magnus content here in 2024 but I had to make a video today because he was defeated by 17-year-old Bellar Russian Grandmaster Dennis lavic and Dennis lavic is currently on Prodigy watch in the chessworld uh including being unfairly uh accused of cheating by many top Grand Masters he is 100% legitimate and it's an incredible story uh to see his rise uh over the last several years and here's a match that he played against Magnus Carlson he he he beat him and they play played a four- game match and it was uh it it was really really fun stuff uh to witness and it's awesome to see Magnus actually have to you know fight against the younger generation because in his generation Magnus is like really really highly respected and feared so it's just really cool to see so first game Magnus plays C4 Knight to F6 Knight C3 and we have an English uh with uh with a with a reverse not even in English this is an English but this is a reverse Sicilian it's basically for C5 but with colors reversed and now Magnus plays D3 and the thing about rapid chess is um you uh you can take your opponents out of a comfort zone you can play G3 Bishop G2 you can play Knight F3 but it's really nice to get an opponent out of a main line D3 is a very rare move I mean to set up like this in the first three moves already very deep down in the database and Magnus spent 40 seconds on this move so I don't know if he like spilled coffee on his keyboard and then he had to clean things up uh or if this is just part of his preparation he was trying to improvise at the board now loic plays very principled he uh takes the center he puts two Pawns in the center if it's possible and he's going to put a knight there right so we have take take and now Magnus cannot develop his Bishop this way so he's going to develop it this way which is why he plays G3 Knight C6 Bishop G2 lavic uh safeguards the knight in the center with Bishop 2 E6 both players castle and this is our position after eight moves very standard stuff very equal game white is going to try to utilize his queenside majority uh minority of Pawns to attack and maybe bring the rook and utilize this bishop when the position opens up a little bit black might consider an attack on the king side or a direct confrontation in the center of the board so that white doesn't just easily get his game plan Bishop D2 for Magnus he's ready to bring his Rook Queen D7 and now that move takes its eye off of the G5 Square so the queen goes for the light squares instead of the dark squares and that is why we see this move Knight to G5 and the thing for for a guy like Magnus who is very experienced in a multitude of positions it's really about getting some of these younger guys out of a comfort zone Zone even at the cost of sacrificing engine evaluation lvic takes the n on G5 within 7 seconds and basically says you know what I don't need the bishop I'm just going to build up on my dark squares like this I'm going to push your Bishop right back to where it was and the question is who's happier with this trade we say don't trade Knight for Bishop so you would think that you know it's black who's worse but not really black has a very active position he brings his Rook to the center that's the first time lvic spent any time really he spent about 40 seconds on this move uh and yeah it's a real question of like does he put his Rook there and there or does he start attacking he really doesn't want to destabilize his own position he went down to 1 second because I made a move there uh he really doesn't want to do that but he plays rook d8 and the question becomes what's going to happen if this Rook right so Magnus plays Rook C1 and queen A4 right we see Rook C1 Queen A4 I told you Magnus is going to try to play on the queen side that's the entire idea Dennis takes on C3 and Bishop D5 he's trying to play in the center of the board trying to trade magnus's Bishop very principal approach and so Magnus here plays a really ugly move but it's a move that makes a lot of sense the move is F3 you see if you don't play F3 if you play E4 you weaken this Pawn so I just go back and I say well we didn't trade but who's going to guard this nobody by the way literally nobody so if you ignore me like or you know you allow this well well then white has no Advantage white has no Advantage because cuz you're not going to get any of that pressure and Rook B1 let's say black plays like B6 I mean Rook B1 is is there's nothing there's no Advantage here for white whatsoever so Magnus is forced to play this really ugly looking move but the idea is actually pretty simple he just wants to push this back and that's what he does he gets to a queenless middle game and now he gets the bishop out onto a diagonal that's all he needed to do he just needed to preserve the smallest of advantages and that's how he's going to apply pressure now it's going to be a queenside battle now Magnus begins opening up the position with his pawns and his Bishop lazovic is fighting back now D4 Bishop Bishop D7 and he reroutes right if Dennis is able to trade the Bishops he's going to be very happy so Magnus is trying to preserve this position very slowly and very methodically improving his position now you see out of nowhere white is better like a little bit like the computer has life it's like you use the defibrillator like you know a moment ago it was dead equal but now what well here comes this move C5 you see Dennis took a step backwards to try to reroute into the position C5 this is a masterful usage of the bishop pair when you have the bishop pair in chess you've got to preserve them and then activate them and he's NE he's negating the movement of his opponent's pieces Magnus while also trying to make advantageous Pawn trades and structural decisions uh to get an advantage Bishop F1 look at this bishop look at this the Bishops are back on the first rank yet the advantage has never been bigger how is that even possible A3 Bishop B5 and at some point he's just going to slowly work his way in and there it is he found it he maneuvered and got Dennis to 9 seconds just moments ago Dennis had a full two minutes on the clock but in this deep maneuvering game of like constantly it's like in a boxing fight you know like you're boxing and you're throw you're fainting you're faking that you're going to punch so he's overloading his opponent's nervous system and finally he gets Dennis to commit to something and there he is right he's arriving but Dennis is no slouch I mean he's going to defend himself he's defending for over 40 moves it's a very unpleasant position Bishop D7 but Magnus sacrificing The Rook it's not even the best move the computer wanted to preserve but the position sort of disintegrates and Dennis just unable to defend himself from the pressure like Magnus wins a couple of Pawns and you know stockfish might have held it Magnus gives up both Rooks is ready to pick up this rook and at a very very very nice first game very nice first game like showing their's levels you know beating people in typical Magnus style uh and looking to put away the match early in the second game uh Dennis tried to fight back play D4 right got Knight F3 and we have a uh a a Cambridge Springs variation a semi a Moran from White Knight bd7 this kind of triangle setup very calm game but Magnus doesn't wait doesn't wait very long he plays E5 it's kind of the the principal thing that you're supposed to do with with black is to open up the position and say you know what like Dennis Dennis is one of the most solid positionally grounded players in the world so Dennis plays CD CD and tries to take advantage plays Knight B5 makes Magnus Play Bishop before and then he offers a trade of Bishops Magnus plays A6 pushing the Knight back Dennis finds Pawn takes and Knight D4 Magnus offers a trade of Bishops Dennis says no thank you and this and now Rook E8 and black is going to try to targets white Target White's E Pawn Rook D1 Queen B6 Knight F1 the queen slides over and we see you know M Magnus kind of plays against Dennis in a very he plays his game he plays like in a very controlled manner against Dennis cuz Dennis is a very positional player slow like he he he he he works on a position he he kind of massages the position all right uh but uh and Magnus can play like that but he also knows when to strike and to push the pace so we have a trade we have Knight C6 and Dennis plays just bring bringing the king to F2 looking potentially for the end game but he he's he's he's a little slow in this game he's not able to build up much of an advantage Magnus playing on both sides playing on both flanks trying to trying to find something Dennis captures and offers a queen trade so Magnus is like all right I guess we'll take now visually this looks better for white Forever cuz black has this ugly pawn and uh I would love this position for white king f8 now if you play the move Rook C5 what's funny is that after Rook A8 you actually cannot make any progress it looks like you can but you can't I mean it's only op like visual that you it looks like you have an advantage but there's no Advantage black is Rock Solid there was no way for you to attack this Pawn unless you could teleport the Knight to B7 which is not possible if you got multiple moves in a row and got the Knight to B7 then you would maybe even have a chance but black still plays A4 so you would need it's just not possible all right so Knight E3 Rook C5 you know he walks the king to D2 and Magnus is just defending himself plays G6 plays all the moves that I said and you're just not going to beat look at the time look at the time Magnus asserting dominance I mean you can't beat me we are we are Generations apart but uh I'm here to stay all right and chess uh chess still runs through way and through Oslo and like I said just like the last game you know it was 85 it was it was 99 and within a matter of 10 moves Magnus built up a six-minute time Advantage like that's not good that you know that that clearly shows a level of nerves and again like Dennis is a very good player but he's got 30 seconds versus 7even and a half minutes and at this point Magnus might even play this for a win and he is he's playing it for a win Dennis is desperately holding on I mean this is like like a roller coaster right it's 20 seconds versus 540 against the goat from a position where probably only white was playing for anything at this point Magnus completely changes his mindset he's like wait a minute I'm just going to I'm going to overload Dennis's nervous system until he blunders look at G5 I'm creating an outside pass Pawn potentially Rook H4 Rook G8 he's firing Dennis has 8 seconds 6 seconds but he's defending he's defending he grabs the H Pawn Magnus gets in Magnus a pawn down by the way but he's going to go back for that E Pawn Rook A3 check Rook A4 uh but uh unfortunately despite his best efforts despite Dennis trying to make it as dramatic as possible Magnus unable to grab a victory Rook C6 a nice idea Bishop G4 we simplify and uh it's just going it's just going to end in a draw King E5 Rook G5 and the players Shuffle and make a draw again rough start for Dennis like not a good start nervous start as I said uh equal like through the opening and clearly getting a slightly you know more pleasant position but by the time we get to the 29th move he's got a minute I mean he spent so much time he spent two minutes putting his Rook on C5 that's like how I play chess against the good players okay so we go to game three and Magnus is just going to put Dennis away C4 we go for the same opening as last time uh but this time we uh you know we do things a little bit differently and um whoops let me just I'm adjusting the uh the sound of the pieces if they're a little bit too loud G uh D5 CD Knight D5 Bishop G2 all of this H6 and now takes takes the queen is in the line of the bishop so the queen is going to back up and this is our position from the opening you'll notice that Magnus started the game with 10 minutes and has 10:07 he he's he's just going he's walking Dennis down that's what you do like you're beating up a fighter you're punching him in the stomach you're punching him in the head you're kicking his legs if it's legal if it's boxing please don't kick anybody and that's it he's going to put away the young he's just not ready yet Bishop B6 Bishop E3 offering a damaging to his his own structure to open up an attack and pressure on the C file this is like the exact type of game Magnus likes this why the English opening is actually a fascinating opening to try to play for a win Dennis though finds a clever idea to break up his structure but open his own file right Bishop D5 we have a very similar game to the last time where Dennis is trying to trade the Bishops but unlike the first game you will remember that in you might not remember at all in the first game it was a different structure right in this game the pawn went there and black has no F no Pawn on F6 right take take and Dennis is just kind of sitting back and defending himself he's doing a better job on time in fact in this game Dennis starts fighting back plays B5 he's like you know what Magnus you gave me a damage structure you think you're so strong positional genius B4 he's using his own Pawn against them and he's up on time this is a right of passage of every young chess player can you imagine beating the goat of a sport surely he hasn't had a chance to do it yet ab4 Knight D5 played instantly to attack The Rook Magnus gives up the bishop oh my goodness Magnus was in a mood today sacrificing for the bishop trying to win the pawn trying to win that pawn and he's I mean he's not showing any signs of intimidation obviously he's the goat but I mean he's just he's fighting the Next Generation like this he sacks like this take and you'll remember a moment ago Magnus took a pawn so now he gets a bishop and a pawn he gets a bishop and two pawns for a rook and he's got an outside passer now the thing about this position is that if black uh I'm I'm obviously I'm not saying this move is going to happen but let's just say you know very hypothetically something like this happens the end game with no queens is probably advantageous for white like an end game like this where white can potentially get these pawns rolling and even more more so like this is winning for white right like if you can get two pass pawns against the rook and a knight it you know it's it's bad so white needs a few transformations to happen C5 is a nice idea to stop White from Ever Getting the pawn to B4 Magnus plays Knight D2 and Knight C4 gives up the pawn on D3 but you will notice that Mr lazovic for the first time in this entire match has a Time Advantage it took him a minute and 20 seconds to build up the courage to take the pawn on D3 but he's standing up to the bully Queen takes D3 all right Bishop F1 played by Magnus and now Queen back to D5 and Magnus plays Queen A1 and the queen is like a like a lighthouse you know just standing on the edge of the board shining the the beams all over the place B3 was apparently incorrect apparently Queen A4 was better but Queen A4 allows Queen F3 and I'm I'm not sure that looks particularly exciting to play so obviously he didn't like something there instead he plays B3 Dennis still plays Queen F3 Knight C1 and it's a tactical Skirmish Knight takes E5 but Queen E4 magnus's Queen is hanging and his Knight in the center but uhoh Dennis is down on time but no he's not Queen E5 But Here Comes the a pawn Magnus is a full Rook down but Dennis has 30 seconds again it took him a whole minute to play Queen to D5 magnas plays A7 Bishop G2 is coming he's going to make a queen who's going to stop him who's going to stop him Rook A8 Queen B5 you can't take the Rook because of Queen B8 check and I'm threatening Bishop G2 but Bishop G2 there's Queen D1 check so the queen goes back Queen oh my God he blundered oh my God Dennis blundered Dennis should have played Queen B3 it was just winning Queen takes B3 was winning if Queen C5 defending the pawn you can play Queen A2 you can play Queen B2 you can play Queen B1 and the idea is that there is no way to get closer to the Rook for example if I play like Queen D6 you can just take the pawn but the idea of Queen B1 want is you know you're going to get the pawn in a moment you just have to guard your knight you just got to get the Knight outs for example if I play King G2 you can give me a check you can take the pawn you play Queen B7 Knight B3 so Dennis is completely winning but he blunders he blunders and now he has 17 seconds on the clock Knight B3 Magnus is trying he's trying to escape with this Knight Bishop C4 but now Knight D2 now Magnus plays Bishop D5 but first he grabs the pawn which is wrong he had to play Bishop D5 right away by taking the pawn with check now if he plays Bishop to D5 there was Rook takes A7 and after takes there is takes and black is winning what he had to do in that position oh my goodness Dennis was so close if Rook A7 now now you take you say What's the difference what's the difference now this you can't go here but because Magnus took first and then wanted to go to he couldn't do that the bishop had to end up on that square not on that square that's the difference it was the positioning of the bishop now now all of a sudden in a crazy scramble Dennis is winning again E4 and and now with an extra rookie picks up the pawn in the 40th move his King is mercilessly hunted a moment away from getting mated but he consolidates and it's nice to be up a rook and chess because you win and that was Dennis's first win a Tense one a nervy one but he takes down Magnus Carlson and now he cannot just save the match and tie it up he can win he could win this is the chessable masters Grand Final and um oh my goodness that was crazy Magnus in a in a crazy complicated position kind of went for Queen A2 and then Knight E5 but he's losing and the reason you might be wondering why he couldn't defend himself is because of Rook to D1 there's a threat on the queen and a threat of mate so for example Queen B2 Rook F1 and this completely ridiculous checkm in the corner where the king can't escape it crazy it was a very tactical game Magnus loses to Dennis laic what the hell is going on oh my God so now we have one last game Dennis could actually knock out Magnus what he's 17 years old he turned 17 3 months ago can you imagine beating the goat in a position like that that was a nervous game but he got it done Magnus plays the bishop G4 slow SLO H3 take take E6 he trades the light squared Bishop puts the pawns on light squares Knight C3 puts the bishop active both guys castle and listen Dennis is a queen Pawn player I mean you look at Dennis as position he is so tough to beat this is a nut that does not crack he is so annoying with his repertoire he is so solid beating him requires risk to you got to open yourself up to a counter punch so Magnus gives up the center and then he brings the bishop back and he wants again plays this E5 idea but it's not without risk you see it's not without risk because you're giving up the entirety of the center now Dennis has an advantage but IM Magnus has to go through the fire so Bishop here Dennis here spends 40 seconds he senses that this bishop is going to grow powerful the best way to claim an advantage here for white is to take this Pawn let the bishop live and then you play Queen F3 and then you bring your Rooks for example let's say black plays like Rook B8 you play B3 solid let's say black plays I don't know H6 and you can play Knight E2 and try to maneuver with the bishop here that's what you got to do you got to punish Magnus for giving you the center risking a damaging of his structure but this is what magn Magnus very calculated Dennis plays Bishop E3 see Dennis is a solid player this is not stock push's STP Choice stockish prefers to keep more pieces on the board Queen F3 with the idea of Knight E2 Knight G3 maybe here maybe G4 G5 in the future Dennis just trades his Bishop so take take Magnus is like all right you know what queen trade now here ironically trading queens and playing this end game is better for white than what Dennis does Dennis has no Queen trade so he's like solid but almost slightly flawed like in a in a slightly flawed way like now he preserves the queens and he gets this CD Knight D5 Knight D5 then it SES with the bishop so he wants to give up the bishop for the Knight and the idea I suppose is to take with I mean the pawn is fine but maybe even The Rook symmetrical structure microscopic Advantage play the position forever black can't win Queen E7 Magnus says no I I want to win I want to preserve imbalance so Magnus does not trade Knight for Bishop he offers a trade of Rooks otherwise Dennis would have control of the file and now we have queen queen Rook Rook Knight versus Bishop G3 G6 King G7 the king and the pawn step up to get out of the way of the bishop so you control your dark squares King G2 both guys do it Queen F3 now Rook D3 this is the end game okay fascinating symmetrical structure queen versus Bishop who's better well they say queen and Knight are the ultimate combo because they can move like every piece in chess Queen gets Rook bishop and King and pawn obviously and Knight is a knight so the Knight would love to go there if the Knight gets on D4 and has a plant in the white position it's going to be very annoying Queen C5 let's look at Dennis's time A5 King up to F3 Queen back to C8 right Dennis goes back Magnus looking plays H5 I mean you got to do something against Dennis right Dennis plays Bishop B3 spends a minute he spends a minute moving the bishop back to the home Square so it's like a it's it's a coming of age you know it's like you you gota you got to be brave against look at Magnus playing every Pawn forward he senses the nervousness Bishop D5 Queen D7 King G2 now Dennis says you know what Magnus B4 B4 in and of itself makes sense the idea of B4 is you freeze your opponent's Pawn on the same color Square as your Bishop so logically in a position like this white wins every endgame because white is going to win his opponent's pawns so B4 actually makes sense but it's a mistake shockingly despite this move looking to make sense in every type of end game cuz the pawn for black gets fixed it's a mistake can you believe it how is Magnus going to exploit that though can he show that there's levels Magnus plays A4 why he wants to keep more pawns on the board that's it A4 it's just like I want to keep stuff on the board I want more targets to to attack in the future Dennis now plays F4 so the last two moves B4 F4 a little bit too nervous a little bit like jumpy so Dennis has weakened his King and potentially given Magnus a Target Queen C7 Dennis plays Queen D2 spends a minute a minute on this move he's got to be able to get it together play just a little bit faster King goes to 2 E7 Magnus misses a chance apparently Queen D6 was really strong I don't know what the idea is like let's say King F3 I I I I can't actually I don't actually understand maybe it's like a tactic yeah I guess it's just a tactic in the center but Magnus goes King E7 and Denis plays E5 he's right back in the game oh my goodness he's in a queen and Magnus missed the chance apparently he had to play Queen D6 in this position Queen D6 to prevent these pieces from coming forward but he doesn't and now this and now Dennis is back in the game against Magnus back in the game Magnus plays Queen D7 the craziest thing about Queen D7 is it's a draw I think you can take and make a draw King F3 let's say King E6 trying to go King D5 you just play this and shockingly King E3 is a draw if G5 trying to pry you apart you just go King E4 if G4 you take and the pawn is in the Square so you can't actually promote so Magnus plays Queen D7 but it's a little bit of a bluff but trading the Queens is really stressful there because you don't want to be the clown who trades the queens in a drawn end game so he says no Queen trade queen queen D3 now Magnus is winning Magnus here has to find the unbelievable winning idea G5 check sacrificing a pawn in a queen end game the idea is nuts if this you go here if there you get mated if this you play Queen H3 King G5 Queen here anywhere the king moves you take and you take the other idea of G5 is unbelievable if FG if FG you trade queens and the king is too far and that is why moments ago the move A4 was so smart because you never know when that pawn is going to collapse so that would have been the winning idea for Magnus it would have been to play Pawn to G5 check and get a queen trade because you promote and if you don't do that then take take B4 AP and this that's the winning idea and you maybe you don't have to play B4 right away you could take take first and then B4 on the next move but that's the point but Magnus misses it he misses it now Dennis gives up the pawn forces the king back Magnus is a pawn up but it's a draw it's apparently a Perpetual because Dennis's King is getting in Queen B5 check King E7 and it's a draw it's a draw Dennis is only down one Pawn but it's a draw because his B Pawn is so strong but the human urge to give checks right Queen E5 check but now magnus's Queen gets back which is going to make the job infinitely harder B5 apparently was a potential drawing mechanism both guys at 10 seconds Queen E6 Queen B8 King E7 Queen C7 and now Dennis goes here and it's a blunder it's a blunder because if you trade the Queens you you actually lose but guess what F6 is the winning move because after take take take H Pawn Queens but Magnus misses it oh my goodness he misses F6 F5 Magnus plays King E7 and now Dennis has to play B5 it's the only move how is that possible B5 none of magnus's Pawns can move so King D7 goes to stop it and now you play King F6 because when this Pawn goes down King F7 Pawn to H3 E6 and you also Queen and it's a draw but Dennis couldn't help himself he went backwards he went backwards Magnus approached so he went back it's like in fighting it's like in fighting a guy fakes to throw a punch you're like oh I got a block but you don't he needed to go forward he needed to walk Magnus down with his bwn it was a split second decision Magnus couldn't run forward here he would have had to go respect the bwn and you needed to go in you needed to get your pawns moving together but Dennis went back and now it is over it's over because he's never going to get to the be he's he's he's never going to join his pawns you could push the B Pawn now it doesn't matter H4 you can push your B Pawn now it doesn't matter because I'm gonna go here and you're too slow you're not on F6 right we're not we're not there we went back so Dennis takes a step back out of respect and unfortunately he is just losing King E5 and he just resigns he resigns because if he stops this Pawn I'm stopping those pawns and I have three that's the problem you can't stop three nothing you can do I can't I can't you know come forward I got to be really careful but but three Pawns is too much three pawns is too much you can't you can't stop three pawns it just doesn't work and I'll play King D4 I'll play King E3 and and that's the end of the game oh my good he came so close he beat Magnus straight up in a game for the first time and he was so close and it it's nice to see you know it's nice to see uh lazovic getting a chance to play Magnus in a best of four he did draw him and lose to him in Toronto in the Champions Chester final 2023 but another young man to keep your eyee on Dennis lazovic Superstar really really strong hopefully he gets more opportunities this year in uh 2024 and the next generation is coming it's coming for the goat well we could debate maybe it's Kasparov blah blah blah Magnus himself said it because it's it's kaspar but we could debate that but fun to see 17 years old beating Magnus Carlson hopefully big things for him in the future unfortunately Dennis actually was knocked out uh earlier today in the losers bracket of the of the chess bow Masters so he finishes in the semi-finals there uh and the ultimate final will be decided by Magnus and fua but uh cool stuff that's all I have for you today get out of here
