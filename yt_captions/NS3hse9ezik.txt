- Last to leave this pool
full of ramen wins $20,000. (Chandler laughs) Now this episode is a little different, because it's all Chandler's family. Those are his sisters,
this is his brother. It is Chandler's family in
a pool of ramen for $20,000. This is their father, as you
remember from previous videos. - I'm here to referee. - Who do you think will win? - He'll be first out. No, he's on a winning streak, though. - He is, three wins in a row. These three. I just want your prediction
so if you're wrong, we can be like oh, he
doesn't know his children. - Chandler's gonna win. - When did the script flip? - Chandler's going four
in a row, right here. - Okay.
- I gotta pee. - [Jake] Chandler's
about to get out already. - In the sand video, you
literally got out in an hour. - I can pee in this, though,
'cause peeing is easy. - You can't pee in front of friends. How are you gonna pee in front of family? - That's what I said.
- That's easier. - How are you gonna-
- Is it easier? - Dumped in the bathroom,
and it went everywhere. - He did, it was all over the
floor, all over the walls. - We're two minutes in, and
we're already getting secrets. - I went in there, I
had to poop really bad, and I pulled my pants
down before I sat down. - And it just shot out?
- Shot out. My mom came in there, yelled at me, told me to get out. - So you've pooped your pants
five times in your life? - Yeah, I'm gonna make it seven today. (upbeat hip hop music) - You remember those Barbie Jeeps? - I do.
(all laughing) - [Jimmy] What happened
with the Barbie Jeep? - I wouldn't get out of the Barbie Jeep, so Zach just whipped it out
and peed on me, so I'd get out. (all laughing) - What?
- What? - I remember that time. - I'm gonna just keep
replacing ramen noodles, don't mind me. How do you feel? - I feel like I'm about to win, and beat Chandler. - You lost to him in the revolving door. - I did. - Did you go easy on him? - You look like a cyclops.
- You look like a bird. - I did.
- You did? - A little easy.
- You're done. You're done for.
- I'm done? - You're done for.
- All right. - All right, so Zach is talking smack, saying he just was taking it easy on me, so I guess I'm gonna have
to win and give him nothing. - What?
- Wait. I'm already getting it all.
- Nope. - How long are you gonna go? - I'm gonna be the last
person in this ramen pool. - Two days from now, you're still here? - I'm gonna be the last to leave. - All right, when you get out, we're gonna cut to that. - Okay, I just made
this ramen noodle ball. - Throw it at Chandler.
- Would you like to taste it? - No.
- No. - Well, apparently it's
already been 20 minutes, but it's only felt like five minutes, so basically I got this in the bag, and I already beat Chandler
when I punted the baby doll, so we're just gonna go round two. - [Jimmy] You did! - Yeah.
- That was funny. Play that again. All right, let's see it. (baby crying) Wow.
- 55 feet! - Don't let your sister
show you up now, Chandler. - No!
- Oh, 48 feet! - Wow, you can kick baby dolls. - [Jimmy] How does this make you feel? Your children are in a pit of ramen. - Been around our family at all, you can pretty much figure
out we were gonna end up at this point somehow. - [Jimmy] Okay. (upbeat hip hop music) - Y'all hungry yet? Only way you can eat is if you get out. - You can eat. I don't know what rules he's going off of. Do you want anything? Chandler, you're always hungry. What do you want?
- Some cookout. - [Jimmy] So guys, how
does this feel right now, like how does the water feel? - I feel moisturized.
- I don't care about- - Moisturized?
- Yes. - Can you come here? - Could we have something to build with? - There's stuff on my face. - [Jimmy] There's stuff on your face? - Yeah. - We could make a little tower. - Did you get it? - You good?
- Thanks, man. - Chandler, which would you
rather have, Chris or them? - Chris.
- Why? - Because he's not annoying. - One of you who just wants to save time. Whoever's first out should just
get out now, and save time. - That's true, Cassidy. (all laughing) - You literally told on everybody. - Yeah, because y'all were so mean to me. - We didn't rock with you. - Yeah, we didn't wanna- - Yeah, 'cause y'all were mean. - We couldn't get away with anything. - Yeah! - Whatever, y'all got away with a lot. - But did he spank you?
- No, he sure didn't. - But my mama did. - Sure did. - So look, whenever she said
we're getting a spanking, me and Chandler went upstairs and put on 10 pairs of
underwear before we did. - We got caught a few times. Had to go bare booty. - One of y'all put a book. - I put an encyclopedia. - Zach put an encyclopedia. - Wait, you put an
encyclopedia to hide your butt. - Horrible. - It was more just to be funny. - [Jimmy] So who's the
oldest person in the tub? How old are you? - 24.
- 24. - I'm 22.
- 22. - And then-
- Chandler, 20. - 20.
- Chandler, 20. And then Hannah.
- 18. - [Jimmy] 18, oh wow, okay. - Look, hold up. Me and Zach are riding
down the road one day, and he's got on gray sweatpants and they got lint all in
the pockets and stuff. Probably reaches in his pocket, and he pulls out two pieces of salami, and says, "Dad, you want one?" (all laughing) It's like it's got hair,
and lint all over it, dude, no I don't want none. He just goes to eating it. (upbeat hip hop music) - I'm gonna FaceTime Chris. Hey, how's it going? - [Chris] Doing pretty
good, how are you doing? - Great, this is our first time filming without you in forever. - I know, it's weird. Zach, my hopes aren't high
for you, I'm not gonna lie. You look like you're always
about to die for some reason. (all laughing) - Hey, Chris.
- All right, the winner. - Yes!
- No. - Yes, look.
- Chris is calling it. - [Chris] Strong contestant. Probably gonna get second, not gonna lie. - Chris, I'll FaceTime you in a few hours. - All right, see ya.
- Bye. You can't escape us, ever. (upbeat hip hop music) So as you guys know, you guys
are sitting in a hot tub, and we're gonna turn it on. - Okay.
- Let's do this. - That means pee will get everywhere. - So do you guys want it on? - Yeah? - The controls are right here. - Dude, I wanna be the one-
- Oh! What the? Help! - Get off of me! - I didn't do anything. I really didn't do it, Zach did it. - This was your fault. - He's just trying to make us get out. - You!
- Trying to get somebody out. (ramen splashes) - Hey, whoa. - Y'all ain't my children. - Let's just all get
really close to Chandler. - You should, that's how
he's gonna get you out. - That would work, especially
when I start choking you. (Chandler laughs) - [Jimmy] I bet he freaks out. - Yeah, get all this piss water on me. - Oh, she has pee all over her face. - Dang, see y'all need
to stop messing with me. Get off of me. You got noodles in your hair. You look silly. - I'm just chillin'. I'm gonna be here for like, 24 hours. (Hannah laughing) - Close.
- What the? Oh, Jimmy! (Hannah screams) - Oh, no that was not me. I did not-
- Jimmy! - Do you not like this picture? You're trying to hide it? - Whoa!
- Oh, wait, wait. Is this an important frame? - [Hannah] Too late now. - No, no, no, it only got the tip. I thought you gave us
copies of everything. - No.
- These are all my mom's. - Oh my god. Sorry, I have to get back at him. Good thing I got a manicure. (upbeat hip hop music) - Literally.
- Hannah, watch out. - Disgracefully. - What do you want me to do?
- Did she get a quesadilla? - These antibacterial wipes. - Oh shoot, I didn't know y'all had that. - Yeah, Mom's here. Stop it!
- Give me one. - That's a double.
- Why are you serious? - This is low key hard to eat in here, knowing how gross this is. (upbeat hip hop music) - [Cassidy] Zach! - Chandler, I hear you wanna get out. - Yeah, this is gross. - I understand it's gross. - Touch me. - I don't want to. Touch him. I mean, only one of you can win, so it doesn't matter, go ahead. - I'm getting out. Don't look at my underwear. - You're on a three win streak. Are you sure? - Hey, that's a- - Hold up, hold up, before you get out. $20,000, what could you buy with that? - I mean, I was just
gonna give it to my dad. - Well.
- So now you're getting out. - No, but they're hey,
they need some money too, so I was like, you know what? - Well, I just-
- Here you go. - All right, thanks. I'm gonna bust my tail
getting out of here. - Just don't pull a Chris on 'em. (whistle toots) (Chris groans) - That really hurt. - This one, is that Chandler? We gotta take this one off the wall. - There we go.
- All right. (all laughing) - [Chandler] Oh my god. - There we go. So you were the first one out. You have had 15 challenges to train. - Yeah.
- Didn't do anything. - The challenges are all different, so you can't really train for 'em. - But this one is just like the slime one. - Oh, I guess you're right. - So, at least you're staying on brand. So, what happened? - I just had to, excuse me. I just had to give my
family a chance, you know? They need some money too, so I had to, you know, get out
so they could have a chance. - So you didn't need money? - Not at the moment. - Oh god, okay. - But when that ostrich comes in, it's gonna be a lot of
food to feed that man. - [Jimmy] How do you feel
now that Chandler got out? - 1% closer to winning. - Already knew it was gonna happen, so it was just a matter of time. - [Jimmy] So Zach, how do
you feel now that Chandler- (blocks rattling) - I feel numb. Like, my fingers are numb and stuff, and I'm tired. - If you're going to get out, you might as well get out now. What's the point in getting out in an hour if you're just gonna get out now? - True.
- That's a great point. - I got school. I did miss class for this. - School is expensive. Winning would help pay for it. - It would. I think my goal is to win every
challenge on CJ's channel. - You getting out on this shot? Oh gosh, really? - I'm getting out.
- No, don't fall. - Should I get out?
- You're already out. - Let me call CJ, let me call CJ. - Hey serious, Siri! She won't listen to me. - He's not answering, I'm gonna get out. I'm really numb, guys. - Okay, then get out. (all laughing) - [Dad] He didn't answer. - I just wanted to beat Chandler. That was really my goal. - That's not really an accomplishment. (Jimmy knocking) Chandler.
- Yeah? - Zach just got out.
- Why? - [Jimmy] I don't know! Two sons are out. - Told you Chandler would be going first. - Yeah.
- Chandler's gonna win. Look, I predicted both
y'all to be the last two in. - You almost said I
was gonna go out first. - No, but I changed, 'cause I knew you'd
actually give me a cut. The rest of 'em wouldn't. - That's true, I'm the only nice one. - No. - Zach, we're at the end. I'm sorry for making you do this. I realize it's disgusting,
and I apologize. - It's okay. Like I said, I'm glad I beat Chandler. - But that doesn't win
you any extra money. - But- - Life's not all about money? - No, it's about the comments. And I want y'all to say that
I'm better than Chandler. I just beat him. - So you and Chandler are even. - We're even now, so I just
had to level the playing field. - Comment if you want a rematch. We can have 'em sword fight. Oh, she's taking his picture down. This is Zach's picture.
- Gotta come down. - Oh my goodness. So, Zach and Chandler are gone. It is disgusting. Five hours in. How long are you guys gonna last? - 'Til I win. - Yeah, until I'm the
last one sitting here. - Make your prediction. - I don't know who's gonna win. I'll just go with Hannah. (blocks clatter) - Sorry, my hand slipped. My hand slipped. (upbeat hip hop music) - [Jimmy] So is it getting colder? - No. - It's starting to like,
putting stuff in here is stirring up the smell of pee. (Hannah gags) - Hey, Chandler. You look so clean. - As soon as I got in the shower, noodles just fell out my crack. I went. - Yeah that must've been
tough with some boxers on. - You are your father's son. Look at that little smile.
- I look so cute. - Look at that little cute girl. (all laughing) - [Jimmy] That was your picture. Oh my god. Oh, it's literally stuck. Ramen eyes right there. Do pickles go bad? - [Hannah] Don't try to put that in here. - [Dad] Just one, for y'all to play with. - Oh, now it smells like pickle juice. - [Dad] They're gonna have to
get out and get the rebound. - Really?
- What? - Just splashed that on me.
- It's just pickle juice. - Back up. That's what you did. Except the pickle hit me. (ominous music) Really? This so sick. - There's some more. I was told it wouldn't float, but it's actually floating. Just so you know, you can't
leave until someone wins, so I think it's time you start sabotaging. There you go, you throw the football. (ramen splashes) (crowd groans) - Do you see how wet my face is? Why are you throwing it at me? God! (things clatter) - [Jimmy] Zach, go say sorry. Zach, say sorry. (Zach yelping) - [Jimmy] Hannah! This is getting out of hand.
- Guys. - Hannah!
- Hannah! (all shouting) - [Zach] I just took a shower! - [Jake] The cameras! Not the cameras! - I think Hannah's gonna get out soon, so I'm just preparing. - I think you're gonna get out soon. - I'm moving this stuff to prepare a way. You can take that. (ramen splashes) (Cassidy yelps)
- Ow! - [Man] Headshot. - Chandler, that literally just hit me on. - Tell them what you would buy if you won the $20,000. - Well, I would probably put it towards my loans, for school. - That's boring.
- Thank you. - What would you buy with
20 grand that's not boring? - Pay off my car. - That's still boring.
- That's still boring. - I'm doing good in here. Been here for about two
days, and three months. I would buy a little pet monkey. - Oh!
- Okay, okay. - Yeah, like a little-
- That'd be cool. - You can put it right here. - So, Chandler's getting an ostrich and you're getting a pet monkey. (upbeat hip hop music) - I need to go home. How are we gonna get them out? - [Jimmy] Okay, so what's your plan? Think, why are your sisters so resilient? - Let's put a toaster in it. - [Jimmy] You cannot kill them. - We can do like a scare? - They're scheming over there.
- I hear 'em. - What if we turn off the lights? - Oh yeah, and scare them. - All right, hit the lights now. (Chandler snaps) (ominous music)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? (people yelping) - [Hannah] Oh my god, I gotta get out. - Get out.
- Are you actually going to? - Yeah, I'm getting out. No one. - [Cassidy] You're getting your towel wet, you're getting-
- Oh shoot. - [Cassidy] Get up. (ramen splashing) - [Jimmy] No! - Chandler, help your sister.
- Hey buddy, sit down. - I'm helping from over here. I'm praying for you. (all laughing) - [Cassidy] She's gonna,
I pray she gets out soon. I jinxed it. (all shouting) - [Chandler] Whoa! - All right.
(all applauding) - [Chandler] Look at the winner! - There we go. Cassidy is the most resilient
from the Hallow family. How do you feel? - Feel like I knew I'd win. - $20,000. Now that you actually have the money, what are you gonna spend it on? - Well, I'll probably spend
it on all of our family to be able to go somewhere. - Aww.
- Aww. - Aww, yeah. Oh yeah, we are gonna
get matching tattoos. - You should all get ramen
tattoos, like really small. - Oh, we thought about it. Then we thought of something better. - Okay. Now that it's over, how do you guys feel? - Clean. - Do you guys feel closer as a family? - No.
- We will be. - Are you happy you participated? - Of course. - But you didn't win. - Of course, lovely.
- It was fun. - I got hit in the head. - Phenomenal. - It reminds me of old times.
