- So time and space are emergent. We kind of mentioned in the beginning, but can you elaborate, what do you feel, hope is
fundamental in our universe? - A wave function living in Hilbert space. - A wave function in Hilbert space that we can't intellectualize
or visualize, really. - We can't visualized it. We can intellectualize it very easily. - Like, well, how do you think about-- - [Interviewee] It's a
vector in the 10 to the 10 to the 122 dimensional vector space. It's a complex vector, unit norm, it evolves according to
the Schrodinger equation. - Got it. When you put it that way-- - [Interviewee] What's so hard, really? (both laughing) - [Interviewer] Yep.
