welcome to the most thorough speed test of the oneplus 7 pro and we're going to be comparing it against not just samsung's offering but also the one from huawei and to start with a boot test but before that by popular demand we're going to be turning on performance mode on the p30 pro phonetic mode on the oneplus 7 pro and for the s10 optimized mode because high performance on that phone actually just dials up the screen resolution which we don't want i'm gonna close all applications on each phone just before i power them down and now that we've done that it's ready to see which one wins now bear in mind this boot test is not really a very good indicator of general phone performance but a lot of people want to see it so i've added in at the beginning here the huawei boots up first the oneplus 7 pro about a second after that and the s10 plus about a second and a half after that now we're on to unlock times and starting off the oneplus 7 pro with its optical in-display fingerprint scanner that's a pretty massive improvement over the one we saw on the 6t and for each phone we're going to unlock 10 times and then get the average score over two separate runs just to make sure that we're eliminating as much human error as possible and we can fast forward the second run you don't need to see the same thing twice but the story here is that both runs were very similar we got basically just over 15 seconds for 10 unlocks so about 1.5 seconds per unlock okay galaxy s10 plus which uses the theoretically more capable ultrasonic technology although i feel like they've weighed their own phone down with this ripple animation because there's no way to disable it the upside of this tech is that you pretty much need to just graze your finger against the phone you barely even need to apply any pressure unfortunately for the samsung though whilst this technology may well be more secure than the oneplus is in terms of raw speed that phone can unlock on average faster than this one and then you've got huawei's which is also an optical scanner but ends up having the advantage of no animation whatsoever no screen on animation pretty much no unlocking animation and it just gets straight to the point and this ends up being slightly faster than both of them on average alright so now we're in the phones we're going to start with a real world kind of test we've pulled up kinemaster which is a video editing application and i've transferred the same file to each of the phones we're going to use that file to make a 45-minute clip on each of the phones and then export it in the same quality see how long it takes and yeah this isn't exactly the most exciting test to watch so i'm just gonna fast-forward the whole thing and let's look at the results all right oneplus 7 pro finished first but if you look at the lead between that and the p30 pro it is less than two seconds but the lead of the huawei over the s10 plus is pretty massive time for a bit of benchmarking we're gonna run three back-to-back and two-two benchmarks and then two back-to-back geekbench scores and take averages of each and because we're doing them back-to-back it's also going to help to factor in any performance throttling that might happen when the phones heat up bear in mind that the samsung i'm using is the exynos version that's the one you get in the uk or pretty much every other region that's not the us and it doesn't perform quite as well if you did get the snapdragon version you'd be expecting around 360k but that still wouldn't change the order of these three phones oneplus 7 pro at the top then samsung then p30 pro okay geekbench and visually this isn't as interesting as antutu so again we're just gonna skip to our first reading and it's quite an interesting one you can see that the p30 pro comes last place in both the first reading which is the single core score and the second one the multi-core score but then if we look at the results comparing the oneplus 7 pro and the s10 plus samsung consistently wins when it comes to single core score but then consistently loses when it comes to multi-core so that predicts that performance will vary based on the application and how it takes advantage of the cores okay for a bit of gaming and i filmed this section at 60fps so you can see any frame drops we might get starting off with the 7 pro you can see that the frame rate is fairly consistent but at the same time it's definitely not maxed out this isn't a smooth 60 frame per second the galaxy s10 plus has a pretty similar average frame rate although i did notice a couple of slightly more significant drops every now and again when you turn and face a new direction the frame rate occasionally plummets and it's enough to slightly pull you out the experience i didn't really notice any massive significant drops on the p30 pro but you can probably tell the average frame rate is lower here it's running at between 20 and 40 frames per second with pretty much no deviations on either side what about emulation which can be an even more demanding task than trying to play even native android games so this right here is ratchet and clank made for the playstation portable and the game itself is capped at 30 frames per second so it's good to see the oneplus 7 pro continues to play at that frame rate it's pretty much an identical experience on the galaxy s10 plus there were next to no drops there was only one time when i was jumping but i did notice the frame rate dipped but apart from that no errors the huawei 2 with its kirin 980 chip didn't really have any problems at all emulation is generally a slightly more cpu intensive task than it is a gpu intensive and it's more in the gpu tasks that you notice this chip fall behind so in emulation it's generally okay all right now we're going to use android bench to perform an sql light test which is what is used by phones to store data they retrieve from online so they don't need to continuously redownload stuff the better a phone does in the test the faster it can do this retrieval and we're going to test three times and take an average and this looks like another one of those cases where the galaxy s10 plus at least the exynos version i have here is convincingly in third place you've then got the oneplus 7 pro and the huawei p30 pro on top all right application loading times this is more of a test of a phone's i o capabilities than its actual processing power but oneplus did claim that their new ufs storage would mean faster uploading so there's no better way to test it we've got eight big back-to-back games that we're going to load and the way i've done it is i've selected games which have substantial loading screens and by doing this we're placing the emphasis of the test on how fast the apps are actually loading if i picked a bunch of applications they all load in two seconds then the result is going to be more swayed by any slight differences in the time it takes me to open them as it stands if we fast forward to when the first phone finishes that is the oneplus 7 pro and it is well ahead of the second phone which is the huawei p30 pro that difference is far more than any human error could possibly be and so yeah from this test alone we can fairly safely say that the oneplus does load applications faster than the huawei which in itself does faster than the samsung while we're here while we have these eight applications we've just loaded up on each phone it's a good chance to try multitasking so we're gonna go back through those games in reverse order to see which ones have been kept in memory so far so good but when it comes to the fourth application you'll see that the oneplus has had to reload it on the next one though you'll see that the tables are turned whilst the p30 pro and the galaxy s10 plus have both reloaded the application remained in memory on the oneplus interestingly you'll find that for the next game it had to be reloaded on all three phones so it's an indicator that that particular game was just hogging a lot of resources all three phones had to reload the elder scrolls probably for the same reason but they all managed to keep subway surfers in memory so in total each phone kept five apps in memory an equivalent multitasking experience and right here we've got each model with eight gigs of ram so this is kind of what you'd expect storage speeds are more important on this test than ever before because the oneplus 7 pro is one of the first phones in the world to come with ufs 3.0 a new standard in storage technology so what we're going to do here is use passmark to measure both internal read and internal write scores we've already got our first reading and the huawei p30 pro and oneplus 7 pro are a fair bit ahead of the s10 plus but we're going to do this test three times and take an average score just to make absolutely sure but yeah after doing this three times the result is very much consistent huawei p30 pro on top oneplus 7 pro in second place and then the s10 plus for a more real world comparison one by one i've plugged each phone into the macbook pro using a thunderbolt 3 port and a usb c to usbc cable and we're going to transfer a 2gig file to each phone to see how long it takes so first things first oneplus 7 pro with one minute and eight seconds now that is a fast score but at the same time it's nothing game-changing it's not mind-blowing and the problem is is that when you're transferring files you can only ever transfer as fast as the weakest link in the chain say for example you pull up a usb 3 phone but connect it to a usb 2.0 laptop you're only going to transfer at usb 2.0 speeds and so whilst this oneplus 7 pro does have fast ufs 3.0 storage there are only specific usage cases where you'll actually feel it a perfect example of this point is that the oneplus 7 pro has a usb 3.1 port but the cable that comes with the phone is only usb 2.0 compatible so after running this test after transferring the same file from the laptop to each smartphone you get that the oneplus 7 pro and the s10 plus are kind of fairly close together at the top and that the huawei p30 pro is slower nonetheless we've now done a lot of tests with a lot of different applications and there's plenty of data to suggest that yes the oneplus 7 pro is one of the fastest smartphones out there for sure at the same time though even though it does have this brand new storage standard we've got enough data to say that it's not in a different league altogether it's very much on par with its competitors if not slightly ahead in some areas but that's not a bad thing it is a cheaper phone remember if you enjoyed this video a sub would be massively appreciated and also let me know if there are any particular tests you want to see on the next speed comparison it's still something i'm working on my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one you
