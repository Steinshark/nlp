the insta360 go 3 is the most insane example of how capable miniature Tech has become every time this company releases a new version of this thing I can't quite believe how much more they've crammed into it so here are the top 10 things you need to know starting with the unboxing because it comes with everything every accessory that you could possibly need to make it work at its best is in the Box would you believe it the video quality is a really cool example of this progression like this is the original insta360 go one from 2019 and its quality looks like this which is you know it's not Cinema quality at 1080p but it's excusable for the size the go-to almost doubled that resolution to 1440p and uses a bigger sensor to let in much more light I was impressed by this one when I tried it in 2021 but then you've got the go 3 which shoots at 2.7 K which is even higher and it's reached a point now where when I'm showing people the footage I've taken on this thing I'm not there like just bear in mind it's taking on a tiny little camera the size of my finger I'm just genuinely proud of it and on the subject of size that's number eight it really is ridiculous what you can do when your camera is this any skills all those weird shot ideas you've had that just don't make sense using a DSLR or a phone there's a very good chance that this will do and with a lack of size also comes a lack of weight this thing is 35 grams it's lighter than your phone it's lighter than our camera batteries slicer than a lighter it's light enough that you can actually just wear it and I don't mean with harnesses that make it look like you're about to do one of those Red Bull motorbike stunt tracks with a pendant that's new and improved actually so you can now coil up the necklace into the sides of the pendant to turn it into basically a coin that you can keep with you and then when you want to use the thing it goes behind your top the camera sits in front and just captures your point of view without you needing to do anything and then what makes that proposition even better than it's been in past years is the battery life the original go one could do about 16 minutes per charge which sounds piddly but it was actually okay because of the way that you use it this was designed to just sit on your chest be able to turn itself on periodically record a 10 second snippet and then put itself back to sleep but then with the go-to this improved to 30 minutes which enough that for me all concern that I previously had about it potentially running out within the day was over and now with the go three thanks to more efficient use of the internal space for a bigger battery lasts 45 45 minutes of battery on a camera that's basically an oversized paracetamol I find that really impressive plus thanks to improved heat dissipation especially on this back plate over here there are now no limits on how long each clip can be but what if you want stupid levels of battery life well that's where the that's where the action pod comes in again included in the Box it's essentially an external shell for the go3 that gives you an easy way to grip the camera if you want to go handheld oh but here's the thing it pushes the battery all the way to 170 minutes for context the pro-grade Sony camera that we're using to film this video on that lasts about 60 more like 40 nowadays but it's not just a battery one of the reasons I find insta360 products so interesting is that they're constantly thinking and you can just tell they're constantly thinking how do we multi-purpose things how do we make this one thing do as many other things as possible and I'm in a tree where do we go from here so this action pod for example also has a high res screen that lets you preview your shots it flips so you can do the same for your face it's a touch screen so you can use it to toggle settings and use presets and change your mode it's got this magnetic quick release latching system for a tripod mount again included in the box but it's also and this is the kicker a Bluetooth remote for the camera so when the camera is in it the pins on the back physically connect to the action part and it works as if it was all just one device but then when you disconnect it it just switches to a Bluetooth connection where you can still see what the camera sees you can control the camera in the same way and you can preview the shots you've taken to make sure you're happy with them you can even stick the camera on your cat collar and record what they get up to that is if you have a cat who at least somewhat does what you want them to oh yeah also stabilization see when you have a camera mounted on your person and you're just going about your day you'd be surprised how much shaking and shuffling happens this camera just gets rid of it but three distinct levels of Flow State stabilization depending on the activity it even has an option to Horizon level so that even if you flip the entire thing upside down it still records everything the right way up and the go 3 is durable it's not like military grade or anything I wouldn't drop it from a plane hold up imagine the footage but it's strong enough that I haven't had to worry about it it actually comes with a lens guard attached by default but also it's watertight which means that a you don't have to worry if it rains and it gets wet but b means that it's actually waterproof to five meters no I don't think I can drop it there not because the camera can't hack it more because I can't but yeah while I don't exactly have a tropical sea nearby to me where I can test this say some footage that the company has taken with this it seems like a cracking camera for taking on like a snorkeling trip oh wait this is actually a real life test of how powerful the magnet on the pendant is wow so you know the floor's made of metal but it's not just about video the other half of the equation is the audio see both the go one and the go 2 have a microphone facing up which is focused on picking up your voice but this time round there are two microphones one facing up to listen to you same as last time but also one facing out and this has a few perks it means that a if you wanted to better hear what's happening around you this can now do that it means that if you're filming from unusual angles they'll always be at least one microphone that's picking up your voice directly but then also being able to hear both your voice and the environmental noise separately allows the camera to treat those audio tracks individually so if you wanted to let's say reduce the amount of background noise around you the camera can then use its understanding of what it picks up from the front mic to understand what part of the overall noise coming in is background noise and so it can cut that out and focus just on the words that you're saying I've always said that audio quality is 50 of the total video experience so I'm really glad that they've got around to addressing this oh yeah and there's now a oh yeah and there's now a secondary benefit oh yeah and there's now a sec oh yeah and there's now a secondary benefit to being able to hear yourself clearly voice control so let's say you've propped it into a precarious position and you no longer want to touch it all you need to do is to just say start recording and it will do it for you it's a steeper than I expected but nothing beats the modes on the go 3. if you watch my videos on passed into 360 cameras you'll know that they already have the most insane Suite of creative ways to shoot videos you can swap out your Sky you can automatically add light trails to an action sequence their app can Auto edit your videos for you syncing them up to the beat of the music using artificial intelligence but there's even more this time around for example pre-recording which lets the camera save up to 30 seconds of what it sees before you've even hit the record button you've got looped recording which continuously records but then only saves the last few minutes at the point where you click stop which is a really good way to just save storage space and then timed capture which if you want to capture a sunrise at a certain time but you don't actually want to get up for it this thing can turn itself on automatically at that time capture for you and then turn itself off
