dear smartphone companies two things the first one being at naming a might seem trivial but smartphones are complicated some companies are making 30 models a year and visually a lot of them don't look entirely different this of course makes the naming of them crucial but some brands just keep messing it up so there are seven things that I think could be done better here and seven being the length let's say Apple released a brand new iPhone in the future and they had two potential names how much better does iPhone a Zed sound versus iPhone 12 Pro matte plus SSS plus the name has got to be short short is impactful and short is easily shared that's it Apple still somewhat gets away with this because they only released one batch of ferns a year and they're so widespread that people kind of get used to their naming but let me tell you if Lenovo did this then I reckon it would fly completely under the radar it even applies to laptops how much better does macbook x7 sound as opposed to MacBook Pro 15 inch late 2018 model one letter and one number is enough to convey the exact same info as what is almost half a sentence number six is that the naming has got to be intuitive let me tell you something that does make sense let's say Samsung makes three lines of phones you've got the flagships you've got the mid-tier ones and then you got the entry-level ones they could literally call them a B and C a being the letter people already associate with being the best and it's very clear that phones in the a range are going to be better than phones in the C range now what makes a lot less sense is this this is Samsung some years ago talking about their different ranges of phones and apart from why at the bottom which stands for young it's almost impossible to tell which is the best S is for super smart and that does sound pretty good but then R is royal that sounds even better W and M are Wonder and magical where do they fit in in trying to make each individual product seem great you might end up confusing your customer here's a story I was talking to someone last week and they're about to buy the galaxy a 80 smartphone which is a really cool bit of kit but they wanted to check they just want to do a final confirmation that this was indeed the best phone at Samsung offered right now no it's definitely not and yet this is gonna be obvious to me it's gonna be obvious to you guys because the kinds of people who are in this tech community we really understand small phones but you can probably also see the situation where by looking at this phones front filling display it's brand-new form factor and the fact that it has the letter A in it an average consumer might not realize it's barely half the power of Samsung's best number five is appeal every single time you think about you hear about all you interact with the product you build associations with it if for example people kept telling you oh my oneplus phone is so fast then you're going to start associating oneplus with speed with that in mind then if you're going to name your small phone of Prive or char char then right out the gate a person's first impression is not gonna be all that great a name should have positive associations and yes these can be built over time but a company can also help themselves by picking something that sounds good output gate Samsung's Galaxy is a good example number four is being something they call web friendly and this is especially important if you're a smaller or newer company whilst it is tempting to name your brand or your line of Ferns after something in the real world it can also result in your brand just not appearing at all when people search for you let's take honor when I search on er here in the UK I do get the brand name coming up first which is good but it's also mixed in with a whole lot of news that's got nothing to do with the phone company there's another company called lava and let me tell you they've got it far worse they're a fairly established manufacturer of smartphones but they don't even appear on the front page when you google their name I would argue that even more important than this is pronunciation you see there's a distinct psychological effect when someone sees something that they think is unfamiliar or foreign people stick to what they know and that applies to the names of phones and the companies that sell them if you're going to try and sell in the UK and your brand is called Huawei or Xiaomi which a large amount of people here struggle to say properly then it's not impossible but right out the gate you're at a disadvantage this is part of the reason the honor brand exists to try and appeal to young Westerners you might be put off by qual way so you don't need telling that a lot of small things are getting released and our best way of keeping track of that is numbers oh you're using the iPhone 7 I'm using the iPhone 8 you can tell very quickly which one is better than the other one Samsung's Galaxy S series does this pretty well it's consistent and easy to follow you've got the s1 the s2 the s3 the s4 and so on and because the note series shares the same numbering as the S series people could very quickly look at the note 9 and realize it is Samsung's Note equivalent to the s9 it's kind of amazing then that almost every single one of these companies starts to break this rule but only in some situations with Huawei's flagship P series it was absolutely fine there was a PA to Pinay in a p10 but as soon as we thought we were about to see a P 11 we got a p20 and pardon me gets it it sounds cooler it signifies a big jump in performance but to an average consumer as soon as you start arbitrarily jumping numbers like this the number itself becomes meaningless it might as well just be the P 900 at this point what makes even less sense is LG you count upwards in ones with their flagship G series of phones but then decides to count upwards in tens with their other flagship V series of phones and the most criminal example of this is when companies completely are the blue just name their product one no prefix just the number one Sony comes to mind here a company with quite possibly the most confusing lineup in history let me give you an example of the names of Sony flagships over the last few years you've got the Xperia x10 Xperia S Xperia T and Xperia Z so at this point it just seems like the brand Xperia with a random letter attached onto it but then we had Xperia Z 1 Z 2 Z 3 Z at 3 plus z5 and then just when it looks like we're getting somewhere X Zed they then kept going with X Z for a bit and then BAM back to just Xperia 1 and they've also just announced the Xperia v to go with that I give up number 1 is gonna sound pretty self-explanatory but repeating yourself giving two completely different products an identical brand name I was talking to a friend the other day about buying an iPad and he said but isn't the standard iPad really old in an attempt to simplify things Apple has done multiple iterations of starting from scratch in the same way Sony has but with Apple they're not using similar names but identical names I suppose what Apple is trying to do here is sell the iPad as an experience they're banking on the fact that people trust them they're trying to create an environment where people will buy Apple products without even making comparisons to other brands and in that sense it's quite effective it just means that the only way to keep track of what you're actually getting when you buy iPad is by diving into the tech specs where you can see which chip they're powered by funnily enough the chips themselves are labelled perfectly and very easy to follow anyways I went on for a bit but that's my piece on name and the second thing I want to talk about is scratch resistance isn't it kind of annoying when you're doing everything to protect your shiny new smartphone and then one day you just pull it out your pocket and bam there's a massive mark going right across your screen you might have seen a video I'm a entitled our small phones getting weaker if you have an Owen spoil the full thing but one finding was that newer smartphones aren't actually more scratch resistant than devices made 10 years ago or at least not significantly the issue is that there's a trade-off between adding more scratch resistance to glass and adding more drop resistance to glass as the Corning Gorilla Glass the stuff you see on flagship phones each year has progressed it has become more and more resistant to drops but because adding drop resistance doesn't protect against scratches and because small phone makers are supposedly pushing Corning to make thinner glass each year scratch resistance has barely improved and actually between some generations has gotten worse now I'd have a problem with stuff getting thinner it can be quite a cool novel thing but not everything has to be thinner and I feel like when it comes at the cost of things like durability just make the phone thicker obviously you can just put a case on the back and a tempered glass screen protector on the front but at that point your device is almost definitely thicker and probably less pretty than if they just added more durability in the first place what I would personally want is for a phone to have a harder material to coat the display this can potentially make it more brittle but then increase the glass thickness or add a protective layer on top to make it stronger it is possible that this is all part of the business strategy that having scratched up ferns gives people that constant sustained incentive to keep upgrading and buying the latest and greatest but at the same time if it is a fixable problem then it would be really appreciated see ya it's an incredible time to be alive if there's so much crazy stuff happening and in the grand scheme of things yes I am nitpicking but I quite enjoy analysis videos like this and if you've watched this far then hopefully you do too if you enjoy this video I've got a ton of smartphone news like this so I'll link it somewhere above here my name is Erin and this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
