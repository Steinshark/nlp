open AI CEO Sam Altman says remote work was a big mistake for Tech okay these are some of the the balls on this guy okay I've not read this I want to read this while seemingly every tech company is attempting to chase the artificial intelligence dragon that Sam Altman and open AI rot ultimate is I love heroine jokes by the way heroin jokes are my favorite ultimate is joining the old-fashioned chorus of anti-remote work Tech CEOs with one of the strongest statements against it all right all right Altman the chief executive of San Francisco based open AI gotta do you gotta mention in San Francisco by the way it's San Francisco home of the tech by the way if you didn't know it by the way uh opined against the experiment of remote work for staff creativity at a talk hosted by the financial Tech Giant stripe it was first reported by foot and Friday I think definitely what kind of voice does Sam have I think definitely one of the text Industries worst mistake in a long time was that everybody could go full remote forever and startups didn't need to be together in person and you know there was going to be no less of creativity did I do a good job I think I did a good job I think I nailed it I think I nailed it uh anyways let's see I would let's see I would say that the experiment on that is over and the technology is not yet good enough that people can be full remote forever particularly on startups in a 2019 podcast uh when a economist Tyler Cohen aldman did Express his contempt for co-working spaces which begs the question where does he think startups should meet if they uh if they need to meet in person that's actually kind of a funny thing he doesn't like he doesn't like remote work and he doesn't like co-working spaces I just want everyone in the cube far away from each other but together so just in case neither bring them together um I'm curious about this whole thing because I'm not fully convinced creativity is gone I think creativity is not the right term I would say team cohesiveness buy-in on the team ability to enjoy and kind of find more uh satisfaction from your job I think really does hurt in real remote work but that's kind of the trade-off you're making you're intentionally saying I want to find less satisfaction in my job and more satisfaction in something else I think that's kind of the statement so I'm curious I don't think you could ever measure this but what you know like what is a person's buy-in at a company based on whether they're in the company in a location versus remote is there a more committed person if you will uh in person versus not in person I don't know but this whole like creativity thing I think creativity it has a lot of factors and one of them is being in a space that you feel creative and sometimes that's just the ability to talk to somebody else which is really really important and to just say your ideas out loud which changes your perspective but second I think that sometimes just being away from people is also where you do very creative work so I know he emphasizes the startups but again I don't buy any of this right I like I just simply don't buy any of this and so I I'm saying that I don't think you can measure this axis on remote non-remote I think you could measure a lot of things on remote non-remote I think team I think team cohesiveness would be probably the biggest one Chad Jeopardy wrote this okay uh this isn't the first time Altman has made his feelings about remote work known saying that uh the companies who rushed to fall remote permanently made a big mistake in a January tweet that said he even has expectations making the caveat that some of open ai's best people are remote in the following up response okay so again maybe just maybe I know this is going to be one of those problems that people just hate hearing maybe some people are better in remote and some people are better in office maybe some people don't want to live in shitty San Francisco and some people do and when you force them to live in San Francisco maybe they don't perform as well because they hate the location they live and maybe I know I know five dollars a month people Maybe in the Hills of South Dakota some of us think better than we did in the bourbon sprawl of San Jose I'm saying I'm just saying okay I'm just saying I'm PR you know honestly I'm probably this this video will probably get demonetized on YouTube I mean this this take where we should like respect people for who they are kind of takes man this is not an opinion YouTube shares jeez he is also not the first to Bang the Drum against working from home please tell me read read Hastings let me get the Reed Hastings one here even if he is among the most zealous Salesforce CEO Mark benioff benioff and benioff uh once uh an Arden supporter of his employees ability to work remotely suggested in January that employees hired during the pandemic are facing much lower productivity because of the company's office policy dude that is such I mean please dude take dumb take right there please you cannot possibly measure employee performance against non like pandemic hired employees right they're like the the the world the experience what people are going through is vastly different between the two it just it just feels like like remember when you were hiring before covid you actually had the pick of whatever you wanted there's a lot of people in there there's a lot of positions and so you got to really be really like particular about what you wanted and then covet hit everyone started using the internet money was going way up government was handing out checks money was spent like wild on Amazon more money than they've ever made was during that time and all of a sudden people needed to hire like wild so they just didn't even have like the filtering mechanism was so much different during that time than beforehand and to just like remotely compare the two is just bogus uh yeah compare productivity during 9 11. I'm sure it went down yeah I'm sure when you have horrible human uh things in productivity at a job might be affected ridiculous ridiculous uh meta CEO Mark now does BJJ Zuckerberg and dude imagine imagine having to go on the mat with Mark Zuckerberg and getting pinned by Mark Zuckerberg like just imagine Mark Zuck BJJ just imagine that you're in there and you are this guy right here you're getting pwned by Mark Zuckerberg like you're getting full lizard human like not only did you just get defeated by a guy that's most certainly either a lizard or a robot but like a billion people are gonna watch you get owned you know what I mean ugh that has to hurt that has to hurt it has to hurt because you know what I don't know about all the pinnings that happen at all in BJJ I don't even care but when you're telling me that Mark Zuck takes you to the ground you know I'm looking at that photo lizard strength is greater than human strength probably yeah it I mean it sucks all right here we go uh here we go suggesting that remote start employees were worse off than their uh in office counterparts now that is an interesting take this is something I could believe that if you start off remote your ability to become integrated know your team and get up to speed is probably hampered more than if you were not remote to begin with I can buy that take because you're in office and you can just like walk around going to person to person asking questions that's a buyable take uh internet let's say into a notice so let's see uh into a notice of laying off ten thousand workers in March let's see recently joining this list is newly appointed CEO of Lyft David writer richer uh who in April reported switched the company's flexible work policy into a mandated three days a week in the office among those cheering on his call to return to work with San Francisco supervisor Matt Dorsey uh whose District Six includes a mid-market Soma and Mission Bay okay so if if you're talking about anyone that's running San Francisco of course they are do you realize how desperate California is for taxes like when you make someone work in office that means they have to pay state taxes okay I'm just saying you want to tell me you want to tell me like I live in South Dakota I don't pay California taxes I don't give California a dime you know why because I don't live in California uh anyways uh let's see uh in-person collaboration helps create vibrant workplaces and vibrant Urban neighborhoods what a politic this is I I don't even I don't even know if this guy's a politician or not but this guy's a politician okay this guy is a politician I don't want to live in a Urban neighborhood perhaps ridiculous uh the thanking almond for his influential thought leadership on the matter what a tool bag I do like those so the one big takeaway though which I think is a really great takeaway which we should have is this right here I really do think in-office interactions are the best way to get to know the people on your team to get to know people no matter how much you feel about interactions no matter how introvert you think you are which everybody's an introvert these days I swear uh interacting with people there is just no replacement there is I do not believe that there's going to be a VR replacement uh anytime in the next 10 20 years that could actually mimic all the things you need maybe maybe in 20 years I could be wrong in 20 years but I'm just like I just doubt it so hard you know what I mean like the amount of communication that happens in an office the amount of communication that just happens with how you move your hands how you position your body how your tone of voice comes out you just like it just doesn't you can't get it and on a call you can't really get it here's Mo here is most of the phone calls that happen okay here you go here's most the phone calls this is pretty much this describes most of okay where are you is this is this it no this is not it what about this one this is pretty much every single phone call that I get always like hey hey is that hey is this Prime hey hey Prime uh I was wondering if hold on one second hey hold on okay hey I was wondering if you happen to have a hold on that's it that's what that that is remote work in a nutshell I don't even know if I got this right I may be screwing this up I probably shouldn't have done that because now I have to figure out did I get this right I don't even know if I got this right it's close enough you see a lot of waste now oh I never had that happen oh man I get so many of those I get some people will like open up their laptop and like half their face is in it and the other half is just like of of a shade and then their voice is constantly just like you know their voice is like hey uh hey hey uh I was just uh I was just going down and uh you know I was just wondering if you happen to have the time to uh look for it I I you're just like what the saying your microphone's cutting out 80 of the time why are you speaking into a can of tuna connected to a string connected to a USB what the hell is happening here oh hold on what was that like earpods dude I hate it I hate it it's not cool anyways the name is the prime machine I have to pee so bad oh my goodness
