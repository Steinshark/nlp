what's up guys welcome to worst Amazon reviews on Amazon what's up guys welcome to worst reviews on Amazon I'm gonna read you guys some titles of real like a hundred percent real reviews and I want you guys to try to guess the product so as I said these are titles of real reviews and I want you to try to guess the name of the product okay so demon spawn life-altering experience why is this legal internal Armageddon great going in hell on earth coming out in time okay so what I want you to do right now so I want you to write a comment what do you think this product is it's an actual product on Amazon okay so I'm not even joking these are real reviews for sugarfree gummy bears no joke what's funny is these are supposed to be sugar-free according to the name but the first two ingredients are corn syrup and sugar so apparently someone is selling sugarfree gummy bears on Amazon but they're not actually sugar free so all these people that are sugar intolerant are buying them and then when they eat them they can't have sugar so it's giving them bathroom problems and these reviews are hilarious let's read them dropship over enemy lines ship these Thai Rak and give to Isis they look and taste so good but the pain is beyond translation forget it as a gift and consider it better a weapon against our enemies dang a red one shot out hole it was unbelievably fast ricocheted against the side of the bowl and made a noisy splash good for a party trick I guess mother of God sugar free was made by the Nazis during World War two as a testing agent in the concentration camps I'd rather share bed with Satan in hell then go through that Hiroshima again I didn't serve in any war but I swear what I just experienced can rival a flashback to Nam for the love of everything that is holy and sweet do not eat sugar free anything gain the weight is worth the alternative of crying in your bed praying to a higher being the pain stops oh boy no do not eat these Satan bears they will kill your digestive tract and put you in a world of pure pain as I stood up from the toilet I was in awe love how many brown dolphins were in the pan this is for hungry few people should be classified as WMDs I ate a handful of these on a flight from NYC to California and now I been permanently banned by that airline I heard they had to fumigate the plane hell in a baggie a few hours later in the night I tossed and turned on my bed I felt as if something was going to rip out of my stomach I decide to get up it to use the restroom reading the reviews and knowing my gut a steal I took the chances as I went into the restroom I felt more pain it was unearthly pain I cannot even describe I got on the toilet and were released from my but a more dangerous load than Hiroshima in 1945 after which my stomach burst open and a small fetus came out turns out if you eat sugarfree gummy bears you will in fact give birth to the Antichrist oMG I wanted to die it was not great buy something else where you'll be happy you did trust me on that one I will never buy again these may ruin your life my well-meaning roommate picked up a bag of them for me knowing that I was trying to lose weight I opened them and munched on a few then decided to put on my one-piece bathing suit and go for a swim in my buildings pool long story short hazmat what's called and I was evicted shortly thereafter the pool is still closed to my knowledge why is this legal they were absolutely horrible this is like drinking five gallons of laxatives the great flood was the worst part I had to sleep outside for five days because my family didn't want me around it has been three months now and I still can't get the stains off of the toilet all right guys so that's the video I don't know what they're putting in those gummy bears apparently they're putting like poison ivy instead of sugar freeness what'd I just say something you guys have been saying though is this right here it says 0% well it now says 100% again now the reason the one has been covered up for so long is because we couldn't keep up with the amount of likes I was getting so I had to cover up the one so it would say 0% or zero zero percent which is zero and so that's why you haven't been getting cookies recently but we're gonna read rebn restart whatever something we're gonna fix what am i say we're gonna start making the cookies again you're in receive them so make sure you like the videos I'm sorry for all the ones you didn't get that you might have thought you were getting kind make sure you take out your dishwasher do your trash and that's the video hopefully you enjoyed by the way I'll link the product down below the Amazon product so if you want to read the reviews just go down there there's hundreds of them they're so funny and yeah wait a minute did I say take out the dishwasher [Music]
