so today we'll be looking at exponential functions and the fact that they can be a bit counter-intuitive at times um so if you don't mind um i'm going to ask you a couple of questions to test your intuition okay okay warning all right so you know that duckweed which is the green stuff that grows on top of ponds can grow quite rapidly and cover a pond in no time so let's say that we have a pond and we introduce a little bit of duckweed on day one um and in two weeks it will be completely covered with duckweed so how long does it take to cover half the pond with duckweed okay i know so two weeks it's full is it yeah um so i don't know 10 days 10 days no the trick is in the question it doubles every day so on day 13 it was half full because it doubles and then it's full ah of course right yeah so what if instead of starting with one initial patch of duckweed we put an equivalently sized one on the other side of the pond and we let it run how long does it take to cover the entire pond this time so i'm going to say half because there are double the amount of plants make sense right but no again it's 13 days because basically they both have to cover a pond that is half the original size now let's go the other direction let's imagine that the entire earth is covered with fresh water how long would it take to cover the entire earth with duckweed there's a there's a trick here inherent in this i can for sure there is so it's not going to be very long a year or so a year or so i'll get to a year in a minute so the first two weeks we go from about six square centimeters to 10 square meters that's covering the entire pond in two weeks and then another two weeks and it's enough to cover the entire campus of the university if it were fresh water another two weeks and it would cover all of europe and another week and it would cover the earth now you were saying a year and a year is actually plenty of time to cover the entire galaxy if it was covered in water in fact it only takes 47 weeks to do so so our intuition is kind of misleading with exponential growth and of course part of the reason is because in practice there's always going to be a barrier the pond is only 10 square meters so it's not going to grow beyond that you know for humans that make sense we're in an environment where things eventually have to slow down another example of this of course is a current hot topic the chronovirus which has an initial growth that is also thought to be exponential of course at some point there will be a break because a lot of people will be immune or you know shielded otherwise say a vaccine so of course i'm not a health expert i'm just talking about the exponential growth bit here and not about all the other things that are important for corona so the idea is that there's a growth factor which is sometimes called the r zero and this r zero value is the basis of the growth so the duckweed was growing with a factor two every day now the r0 value is not defined over a specific period of time but rather over the infectious period so if your r0 is 3 what it means is that the average person over their term of being infectious will infect three others so by the time they're better they will on average have infected three others now if that infectious period is about a week that means that every week the number of patients will triple and this is sort of what we saw in the beginning of the corona virus crisis so what the duckweed and the coronavirus have in common is that they follow exponential growth and i think it's a good idea to train our intuition to write down a very simple formula so let's derive this formula um specifically at first for the duckweed in the pond right we know that there's an initial value i already said the value so let's just write it down the initial value was six squared centimeters and then after the first day it doubled so that's a times two after the second day it doubled again times 2. now of course we need to do this 14 times i'm not going to write down 14 twos but you get the idea so we have 14 times this doubling process now i think almost everyone will be aware of a different way of writing this down which is simply to say we have the six square centimeters times two to the power fourteen and two to the power fourteen is roughly sixteen thousand sixteen thousand three hundred roughly and if we multiply these two numbers what we get is a hundred thousand square centimeters so remember that's the original unit so this remains the unit and it means that it's 10 square meter we all know that exponential growth has an exponent there's no surprise there but we can generalize away 6 was our initial value so we write that down with the letter i to we call our base so in our case it was doubling every time period so that's our base b in our case two the time period we denote with t so that is 14 days and then the result will be our final value and this is how all exponential growth works you have an initial value times the amount of change per time unit to the power time units is equal to our final value now another example of exponential growth that we're all familiar with are of course bank accounts and accruing or paying interest so in this case the growth is often expressed as a percentage so how do we convert a percentage to a base so let's say that we have three percent growth so obviously that is not the same as tripling every time period so we don't want to fill in three for b here we want to convert this to a number that fits there so three percent growth means that if you have a hundred percent after one time period you'll have a hundred and three percent um so it also means that if you have one unit and you have three percent growth you'll have one point zero three units so what you do is you add 100 to get 103 and you divide all of that by 100 to go from a percentage to a number and the value you end up with is 1.03 we talk about exponential growth and the immediate thought is a huge amount of growth when actually i'm thinking three percent not so great exactly and this is the point i was about to make it's not very intuitive um perhaps that's part of the reasons why banks like to use percentages because they're not very intuitive which works in their advantage if someone says monthly interest of three percent you might think that's not a lot but if you convert it to annual interest it's actually really a lot there's another way to think about this because you can convert bases so instead of saying we want to have 1.03 so let's say that you have 10 000 pounds on your bank account and a 3 interest and you're running it over let's say 10 years so this is one way to approach it i don't know by heart what the answer is but this will be the amount of money you have on your bank account after 10 years of 3 but another way to think about this is how long does it take to double my money so you want to find a value x such that 1.03 to the power x is equal to 2. and it turns out you can use a logarithm to compute this that x is roughly 23 and a half years so that means that after 23 and a half years of accruing three percent interest you will have doubled your money now if you have two percent interest it will take you 35 years um so i recommend and a lot of people do this when they ask for a mortgage is they convert these figures to how long does it take to double the money or to pay off the principal etc etc so that's basically what you're doing you're converting the base and the time period from one format to another in computer science we typically use two as the base anyone can guess why right binary stuff 2 to the power makes sense so a famous exponentially hard problem in computer science is the towers of hanoi in case you don't know what the towers of hanoi is you have a game where you have three prongs and you have disks that can slide onto the prongs and there's one rule in one rule only which is bigger discs cannot go onto smaller disks so they always have to have a shape like this and now the trick is can you move a number of disks from one prong to the other prong without breaking this rule so if you have two disks for example you can take the top disc put it in the middle take the bottom disc move it to the right then take the smaller disc and put it on top it gets a lot more complicated if you have more discs well it's not more complicated but it gets a lot more involved at least and let's try to figure out why so let's say that i give you a way to move k disks so any number k disks i give you a way to move them now i ask you can you move k plus 1 disks and the answer is actually yes quite easily because you take the top k disks you move them away using the known way the bottom disk you can move it now because it's free and then you take again the k disks and you move it on top of the now moved bottom disk now this algorithm is very nice but it has the downside that you had to do the moving the tower of k disks twice so every time you add one disk you need to do the problem for the previous one twice so we can actually write down the formula for this um so we know that it doubles every time you add a disk so the base is 2 again computer science and then the number of disks let's call that n so 2 to the power n that's how much time it costs now what we notice here is that time is actually our final value and the number of disks is our exponent so it's kind of flipped um from the problems we've seen before but that's perfectly fine our initial value is how long it takes a computer to move a single disk so let's say that you build a computer program to do towers of hanoi you can ask torsten how to do it in one of the computer file videos but let's say that it takes about a billionth of a second because the computer can do dozens of operations in that time that is one nano second and then you can do two to the power n operations and that will be our final value now we are free to fill in a value n and ask ourselves how long will it take a computer so if we fill in a reasonable value like 10 2 to the power 10 is a thousand and 24 so that's a nice value because it's roughly a thousand so that means that we can do 10 disks a computer can do 10 disks i can't um in one millionth of a second it can do 20 disks in a thousandth of a second it can do 30 disks in a second okay so you think okay that's fairly quick 30 disks per second but then if we move to 40 disks it will take a thousand seconds which is you know almost 20 minutes then if you move to 50 disks well you get a thousand times 20 minutes so that's in the order of magnitude of several weeks then if you go to 10 more 60 discs you'll get again a thousand times that time span which will be in the order of magnitude of centuries already um and then of course if you go beyond that you know before you reach 100 discs the universe will have died a black death or whatever it's called nowadays a big crunch there's just no way that a computer will be able to compute this but then you might say okay what if we make the computers a bit faster right what if we instead of having a gigahertz computer we have a petahurtz computer so it will be a thousand times quicker well all that means is that it can do 10 disks more than the previous computer you might say what if we are smart in the algorithm and we have some shortcuts and we can save 99 99 okay that's a factor 100 so that means that you can save about six or seven disks and this is the big problem of exponential algorithms in computing now in the case of the towers of hanoi it's not a practical problem because why on earth would you want a computer to to tell you exactly which disks to move for 100 disks that just doesn't happen but there are famous problems that we believe are exponential that are of interest a famous example is a traveling salesman problem so let's say that you want to visit say 20 cities in the uk and you ask yourself can i do this in one week you know following you can use public transport you can use the car whatever can you do this in a week and in general there's no easy way of finding this answer one naive way to do this would be to look at all combinations of cities and that is exponentially many combinations so that means that if you add one city you have to now consider all permutations that include this one city so that means that it will be more than two times as hard every time you add one city to the problem and that of course is going to run into the same issues here it doesn't really matter what the initial value is it doesn't really matter what the base is if you have an exponential function it will always get out of hand at some point now in the case of the traveling salesman problem this is a bad thing because we would like to be able to compute you know faster ways of traveling that would be nice wouldn't it but in the case of computer security it is actually a good thing sometimes that it's difficult to compute certain problems if you have for example a 2048-bit key what it means is that there's 2 to the power 2048 different key possibilities so if you start guessing keys you can go multiple runs of the universe just guessing random keys and you'll never even get close to getting the right key that is the nature of exponential distributions they can go up really quickly much more quickly than we can understand thinking about it naively but by simply looking at a formula we can get more informed uh ideas of the speed of the growth i'm hoping one day my bank account interest will get out of hand that's the that's the hope yes so i don't know if you've seen futurama but if you have a thousand years worth of interest you have a lot of money unfortunately the world government will have collapsed a couple of times so it still ends up worthless here this one back so i know the trick huh this one here ha and it all works out which is keeping track of time in that way we'll get really confused and we basically get the millennium bug all over again there must be a way of fixing this are people working on it already you
