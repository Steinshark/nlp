ladies and gentlemen I've got a very special piece of content for you today normally on this channel I cover Chess at all levels it doesn't matter if it's 100 200 ELO 1,000 1500 2,000 the best Grand Masters in the world or even AI That's 3700 normally all of these games that I cover start with the starting position and they start in a position that is equal not today's video today I'm going to be showing you a game that Hikaru Nakamura uh the third ranked player in the world uh currently a candidate he's going to be playing in the candidates tournament here in uh 2024 competing for the World Chess Championship cycle and he's the number one and number two ranked player in the world in Blitz and bullet as far as I'm concerned Hikaru played a game that was so ridiculous stockfish could simply only smile and that is my entire introduction and we are going to enjoy this game this game did not start on equal terms and a couple of quick caveats uh about this game this game was played in the bullet Brawl on chess.com the bullet brawl is a tournament where people play bullet they play one minute chess I don't really like covering one minute chess cuz it's kind of stupid but when the average rating of the players is 31 like 80 the play is a little bit less stupid except the opening because this tournament was ending very soon uh hikaru's opponent Grandmaster Andrew Tang one of the best bullet players in the world played this and this is something that we refer to as cheesing if you ever see that your opponent is pre-moving for example some people pre-move the London system and if you play the England Gambit suddenly they're going to lose a bishop and they're going to be losing the game right Andrew knew that Hikaru was going to play this move next because that's what Hikaru does this is hikaru's favorite opening especially online not over the board but definitely online so Andrew cheesed him he played Bishop H6 which is a terrible move it loses a piece but because he knew hikaro was going to be playing fast not only did Hikaru play this move and ultimately lose his Bishop Hikaru is also going to lose the Rook Hikaru loses eight points of material on the third move of the game technically on the second move two moves in Hikaru now guarantees that he starts the game down eight points of material now you can already tell as an introduction to this video something is going to happen that is going to be utterly ridiculous um and yeah yeah that that that is that is actually literally what is going to happen this is a defensive master class I know it's a little ridiculous I know one minute chess is not real chess technically but it's still very very important to understand how to play a position when you are down material because guess what for all of you that are sitting there going oh this is bullet this is nonsense you're all going to be down material in a game that you play in the next 24 hours so will I because chess is hard it's important to know how to play when you're winning but also when you're losing so Knight to H6 the idea of Knight to H6 is to play King to F7 and ultimately win back this bishop so at least hikaro is not going to be down eight points he will be down five now and uh Andrew who was playing with the white pieces obviously is not going to uh you know um is not going to be fully there mentally after successfully getting away with this when you get away with something like this an adrenaline rush happens so you're not really be going to be playing perfectly the best way to play here if you're playing White is you actually have a way to Target this Knight forcing black to play defense and now you sneak over here and somehow black can't get to you and then what you would do is you would send help right so black would go here and you know you you would just send help for your Bishop so I I would play H4 H5 and and try to get my Bishop like this Andrew however plays Bishop G7 and actually walks directly into Knight F5 so he is going to lose his Bishop but to be honest with you he really shouldn't be that greedy he's up a full Rook so Hikaru is playing a 3100 level grandmas we could live multiple lifetimes and not get to this level and watch okay white plays KN C3 of course good move doesn't really matter you are upper Rook okay now Hikaru has to make moves fast cuz he only has 49 seconds and he has to make moves that don't lose the game cuz he's down a freaking Rook so he plays C 6 the most insane thing about the move C6 is of all the things that black can do it is the top engine move how does he know that well the point is he's going to stop this knight from coming out but also he's going to get his Queen to create counterplay and also he's going to create counterplay with his Pawn white plays Knight F3 okay black can do a lot of things here but the best plan for black is to advance with the pawn on the edge of the board because you cannot fight your opponent in the middle if you're down material it doesn't make sense you don't have an Army full of pieces so you try to get some degree of imbalance on that side of the board with the move B5 now for white if I'm playing white I'm probably just going to March down the middle right I'm I'm I'm just going to try to March down the middle open up the position Andrew does play H4 I talked about this move not so long ago to try to bring it you know his Rook to the party a very big decision for Hikaru the move H5 is a bad move you'll notice the evaluation goes up and the reason is G6 gets very weak so after Queen D2 the queen can infiltrate and it's going to be very very unpleasant to defend this position because you've created more weaknesses hikaro doesn't create more weaknesses he doesn't panic at the sight of this move he plays the top engine move which is to remove white knight from the middle of the board that is the top engine move defensively the best move for white is actually to hang out here it's to block Black's advancement and maybe try to gallop back into the position but he plays 92 which is not the best move Look 4.5 4.2 he CaRu chipping away right now the best move I swear to he's playing the top engine move it's not A5 now that you've removed the knight from the center of the board now you play D5 now you do fight for the middle because white kind of left so he can't get his Queen out he can't get his Bishop out right by the way have you noticed Andrew Tang has lost like 3 seconds every move Andrew is making is coming with than half a second it's unbelievable so D5 now if white plays E5 the position is locking up so what Hikaru is going to do is he's going to try to make it so that white can't easily make moves all right Andrew takes why he's upper Rook so of course he's going to want to trade to open the position hikaro plays cd5 so he wins a little bit of central space he has the open C file potentially right for the bishop to come out but at the end of the day the position's opening and one guy has more pieces than the other a lot more pieces technically it's it's just one more piece but it's a five-point Advantage Knight to G3 okay now black can play a lot of different ways here he can play Bishop to G4 but I think hikaro is kind of allowing H5 because he wants to lock the position so he plays Knight C6 Andrew plays H5 hikaro plays G5 basically saying look Andrew you can't Advance on that side of the board but Andrew has made progress he moves the pawn to H6 now this Pawn is the last thing preventing that H Pawn from becoming a queen so Andrew is up a rook and he's really making it count because Hikaru lost the corner Rook right I mean and now Hikaru plays Knight E6 if I'm playing white you know I'm playing one of these two moves and I'm just going for that pawn but it's actually shockingly not that easy of course because Hikaru is the best defensive player in the world he plays Knight f8 he's just not going to let you take the pawn now what's crazy is you could actually sacrifice the bishop which is not what Andrew does and after Queen D3 that this is by far the most brutal way into the position for example G4 here is a move you can take on H7 I would take and then you would try to promote the pawn I mean it's it's it's really really bad news Bishop takes H7 is brutal if white plays all the best moves he car is going to lose because I mean he lost eight points of material in three moves that's what happens but Andrew is trying to play quickly all right he's not looking for sacrifices he makes a bit of an inaccuracy but it's still plus five now King F7 all right we bring the king a little bit closer we can now help stop the promotion the king walks right Andrew castles he's maintained a plus4 plus five Advantage the entire game hiar has kept the game going still got 45 seconds on the clock both guys are making every move in like S 3 point4 7 something like that okay so now that white committed his King right he committed the king he's going to put a rook on the E file he's going to try to get a rook maybe over here he's going to try to go for it so now karo's got to play Queen A5 now the king that has been committed right Queen goes to A5 by the way the best move for white is not to play defense it is to sacrifice and that's what Hikaru does he puts opponents in positions where they need to find the most critical responses and with like 50 seconds on the clock that's not so easy because you got to calculate Queen H5 and then Queen E8 and try to you know get over here and of course it's winning of course it's winning again but white plays King B1 all right he's respecting the threat of Hikaru now E6 all right again creating a bowl of Pawns around the king trying to make it so that white can't easily infiltrate again the top engine move sacrifice the Knight go for an attack on the black king if he finds that wonderful instead of that he plays Queen E3 clearly by the way clearly setting up Knight takes G5 so if this Knight G5 and then the queen is going to get in and queen G7 that is a much more natural type of sacrifice so Queen E3 Hikaru is the best defensive player in the world because right when the situation demands a critical move he doesn't get tunnel vision he doesn't continue to try to attack you know what he does he puts the queen right back on the home Square he says you know what you're not going to sacrifice the Knight speaking of which the computer still wants to sacrifice the Knight because Black's King is so weak and this Pawn is so strong right and white has enough material but Andrew plays rookie one he's just making simple improving moves can you really blame the guy not really I mean he's he's upper Rook he's got a plus six Advantage now Hikaru again not waiting for his opponent to continue to build the position plays A5 the advantage has been hovering around plus six the entire game but as far as Hikaru is concerned in a bullet game he's preventing Bishop H7 he's preventing Knight takes G5 and he's preventing Queen E6 so how is white going to break through Hikaru has set up an absolutely perfect stockfish level defense here White NOW needs to find with you know limited time on the clock these sacrifices and will he well he plays Knight H5 again he's trying to keep pieces safe Andrew is not trying to lose any material so he plays Knight H5 he's still looking at this he's maybe going to put the Knight on G7 to pressure over here right now remember hik Caro's last move A5 Andrew plays Knight H5 hikaro plays A4 right he very quickly evaluated that this Knight posed no real threat so he plays A4 now it's not really clear what black is going to do on the next move by the way while Andrew plays Knight G7 so now the Knight is there pressuring this pressuring this but there's no threat hikaru's Knight on f8 is protecting every important Pawn in the position is Knight takes G5 still a possibility probably but Andrew plays Knight G7 right and now it's the Battle of these Knights now it's important you know which Pawn to push anytime you have a two on three like this or a three on three you have to know which Pawn to push more often than not the center Pawn is better because the center Pawn forces a response from White if you play A3 white can play B3 and that's the end now of course there's going to be a game you can get a queen and you can mate however generally B3 is a little bit better because it forces a decision if A3 you can take and then you're going to get in if C3 you can take if take well then you're going to open up like this so it's better to strike right it's better to strike with B3 and that's exactly what happens hearo plays this move B3 and he's making Andrew make another decision Andrew takes with a c Pawn probably because he gets the open C file okay a takes B3 right now can Andrew take AB yeah but then it's B plus two okay it's plus three if you find some Perfect Defense but Knight B4 Is On The Way Queen A5 is on the way and suddenly black has a Checkmate threat which did not exist the entire game Suddenly It's actually White's King who is weaker and Black's King is safe behind all of these Pawns which is why Andrew plays A3 he just not letting hikaro into the position yeah I mean that makes a lot of sense so what does hikaro do now right what is he GNA do spends a whopping 2.4 seconds and he plays Rook A7 he is now down 10 seconds on the clock and he's still down a rook he is just down he's playing a 3100 rated opponent down a rook he's playing him with Rook odds basically okay The Rook goes there for three reasons four the first reason is hikaro doesn't really have any moves and he has to play a move fast that's kind of a bonus reason reason number two you want to protect h s all right you just kind of want to in general protect the seventh Rank and you also want to double you you you never know maybe you're going to double up of course the queen could have gone to A5 anyway maybe Rook E7 right Rook A7 okay Andrew's got to find the well Andrew took on B3 because he wanted to play Rook C1 right there there he goes his Rook is on the C1 Square so he plays Rook C1 attacks the Knight this Rook might come in as well that's exactly what happens right Rook E1 and um still Andrew can't find a way in hikaro is just defending everything everything is protected now if you're looking to break into this position with white probably what you should do let's say hikaro plays Bishop D7 which is what he did in the game probably at this point you kind of begin reconsidering like can I bring my pawns for for example if you play Knight D2 in this position with white who's going to protect this probably this Rook now you took pressure off of this and then I would just start I would just start going for it you know I would just start firing pawns away to try to open up the position cuz you can't really get mated here well at this point Andrew finally does it Andrew has had the entire game to rip open Black's position finally when he realized look I can't really do much else Knight takes G5 and unfortunately for Hikaru Knight takes G5 is still one of the best moves F takes G5 Queen takes G5 the position is now officially getting dire so Andrew is now only up four points of material he has two extra pawns and he has a rook for a knight so he has a two-point imbalance and two extra pawns he is still completely winning uh the only question is how much longer does this King have to survive the king's roof has been blown off the house if you walk over to G8 it's mate it's Knight F5 it's discovered attack it's this so hikaro understands he can't continue to play defense if he plays Queen E7 trying to trade Queens even with the queen trade white is completely winning but he's not going to trade the Queens he's going to move out of the way right so instead of that I told you iaru is the best in the business at making the right move at the right moment and in this position not playing passive defense anymore seeing all of this is coming Hikaru turns this into a dog fight he bites down on the mouthpiece and he sacrifices The Rook Rook takes A3 the evaluation sky rockets to a plus 10.7 but that's because stockfish doesn't understand human chess it doesn't know that there's 40 seconds on the clock it doesn't understand that it's a bullet game there's time of the tournament determining things it also doesn't know the emotions the players were experiencing before they got here if we turn this off and we just let two humans figure this out taking this is very dangerous for white it looks very dangerous because there's a mate and then there's backup and then there's the pawn and then and and then you're going to lose this and then you're going to lose some pawns and I got to tell you by the way this evaluation is down to plus 2.7 plus 2.7 I turned it off when the evaluation was + 10 and suddenly it's plus 2.7 which goes to show you this is not an easy position to navigate at all so Rook takes A3 now white has to navigate this position you can take the Rook but Andrew takes a moment here spends the most amount of time that he has spent the entire game I'm not even joking Andrew on move 29 spend 2.8 seconds he has not thought for longer than 1.5 seconds this entire game and he says you know what Hikaru doesn't have a threat so I'm going to go here and that is the top engine move Rook F3 is the threat the game is completely over there is absolutely nothing you can do so Hikaru now spends 5 Seconds of his own and he finds again as always throughout this entire freaking game the top engine move which is Knight takes D4 that stops Rook to F3 check if you play Rook F3 I take simple right so he grabs himself a pawn Andrew is now only up two points of material but what if I told you this position was plus n for white but the moves are really weird to get a plus n Advantage here you have to ignore everything and get out with your knight you have to make the B you have to remove the knight from the position that you played it because you threatened Queen F6 and then at that or queen G7 and at that point black is in a lot of trouble however the other two moves that get an advantage are Rook to C3 which what does that do and I'm not even joking Rook to E1 you could play Rook G3 as well but it's not really clear what that does well instead of all of that Andrew calculates a tactic Andrew calculates Bishop takes H7 oo Bishop takes H7 and the idea of Bishop takes H7 is after you take with the Knight I'm going to go Queen H5 check and then you're going to move the king somewhere let's say to f8 and then I'm probably just going to take the Rook so now you are getting mated soon and I'm going to be up a rook and if Queen A3 there's Knight E6 check and I'm just going to win the game you can take Rook C8 look at this E8 is made brutal so Andrew plays Bishop takes H7 and in 1.4 seconds iaru realizes that it's mate in three and as I always say the worst evaluation that you can get in chess is that of a BMW there's a Checkmate in this position and it was only made possible by hikaru's previous defensive move which was KN takes D4 he played Knight takes D4 purely out of necessity to stop Rook to F3 and by accident white who was too tentative and did not want to take this Rook to allow the queen of the pawn there white forced Hikaru to make a defensive move but it was secretly an offensive move because now the queen has access to A6 which was also made possible by Andrew Tang's sacrifice this bishop controlled that square s but by going over here hoping Kikar would take creating this attack and then taking his Rook he allowed Queen A6 but it's not Queen A6 right away it's Rook A1 check and the king is mummified with this B3 Pawn King takes A1 the queen goes to A6 and queen A2 is mate Karu was down a rook and a bishop after four turns you could argue he was down a rook and a bishop in this position for him to safeguard his King and just create the tiniest of Windows just Safeguard his King protect everything in his position defend and then Advance the Pawns in this fashion to make sure this King was always a little unpleasant defend defend defend defend the second things got dire sacrificed The Rook understanding that probably it was losing but at least there were chances and when the opponent didn't take he stopped their threats held on Hope and he ends the game one mistake 30 moves one mistake and against Hikaru it is absolutely fatal I said at the beginning of this video I understand it's bullet I understand bullet is silly but that was absolutely ridiculous that was ridiculous I don't care if it's a one minute game like he beat one of the best bullet players in the world he's 3100 I mean I I don't know what to say like it it it's so crazy how dly defends everything how nothing can be captured bullet or not that was unbelievable so that is how you play defense now get out of here
