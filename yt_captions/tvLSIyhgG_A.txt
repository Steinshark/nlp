the Nokia 7.1 is not an expensive phone 299 pounds here in the UK and likely to be at least as inexpensive in other markets and it's a phone that I would say stands out because of four key pillars so let's quickly unbox it and see what they are the first thing you'll see is the smart phone which feels immediately substantial underneath which you get the instruction manual and the separate little box which contains the USB type-c charging cable earphones and an included 18 watt fast charger first things first the build of the phone when you pick up the 7.1 for the first time it feels really just tough there is glass on both the front and the back and an aluminium trim with chrome accents running out the sides in fact even switching between my mate 20 pro and this phone the Nokia feels every bit as solid number 2 is Android 1 which is basically a guarantee from Google that you getting a secure stock and up to date version of Android literally this is the full list of included applications and I like the fact that it's bloat free I'm not someone who usually ends up using many of the first party apps that are pushed with a new device the phone is currently running Android 8.1 but there is an update to 9 coming and also because it is an Android 1 phone you're guaranteed consistent updates for at least two years then we've got the camera which is very respectable for the price and has most of the modes you'd want to see on a phone you've got Bo care pro mode slow motion as well as time-lapse there's a 12 and a 5 megapixel camera on the rear and it doesn't feel cut down in any major way the company is very proud of its HDR capabilities and from everything I've seen so far rightly so photos are really rich and is tough to complain about color contrast or lighting it's a camera that I'd say strikes quite a nice balance between an accurate representation of any scene and a photo that looks visually pleasing I was surprised with the portrait mode too even using it on my hand which is a pretty tricky subject almost all of the air looked clean and the background blurred nicely the phone also shoots stable high contrast 4k video like you see here slow motion at 240 FPS and this footage especially looks as clean as the slo-mo from most flagships and then of course like every self-respecting 2018 smartphone augmented reality stickers on the front camera maybe the most unusual feature though is the dual sight mode which places a video of you side-by-side with a video of what you're looking at and there's obviously a disparity in the quality of the front and back cameras here but at the same time it's still a cool feature to have and something that I'm not sure any device outside the Nokia phone lineup has that leaves us with number 4 the display this is a five point eight four inch full HD plus LCD panel which may not sound great but they call it pure display and here's the kicker it's HD are 10 compliant this means it meets certain criteria in terms of the brightness it can reach and an ability to show deep blacks and brilliant whites and I didn't really notice as much when scrolling through the UI but when viewing photos and videos it's pretty clear there is a not on top and a sizable chin on the bottom of the phone but it still manages to keep nearly 80% screen on the front also it can upscale standard definition video to high-definition aside from these four pillars I've talked about there is a fingerprint scanner on the back support for 400 gigabyte microSD cards and 32 or 64 gigs of internal storage and the phone is powered by the mid-range Snapdragon 636 and 3 or 4 gigabytes of RAM so that is a Nokia 7.1 and I'd be curious to know your opinion on having such a strong focus on the camera and the build quality on a device that is pretty far from flagship territory in terms of price my name is Aaron this is Misty's boss and I'll catch you in [Music]
