the People's Republic of China recently announced unspecified export controls on three dozen metals and minerals they are likely in response to the Netherlands placing export curbs on chip Production Technologies like lithography the two minerals on the list making the most headlines in the media are gallium and germanium the names might be familiar to those in the semiconductor industry in two previous videos I talked about China's dominance in rare Earth's Supply gallium and germanium are not rare Earths but they nevertheless play Vital roles in World technology this is a current event so things can still change but today let's take a look at gallium and germanium and how we use it but first I want to remind you about the newsletter sign up for updates and new analysis the full scripts of selected popular videos and more the sign up link is in the video description below I try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show germanium is a metalloid as the name implies they're not Metals but instead have metalish properties other metalloids include Boron Arsenic and silicon of China Daily starts his editorial by claiming that germanium is rarer than gold believe what you want to believe but what's that phrase that gen Z kids say now calling cap anyway I doubt the validity of this claim Wikipedia quotes both bar ballots and web elements that germanium exists in 1.8 and 1.4 parts per million in the Earth's crust gold meanwhile exists in the earth's cross at 0.0011 and 0.0031 parts per million respectively germanium metal the Pure Element goes for about one thousand five hundred dollars per kilogram more or less germanium oxides a precursor combination of metal and oxygen go for about seven hundred dollars per kilogram gold on the other hand goes for about 61 700 per kilogram as of this writing and I certainly would prefer a gold bar over a germanium one America has germanium containing ores in Alaska Washington and Tennessee same as China but ultimately it is pointless to look at Global reservoirs of germanium and where they are yet another mistake that Mr Zhang the China Daily editorial writer makes that is because germanium like gallium but we will talk about that later is not economically viable when mined on its own as I have said the issue with these elements has always been about refinement germanium is never found by itself in nature instead manifesting in Trace Amounts in ore minerals for other items like zinc copper lead ores because of this most germanium we have today comes as a byproduct of other procedures about 60 percent of the world Supply comes from zinc refineries with 20 coming via the coal fly ash from coal burning power plants and a lot of germanium is also recycled the U.S Geological Survey says that 60 of the germanium metal the U.S produces is recycled again for later use a good amount comes from decommissioned tanks anyway in the 2012 to 2016 time period China produced 80 percent of the world's germanium Supply Finland does 10 in Russia about five percent the U.S and Japan do about 2 percent America Imports more than half of its germanium Supply more than half of those Imports are from China the rest comes from Belgium Germany and the such Canada also hosts two refinement factories in British Columbia run by the Canadian mining giant Tech and they process a germanium containing zinc Alloys mined out of Alaska germanium used to be quite significant in the semiconductor industry the first transistors were made from germanium before the industry switched to Silicon in the 1960s one estimate of end user markets for germanium goes like infrared systems 30 fiber optics 20 and polymer catalysts another 20 the rest is split up between solar panels and smaller things like research for infrared systems we use germanium as an optical window and lens material since infrared rays are transparent to the element we can substitute it with zinc selenide zinc sulfide and germanium glass but that does not work as well and germanium glass obviously for fiber optics germanium oxides are essential and it is the largest use case specifically in the United States forty percent of demand germanium oxides are added to the Silicon glass as dopants to minimize signal loss as the U.S continues its 5G rollout that means more fiber optics for example Verizon bought about 12.4 million miles of fiber from 2018 to 2020. so far there are no industrially competitive Replacements people have experimented with fluorine but it is not a good replacement for the polymer Catalyst use case we use germanium in the production of pet plastic bottles we use it as a catalyst so that the pet plastic does not discolor this isn't significant in America but globally this is the single largest use case for germanium and finally solar panels we use a germanium alloy as a substrate layer and high efficiency solar panels they cost more compared to silicon-based panels which makes them more suited for satellites but that is expected to change well maybe silicon is a pretty formidable competitor as for the electronic space it is a whole amalgam of small and random stuff we use germanium to help produce the scintillator crystals for pet scanners bismuth germanium oxide or bgo did a video about that too we use a germanium substrate for some LEDs there are some mention of silicon germanium Alloys today for radio frequency applications but on the whole germanium is no longer used in semiconductors there is a relevant and recent example of a significant germanium shortage in January 2018 there was an explosion coal dust or something at one of Tech's two refineries in Canada and that caused germanium metal prices to rise 35 from 1250 to 1400 to 1720 and 1800 for half the year it I mean that's about 500 a kilogram that's not a lot and even at that price Traders felt that the germanium Market was over supplied in light of the impending repairs of the tech refinery the germanium Market on the whole is very small in 2022 the total value of the germanium consumed in America was about 39 million dollars Tech is one of the world's leading suppliers of germanium and even so it makes up less than two percent of their revenue so all in all I would expect that they're sufficient Supply to shoulder the germanium burden in the case if China decides to disallow exports which I think they won't not by itself germanium is so widely used and provided by so many different countries across the world that I think China only chose to put this onto the list because America used to make germanium transistors gallium is a post-transition metal related to indium tin and aluminum gallium is silverly blue and quite soft along with Mercury cesium and rubidium which doesn't sound like a real thing it is the only metal that takes a liquid form at room temperature it melts in your hand though you shouldn't put it into your mouth gallium is not toxic to the human body but can cause throat irritation vomiting blockages and ridicule by your peers at about 18 to 19 parts per million in the Earth's crust gallium is rarer than copper cerium or lithium but more common than germanium lead uranium and mercury and certainly way more common than gold I still would rather take the gold bar but again it's not about rareness as measured by parts per million but refinement like germanium gallium is mostly found in Trace Amounts alongside other things ores with gallium include bauxite zinc ores and coals so like germanium gallium is not commercially viable on its own so we get it as a byproduct as we process these other things we extract aluminum from bauxite using acids as part of the Bayer process after you churn through those acids several times we have something left behind called bare liquor this liquor has a high concentration of gallium don't drink it so we then process that using a variety of methods like solvent extraction or ion exchange or fractional precipitation bare liquor provides 90 of the world's raw gallium but we can also pull it out of burnt coal ash the gallium Market is split into two segments the low and high quality markets despite the name low called the gallium is still quite pure 99.99 pure high quality gallium on the other hand are more about Wafers which need Purity levels with many more nines sometimes six or seven digit places of nines they are far more valuable in this form about five hundred dollars per kilogram compared to 100 per kilogram the world leader in both is again China China produces the most aluminum in the world they also have the most coal-fired plants in the world so it makes sense that they produce the most gallium as quoted in the media China has 90 market share including 93 percent of the low quality refinement Market they produce a staggering 750 000 kilograms of low quality gallium each year Moe's high quality gallium Wafers are produced in China Japan Canada and the United States the U.S Imports all of its gallium mostly from China but France and Japan are also significant exporters there is no domestic supply of it though we could conceivably recycle scrap the world's biggest consumer of gallium is not the United States but Japan taking up forty percent of world production Mitsubishi chemical psyox and Sumitomo electric use it to produce and Export gallium compound wafers 75 percent of their raw gallium in turn comes from China unlike Germania most of the world's gallium production is for electronic usage integrated circuits and optoelectronics in 2018 in the United States integrated circuits consumed 73 percent of the whole gallium Market by volume about 10 800 kilograms of the 15 000 kilograms total opto Electronics LEDs and solar panels run a distance second there are two big compounds gallium arsenide and gallium nitride when it comes to arsenide it is more resistant to radiation so the stuff is well suited for radio frequency applications power amplifiers for mobile phones or communication units for Telecom this is a nine billion dollar market and consumes about 33 to 35 percent of the whole gallium arsenide Market now gallium nitride I did a video about this before go check that out these are critical ingredients in Power Electronics like Chargers gallium nitride and other wide band Gap semiconductors outperform traditional silicon in certain power applications because of its higher tolerance of temperatures and voltages gallium nitride power semiconductors are not as suited for large-scale higher voltage systems EVS windmills Etc silicon carbide has the edge there but they're great for smaller and medium items like medical equipment and consumer electronics I'm using a little Gan wall charger right now and love it it is so small and cute yet does better than my old massive Apple power brake gallium is a critical ingredient in opto electronics LEDs solar cells and lasers LEDs do more than just provide the light for your rooms they're Incorporated in basically every screen for notebooks smartphones and televisions we use many gallium-based compounds like aluminum gallium indium phosphide indium gallium nitride gallium arsenide gallium arsenide phosphide and gallium nitride to produce the various colors in your LEDs for instance gallium nitride is a critical ingredient for blue LEDs another growing use case is for laser diodes for commercial lidar systems laser diodes are like LEDs but with extra modifications to create a more coherent Light Beam three 3D sensing diodes made from gallium arsenide go into your iPhone 10 and other mobile phones to help face ID work we might be able to replace those with indium phosphide but indium is another one of those rare compounds too robbing Peter to pay Paul's situation as for substitutes I don't think there are good substitutes for these ingredients within the LED itself oleds can do similar jobs and are made from organic compounds but of course swapping those too isn't always feasible for systems I believe that export controls on the gallium compounds will have big effects on certain components within the opto electronic supply chain affecting the larger electronic supply chain too that being said Supply is Diversified and can be brought online wherever we make aluminum or burn coal after doing a few hours reading and reflection on this I feel that these gallium and germanium export controls are more a public relations move rather than an economically impactful one export controls might not ultimately turn into outright export bands the government is putting in the foundations for such a ban but that does not mean one is inevitable if it does then such a ban on these two minerals via the controls will ultimately end up and not much more than some delayed shipments and higher but not crazy higher commodity prices gallium and germanium are different than the rare Earths there are other places producing and refining this around the world when prices get high enough production can start up again and enter the market note that this is assuming all things being equal there are a bunch more minerals the controls which are not mentioned in this video a full and complete ban on all of these minerals at the same time can have unpredictable outcomes China knows all this of course what they're doing is making a statement that China believes that its raw materials are as important to the American silicon industry as the lithography machines are I'm starting to wonder if they are right all right everyone that's it for
