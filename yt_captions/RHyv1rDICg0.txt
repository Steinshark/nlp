[Music] it's got done with my stand up gonna head to the office now and so welcome to this day in the lives as a software engineer in London I know that most of you who are trying to learn the code really want to know what it's actually like to be a software engineer so that is the goal of this video to show you what an actual real day in life looks like as a software engineer I work for one of the big four companies in London exciting day coming up excited to bring you along foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] before the summer has gone away [Music] I'm out under a broken sky cold Sun colored with shades of white wave goodbye to last summer foreign [Music] you've never told you no one else [Music] I [Music] know summer [Music] oh thanks today it's currently oh it's almost 9 p.m but normally if you are wondering how long do I work as a software engineer almost every day I finished by five it's just great but the work itself is very chill only one meeting that I need to attend every single day which is the stand up in the morning and then the rest of the day I just keep working on tickets and learning stuff and whenever I need help I will call someone or team someone or slack someone so that is a glimpse into what a day in the life of a soft engine looks like but before we go there's one more thing I want to tell you okay so I know that most of you are watching this video don't have a job yet but you really want to become a software engineer and helping you reach that goal is the main mission of the channel what's the main problem we have as software Engineers when we are trying to look for a job I would argue that it's being able to Showcase who we actually are as developer you might be the best programmer in the world but if you can't actually show that it's kind of all useless because No One's Gonna Give You an interview for you to actually showcase your sales well I have a solution for you this is Showcase it's an extremely cool platform built specifically for developer purpose where you can find other developers to connect with but more importantly to get a job faster let me show you how you can get started by creating a profile at showcase.com you can fill out your showcase profile which is essentially like a mix of LinkedIn GitHub Twitter and a bunch of like other tools that you probably use in your life you can fill out repositories your experience your languages whereas an about section and then showcase will give you a custom domain with a link to your unique profile which you can show to employers and because you obviously also need a resume to apply a very conveniently showcase also automatically generates this for you by clicking view resume just like this and they've actually even made sure that this resume is fully optimized for like the company's automatic resume tracking software so you don't have to worry about passing all those scans it's also available in both light and dark mode depending on your preferences I'll leave my showcase profile down below in the description for my inspiration thank you for showcase for sponsoring this video I think what they're doing is exciting and I think the platform could really help you and now back to finishing my long day as a software engineer I hope you enjoyed this day in the life video if you want to see more videos like this rather than my traditional kind of how to learn the code type of videos do hit the like button because that tells me that this video was actually interesting to you I definitely do want to make more videos like this because I really enjoyed this if you would like to see a similar video except for the day when I'm working from home and what that looks like leave a comment down below and let me know this is right work from home in the comments to like tell me that I should make another one of these and if you want some motivation or you're just interested in step by step how did I actually manage to do this teaching myself to go and become 29 I recommend you watch this video right here where I go into detail about my own journey of going from completely zero and changing careers to becoming a software engineer with that I will see you next time
