louis vuitton or lvmh is one of europe's largest companies with a market capitalization of 350 billion dollars as of this writing the company's co-founder and controlling shareholder bernard arno is worth over 100 billion dollars and is the third richest man in the world lvmh's fortunes have risen with the luxury boom in asia first in japan and then china in 2021 asia including japan delivered 26.7 billion euro of revenue 60 more than the united states is 16.6 billion euro i have never owned a louis vuitton bag in my life i thought about getting one for research but who said i can afford that anyway this story has fascinated me for a while and it has nothing to do with semiconductors so let's try it in this video i want to look at how lvmh turned asia into its richest money machine but first the asian armature newsletter check out this one that followed up one of my most popular videos i felt that it was an even take on a difficult to predict subject the signup link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show the luxury goods business has been big for years during the early 20th century new technological changes allowed companies to mass produce certain items combined with brand marketing luxury experienced its industrialization moment prior to the 1970s however this was mostly an american and british phenomenon in the 1960s the united states was france's single biggest leather goods export market eating 40 market share from 1961 to 1967. following up from that was germany with 22 percent and switzerland belgium and italy with about 10 percent each the 1970s however would see japan and hong kong to a lesser extent take over the luxury goods market its emergence goes back to both economic and social factors first the japanese economy was doing extremely well fueled by a massive surge in exports japan during the 1950s and 1960s enjoyed a massive economic boom real economic expansion rates numbered nearly 10 percent each year this newfound wealth allowed japanese to purchase the staple goods they needed like rice but it also gave them disposable income to spend on other things japanese spending on clothing food and other goods increased five times over from 1948 to 1978. second socially the japanese experienced a cultural injection from the american occupation after world war ii chocolate cake t-shirts jeans chino trousers and other scandalous things that your great-grandmother probably wouldn't like japanese experience a brand new westernized lifestyle and they liked it in 1959 choichiro motoyama a high-fashion shop owner made a trip to europe and became entrance with european fashion brands like hermes gucci and charles jordan entranced motoyama relentlessly pursued these brands to let him stock his store with their goods in 1961 ferragamo allowed motoyama to purchase some goods for resale in japan then in 1962 gucci and hermes gave him permission to stock his ginza store with their product department stores soon followed motoyama's footsteps takashima mitsukoshi and cebu they drove this consumer boom exhibiting and pushing the sales of westernized clothing and luxury goods these department stores cater to the rich and upper middle class expanding globally to build sourcing networks for their next big domestic hit together with hong kong which also more than doubled its export share in the 20 years after 1960 japan presented a tantalizing opportunity for untold riches at this time louis vuitton was a fairly large but still traditional luxury brand run by descendants of its founder throughout the 1970s it started to experience growing asian sales after launching hit products like the papillon bag though while the american markets weren't too much trouble growing into asia required far more resources than many companies could muster at the time these european luxury brands needed to expand beyond their roots as small and medium-sized businesses louis vuitton was one of the first companies to make this change with the arrival of anri rakami who married into the vutan family he was appointed ceo in 1977 after making a fortune of his own in the steel business rakhami internationalized the sale system and focused on japan in the mid-1970s louis vuitton made less than 10 million euro in annual revenue by 1981 lv grew that to 50 million euro and established a wholly owned entity louis vuitton japan he also centralized louis vuitton product pricing and supply chain cutting out various middlemen and agents from the equation louis vuitton then opened a wholly owned store in ginza japan one of the first european brands to do so i think it is fair to pause a little and briefly discuss how a louis vuitton is made i don't mean a leather good but the luxury brand itself and its cachet luxury brands allow consumers to create a favorable prestigious social image these brands are not owned by everyone so purchasing a louis vuitton gives people feelings of accomplishment self-pleasure and pride at the start of louis vuitton in japan traders imported and sold louis vuitton goods from france at weird and varying prices they sold alongside official stores diluting the brand after taking control of the supply chain kyojiro hata the first president of louis vuitton japan set a single global price for every louis vuitton sold in the country hata considered an lv bag to hold value and that value was absolute rather than relative louis vuitton builds as customer relationships with massive lavish flagship stores these massive stores are placed in prime locations each such store is individualized for its particular urban location i think that's good for now let's get back to the 1980s in 1987 louis vuitton hoping to size up the company to avoid a potential hostile takeover merged with moye hennessey to create lvmh roy hennessey has started out as a champagne maker and had steadily acquired his competitors soon after the merger however the weirdness of having a leather goods and champagne business under one roof started to come out this conflict threatened rekkamir's control of the growing louis vuitton subsidiary thus the 77 year old rakhamir brought bernard arno into lvmh as a minority shareholder hoping that the younger businessman would back him in any future management kerfuffle but the two disagreed on strategy and arnaud spent hundreds of millions to purchase a controlling share ousting the ceo the story is pretty amazing but lets you move on this is asian arbitrary not euronomatory after all one of the key features of a louis vuitton is mass exclusivity and excellence producing a luxury leather good in modern days under these principles involves mixing traditional craftsmanship and modern production styles it used to take 20 to 30 craftsmen eight days to put together a louis vuitton bag then in 2005 louis vuitton commissioned mckinsey to review how it had made its products and they suggested a lean production system that pulled in raw goods as they were needed in 1997 marc jacobs joined louis vuitton as his creative director and helped revitalize the brand's image with exciting new designs that shook things up lv started producing one shots limited edition runs of specific products many of these goods are retired at the peak of their popularity for instance a 2001 louis vuitton collaboration with steven sprouse which produced some of the most iconic bags around these production ramp downs mean a lot of wasted inventory sometimes as much as 7 to 10 percent of the total acquisition if they cannot be reused by other louis vuitton goods then they are destroyed wasting hundreds of thousands of euro but it is worth it to maintain the product's principles of mass exclusivity the japanese market continued to grow for the next 20 years taking nearly 30 percent of france's leather goods exports and for lvmh itself japan accounted for a significant portion of the company's sales throughout the 1990s into the 2000s lvmh continued to invest in the japan region they hired japanese designer takeshi murakami as a consultant and opened a flagship store in omotesando tokyo in 2003 but about that same time the japanese luxury market reached a state of stagnancy japan had entered its lost decade and soon it would lose its place at the top of the asian luxury market to china the china boom started in hong kong in 1997 the city was handed back to the chinese and immigration policies with the mainland were loosened hong kong soon became an important destination for chinese shoppers looking for luxury fashion products long before the rise of cities like shanghai and beijing hong kong served as a cultural mixing zone between east and west the experiences accumulated by the luxury brands there allowed them to better understand what chinese consumers wanted the china market presented some differences from japan china did not have the same early exposure to western culture that japan did companies would have to do a lot of education about luxury goods on the ground usually in their flagship stores another big difference from the japan market as it turned out their first big wealthy consumer group were men rather than women businessmen making their first bucket of gold wanted to show off their wealth usually with a piece of louis vuitton luggage or a luxury watch back in the early 1990s china did not yet have shopping malls as hard as that might be to believe so this meant luxury brands targeted this businessman demographic in boutiques in the arcades of foreign five-star hotels the chinese luxury watch market grew extremely quickly hong kong owned retail distributors entered the mainland and dominated the market foreign watchmakers like swatch group had to enter the market through them it was not until swatch signed deals in 2000 with one of those distributors xinhu hongdae the holdings limited that the company started to experience significant sales there louis vuitton opted to take a different path for their entrance and growth within the china market their principles have meant having close control of the product and the way it's been sold without middlemen and distributors like other luxury brands at the time the first louis vuitton store opened in 1992 in what is now called the beijing peninsula hotel china's first luxury hotel the company has since then leveraged its brick-and-mortar stores and long history to build a massive market in china as the chinese people's wealth grew so did their desire to exhibit that wealth by 2004 china overtook japan as asia's largest luxury market louis vuitton that year had 28 stores in china including hong kong as luxury malls started to appear the company has carefully managed his entry into them with a preference to first own the land or the space directly in 2012 louis vuitton opened one of their biggest stores yet a four-level flagship in shanghai's plaza 66. like apple stores each louis vuitton flagship store is a unique experience it's a way for the customer to learn the brand's values and elevate its added value in other words making louis vuitton feel fancy and prestigious so that you can feel fancy and prestigious too by buying one in august 2020 that shanghai store alone moved 22 million dollars of goods while louis vuitton has also worked to engage with her chinese audience through media and digital channels their social influencer marketing is on point the company considers its stores to be the core channel of its values the sheer size of the market has attracted competitors they include the usual suspects like caring hermes and so on but one very interesting competitor is a domestic chinese one sandong lui founded in 1972 as a textile factory lui converted into its shareholder structure and grew rapidly during the 1990s their main specialty was wool and cotton spinning but eventually decided to move up the value chain in 2010 rui emerged into the public limelight when they acquired a majority stake in the 100 year old the japanese apparel maker renown owner of brands like arnold palmer rui wanted to turn the struggling company around by tapping the chinese market like honma golf and other similar stories funded with cheap money from the state-owned asset fund of the city of yunton rui continued to acquire a variety of high-class brands like british luxury manufacturer aqua scudam and the french retail group smcp for over a billion dollars they also spent lavishly on purchasing fabric sources like an australian cotton farm and the synthetic fabric maker the lycra company in 2019 for nearly two billion dollars chairman cho yafu said that in the next 10 years he wanted to build the lvmh of china a 100 billion dollar fashion group but the acquisitions led to the group racking up rather large debts and problems started to arise after the cheap money dried up a deal for swiss brand valley fell through then renowned filed for bankruptcy over unpaid debts from rui and then fell into liquidations other failures include the 200 year old gives and hawks and aqua scudam today shandong rui struggles for its life trying to shed assets and pay back its debt as it turns out building an lvmh-style conglomerate takes far longer than 10 years while the kol models and the iconic names are important louis vuitton's success in asia has been through its control of the product patient financial firepower and focus on customer experience the products are exquisitely made and you shop for them in an iconic luxurious environment the brand is now competing in china's tier 2 and tier 3 cities most of whom you've never heard of but with massive populations with rising middle class incomes the competition remains fierce but louis vuitton is the king of kings when it comes to luxury brands and it will continue to attract millions of asian consumers in the future alright everyone thanks for watching that's it for tonight subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you guys next time
