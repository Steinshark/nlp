so hello everybody I'm here with JP Matt so some of you might have seen him on my channel you might have seen discussions between him and John for Becky he also has a YouTube channel where he talks about the relationship between symbolism and emergence and pent psychism all these really fascinating things one of the greatest thing that's been going on in the past few months were those who haven't been following is that we started a symbolic world blog and JP is the main editor the chief editor of the blog he's managing all the writers and deciding which articles are going online and everything so I've been really happy to partner with him and I've been very excited about the the quality of the article that I've been coming up and in this discussion we're going to look at his ideas related to the symbolic thinking and also the two articles that he put up on the symbolic world blah [Music] this is Jonathan pezzo welcome to the symbolic world [Music] so JP to start maybe you can tell people how your experience has been we've been we started I think we launched about a month ago or maybe a bit more what has been your experience in terms of managing the blog and seeing these articles pop up from our different collaborators yeah it's been great to be able to have a correspondence have a back and forth with different symbolic thinkers so of course initially it was like sitting people up sending emails gathering people and then once of the workflow got started it's been fun I've learned a lot already some people as you said I've been writing excellent articles and it's worth mentioning that you got those people initially from the the Facebook group so I don't this the I think it's the symbolic world within their zombie invasion that's right all right that's run by our friend right Russell yes right yeah and it's been a good community to be a part of it's been cool to see the quality of the posters have been coming up and by dee dee yeah just improvements in the level of symbolic thinking that I've seen around it's crazy if I think oh let's see three years ago four years ago when you started making videos Jonathan and people were sort of interested in you but they didn't know what you were really talking about and now not only are people understanding but they can even contribute themselves so this if I look at it at the long term I find it all very exciting and then yeah alright that's really it's not it's strange cuz that's been one of the most exciting things for me is to really watch this kind of crew come up you know very fascinating obviously good intuition and a good capacity to kind of take people through the steps you know of their symbolic thinking applying it to all kinds of things that I wouldn't have thought of and also pulling in strains in terms of analogies from different traditions that I don't really know that well know people people obviously have their own baggage and their own knowledge you know their own line from which they pull their ideas and that's why I was really happy to see the first article you put up I put up the very very first article kind of introducing people and then your article came up strong right away a because I'm not really a formal philosophical thinker I I'm more intuitive more analogical I use images and stories so I'm more let's say taking it from the artistic perspective whereas you are really able to write an article which trace the line between the symbolic thinking that we're trying to develop you know the new the Platonic thinking Aristotelian thinking all the way to Thomas Aquinas and then connecting it also with new ideas of emergence so maybe you can give us a little bit of idea a little bit of an idea of your article that so that we can talk about that yeah yeah sure I can treat it part of thinking in this article to the several conversations I've had with John Ricky because it's really the course of those discussions that became obvious when when talking to him and also by reading the comments and interacting with other people who had watch the videos that you can start with a like the the bleeding edge of scientific thinking you can start with commit a sign that is starting that is trying to together the different ontological levels within science and yeah their field get from there fairly smoothly to symbolic thinking to the sort of worldview that you founded the neoplatonist for example so I can try to lay it out very quickly what has been happening is well like drink that the Renaissance progressively people tried to reduce everything down to the material level because people were able to calculate things and it was yelling more and more progress over time so people get progressively more materialistic but it's been sort of blowing up in the last few decades on if you in a few different Sciences actually and the sir I don't want to take like a very long time and spell out the different places where it drove down exactly and what are the precise solutions that people give to the different levels but the bottom line is that something that integrates all of those new yeah those new facts within science is the basic I knew picnic idea that the world is made of potential and patterns so you can see it at every level within the scientific ontology you can start just right away from from the bottom at the bottom of physics what looks like is there at people quibble about the details and there is lots of disagreements between physicists trying to interpret what this what this could all mean but a common interpretation and one that will work well when we apply to other levels of being as well is to see the ground layer of physics as just potential feel the potential from which different particles can emerge so you have the idea you can have particles that emerge from potential and then once those particles are there they will emerge also the potential that's below them they will they won't influence what other particles can can emerge they will influence the interactions between those different particles and then if you take a set of of particles you can also see how their potential for iron level atoms or molecules so of course a a molecule for instance is made of several atoms and particles and in one sense you can see the molecule as emerging from those but you can also see that the the molecule isn't forming the potential that is below it it's out of all of the things that could happen with those different particles there is a something very precise that actually occurs is the pattern of this molecule and then you can keep going up the levels of being in a a cell for instance you have tons of enzymes you have different molecules that could be doing several different things all over the place they could go the cell could eat that yourself it could fragment it could do a bunch of stuff but all it from all this potential all of the different stuff that exists at the level of the molecules within the cell what actually happens is a the emergence of a global pattern of the pattern of the cell which will then in turn inform what happens with those different molecules and then we could go I oh I are up to the human level where we see this within our own being and this has been committed especially in cognitive science as people try to study the mind that how it is that our cognition work take all of the possibilities that I have within my body within my members just even if I just take one of my members I just take my eyes and the way I look at the screen and I see you Jonathan right now I could be focusing on a myriad of different things but I will actually gather only a few most significant points in there like your eyes like maybe a your your eyebrows a bit of your mouth and so on and I will so power gather from all of this potential from all this potential that at the level of my CD the photons hitting my out my eyeballs there's tons of financial information I could focus on right there I will constrain that potential into a simpler pattern of just eyes and and eyebrows and face and so on so I take very complex information very complex potential i condense it into a higher level pattern and in turn then that I a little pattern will influence what I will do also in the future with the potential that isn't my body so out of all these things that I could say with my mouth out of all the complex interactions that you learn with my cells in my mouth or in my lungs this one I will say these very precise words so you have we started from the very layer very bottom layer of physics of just killed the potential being gutter with you saying that from those fundamental fields there emerge particles and then those particles become matter they become potential for the the atoms the atoms become potential for sales for humans and we can keep going i europe as well we can take the example of a one i really like is the church for instance or not even before go to the church we can go to it family let's see in a tradition do stick try and take your family like jonathan is the head of his family and you can see this in the way that you will gather from all the potential things that is family could you so that the different members will be doing the family so I'm going to be reading over there someone could be carving over there sometimes Jonathan will act in a way that will gather all of these potential interactions from the family and you will have them do a precise thing let's see maybe eat or maybe a go to church and so on so you'll gather this potential into one pattern of the family to D D actions the family at the ire pattern of Leslie going to church or or or eating at a certain amount of the day and so on so you have an emergence from different individuals the emergence of a a pattern the pattern of a family that goes through you Jonathan and then that falls back down into the process things that that you do so you have you can sit as emergence from the potentialities in your family of a pattern a more abstract or a ire level phenomenon and then this one from this will emanate also constraints on those individuals and you can see the same thing of it and going on in a church where the priest goes does the same things that you do in your family I'll be gathering all the people and then if you go even higher up you can see Christ doing this also with the whole of creation really he is served in the is little story that will contain and gather all of the other stories so we all had different stories in our different parishes there's all sorts of stuff going on but out of all of this potential tress gathered it all into one abstract pattern and then it's this pattern has also been unfolding throughout history in us so yeah you want to say something no I was just going to say that what definitely is fascinating is how similar and if you use terms like emergence and you talk about potentiality and the way that you did you know it I think that most physicalist will understand what you're talking about least physicalist that have been attempted to the problem of emergence but you know for anybody who is knows a little bit of classical thinking you right away recognize that a notion in Aristotle for example of matter you know and and then because when he was talking about matter he wasn't talking about matter the way we talked about it but he was talking about matter at every level on to the different potential if these yes right so potentiality and in any level on the on the hierarchy of being is is matter for the name or the identity that is above which is which is forming it yeah and we people are starting to take those are little patterns more and more seriously and that's that for a lot of people were just trying to reduce everything down to the bare minimum layer just try to reduce everything down to matter but it it it costs a bunch of problems like you couldn't really take even just biology seriously the apology supposed to be science and we can actually do real things with it but it if it was somehow reduced to to matter it was causing problems in philosophy of science for because we always use theological Tildy illogical words when talking about about biology and you need real potential for even just evolution to make sense like there has to be real potential for for genetic variation otherwise biology becomes sort of a a chimera became just an illusion and it also blows up at the human level because we do see patterns in our minds at least but it's it's really people still try some people still try to reduce the mind to something like matter and try to say or say that the mind doesn't exist but it's it's a minority position by now most people will do something that they call a non reductive physicalism or a weak emergence where it's got eyes I got exactly what I mentioned where there is potential in our body in our bodies and somehow all this potential is gathered in a special member in our head and there are higher level patterns there which you can find if you were to just look at our individual cells like the fact that Jonathan gets up in the morning and typically goes carving is it's not a matter that you'll find individual cells in your body it's a pattern that exists at the emergent level of the organization between all of your cells and in that emerging pattern somehow there is consciousness with perceptions which with choices with emotions and so on and without even having to spell out the precise relation between mind and body people will largely agree that okay but at least at least there is such a thing as like your ed mediating some out between your matter and your mind we don't have to be precise there is a there is a an invisible pattern you know even though they might try to find ways to get around talking about it or use the word information for example who is it that I heard one of the new atheist types who said that oh well at least now we now we know that basically the world is made of matter and information I was like okay mr. new platonic atheist like let's keep talking from from from that point on interesting stuff yeah and then we can link that up to symbolism because symbolism is believed the study of how you jump from those different layers of being like what are the symbols that connect levels of being together and in that article I I especially used add body symbolism that's we have been already a link to it in my explanation yeah it's the kind of symbolism I I tend to use most like and as you said it's it's a joy in the blog really that different people will tend to use different kinds of symbolism like their Eugene wheeler likes to use animals or dragons and beasts and so on there's a I think max really likes to use like space and time you'd like to use Center in periphery I like to use head and body and it's you can see st. Paul doing this where and it's it's not a it's not it's not really a surprise considering that st. Paul was both a Jew coming from a symbolic background and also really a wellness studied yeah was a Roman was the leading in Greek yeah philosophy so you can see in putting those two together when he uses the ED body symbolism to describe the relationship between not only with our individual elves with Ed's with our bodies but also the relationship between the the Father and the Sammy and also the relationship between Christ and the church hmm so it's been it's it's what I tried to lay out in in that article yeah when I like about the article especially is you you really take the time to kind of show the process and so like I I tend to work by when I'm talking about symbolism I'd I tend to work by analogy and surprise it's like I'm going to create an analogy and then you're going to be surprised to see your intuition kind of wake up but what I love about your article is that you actually show the levels it's like okay from this like just like you did now you you you really showed how the necessity of this pattern to manifest itself from the scientific sense you know in terms of atoms and molecules and bodies but then also in terms of stories in terms of your day in terms of anything which has form anything which presents itself to us as existing we'll have to participate in this pattern of emergence and well with interest I love I actually I find the word emergent to larious I tend to find it very funny because it's it really is I feel like it's this like last last ditch like fist you know saying okay okay I see this is this is real but I'm still gonna do it bottom-up like I I don't want to accept that there's also like order coming back down to form the yeah and I think that's why I like so much to not only start from let's say our bodies and then use that at body symbolism to go to the other levels being I like to also go down and see that it works even lower because something that will be very convincing to physicalist or scientific types like if I can show that the same I can think of myself when I used to be a physicalist like I could understand well how you go from let's say particles to atoms molecules to cells and if I can reuse that machinery that the physicalist uses that's it to think about the relationship between the nucleus in a cell and the organelles in the cell I can use that to have him think about himself in terms of his head in his body and then about Christ in the church like I used is no is less this she attempted to reduce everything to the physical and turned it into something that can add spiritual significance and it's I really like the example of the the nucleus in the inner cell because you know if you take the nucleus it's a it's an organ unlike the other organs in the cell like a mitochondria and all of the other stuff but it will gather all of what occurs in those different organs into himself and somehow it will turn it into meaningful information but it will say that okay well these various enzymes that are coming from this organ when the nucleus it will like have these extremely complex interactions with DNA and at the iron level you see this as an exchange of information of genetic information and you just get away from this language within just biology itself so you use this information and the cell will want to do this or do that so it will then order your guns to create this enzyme or this enzyme in response so you can see like the different parts of the different members of the cell being gathered in their head gathered in the other the nucleus yes will like race to higher level patterns and then bring it back down to incarnate in the cell and the same thing that happens in our in our bodies same thing that happens in a community in a rare instance where you air everyone has their different inducing crises their different patterns that are clear to them within the day and then they will talk with one another and they will also talk with the priest they will go to confession they will tell the tell him about the the best parts of their day or the worst part of the days and the priest will gather all of this up and then you will try to make it all fit within the story of the Incarnation so it takes all those individual stories brings it into the is story and then uses also is symbolic skills to bring it back down to the people either by talking to them by altering the prayers during Mass or by creating different prayer groups around the church and so on so you can see the same the same sort of pattern that is occurring within cells is opening is occurring within us and it's occurring within the church as well yeah and it's occurring you know if you get the idea of a leader or the idea of a king or something like that or a president you can see that having because like you said the the king or the president is just a person like he's the season of the same stuff as all the other people in his group yeah but because he has a cuz he has he's been anointed or he has a crown or he's been chosen it doesn't matter which word you use then he ends up moving above gathering the will of the people into himself but also he also like you said in forming the the will of the people to a certain extent it's a managing and doing all those words that we use so you can see that like the idea that a cell and a country has the same structure is something which which on the one hand can in a way I think maybe soothe the physicalist to a certain extent because we're saying this is it like this is this not magical fairies in the way that you think about it it's not although fairies are part of it too but we'll get the fairies in angels later but for now you can understand that when we talk about these spiritual truths which inform reality it's it's the same thing happening the sell that's happening in the city and so it can help you understand what we're talking about when we talk about these things yeah and I remember I in a conversation I had with John and also America when we brought up the idea of okay so because the sort of metaphysics had just been putting forth is like John likes this he thinks this works quite well and we uh we asked him whether within committed science this was sort of widespread attitude or if it if other people were more physically sztyc and he said that it's it's sort of shifting now and for now a lot of people are still like reductionist physicalist but he says that there's also I don't really the statistics but like most people who don't come from just a technical background like people were background let's say linguistics or paucity will acknowledge the sort of ontology that I just laid out so we didn't even just science like the fact that they're this sort of metaphysics is soothing to them I think we can see I the fact that like John and a bunch of other cognitive scientists are willing to endorse it hmm yeah that's great and so the next thing I wanted to talk about is really your last your last article that you put up which is the symbolism of cell tower burning just such a great it's such a great timely article and you're able to really bring break down the the question of symbolism and its relationship to intuition that people have and how sometimes let's say you don't necessarily the causality that people think is there doesn't necessarily have to be there for the pattern to be true or the pattern to be real so maybe you can give us a sense people can check out the article for sure and I think you also have a version of it that you're reading online so people can check it out but you can give us a little hint of what you're talking about and it'll be a good it'll be a good example to kind of play through the different levels that you talked about in terms of cells and everything else yeah I think it's a good thing simplification for the like that we with star symbolism and that's we're not very good at it but if we if we practice it let's say the other blog or we are going to church or if we practice and listen there's a bunch of stuff there's a bunch of patterns that are much more obvious to us for instance I took the case of people bearing down cellphone towers because coming from me yeah from they just explain it to people that what happened during the pandemic so you don't know if you're living in a cave of some so I'm sorry for it first during the pandemic they were because there were certain people who were saying that the virus was caused or made worse by cell technology 5g technology then they started to see this this kind of cell technology as like a mass conspiracy to control people and to to also kill people off you know like to reduce work populate or whatever like all the conspiracy that came around it and some people took it so far that they went out and actually destroyed some cell towers and so there you go now you can explain the pattern that manifested itself yeah because what happens is I think people grasp don't like that they are the symbolic intuition for real patterns that occur at the psychological and also sociological scale but because we're not very good at detecting those anymore or treating them as psychological and social patterns people try to bring down onto the material matter metric level and that's what caused issues so I can see what or I think the the the valid patterns that occur at the psychological and social levels so you can even just start biologically like the fact that cell phone towers allow people to communicate easily by communicating easily with one another I think internet all over the place you can travel easily it's easy to do business with other people so this inter communication within the world allowed people to like physically move easily and to spread pathogens so at the biological level there's at the zoo yeah the social level there's already something there relating cell phone towers and the virus at a psychological level there is the fact that there's tons of stuff that had to do with technology and how it made us more inclined for the all of the panic that we saw that the fact that we were we had so much so much enjoyment possible at her fingertips like via our cell phones made people quite willing to just Punk her down and stay in their homes to be very obedient to the government the government was also much more able to monitor what was going on because technology allows us to communicate so easily like the research can can spread the like what doctors in China can influence what we do here and then also the government can propagate information quickly we can tell people okay now yet follow this law in useful data and so on you can even track people just with our cell phones to see if they obey or not those regulations and then you can also add at the communal level as well that we saw a huge social media panic and this just adds fuel to the fire where people feel really trapped by cell phone towers like so you can see that there are real patterns from the cell phone towers that occur at the social and cycle and psychological levels yeah because such a huge part of the covert thing and the lockdown was based on media and information and like you said our willingness to accept the lockdown because I mean can you imagine just 30 years ago maybe you're you know 40 years ago the idea that the government could have imposed this so easily on everybody would have just been impossible you know the internet gave it made it possible for people to work from home made all these things possible which made us accept the the statement of the pandemic and you know and the panic all of this together and so this is that so the idea that that cell technology was part and all even in a way a cause of the situation was absolutely true there's no way to deny it yeah it's really so if we can see the cell tower as a is symbol because it's a physical artifact it exists at the physical level it's a real power made of metal and plastics is one but it mediates also with the psychological and social levels because it participated in the social patterns that fuel the COBE crisis so I think conspiracy theorists to blame the cell phone towers for the virus or at least for part of the virus will Intuit this tendency ballad intuition to start up but rather than seeing this as a properly social and psychological phenomenon to which you need to provide a psychological and social answer they casted they cast it down to the physical layer because that's what we tend to do as we discuss it's only been in the last few decades that we've been starting to rediscover like neoplatonism and those different theories that incorporate potential and form at different layers of being so it's not surprising that people would cast down the social problems that they into it from this Nestle towers and that they would cast them down into the language of physics but this you can see that okay and you can control yeah you can contrast this with what happened let's say to the Israelites because they would do some things something similar from time to time it would notice that they there were something breaking out their social and psychological patterns like maybe the worshiping a golden caffeine is causing all kinds of trouble so it would get rid of that Golden Cap but it's not the whole thing did we do it wouldn't just like burn the cap down and then hope that because they burn they don't physically then all of a sudden things will be okay they also reinstated other practices yeah gathered themselves together so it's not just a physical problem it's a it's a social problem you need a social solution for it but I think this is the step that the the arsonists don't quite yet things won't just get better because you burn down this earth hours yeah exactly and in terms of the imagery it's very powerful because in Scripture there's a there the they call the ash eras or the sacred poles and so the there's several moments in scripture where the Israelites kind of give in to building these sacred poles that are dedicated to other gods and and then they destroy the sacred poles so there's something about the actual visual you talk about this in your article as well the actual fact that cell towers appear above us and you see them as these towering things is also part of the problem or part of the reason why they end up attracting attention in terms of the source of the because they're their visible totem yeah all of technology of all of media of all of this kind of strange connectedness that we have through through the internet and also all the problems that come with that all the social diseases that are related to to to the Internet and to this this type of connection and so like you said in a kind of weird intuitive way there's something that is intuitively I'm not we're not at all saying you should come or say that we could understand the fact that people would have that intuition that okay here's here's an actual image of something which is causing the problem in our society yeah yeah I think well we can even see I sort of entered at it in my article what the the actual solution would be to this as a as it's psychological and social problem and not as a material problem and one way of seeing it is that by casting the problem in terms of physics they're not able to see all of the other sides of the social patterns and they're not able to address the problem correctly so no cell towers also have a good social effects like the fact that they can allow people to communicate from overseas the fact that they allow us to communicate now for instance the fact that it it did allow my experts to exchange information quickly there's good side - this this phenomenon and the the real solution I think would have been obvious in societies where symbolism was better practice like it if you just consider the fact that there are cities now where the cellphone tower is higher than the highest church tower right yeah and of course like cell phone towers like they get big they defragment people physically they there is symbol of the technology that fragments us physically physically isolate us just like that just like the people like the virus than they're doing yeah and it's the opposite from what the church used to do like the ice point in villages that used to be the church where people would gather they would worship together and it closed once so people would commune so you can see we went from a place where community we would gather around the highest point which was the church now the highest point is the cell phone tower in the premises and the solution is to well it's a a social solution at the social level what we need to do is we need to like build communities that will built up that will build churches I go higher than our cellphone towers like that the social solution but there is no like quick intervention you can do it's like to do this you need to convert people slowly and it's much more tempting to just burn down the cell towers and hope for the best but of course it doesn't work yeah because you have nothing to replace it with yeah and it's interesting because on the flip side of this like on the flip side of people who want to destroy the cell towers right when covent started to hit and i remember here in Quebec which used to be the most Catholic place in the world but is now you know one of the probably the most atheistic places in the world on the radio unlike hit radio okay sequa like the most hit radio like that exists they spent they would they kept going over and over how people should not go to church and how people who go to church should not use holy water that you shouldn't go to communion all of these things were vectors of transmission and they were talking solely about that on the radio and I was like who are you talking to who are you talking to cuz no one does that like none of the people listening to your radio station go to church or very few of them and so I was like this is interesting they're seeing that the church is a place of communion and is it still like late mythologically in their background thinking yeah you know the place of communion and so that's the first place they attacked and when they wanted to to socially separate so it was just a very fascinating thing to notice yeah yeah that's interesting and to try to bring it back to the blog I think it's those sort of patterns that would have been more obvious in more traditional societies it's something that what we're trying to like faster on the blog and in this online community in general where we're trying to practice seeing the world this way we're trying to practice seeing the different symbols that all the different players have realty together so that when something weird occurs like that when social patterns emerge that we can actually see them and we don't just burn down the cell towers or like fuel the the problem some other way that we can actually diagnose the issue and do something positive maybe under it and a wavy little hiccup that I'll notice I'll I'll mention just because I think it's it's worth mentioning that people should go on jp's video about the cell tower burning and notice that there is a comment by Matt Apuzzo by my brother there and and he reminds us that that even though we can see all the symbolism in terms of story in terms of social in terms of psychological that it doesn't mean that there isn't a hint of material causality there and so you can go check that out for yourself and there's strange things happening in the scientific world as well so go check that out I'm really excited to see because I noticed that the next article coming out is something called the dragon of Minneapolis yeah I'm really looking forward to seeing how some of the people on the blog are going to interpret what's happening around us right now yeah it's a good article I read it and I'll probably post it on next Tuesday so nice so making 40 cents the next article I think yeah I'm trying to figure out how much I'm gonna get into what's going on right now I might do a video on feet washing or something like that to try to address some of the questions of the things we've been seeing going on but seems like the world is is just spiraling into into madness faster and faster the clown world was funny for a while it just does it it's not as funny anymore it's looking more like a like a diabolical clown with pointy teeth yeah it's just scary now and there's too many patterns like to untangle it's difficult like it's Peters going very fast too it's just because everything's speeding up it's very difficult to kind of keep up it's like but we're still taking we're still like breathing in from kovat and now mass riots everywhere in the US and everything and soon an election in the u.s. is going to take over in terms of patterns because we're going to see take sides and then we're gonna see some interesting pattern there as well but yeah so everybody buckle up for the rest of 20 tonight we're not done yeah we're gonna in symbolism for this because there's too many like monsters that are sort of mingling and interacting one others it makes it better to diagnose like there are definitely zombies in those riots but there's also like other kinds of monsters and I I haven't wrapped my head around it yet like it's I don't know if I have time to do it before it's even over oh yeah it's it's and it's interesting stuff so so yeah so guys go go to the blog follow the blog if you are someone who is really good at is symbolic thinking come on the Facebook group get your chops train your train yourself to think symbolically so that we can have a little army of symbolic thinkers to to let's say hold out the madness as the world spirals out of control alright everybody thanks for attention and JP thanks for your time as usual I it's a good conversation thank Jonathan all right I hope you enjoyed this discussion on emergence and the symbolism of cell tower burning as you heard here in this interview there's a lot of stuff going on around the symbolic world around this symbolic thinking we have the website and the articles and the blog that we talked about with JP all of these videos are also being put out as a podcast called the symbolic world there is also a clips channel which is constantly putting out material by subject and so if you always if you ever wondered what I think about this or that that is definitely the place to look they're doing a great job and of course if you enjoy what we're doing we are doing this completely through the help of people who are financing us who are funding us who are supporting us and so go check out my web site at the support page and see the different wage within which you can support this adventure for those who support the podcast I have a monthly free video and this month it will probably be a video on the symbolism of foot washing and it will be related to kind of the some of the madness that we've seen around the world in the past few weeks so thanks your support everybody and I will see you very soon
