I'm about to spend fifty thousand dollars yep fifty thousand dollars buying the most expensive Tech on the internet to try and find out what true luxury feels like all right so what I think I want to do is to find the most extreme versions of existing Tech that you probably will be familiar with so for example a normal Bluetooth speaker would be something like this twenty seven dollars but this is the most expensive bluetooth speaker on the planet I think I've seen a couple of YouTubers test the entry-level model of this type of speaker but this is the nearly four thousand dollars Opera De Paris version whatever that means okay so if someone had unlimited budget what tech would they buy oh they would get things customized custom Nintendo switch oh my gosh retro OG Nintendo theme and that looks absolutely stunning it's kind of borrowing elements from Nintendo's original NES console what does it look so good here is there a custom PS5 there's loads of custom control is it there's one called the scuff reflex Pro which apparently has unparalleled customizations you've got 15 different base colors or you can go designer the cherry blossom is actually kind of nice but it's all about the gold wow you can customize joystick height the color of the Rings around each joystick that is one expensive controller my goodness we need to get a luxury PlayStation 5 faceplate to match oh this works it's 50 but it looks fancy it's also got cooling vents too so I guess it's kind of a feature ad oh and this is like the same thing but with extra rgbs built inside of it this is how you get my attention so really we're already like 70 of the way there to building the ultimate luxury gaming setup we need a really good screen to top the whole thing off so LG's Flagship TV right now the best of the best you can get is their 97 inch G2 Gallery Edition 25 000 pounds technically that is in budget but it's not what I want to be spending the budget on like TV prices tend to drop very quickly I have just had an idea okay so my parents have a cinema room in their basement and it's currently being powered by a 1 000 or so projector if we swap that out for the most ridiculous projector that they would never even consider buying on their own that would actually be such a good gift wow I mean at the very very highest end projectors are not cheaper than TVs but you're not constrained to a fixed science like it seems like a lot of these super super high-end projectors they can do like 200 inches no problem it's got something for 500 you've got some like twelve hundred dollars I mean all of the guides Point towards this one projector being the one to go for that's so much to spend on one thing that's literally like buying a car all right fine let's do it you only get one set of parents so I'll buy this I'll set this up in my parents basement and I will surprise them with it that's gonna be insane I also need the most expensive chair to sit on okay this is the kind of thing I'm looking for I want something that doesn't have like a hard skeleton to it but you can just kind of sink into so what's the highest ended version of that we can get behold the squidger I think we found the one that really appeals to me the squid is a thousand dollars I wonder if there's people on Etsy who specifically make like Elite level keyboards because the DIY keyboard scene is actually quite massive and you can go to the absolute extreme when making a keyboard a wooden keyboard made for people who love the feel of typing on natural words what about the mouse so apparently this is basically as high end as you can get the Razer Viper mini signature edition it doesn't look like like anything spectacular let's just trust what the internet says and try it how much do you think a desk lamp should cost so it turns out Dyson makes a desk light and it is 700 it says it transforms your space how though it's a light we all know there's only one way to find out okay so just putting the setup and stuff aside what about the general luxury lifestyle oh we could try and find the best phone case I feel like a lot of luxury accessories will just basically slap 24 karat gold onto it and just call it a day but this is actually Tastefully done it's something I'd probably use can we give our MacBook the same treatment okay this is nice it looks like a combination of both leather and gold slightly scared to search this but what about luxury men's clothing what is that that's not a cardigan all the trainers is interesting because you can get shoes now that lace themselves you can get shoes that wirelessly charge oh wow these are like the kind of shoes that I would have dreamed of wearing as a kid these are over a thousand even looks like something from this planet I already can't tell if these are gonna look incredible or terrible when I put them on app enabled tint changing smart sunglasses with built-in audio I know what would finish this off perfectly let's get a few really high-end kitchen gadgets there is a waffle maker here for 500. it's best knives on the on the planet 2500 for three knives we've got 33 layers of metal apparently it better be able to cut for us for that price what is this so I'm on a shoe site called zelafeld and they're saying they're gonna 3D print your shoes specifically for your feet so every single pair of trainers is completely One of a Kind okay so you pick like a base design select a size how wide and how snug you want the fit so let's go medium okay I order placed let's fast forward a month and uh see what arrives there is 50 000 worth of tech on this bed right now this is about to be every Tech Lover's fantasy so let's go from least expensive to most expensive the only thing is I don't know what time my dad is going to come today so I need to make sure this projector is at least somewhat ready so that we can surprise him with it alright so now that's ready let's start with the accessories it's 80 worth it to bling out your PS5 so from a distance everything looks fantastic the LEDs the gold it's incredibly Lush and based on the Aesthetics alone I think if you ask most people how much this glow up costs they probably say at least eighty dollars but then when you actually touch it it is all plastic everywhere and the listing is kind of misleading about the fact that you then have trailing cables out the back to Power the LEDs we'll keep building on this gaming room as we have small Tech oh wow okay believe all of this is for a smartphone case you can be inner boxes made of wood and oh my gosh this is actually kind of excessive boy does it make an impression oh this is nice it's got a really soft felt like interior and a really smooth but at the same time grippy leather-like finish on the back it's just Tastefully done I do feel like the beauty may only be Skin Deep it's creepier than my knees I love how that's an insult to the case so for 120 then the laptop skin comes in a bag I mean it looks fantastic at a distance but up close this is just flimsy plastic it's definitely one of the major risks when you're specifically shopping for luxury things it's just really hard to tell when something's actually being built for the price being charged or if someone's just seizing the opportunity to repurpose a three dollar case from China this is not great I mean the plus side is from a distance it's nice it looks like leather and gold and it's fancy and it does cover up all the fingerprints and the smudges that I had previously on my laptop but I mean it doesn't fit properly like it's kind of coming off at the bottom here and also the extra weight the case adds you can tell that Apple hasn't really factored it into their design because Beyond a certain point it just closes by itself now the Razer Viper mini which I think is actually the most I've ever spent on a mouse wait what the this is a nicer box than my engagement ring came the mouse itself though it doesn't even feel real it's like lighter than air in the way it normally works when you pay more for expensive gadgets is you get more stuff it's heavier it's weightier it's more premium but this is kind of the opposite to make this mouse as light as it possibly can be they've actually gone to the extent of Shaving away every bit of material that they think doesn't need to be there which I suppose if the performance is the same is a good thing and the same as airflow to my hands and then as far as the material is concerned there's no heavy stainless steel at all here this is just a super lightweight magnesium alloy and then the other Crown Jewel for this mouse is something they call hyper pulling so most wireless devices like mice they'll report their location to the computer about a thousand times per second this thing can do thousand times oh damn this thing Glides you normally feel just this tiny hint of latency between when you move your hand and when the cursor moves but here there is nothing actually made the entire scroll wheel Hollow it's also only just dawn on me the benefit of it being so light is there's like no resistance from the table look at this oh you don't just hear me say the word Mouse I know we need to stop saying the m word this is good progress for our office Center but uh we'll be back now I am a bit of a sucker for sunglasses I'm that guy who on holiday actually will buy one of those three dollar Roy band glasses someone sells you on the beach but see these are not three dollar glasses these are not 30 glasses these are 300 sunglasses but what's really exciting about these is that they're not just expensive because they have a fancy brand name attached to them they're expensive because they have built-in audio as well as self-tinting electrochromic lenses oh wow so you can see Tiny slits for the speakers on either side I'm assuming they're going to fire directly into my ears ah it's pretty tinny sounding you can tell it's coming from a really tiny little speaker unit and there's like no bass at all I mean it is so cool that a pair of sunglasses even come with the option but I wouldn't use it there's also a lot of sound leakage like I can still hear it even when I take them off and hold them like this but the audio is kind of a secondary feature the main thing these things advertise themselves as is self-tinting so there's an application obviously you can go into your sunglasses settings and adjust your tint level can you see my eyes right now wow so I'm completely Incognito this is a proper like men in black out of a movie gadgets you've got fully light fully dark then you can also create presets if you want a very specific setting this is a slightly strange concept though I'm just imagining being in a conversation with someone and the sun suddenly comes out and you're there like trying to fiddle with your sunglass tint level plus now you've just got one extra gadget's battery to worry about I am actually really confused right now so the way this company is described to work is you order they then email you a link to install the app which is actually 3D scan your feet so that they can print the shoe to match those Dimensions but I never got that email I did just find out there's a lot of data of my feet on the internet right now surely not I just kept waiting and waiting for an email from them until eventually I got one that said package shift so I am genuinely confused as to what exactly has arrived I know that if you're really into sneakers shoes can quite easily get more expensive than the 350 this cost but it's not cheap my current experience with most things that are 3D printed is that they are pretty rough around the edges oh my God what is this it doesn't look great and you know what you can see all the classic Hallmarks of a 3D printed product like all the kind of classic loose threads that come with it it's so intricate wow but then on the other foot I guess it just would have been nice to have some color variety or like some textural variation but I guess the most important thing is how do they feel this is actually kind of surprising that feels fantastic now I'm even more confused did they actually 3D print these to my feet without me giving them my feet details this is the first time I felt a glove-like feeling for my toes do you know what I'm keeping these they actually kind of feel like high definition Crocs all right now we're getting to the majorly gadgets why on Earth is this PS5 controller the same price as a PS5 so at least part of it is definitely the Aesthetics and the feel of it and on that front I gotta say I am a massive fan if it starters it's got this insane like density to it it really feels like a mean piece of work you've got the decals all over which I don't know if I think it's an improvement but it's definitely fancy oh these are basically instant reflex triggers which are designed to be kind of like Mouse clicks like a tiny bit of pressure and then it's activated as opposed to the standard PS5 controllers very slow soft mushy kind of address oh and also listen to this the face buttons are basically silent whereas a standard PS5 controller has this tiny little bit of rattle with each of them right time to see if 400 actually makes me a better player versus Street Fighter neither of us have played this game so you say yeah it's brand new race just come out you've only had two days it's a question for you how do you feel holding the normal controller it's better than the PS4 obviously but I don't feel like I've gotten Dimensions so I'm hoping my extra clicking short travel buttons are going to help me out with the response time here oh no he's smashing it so so far luxury is not buying any skill one of the main Feats of this controller is meant to be the fact that the buttons are kind of silent but surprising the heat of a battle that's not really something that's gonna matter to me but I have to say one thing though this does feel very premium so there's very little rattle in the my dad you do sound more professionally right okay the takeaway here is that it requires a lot of skill to be able to properly take advantage of a controller of this level for an average player like me no point now when gadgets get expensive they tend to go in either one of two directions either the luxury route which focuses on materials and Aesthetics or the functional route which focuses on just being able to do more and the latter is firmly where this 500 waffle maker fits in compare that now to a 10 waffle maker which is basically a slab of metal and comes pre-baked with grease on the handle all right I've put together what looks like waffle mix um I can't speak to the flavor of it yet but both are getting the same treatment all right so the 10 experience is you open it up and you pour your waffle mix inside this has actually got self-raising flour in so I've got to be very careful not to overfill it and we close it up seal it via the handle that feels not secure and then you just hold it over the fire I mean one thing that you also definitely don't get with the 10 maker is any indication at all of progress so really to use something like this properly you'd actually need more skill than to use something like this even though this looks like the more Pro piece of equipment okay it's steaming this is big reveal time hey not bad at all it's a little bit Hollow on one side oh there's also a big difference between how much it's cooked on one side versus the other which is kind of inevitable given how manual this is but what matters is and a nice crisp crunch sort of pretty crispy on the Outside Pretty fluffy on the inside that is a strong eight out of 10 waffle okay this has the potential to provide a lot of Joy right so you flip the switch and it's going to let me know there when it's ready for me to pour the mixture in it's also kind of cool that it comes with a drip tray like if I'd overfilled this one it would have just gone straight into the fire oh it's actually taking ages a 10 waffle maker would have made a family of waffles by now I'm hoping now that it says it's ready to receive it's uh gonna be a quick process through that that's why I'm watching it fill all these holes oh thank God for the drip tray look at the back oh that's unfortunate well for steamy action here I'm assuming this thing's actually gonna oh is that the waffle growing up for help I'm so conflicted because it smells incredible and it's farting out the back it's actually water dripping out the back when you go for a two sometimes until one comes out oh okay I mean the inside looks a lot a lot better than the outside it looks so intricately designed clearly 500 UPS the presentation factor it's fairly evenly cooked on both sides but not exactly is it going to taste better can you tell I'm hungry um whoa look at that can you see the difference in the texture of the crunchy base and the really soft interior I was skeptical I have to say but every single one of these pockets is a joyous culinary experience and aside from having the potential to be a little Messier it at least is a very idiot-proof experience a nice homemade blue waffle custom switch there's no custom packaging for this but that makes sense I mean whoever's made this has bought a new Switch customized it and placed it back in the box it came in I mean the key thing that I'm curious about here is the quality of the Finish because with all this stuff on Etsy you have this entire Spectrum all the way from yeah this was clearly made using someone's 80 3D printer that sits in the cupboard Under the Stairs all the way to genuinely spectacular pieces of Art and I'm not gonna lie this is definitely falling closer towards the latter part of it the custom buttons they're not made of metal like they look they are still plastic but they feel fantastic I just love the way that two-tone two texture finishes look like this I think the contrast between the matte finish on the controllers in the back of the switch and the glossy finish with all the buttons it's so striking and I think I appreciate it more now knowing how hard it actually is to customize the switch as you'll know if you saw that YouTube short I posted a couple of weeks ago but I guess the thing that actually completes the look is this dock over here oh that's so smart looking you can tell that someone's really thought about how best to apply the NES theme to The Switch this was not just an overnight job it's always so cool seeing the switch interface with these massive switch joy-cons it's actually really cool they've even customized the inner trigger buttons who uses those I thought it'd be fitting to play NES Mario since it is an NES switch this is old old school the environment almost looks hand-drawn and you can kind of see it being rendered into the scene as you're moving towards it okay the game kind of sucks nowadays but it's the feeling it's the the memories that it's bringing back that to be fair this custom controller is doing a really good job of facilitating holy moly this is the most intense looking desk lamp I've seen in my life but to be honest it's also still not very clear what makes it so special and so valuable I mean this is an imposing piece of Kit wow okay so I guess perk number one is that it's fully articulating any angle like any angle you want you can get here and part of what makes it special is they built a custom heat pipe that sits above it like this to keep it cool because when LEDs over heaps that's what often causes the fading and the discoloration it can sink its level of brightness to the sun cycle that's actually a major health perk so it's got glare protection it's got anti-flicker and it lasts 60 years it's gonna outlive me and my creaky knees so I guess Dyson's angle with this is yes it's 600 but considering you might well spend 90 to the rest of your life indoors this one light could carry you through the entirety of that it's actually kind of sad to think about oh that's so cool so when you bring it over this chamber here it becomes a diffused NightLight I guess it's satisfying you've got touch sensitive color temperature and brightness controls at the top and when you get to this tier of light it's not even about like does this light my desk enough for me to work it's all about the quality of the Shadows it leaves and the evenness of the illumination all of which this ticks the boxes for the only thing it doesn't do is uh disco mode you could actually potentially use this yeah as a video because every other kind of detection don't shine this in your eyes there's one top tip uh so this is the package for our 700 keyboard it just says real clutch on the front oh okay okay the actual box is kind of on the inside this is proper wood much more what I was hoping for for the money okay uh slight Vibe clash with all the hyper futuristic modern looking Tech on the table but this is an item that's definitely going for The bespoke Classy ascetic now I gotta say very first impressions it's not immediately clear to me why this is 70 times the price of a normal keyboard I mean it is made of natural wood it's hand sanded it's coated in ecological oil actually maybe the best test it's kind of a brand new scent actually wait a sec 10.20 per key there's a certain kind of person this is clearly made for someone who really appreciates the the craftsmanship of it for me I'm kind of looking at some of these keys and they're slightly faded layouts and thinking kind of wish a machine had done this it was actually kind of like something my dad would try and make the typing experience is I mean it's good it's a mechanical keyboard it uses Cherry MX Brown switches it's quite fitting actually but for me personally this whole thing being made out of wood doesn't really add anything if anything it's kind of like a rougher texture than I'm used to you should I'll probably plug this in whoa that's so cool seeing like really rustic old-school wood mixed in with modern RGB lighting it's magnetic to elevate the keyboard that is such a good feature I'm quite Keen about it hey I am pumped right now the next time we're back in this room we are testing the single Gadget that I've been the most excited for it's gonna get hot in here so probably take off this ridiculous jacket this is what I've been waiting for you know what I can't wait for is that first jump into the seat I'm expecting the most cushioned Landing I've ever had that's a thousand dollar smell right there I just love the fact that they call this chair the squidger it's really had better be cushioned oh can you imagine if that was actually like a hard-backed it's got the perfect balance of being insanely squidgy at every point and yet it does have some sort of supportive structure to the point where like every single angle feels fantastic maybe not this one oh wow I'm not used to getting expensive clothes and shoes like this I mean half my wardrobe is just neem t-shirts so this is a quite the shock wow there's so many papers here and also it just smells like the inside of an expensive clothing store I'm sure they've sprayed it with something that's even wilder than I thought it could have been it's such a beast but it doesn't even really look like a shoe so heavy as well this isn't going to be comfortable right they literally look like they can knock someone out and the lace is don't exactly feel amazing but the material of the shoe itself absolutely does it feels like I've just given my feet an extra exoskeleton okay whoa I feel so tall he's actually checking out my crops because the shoes are curved you can actually tilt so far forward what could possibly be the purpose of it let's see if it makes me run faster three two one laughs whoa oh dear ah it's so weird because your feet aren't used to rotating like that guess the takeaway is don't use them for Remy I mean have you ever seen knives presented like this I feel kind of embarrassed now about the five dollar knife I've been using to unbox all of this stuff oh love seeing a massive caution label on stuff I'm just about to test and then a letter which says that the gift of a knife usually represents the severing of a friendship unless it is gifted with a coin hence this I guess okay so there's some anti-corrosion paper around each blade let's go with the biggest one time to suit up gotta say knowing how ridiculously sharp this knife is so when I got this knife I was talking to someone about it who knows a lot about knives and he just said try cutting a piece of paper with it holy cow I'm just thinking like imagine if you accidentally cut yourself with this is that what it would do to your arm I mean don't get me wrong this is a stupid amount of money to spend on a knife but I've never seen that before and you know this pattern that you see here that's not a printed design that is individual layers of Steel forged on top of each other I kind of want to see what it does for these apples but not on this surface so I actually bought a chopping board specifically for this video that I've been really excited to try it's how you know that I'm reaching a certain age so it's forged using a combination of wood and epoxy resin which kind of makes it look like land and sea and you can see the light glowing in the background this is the kind of tool where you start to realize the limiting factor is your own skill I feel like I could cut this apple cell by itself so this is the sharpest normal knife that I own okay it doesn't really hold up when you try to go for millimeter thickness that right there is about the thinnest slice I can make you kind of think you've reached the limit of how thin something can be and I am very clearly nowhere near the limits of this that's ridiculous I imagine the amount of pressure required to actually slice the rest of it is very very minor and we are cutting these apples kind of like we're cutting the Gap in subscribers between us and apple and once we've closed it we will build the most ridiculous iPhone you've ever seen so a sub to the channel would be very nice The dvla Phantom of the Opera Edition man this thing literally looks like it was designed for a king and the package is so heavy I can't believe it so there's a smaller box first which has what looks like the remote inside of it this is pretty Swish and then the speaker itself okay cut down here cut down here it looks like an alien life form with a shower cap on it I can't get over the sheer density of the thing I can barely hold it to say that I am excited to experience this is understatement of the year [Music] sound that comes out of it is disappointing then I guess I'll just use it as a drum kit to give you an idea I actually a while ago managed to get a fake version of one of these from wish.com this speaker right here has 10 watts of power the actual Opera do Paris Phantom is 1100 not to mention that it has 1400 custom parts made of aluminum titanium and even real gold all firing together to create what they're describing as inclusive sound whatever that means oh the gold panels actually come off so I guess you could mix and match them for three thousand dollars a pop you can actually see the gold leaf blending into the back it's connect up to the fake and see how that sounds okay there's a solid white light it kind of feel like we'll know when we're on I was tantalizing [Music] [Music] a playlist called ultra bass boosted [Music] I've just had my dad come the door he's upstairs he's gonna be down any minute now I need to quickly Blitz clean this place so recently I become a bit of a security nerd I've watched how tons of other YouTubers who've followed all the recommended security steps have still managed to get their accounts completely hacked there are entire Forums on the dark web whose entire purpose is to just buy and sell user data everything from addresses to credit card information to passwords and sometimes they don't even need passwords a hacker can send you a link via a text and if you so much as clicked that link can download a file silently that gives them access to your session ID which means that they can basically continue to browse the internet as if they were you but Surf Shop VPN can at least make it harder for them surf shock sits between you and your internet service provider scrambling your internet traffic to keep you Anonymous it's not a one-click solution that instantly solves all your security problems but it is a quite inexpensive very simple solution that will drastically strengthen your security it comes with a proper antivirus a private ad-free internet search as well as surfshark alert which lets you know if your data has been compromised and using the code boss you end up at less than three dollars a month with an extra three months for free for unlimited users and a money back guarantee that is literally like watching the 150 inch TV dad I would like to welcome you to your new projector so we had one here we had one here but you've probably never seen one like this it's a monster it's a 4K to 8K projector which shoots multiple 4K images next to each other merges them into an 8K image that's incredible oh my God look at that and it's using an 18 part Glass lens for the clarity which is ridiculous so you want to the cinema room oh it's too much better it's okay yeah and we've got your nice little chair actually try it it's um well yeah see what you think of it yeah so it converts HD to 4K 4K to 8K and the darker it gets the better the picture is going to be I love how your head's just in the wave successful plan
