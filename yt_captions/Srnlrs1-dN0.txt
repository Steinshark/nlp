hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about how to do a burnout but not only how to do a Burnout we're also going to check out the actual effects of performing a burnout on the rear tires of my Honda s2000. So first of all what is the point of a burnout and to understand this it's kind of easy to look at extremes of tire temperatures so if you have a really cold tire it's going to be really hard and as a result of being hard it's frictional coefficient with the ground is going to be low and so it's not going to have much grip. Now if you heat up that tire it's going to be warmer and it's going to be softer and it's going to comply with that road surface better and as a result have more grip. So in drag racing you know the launch is the most critical part and so if you can warm those tires up before that initial launch and make sure you get a good start then you're going to have you no more grip in order to accelerate quicker rather than just spin up the tires or have a lower acceleration rate so the ultimate purpose for it is in drag racing, where you know one of the benefits of course is that it's going to heat up the tires and thus give you more grip and it can also help shut off some debris or anything that's been stuck on to the tire so that you have a nice clean tire when you are starting that launched to run. Now the process in an automatic transmission vehicle is very straightforward. Literally you mash the break and then you mash the accelerator and you just let that rear tire spin often it's that simple now it can be a little tricky sometimes it may not want to actually start spinning the tires so you may need to use a little bit less brake pressure, get the tire spinning and then once you have them spinning and you've got the engine revved up you can apply more brake pressure to make sure your car isn't moving forward too quickly and so you know that's the very simple process with an automatic with a manual transmission it's a little bit more tricky if you're trying to kind of just stand there with the rear tire smoking while the car isn't moving too much and so to do this what you want to do is push your clutch in, put it in first gear apply some throttle release the clutch very quickly and immediately take that left foot from the clutch and press it hard on the brake and so once you press it on the brake you'll have those rear tire spinning and you're going to modulate between your left foot and your right foot how much brake pressure and throttle you need in order to keep the burnout going now the tricky part here is knowing how much throttle you need to apply initially to get those rear tires to spin in my Honda s2000 it seems to be around 5000 rpm that's kind of the sweet spot you know if you go much above that you may end up just burning up your clutch and if you go below that you may just stall out the vehicle and so you know you do want to find that happy medium and it is kind of a learning process for each individual car based on how much grip you have and how much torque your engine is putting down so vehicles with more engine torque you know big v8’s they're going to be at lower rpm than something like this s2000 which is going to be spinning up pretty high but that's because it's a small engine and it doesn’t have much torque so now let's go ahead and watch a burnout happen but first let's check out the rear tire temperatures looking at the rear tires both of them have temperatures around 15 degrees Celsius now for a short burnout so after two very short burnouts you can see the tire temperature is raised to about 18 Celsius with the inside of the tire at about 20 degrees as a result of the out of spec negative camber and now once without brakes the inside portion of the tire has raised to about 25 degrees with the center at about 22 and because what you've probably been waiting for is a longer burn out I handed the keys over to Braten Carlson a fellow automotive youtuber who happily dumped the clutch over 7000 RPM while I films with the thermal camera more power smooth surface and the clutch held just fine for a nice long burnout after the fact the tires are roasting over 160 degrees Celsius the tires do cool off fairly quickly however at 45 seconds after the burn out the temperatures have dropped to 125 celsius by a minute the left tires just over 100 Celsius at a minute and 45 seconds we're down to about 90 and by two minutes portions of the tire have dropped below 80 if you haven't yet watched my full video of the burnout using the thermal camera I'd highly recommend it as it's fascinating to see also a shout out to last place garage for letting us create clouds in their shop and bragging Carlson for the epic for now I'll have links everyone in the video description if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching you
