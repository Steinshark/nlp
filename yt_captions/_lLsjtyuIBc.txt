i recently picked up the new 
ipad pro m1 third generation and wanted to share my thoughts on it as a coder 
content creator and entrepreneur before we get   into it though make sure to hit that subscribe 
button for more tech and coding related videos   give this video a thumbs up if you 
want to see more tech product reviews   also shout out to some of these subscribers 
here i see you some of you have been with me for   so long and i just your family now and i just 
wanted to shout you out okay let's get into it first off i wanted to talk a little bit 
about why i decided to get the ipad pro   as someone who works from home from my macbook 
pro m1 pro you might be thinking tiff what is   the need for an ipad what are you really going 
to use it for well the answer is a twofold the   first reason is i'm simply a tech geek and 
just love trying out new products and sharing   it with you the second reason is i am going 
to be traveling more and when i'm traveling i   really like to carry something light that i can 
still do my work on especially when on a plane   let's talk specs of the ipad i chose i got the 
silver ipad with 128 gigabytes it has 8 gigabytes   of ram the apple m1 chip and eight core cpu with 
four performance cores and four efficiency cords i   got the smallest amount of storage because i'm not 
really going to be storing anything on this ipad   rather just utilizing it especially as i mentioned 
when traveling okay now let's talk performance   i'm going to pull up geekbench score here and 
show you just how amazing performance this ipad   really has also in regards to performance apple 
claims that the new m1 chip is up to 50 faster in   terms of cpu performance compared to the 2020 ipad 
pro which has a12z bionic chip and that's pretty   impressive stats if you ask me okay let's dive 
into battery life a little as i mentioned multiple   times as i'm using this for traveling battery life 
was very important to me i didn't want to have to   be worried about is my ipad going to die quickly 
am i going to have to charge it on the plane   and so that was a huge factor to me that i spent 
some time doing research on apple states that the   battery life is up to 10 hours when you are 
either surfing the web or watching a movie   okay getting into 5g capabilities the 
2020 i had an old ipad actually from 2020   and it only had 4g capabilities so it was another 
really big incentive to upgrade to the ipad pro   11 because it comes with 5g capabilities okay 
from a content creator standpoint let's talk   about the camera this is one of more of i would 
say the exciting upgrades of the ipad pro 11.   uh the third generation ipad pro 11 comes with 12 
megapixel front true depth with ultra wide camera   as you can see here when you zoom out you will 
see a ton more of the environment you are trying   to capture okay you're gonna see a lot of me 
right now but this is essentially when the   lens is zoomed out you can kind of get a bigger 
picture here i'm on video right now on the ipad   so you can kind of get a sense though and i will 
switch to photos so you can see as well that the   front-facing camera you can have the option to 
really expand the lens which i think is really   great feature especially for content creators it's 
something that i know i would find very useful also the new front camera allows for extra 
features they introduce such as one called   the center stage where the camera will actually 
track and follow you during a video call i thought   it was pretty cool that if more than one person is 
in this video call the camera will accommodate to   that and pick up the faces and also expand to try 
and fit everyone in the camera or the lens okay   let's talk about or let's answer a question that 
i had which is can you code on it i mean my first   answer is you can code on pretty much anything so 
immediately yes but i wanted to know if this is   something that i would feel comfortable coding on 
is a screen big enough for me to code on and just   really how i felt with it my initial reaction is 
i wasn't certain if i was going to be able to code   on it but i actually got a external keyboard that 
i hooked up to the ipad and it really makes coding   on it pretty seamless from a coding standpoint 
let's get one thing clear i am not building large   applications on an ipad pro but rather i find it 
really good and i wanted something that i could   use that i could practice leak code questions on 
how to rank questions on essentially just practice   algorithms when i'm traveling i find i usually 
want to i get motivated or inspired to practice or   brush up on my algorithms it's probably the only 
time i actually get motivated to do so so i always   try and take advantage let's get one thing clear 
i'm not someone who loves practicing algorithms as   i'm sure most of you who code do not but i do find 
when i travel or am on planes and have a lot of   time on my hands that it's a good way to kind of 
force myself to brush up on my skill set so that's   really when i take advantage of it i just go into 
the browser and go to leak code or hacker rank   and start brushing up on it i do find that i 
absolutely need to have an external keyboard   one of my favorite accessories for the ipad pro is 
logitech keyboard and it's super easy to use and   it also acts as a case which is a win-win okay now 
you know some of my reasons as to why i chose to   upgrade but if these reasons or these features 
aren't really important to you i would say   upgrading isn't necessarily something that you 
really need to do there is still a lot of amazing   things on for example the ipad pro 11 2020 with a 
lot of the same features as well so it really has   to be either the camera the front-facing camera 
now overall i would say if you are someone who is   enticed by some of these features or specs that 
i laid out i definitely think it is worth the   upgrade but if you have for example the ipad pro 
11 from 2020 i don't really think it's necessary   unless some of these features really entice 
you more for me some of the differences as   i mentioned that really enticed me were the 
5g capabilities on the third generation ipad   pro the new m1 chip the ram options and the 
new front camera and thunderbolt charging   if these reasons are all important to you then 
upgrading is most likely worth it i hope you found   this video very helpful and useful if you are 
someone who's researching on ipads and considering   upgrading i know for me it really felt worth it 
and i really had a positive experience so far   using it leave in the comments other products
