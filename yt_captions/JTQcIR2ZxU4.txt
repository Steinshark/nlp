- What's up guys, I accidentally gave all my
money away to Twitch streamers and now I'm homeless. And on top of that, UMG
keeps taking all my revenue. So I'm going to go buy a Lamborghini, so I can make this viral video and then have money and not be homeless. - unless UMG claims it again. - There's Jimmy. - How's it going, man? - Good. - Good, welcome Lamborghini. - Thank you. - Got any questions? - How much do they cost? - You have 130s up to 500,000 or so. - That's not that much. What does it feel like to sleep in it? - To sleep in it? Well- - Yeah. Have you ever lived in one? - I have not. - I was thinking of living in one. - That would be a first. - What's your cheapest one? - Probably over here around
200, 205 or so thousand dollars. - Oh, that's it? How
many horses does it have? - 580. - Is that a lot? He's being nice to me.
Why's he being nice? I'm kind of thrown off. There's no cup holder? - There's no cup holder in this. - That's why it's like 200 grand, gotcha. - Exactly. - Well then, uh, can I just buy it? - Yeah, sure. Why don't you step into my office and we'll do the paper work, yeah. - Cool. - All right. Have a seat, Jimmy. - All right, guys, so basically we now own a Lamborghini. - Probably should've bought a house. - Nah, it's whatever. Long story short, I guess
it's Lamborghini's motto to be nice to everyone that
comes in their dealership. I didn't know that, so
that's apparently why he was so nice to me. At the end of the video,
we're going to take this car and sell it back to the dealership. So make sure you watch the end to see how they react to that. We've got so many crazy
things planned for today, so just keep watching. So anyways, I've never
driven a Lamborghini before. I don't know what I'm doing. - Wait, what? Is is pouring. - I know, this is not
the optimal conditions for a 20-year-old idiot to
be driving a Lamborghini. I'm scared. Am I doing something wrong? Dude, there was a ton of
smoke coming out of the back and it was extremely loud. - We don't know how to
drive a Lamborghini. - Yeah, it was making a lot
of noise and I got scared. Damn, boy, our Lambo looks sick. Oh my God, this is so much smoother. - I know, right? - I just don't- It's scary, 'cause it's a $200,000 car, so I wanted an automatic
so I can't mess it up. - [McDonald's Employee]
Welcome to McDonald's, what can I get for you? - How much money do we have? - We got a few dollars. - Do you guys have like $1 burgers? - We're good dude. - Yep. I ran out money. I spent it all on this car. She didn't care. - She doesn't care. - She doesn't care about our car. Chandler, what's the point
of paying $200,000 for a car if a person at McDonald's
doesn't compliment you? Wait, I'm vegan. I can't touch your meat. All right, Chandler,
it's your turn. Have fun. - Buckle it up. - Mm-hmm. I'm ready, dad. Yo, look at those kids, dude. We're flexing on them - They're freaking out. - We're flexing on them. - Oh Lambo. - Dude, they compliment you on the Lambo, I'm going to be mad. - Hey, do you like my car? - It's cool. - Thank you. Oh, you parking? We're parking? We're parking? And since I'm a homeless person, we might as well go spend a bunch of money and just see how people react. I'm looking for some pants
that don't have holes in them. Ooh. Jeans would be cool. How much are they? - These are 168. - 168. Do you have any that
are a little more expensive and can I get a watch? - Okay. So your totals going to be 922.35. - Be nice to have clothes
that don't have holes in them. Thank you. He didn't really react. We're running into a little dilemma, we were kind of hoping everyone
would be just mean to me, but so far, everyone I've
seen has just been super nice. Do you do sales? - I do. - How much is this? I'll buy it. Is it just a scarf? - It is. - Fun. - There you go sir. - All right, so I just bought my towel, kind of an expensive
towel but I needed it, I'm a little dirty. - [Security Officer] What is that? - UMG. You should arrest them. - I have no idea who that is. - What's UMG? - So we were bouncing from store to store, getting people's reactions
to me being homeless, buying expensive things and in between stores,
Garrett actually hit a car, like no joke. Okay. Well, this is interesting. Look what just happened. Chandler threw up on the side of this car and we are talking about
Chandler's puke and- - I just flipped this car. - I literally said, we should
let Garrett drive the Lambo and then we saw- - I'm not good with trucks. - How does he move the car out of the way, where it does the least amount of damage? Stop. Stop, stop. You're good. You're good. You're good. - You sure? - There we go. Fixed. - That looks good. - Did you just bump it out? - Yeah. - How much do you think this car is worth? - 1500. - Yeah. Can we just leave 10 grand
on the car and leave? - Do you have 10 grand? - Or half? - I just want to talk to this person and if I could just buy
the car, I wouldn't care. Like I'd literally just buy the car. Just give him the Lambo. - Yeah. - What if we did that? What if we, don't joke, what if I just gave him the Lamborghini? - He's got a baby seat in the back, so, I don't think you
can put babies in Lambos. - Oh, now I feel bad, she has a kid. Dude, let's take her to a dealership and just buy her whatever car she wants. - She probably at work till six. - I think it'd be funny if the car we hit, if we just
gave him the Lamborghini. - No, you can't just give
away stuff like that. - Why not? That'd be funny. - It's not funny to give
away those kind of cars. People can't afford that kinda insurance. - She could just sell it. - No. - Why? - No. - Please. - No. - No? - Please, no, because you don't, no. No, no. - Please. - No. - Well what can I do? Can I go buy her a new car? - Can you buy her a new car? You don't even know who she is. - Yeah or he, it could be a guy. But we hit, he slash she's car, so logic says we replace it, right? - No, no, no. Logic says. - All right. Can you move some money over
so I can go buy her a new car. We need the content. Garrett literally hit a car. Let's meet that person and buy
her whatever car she wants. - What kind of car are we replacing? - This is the car he hit. Can I give her a hundred thousand dollars? - No. I have to- - You're no fun! This car online is worth $3,000. We made a little scratch, a big scratch and a dent that we already fixed, which means we should give her $20,000. - By that math, yes we should. - Okay. - I'm whipping it! - No You need to get out, sir. You need, sir. You need to get out the vehicle. You are not allowed to drive anymore. No, no. - I'm driving. - No! Pull him out, pull him out, pull him out. - We need six lawn chairs and we need to like camp out right, here waiting for the person. I think that would be hilarious. This is now the desert
video, but in this garage. - All right Chandler, we're at Walmart. - Yeah, Garrett hit a car, so we're going to go camp by the car and wait for the person to come back. - Oh yeah, they need chairs. They need four of those. Perfect. - So this is what we got here. We got some chairs, we got some checkers, you can't really see it. We got UNO. I got a sleeping bag. - I can't hear you now, 'cause there's very loud. - Very angry! So we got UNO, I got a sleeping bag and
I'm going to pass out. - So you are camped out
in this Lamborghini? - In the Lamborghini. The car we hits right over there. - Right there? - Whenever he slash she pulls up, we're going to skirt, skirt, be like, yo, you just got a new car. - This Lamborghini? - No, my mom said I
couldn't give it to her. My mom wants me to have money. It's kind of lame. - I mean, we all want
you to have money, Jimmy. - I just want to give it all away. Chris's mom's calling. This is Jimmy, Garrett
accidentally hit a car. How does that make you feel? - Jesus Christ, with the Lamborghini? - No, no. With the stupid red truck. - Oh. I mean, is everybody safe? - Yeah. Yeah. Well by hit, I mean
kind of like scratched. - I think it's fine. Did the people see it? - No, they haven't come back
yet, but I feel kind of bad, so I was thinking of
buying them a new car. Does that seem reasonable? - For you, yes. For me, no. I would just drive away. - And we're back. - I'm getting a little tired. I'm going to nap in our tent. You know our parking garage tent. All right, ow, ow. Ow, it hurts. It's concrete. This kind of reminds me of the desert. Remember when we were in the desert? - Yeah. - Yeah, this reminds me of that. - So how do we go from a Lamborghini to a tent in a parking lot? - Chris is going to jump
over the Lamborghini. Go, go, go. - Oh! I did it! - Hey Chris- - It's crazy. That's insane. Oh look, it's Garrett. - Garrett, you made a dent right here. Let's not put a dent on this side. You can do this here. Last one to hit a car wins $10,000. - Oh my God. He just hit the window again. - Did you? Did he actually? - Yes. - Get out. - Garret, get out of the car. - Now we owe them $11,000. Stop touching- - Don't touch the car. - You already did enough damage. Whatever it is with this car, Garrett, this car now has a
restraining order on you. Garrett is not allowed within
a thousand feet of this car. - Nice. Look at this place. - 24 hours in parking spot, while we're waiting for
the car that we hit, so we can give the
person $10,000 challenge. - Yeah. I've never seen
somebody so excited about a car getting smashed. Jimmy immediately gets out
of the car, this is great. All of us were like, no. - We didn't know what to do for content, I was just like, thank you God. - So guys, just to let you know, Chandler- - Chandler has never had a Twinkie before. I just handed him one and he's like, I've never had that before. What is this? And I was
like, it's a Twinkie. Was that not the best
thing you've ever had? Wait, give me one. - Chandler, no. - Give me one. - Chandler stole our Twinkies. - These are so good. - We need to throw these away. They have way too many calories. - Okay. I'll go throw them away. - Yeah, please do. - Yeah, I'll go throw them away. - It is pouring rain. - Did you hear the thunder? - It is pouring rain. Hold on Sir. Sir, is that your car? - Your car? - Is that your car? - Yeah. - When we were- I hate to randomly throw this on you but when we were pulling out, we accidentally scratched it a little bit. - Oh yeah. - No, this isn't a prank. He's well- We're YouTubers but we
accidentally did scratch it. So I didn't know what to do about. - We were waiting for you so we could buy- - We waited for you since
10:00 AM this morning. - Yeah, yeah, we- - Oh, seriously? - Yeah, 'cause we felt bad. - What do you want to do about it? 'Cause we were pulling out
with this red truck and we- Garrett right here- - I'm a little too tight. - What do you think? Do you think a couple
of hundred bucks maybe or 500 bucks? - 'Cause honestly, this came off and we kind
of popped it back in it. - Awe, did it really? - But I don't know if it . - The whole thing was dented in and we popped it back out. So, we're just going to give
you money to make up for it. It $9,000. We had 10 but we had to pay a thousand
dollars for our parking spot. - There's no way that's real. - Yeah it is. - It's real, 100%. - We got it from the bank earlier. - Yeah, it is. - Get out of here. - Yes sir, 100%. 100%. - This car's not even worth that much. - It's not even worth 9,000. That's fine. Yeah. Here you go, take it. - There's no way man. - Yeah. - 100%. Yes sir. - Yep, $9,000. - There's no way, that
doesn't even feel right. - I don't like money to be honest. - Ah, man. - Here you go, take it. - That's crazy. - Ah. - There's- - You have to take it. - Yeah, you have to take it. - We waited all day for this. - That way you can buy a new car, 'cause we totaled this car. Yeah. - We really did. - All right, well, I don't want it. So I'll just leave it there and you can do what you want with it. - What are you shooting this for? - Oh, YouTube. I mean we might as well
get content out of it. Garrett, if you're going
to hit people's car. - I'm sorry man. - It's cool man. - I'm super sorry about your car. - I'm like dumbfounded, I don't even know what to say. - It's all good. - I mean, well, I mean,
yeah it would be all good but it's not worth that to fix that. You know what I'm saying? - So we don't have enough, we need more? - Yeah. That's what I was going to say. - We got to get more money. - We shouldn't have
paid a thousand dollars for the parking space. Well, that was all. We can just shake and
go our separate ways. - Hey, like that makes me feel bad. - No. - Just shake my hand. - You shouldn't. - So does that mean I'll
end up all over YouTube too? - Yeah, of course. - I mean, I'm not that type of person, like that makes me feel bad that it's all- - No, don't worry about it. - You really shouldn't, you really shouldn't. We set out camp, we made a day out of it. - Yeah. We had fun. - You got me, I don't
even know what to say. - Now that I just get away $9,000 to a random person, what do I do? - You can hit my car anytime. - I can? Thank you. - I'll be parked around
the same place tomorrow. - Okay Guys, let me know if I can hit your car. Garrett, you hug him. Tell him you're sorry for hitting his car. - Yeah. Apologize. - Hey man. - The bad son, the bad son. - That was, that was, yeah, please. - Don't touch him. - That was bad. Stay away from him, please. That's the world's way of saying, you already hit his
car, stay away from him. - So, don't touch him. - All right man. - Well this one's really
running kind of late, like this. - Take care. - Hey. You have a good day. - Take care of those . - Have a good- - Yeah, same. - Have a good day. - Say what now? - I said, it totally doesn't feel right walking away with this. - Oh no, you're fine. You're totally fine. - Thank God, his cars still works. - Yeah. - I thought we totaled it. - I know. Goodbye. - See you later, man. - I wonder what he's going to do with that money. - I wonder what his name is. Now that we took care of that, can I have the Lamborghini keys? Imagine if my mom would've let me give him this Lamborghini. - He would've lost his mind. Actually, knowing him now,
he would've not taken it. He barely accepted the $9,000. - Hey, wait, we should
pick up our thing first. - Oh yeah. All right. - Lamborghini, give us a second. We paid the guy we hit, nine grand. We picked up everything
from our parking spot that we camped in for seven hours. And now we're going to take
this Lamborghini right here back to the dealership
and sell it to them. I don't want it anymore. Driving a car that costs over $200,000 is literally stressful. I'd rather spend that
money on other videos and do good things with it. Plus, just to be a hundred percent real, people who are friends with me just because I drive a Lamborghini, I don't want them to be friends with me. So, I really have no interest in super expensive cars like this. - Wait, so you said, you're friends that like
you because the Lamborghini, you don't want them anymore? - Yeah. - All right. I'll see you later. - As you saw in this video, I'm homeless. Please go to shopmrbeast.com
and buy some merch, so I can not be homeless. Thanks.
