- Welcome back to season
38 of "Beast Got Talent." In this episode, I invited some of the
world's best magicians to come down and perform
magic for me and my friends. But what they don't know is,
after their warmup round, they're actually going to be
competing for $10,000 in cash. It gets pretty intense. - What's up guys? Nice to be here. I'm super honored to be on the 38th season of "Beast Got Talent," to be honest. And I'm a magician, my
name's Chris Ramsay. Maybe we'll do some card stuff later, but I'm actually gonna do something with this book that I just bought. You mind if I come down there, you guys? - Yeah, bring it on down.
- Absolutely, yeah. - Come on down. - So before we begin, I bought this book at
the airport, "The Dry." - "The Dry?"
- Yeah. It sounds like my bank account. I have with me, a cryptex. You guys ever see "Da Vinci Code?" - Yeah. - So this is like a puzzle, like, where one word unlocks this thing. Here you go. Just try to unlock it, put any word in it. - Okay.
- Obviously, it's locked. Right?
- Yeah, it's... - Cool.
- Yup. - So those things are
known for holding a secret. You can hold onto that, I
won't touch that anymore. I'mma actually use a playing
card and we'll try it this way. Here, moisture boy.
- Right. - I'm gonna get you to say,
"stop," wherever you want. - Okay. - And I will place the card
no matter where you want. If you're not happy with it,
we can do it again, okay? - Okay. - So go ahead and say, "stop." - Stop.
- Right there? - No, I'm not happy with that . - All right.
- Right, stop. - Right there?
- That one's good. - Okay, perfect. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to remember the
first word on this page, I'mma turn around, and the page number. - All right.
- Can you do that? - I'm gonna try. - Have a look, have a look.
- That's harder for me... - First word and the
page number. You got it? - All right.
- Okay. Now, commit this to memory. Put this in your head, all right? You got it?
- Right. - Turn to that page.
What was the page number? Tell everybody. - It's 202. - Go to that page. - What's up? - It's missing. - Wait, what? - What did you do with
the page, moisture boy? - I didn't touch it. - Where's the page at? What'd you do? - I didn't touch the page. - So how'd you see 202 if it's not there? - Wait, let me see. - It's not there. - 202 is what you said? - Yeah, 202. - All right. - MrBeast, you've been...
- Wait, what? - MrBeast, you've been holding on to this cryptex the entire time. I've not went near it, right?
- Okay. - He saw a page 202.
- No, it's not in here. - For the first time, what was the word? - Truth. - You know what they
say about truth, right? The truth will... - Set you free.
- Set you free. - Oh my goodness. No way. - Oh, okay. Wait, there's a page in there. - No. - Now you gotta make sure that's the same page that he saw. - Chris is this the same page you saw? - Bro. - Line it up. Line it up. - Oh my goodness. - what is this? - Line up the tear marks. - No way. - Is this what you saw? - That's what I saw.
That page is in the book. - No.
- Yep. - My name's Chris Ramsay.
Thank you so much. - I don't wanna waste all my 10s yet. That was insane but I feel
like he has other crazy stuff. - Yeah, I know, right? - So I'm gonna throw out
an eight for that one. Thank you. Thank you. - Wait, really? Don't you think that's a
little harsh mannequin? - I'm supposed to be the main judge. - Come on. Unlike my counterparts over here, it's clearly a nine. - Obvious nine for me.
- Wow. - I have no idea how he did it. - Dude, super honored. Thank you guys. - Awesome. So we have two forks,
number one and number two. Which one do you prefer? - I want number two. - Two? Okay.
- Yeah. - I'll use number two. - I want that.
- So here examine it for me. Just make sure it's a normal
one. You can take it up. - Yeah. Yeah. - Just take it then... - Number one. - So, everyone just get a
close up look on that one. Watch that. I'm gonna take the fork and just try to bend it a bit like so. So watch the end right here. Just like that. - Oh wow. - Oh. Oh my goodness.
- Make sure it's solid. Make sure it's solid. Touch it. Touch it. - No, it is.
- Okay. - It's a real solid, yeah. - Step number two. Just gonna take the fork
and rub it a bit like so, and you could try it as well. Take your finger, place
it here and just rub it. See that it's bending? - Bro, it's actually... Oh my goodness.
- Really? - Yeah, it's bending. - Touch it. Make sure it's real. - They're real Chris? - I can't do it without
his magical abilities. It's real.
- So here, watch this. Put your hand like this, MrBeast. - Okay. - I'm gonna take the other one and close your hand around it. - Okay. - And squeeze really tight, right? I'm just gonna try something really cool. Just like that. I'm just gonna twist it a bit and tell me when you feel something. - Yeah, I feel... It feels like...
- You feel something? - Yeah.
- Open you hand slowly. - Oh.
- Oh, dude. - Right. - You're so strong.
- Wait, play that back. Was it like that when
he put it in my hand? - Close your hand around it, - Okay. - and squeeze really tight, right? Okay, last one with the fork. Now, here, watch this. I want you all of you guys
to point the fork like that with your first finger, right? And just focus on the
fork, and especially you. - Yes.
- Okay? So here, watch this. Focus on it. Focus on it. Something's crazy is gonna happen. Just - No. - No. Oh my God. - Examine and make sure
it's real. There, go buddy. - That's like a clean... There's a cut right here. I have no idea how you made
that fork completely fall. It went from an eight
to a nine at that point. So solid nine. - Awesome. - I can't think for myself, so I'm gonna go with a nine as well. - That's it. - All right. I'm a big advocate of eating dinner. So I was actually kind of upset when you cut the fork in half. - Oh my God. - I can't do it. I'm trying. I guess I'm not a wizard. - Try to make it cut in
half, so stare at it. - Soccer dad, could you join me on stage? - Yeah. - Yeah, we're finally using our stage. - Two decks, two colors, all the same, whichever one you prefer.
That's all that matters. - This one. - This one's for you. So here's what we'll do, I'm gonna take this and
I know you're standing, but of course we gotta
give him one of these keeping in mind, this isn't the deck that you took a look at before. So all different, you
could see that as well. - Yeah. - Take the cards in your
hand just like that. Now I want you to take the cards, I want you to cut the deck anywhere that you want
and complete the cut. Tell me when you did that. - I did it. - You did that, yeah? - Yeah.
- You did. - Do you want the top
card or the bottom card? - Bottom card. - Don't look at the bottom card, but take the bottom card and
place it in your back belt. You have no idea what the card is, right? - I have no idea. - Six of clubs. - Bro, are you serious? I didn't even know what it was. - too confused though.
How is he doing this? - What do we even say at this point? - Yeah, I know. - That was impressive. - I mean, this is the final round. We're not gonna use the mannequin anymore because he's clearly biased. The winner of this next
round gets $10,000 in cash. We don't care which one wins, it's just whichever one
blows our mind the most. And instead of showing our scores, what we're actually going to
do, is to keep it a secret and to keep it a little more competitive, we're gonna text Jake our score, and at the end he's gonna
add up all the scores, and then we'll determine
who won the $10,000. - Hold this. - All right. - Don't show me.
- All right. - Hold it up to you.
- All right. - Do you remember how old you were when you had your first kiss, yeah? - Yeah, okay. - Type in just the age.
Just the digits for the age. Okay? Now hit the
multiplication button once, - All right. - pass it to our friend,
MrBeast over here. I want you to write a three-digit number between 500 and 600, okay? The first one that pops
to mind. Go for it. - Okay. - Hit the multiplication button once. - Multiplication. Okay. - Could you hand it to... You're the wild card. - Don't let him see it.
- You're the wild card, okay? I want you to hit four random numbers. Have you done so? - Yeah.
- Hit equals. - Oh, that's big number. - You didn't get it? - And hold it face down
on the table. Perfect. We're gonna get to that later. Could you take the cards? It's important that you touch... Hold them in your hand,
- Okay. - Cut off the packet of cards and drop them onto the table. - Just drop?
- Just like that. Right there. Perfect. Take the rest that in
your hand and mix them up. Just move them around, doesn't need to be a professional shuffle. Cut off another packet and
drop it on top of these. Just like that. Shuffle the rest of those in your hands, mix them up as best as you can, and then drop the rest on top. Now we're gonna make some groups of cards. Let's say something like this, something like this. MrBeast, - Okay.
- point to any two packets. Keep in mind we're gonna... These two like this.
- Yes. - Which one gets turned face up? This one? From this moment on, nobody
gets to change their mind. That gets turned face up. That means these get
shuffled just like so. Now, which two of these packets
gets shuffled into this one? I want you to choose everything. This one?
- Yes. - And which one gets turned over? This one like this? - Yeah.
- Perfect. Can you just take these and
you just push them together? - Perfect. I want you to do everything. Look, last one. Which
one gets turned over? - This one.
- This one? Like this, look, like that, boom and just
squeeze them together. - All right.
- Squeeze them. Yeah, yeah. Push them in. Push them in like so. Great. We're gonna take these. - All right. - You shuffled at the beginning, - Mm-hmm. - and you cut.
- Yeah. - But what's interesting,
is that you chose every card that you wanted to be face up. - Yeah.
- And you mix them yourself. So the fact that... Here, what do we have? So the fact that we have
whatever cards are face up now is merely circumstantial, right? But what's very circumstantial
is the random numbers that you all put in that phone. The phone that isn't mine. Could you turn that phone over? What's the number?
- 008248 - Eight, one, eight, two, nine, eight,
- No. - eight, seven, five. - That's pretty good. - Name again? - Katie. - Katie? Come on down. Give her a big round of applause. Come on. Don't be shy. - Drop the cool. - Yup. Just ask you to please
take one card any one that... Go ahead, pick one. - Okay.
- Okay. Take my marker for me and just like, maybe write your name across
the face of the cards. Cool, thank you. Mind if you show it? Good stuff. - Yeah.
- Perfect. - Can you see it? - Yeah, sure. Doesn't matter. Ace of diamond's, perfect. So I'm gonna take the Ace and I'm gonna bend it a bit like so. I'm gonna fold it in the half, and again, I want you to
do something a bit awkward, but trust me please, all right? I want you to take the
card and bite it like this and keep it there. Perfect. I'm gonna take the top card and
I'm gonna do the same thing. I'm gonna write my initials on it, just like that. Right? And watch. I'm gonna do the exact same thing. And yours was the Ace of diamonds. I'm not gonna touch it, look. Right? - What?
- Whoa. - Now, I have your card. And look in your mouth. Show it to the boys. - Come on. - Oh. Oh, good. Good.
- Wow. - Where's the smoke come from? - That's amazing.
- Thank you, guys. Can I just get my deck back please? Yeah, it's under the mannequin. - Is it real?
- Yeah. - What?
- Give me my deck back. - What?
- What? - Thank you so much. - Good luck.
- Awesome. - Hey, Chandler, stop doing magic. - Guys for my final act, I'm gonna actually invite
two of you up on stage and make use of this thing here. So MrBeast and soccer dad, come on up. Moisture boy, if you want, you can come here and have a look and make sure everything's cool. So first of all, I want you guys to verify
there's nothing in that envelope. Yes, it's pretty dark.
- No, nothing. - Yeah. Camera can have a look if you want. - Ha! Gotti, ha! - MrBeast, without looking, I want you to take a card. Do not look at it, slide it towards you, whatever card it is. And I want you to place it in
this envelope here, all right? So place an envelope, all right? Perfect. Nobody's seen that. And I want you to hold onto
that, leave that in your pocket. I'm gonna actually have you guys switch places here for a second. - Mm-hmm.
- It's in my pocket. - Perfect. We'll get back to that card in a second. I want both of you to hold
your left hands out like this. Perfect, okay. I need you to close your eyes for this, and I need them to be closed. You cannot look or the trick
will not work, all right? You gotta keep them
closed. You gotta trust me. We're gonna try the test connection here and I'm not sure if this
is gonna work or not, but it's based solely
on you two, all right? So in a second, I'm gonna touch you. You're gonna feel something. So for instance, if I touch
you here, here, or even here, I just want you to take mental
notes of what I'm touching, keep track of it in your mind only. Is that cool?
- Mm-hmm. - All right, here we go. Did you feel something? - Yes. - Where did you feel it? - My hand. - On your hand, can you open your eyes? - Yeah. - Is this what you felt? - Yeah, that's what I felt. - Did I touch him with a cigarette at all? - No. You looked? You sure? - I wasn't looking. I swear. I swear I felt it three times. - Okay. - Okay, so that... Now that we've established
your connection, this is actually really good. You can put your hands
down, gentlemen, thank you. You chose a card? - I did and put it in my pocket. - Absolutely at random. - Yeah, I haven't seen it. - He doesn't know what the card is. - Okay. - I want you to think of... Just think of a playing card in general with no face on it, no numbers. Just a blank card in your mind. So here's what we're gonna do. You got this card, you're
thinking of a blank card. I'm gonna try to mind control you into telling him what the card is that he should think of. - Okay.
- All right? And hopefully that works. So I want you to close your eyes, I want you to plug your ears. I'm gonna place my hand on your head, and I want you just to concentrate whatever you hear or see, okay? - Your card is the four of spades. - Okay. You had your ears plugged
the whole time, right? Can you tell him what just happened? - He spoke through the back of my head. My ears were plugged.
- Did you hear, like in your head? - It sounds like there's a radio, yeah. - And you had your ears plugged? - Yeah. - Did you guys hear anything? - No. - Are you serious? He said, your card
- Take your envelope out. - is the four of spades.
- Take that envelope. You're thinking of a blank card. He told you what card to think of. - Okay. - Pop it open, yeah. Wow. - I wanna experience that. - Bro, it was a radio. - Whoa. - It said, "Your card
is the four of spades." And I was like, "It is." And he was like, "Repeat after me." It was a walkie-talkie coming from the back of my head.
- I wanna to experience that. - I can't even describe it other than it sounded like, he like, was a walkie-talkie that said, "Repeat after me, your card
is the four of spades." - All right, that's it.
That's my final act guys. Thank you so much. - And the judges scores are in. Here is our $10,000 winner. - Coming in second place with 27 point, is Chris. - Oh yeah, okay. - That means you don't get $10,000. That's a boo. - And for our first place winner, - For $10,000. - with 28 points, is Alex. - Whoa! Alex! - Thanks, mom. Thanks, mom. Thank you, God. I want
