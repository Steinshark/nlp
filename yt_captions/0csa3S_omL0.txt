this special package which funnily enough looks the same either way up contains a very interesting smartphone that has just been announced this is the next Xiaomi black shark gaming phone and we'll get to it's crazy specifications in a minute but first of all inside the package you actually get black shark logo stickers a tempered glass screen protector and a case which unlike most of the ones bundled in with your phone you will want to use for a very specific purpose so it's a good thing that although it is fully plastic construction it feels solid also you've got a USB type-c two headphone jack adapter you've got the USB type-c cable itself and a charger which supports 18 watt charging and Qualcomm's quick charge three also every black shock device comes bundled with this almost Nintendo switch-like controller which we will come back to this phone looks beautiful with a two-tone metal and glass finish and a pattern that kind of looks like what you might find on a manhole cover not to mention this glowing logo it's definitely distinct it's not full-on aggressive like the Asus rogue phone a little subtler a little more refined feeling there are also a lot of small touches here too a green chrome accent around the phone a green inside of the USB port and even green around and behind the dedicated shark button on balance though you'll probably want to keep this case on it's a complete contrast to the way most phones feel with their super curved bodies but it has a special function here and there's also a lot of ridges to grip I still like the way it looks and feels a few things immediately sprang to mind as I turned it on well the screen looks nice shame about the screen to body ratio and oh that UI is a lot to take in like the razor phone to chopping off the bezels here clearly wasn't a priority and also like that phone the speaker's make up for it you get loud stereo sound with really good separation partly because of the physical distance between the speakers playing alters Odyssey on this phone really pulled me in the screen is a six inch full HD plus AMOLED panel and it looks good I'm actually fine with the resolution I'm currently running my huawei mate 20 pro on the same rares even though it would go higher and it's good that it gives you display options like a color temperature slider and even white point reduction which basically reduces the intensity of rarely bright areas making the screen less strenuous to look at the LED lighting is not just on the back but on the sides too and it looks wicked but also plays a functional role if you're receiving a call or notification the side lights will not just light up but pulse to grab your attention and if you are an RGB fiend like me there's a lot to fiddle with you can pick any color use gradients and even adjust the speed of animation and in an indoor setting it's pretty bright but if I was using this as my main device I could also see a case where I would just turn this all off to save battery speaking of saving battery the UI here is almost completely black with bits of green which on an AMOLED panel like this helps not to mention it's visually distinct for sure although for me I think it's a little much I would have preferred a slightly more toned down aesthetic there's loads of stuff I want to spend a bit more time with like key shortcuts which can start to screen recording when you press the power key and the volume up at the same time frame rate optimizations and even anti addiction settings which controls the amount of time you spend on the gains oh yeah and it's got magazine unlock which basically changes the wallpaper every time you unlock the phone very simple but something I personally quite like so then there's shark mode flicking this key closes all other apps and opens a dedicated gaming space but right now on this prototype well everything's in Chinese it goes without saying that this is a very powerful phone with a snapdragon 845 and up to 10 gigabytes of RAM so obviously it's gonna absolutely queue through most games but at the same time this is still what I would call a current gen chip so has the same limitations this is where the controller comes in and it slides into the case which is why I was saying earlier that if you really want to get the most out of this phone you kind of want to keep the case on at all times it connects to the phone via bluetooth and I don't really have a problem with it apart from the fact that I guess it's just another thing you have to worry about keeping charged up but it provides to shoulder triggers a joystick and four directional buttons which is a lot of controls and they do feel consecrated really nice construction just bare mind that it's very tricky to use the joystick and the buttons at the same time so really it's one or the other and the rest of your game you'll probably have to use with on-screen controls with your other hand the battery capacity is 4,000 milliamp hours and while I haven't had a chance to test it out properly considering the display size the specs the RGB lighting and Android 8.1 it's running I could make a pretty good estimate that it'll be just above average for a flagship and the last main thing here is the dual cameras you've got a 12 and a 20 megapixel sensor and from what I've tested again not by any means a full review the HDR is great I haven't gone into portrait modes low-light shots any of that stuff but initial impressions are pretty good for a gaming phone okay so that is the just announced new black shark device from Xiaomi let me know what you think and if you enjoy the video it would really mean a lot to me if you could smash that subscribe button down below plenty more stuff on plenty more phones coming soon my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
