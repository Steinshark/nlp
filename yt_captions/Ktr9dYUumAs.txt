[Music] if you're given the task to beat super mario bros 3 as fast as possible how do you go about it well there's these things called warp whistles that you can pick up in world 1 and use to warp all the way to the last world world 8. doing this properly allows you to potentially beat the entire game in under 11 minutes however if we're to believe the hundreds of speedrunning experts in the youtube comments section then using warp whistles is cheating so what about beating super mario bros 3 as fast as possible without warp whistles the world record for super mario bros 3 workless carries with it a reputation for merciless execution and luck eight worlds each with a wide variety of levels enemies and obstacles that you must know exactly how to speed through patience is pushed to the limit as the player loses hundreds or even thousands of runs to small mistakes or just simple misfortune while the precision and persistence needed is enough to deter many from trying some push past it this is the story of the players who have gone through the challenging yet rewarding journey to obtain the super mario bros 3 warpless world record this is the world record progression of super mario bros 3 warpless let's go back to 2010. that january the first ever games done quick event was held classic games done quick what was that this event would later turn into awesome games done quick the annual charity speedrunning marathon that raises millions of dollars now the reason i bring this up is because the earliest known warplane speedrun of super mario bros 3 with video was played at this event the runner's name was freddy anderson who had the 80 world record at this point as well this run won't be covered in great detail but the most important concept to understand about it is the p meter super mario bros 3 essentially revolves around the p meter when mario is running on the ground the meter starts to fill up and when he's in the air it decreases when it's filled all the way mario's running speed drastically increases to a speed called p-speed runners struggle to figure out ways to build up p-speed in as many levels as possible you have to run on the ground for as long as you can strategically slow down and speed up in certain places and time your jumps just right anderson didn't have the strategies needed to build up the p-meter effectively throughout the game and as a result he spent much of the time either walking or running without p-speed for example this is anderson's playthrough of 3-2 he's never able to build up the p-meter at the start of the level and instead has to slowly leap his way across the water and the blocks above it in a modern speed run the player can just barely build it up at the start by waiting and running on each platform the piece speed earned from this lets the player fly through the level without even touching the water anderson's lack of peace speed on top of a few deaths helped result in an end time of around an hour and three minutes while it was a solid enough run it wasn't held to the same level of optimization as other speedruns of the time it's possible that anderson himself had a faster run but his games done quick run appears to be the only one with surviving video regardless one guy thought he had what it took to beat his time mitch flower power mitch began doing workplace speedruns in 2010 with a specific goal in mind he wanted to beat anderson's run and get it published on speed demos archive speed demos archive was more or less the center of speedrunning back then runners would submit high quality recordings of their world record speedruns and after they were verified they would be posted on the site for the world to see in 2010 mitch was able to beat anderson's time with a 59 minute run but it was ultimately rejected from speed dumbbells archive not because it was cheated or anything like that but because the verifiers felt that it just wasn't good enough as andro g would say it's too slow that was one other component of speed demos archive your run needed to look visually impressive and while it probably would have looked great to a normal viewer speed demos archive verifiers were used to watching a higher level of gameplay so they told mitch to come back and do it again faster and that's exactly what he did on september 21st 2010 mitch completed a run that would be verified on speed demos archive a few months later the time was 55 minutes and 47 seconds let's take a look the eight worlds in super mario bros 3 each offer a new set of challenges that the player must overcome as mitch made his way through world one you can see his expertise of controlling the p meter he would run on ledges just barely fill it up all the way and then have p-speed as he flew through the air as important as the levels are however there's another incredibly important part to mario 3 speed runs the overworld hammer brothers [Music] these guys move from space to space after you complete a level or die if you run into them you fight them to pick up whatever item they have sometimes like here in world 1 you have no choice but to fight the bro and are forced to pick up the star that he always has and then there's situations like world 2 there's two hammer brothers here one of them has a music box which stops hammer bros from moving across the map for a bit and one of them has a hammer which is used to break blocks on the overworld map to skip playing certain levels since you don't necessarily need to pick up the music box here it can be ideal to avoid fighting this hammer brother by navigating around him on the map because each additional hammer bro fight takes 10 to 15 seconds however sometimes mitch couldn't tell which hammer bro was which and sometimes they were in his way regardless in this particular run the hammer bro with the music box was up in the corner since mitch moved around the bottom of the map he was able to avoid it fight the hammer bro with the hammer and finish the world worlds 3-5 can be summarized as fighting some hammer brothers skipping others and flying through levels as much as you can with all the overworld action it's sometimes hard to appreciate the crazy skill that goes into the levels themselves although some parts were slower than optimal the ability to build up p-speed while trying to avoid touching any enemies is remarkable since mitch did most of this run as small mario touching any enemy would have killed him world 6 featured a bit of a strange moment mitch was flying through the world as normal and then suddenly turned around and backtracked all the way to the mushroom house to pick up a hammer suit you might think that this had something to do with manipulating the rng or it saved him time somehow but no he just forgot to pick it up initially and had to go back and get it world 7 features a bit of everything mitch had been fighting several hammer brothers in the previous worlds to pick up items like p wings to fly over levels clouds to skip levels and even the occasional invincibility star he used a bunch of these items here in world 7 to skip his way through many of the levels and finally there's world 8. most of it is actually on the team side there's several auto scrolling levels where you simply have to wait for the screen to move to the end of the stage but eventually mitch came to the hands these five boxes on the overworld map or specifically these three make up the hands in world 8. when mario moves over one there's a 50 50 chance that a hand will appear and pull him down into a 15 to 20 second stage that must be beaten given that there's three chances for a hand to pull you down this means that twelve and a half percent of the time you'll be able to pass by without getting pulled down at all it's called getting no hands working out the probabilities you'll find that 3 8 of the time you'll get one hand losing 15 to 20 seconds and 3 8 of the time you'll get two hands losing 35 to 40 seconds and of course another eighth of the time you'll get all three hands and lose around a minute mitch got two hands in this run which lost him some time but since it was at the very end of an hour-long run he really didn't mind all that much after a few more tricky stages in a couple of auto scrollers mitch had made it to the last level the fight with bowser normally involves waiting for him to jump and break the blocks below this takes quite a bit of time but remember that hammer suit that mitch picked up in world six the bowser fight is why he picked it up in the first place hammers do an incredible amount of damage to bowser it turned a fight that would have dragged on and on into this [Music] all in all this was quite an impressive run for the time impressive enough that speed demos archive decided to publish it on their website mitch didn't die a single time and showed off some really fast strategies it's also worth noting that instead of playing on an actual nes mitch played on the wii virtual console port of super mario bros 3. just keep that in mind for later one thing that was crystal clear after mitch pulled off this run was the fact that super mario bros 3 worthless was a brutal category wandering hammer brothers and the hands could add dozens of seconds onto your run from bad luck alone not to mention the p-speed strategies in level after level of an hour-long run it was intimidating to try running it and very few people did back then mitch would end up playing the category some more a year later and ended up beating his own record by about 45 seconds there's not too much that was different about it the improvements can be generalized into mitch simply getting better at the game over that period of time there were fewer mistakes overall and the run was slightly smoother what these two runs essentially did however was established mitch as the top runner of super mario bros 3 workless a couple of months then passed we're in early 2012 which is when a website called speed runs live was in its heyday speedrun's live was the headquarters of speedrun races two or more players could connect to a server and have a race room keep track of the total time as they raced to beat their game as fast as possible on march 29th 2012 two players joined a race room for super mario bros 3 to do a worthless race the first was karua he was a mario 3 speedrunner from france with a personal best not far from mitch's world record the second racer was black hasu he was a mario 3 speedrunner from japan and it's very hard to find information about him today blac cassie was live-streaming his side of the race so anybody could watch the runners began their race and even though black casu was playing on the famicom version which had slower transitions between levels he pulled ahead early on by the time the runners were on world three karua decided to just forfeit the race and watch black kasu's run from his live stream what would then occur over the better part of the next hour was remarkable black casu would finish the run with an end time of 54-46 a new world record the only problem is that the video for this run doesn't seem to exist anywhere today people were watching this run as it was being played live including karua so we do know that it happened all those years ago the only evidence we have now however is the speedrun's live race results page which shows a race from march 29th 2012 with kuruwa finishing in second place with a forfeit and black hassue winning with a time of 54-46 [Music] accounts from runners who saw this run described a more modern approach to the run as a whole mitch's 55-minute runs treated each level as an individual level where the goal is to simply beat each one as fast as possible this usually involved just staying a small mario black hatsu on the other hand backed up to look at the game as a whole he decided to pick up the fire flower more often now he did have to slow down to pick it up but it definitely had its benefits it let him save 4 seconds on each of the boom boom fights throughout the game by killing them with fire as well as letting him use fire in the other levels to clear enemies and ultimately get through them faster of course since the video for this run doesn't exist people weren't able to see these strats in action until the next world record crew was 54-34 from may 2012 an improvement of 12 seconds he picked up fire in world 1 which he tried to hold on to as long as he could of course the fire flower route was still really new here so there definitely were a few rough patches he got hit and lost fire in 3-9 4-6 and 5-7 and had to pick the fire flower back up as soon as he could each time he also died in world six and instead of getting right back into the level he just sat there in the overworld yeah he thought the run was dead but decided to just keep going for the heck of it korea was also able to show off a pretty fast 7-1 clip instead of playing through 7-1 as normal which is a pretty long stage it's possible to clip into the wall and ceiling right at the start of the level and skip straight to the end now not only does this trick require you to jump in the perfect location but your sub pixel position also needs to be just right for the clip to even have a chance of working some pixels define mario's position on a scale smaller than the pixel and it's not usually possible to control them creo was able to get it on his third try which was pretty good considering that the previous world record with video footage mitch's 5504 took six tries and then after getting no hands in world 8 karua closed out a run 12 seconds faster than black kasu's lost record all in all while there were many unpolished sections the use of fire flower throughout the run significantly helped the key word here was potential the fireflower strats had a potential how far would people be able to take them mitch decided to test that question less than a month later just three weeks after karua's world record mitch fired right back with a 40 second improvement a time of 53-53 while mitch 2 is using the fire strats his methodology was slightly different karrue's strategy was to pick up fire and then hold on to it as long as he could mitch's strategy was to pick up items and then intentionally lose them to damage boost through specific sections he did this repeatedly throughout the run fancier p-speed strategies especially in world 7 helped him gain more time over karua in 7-3 for example he would run right up to an enemy or ledge pixels away from getting hit or falling off it's exactly what he needed to build at p speed each time by this point in late 2012 a friendly rivalry between mitch and karua had developed these guys traded the world record back and forth multiple times throughout 2012. the next four world records however would all be obtained by karua over the course of about six months korea would take the world record from a 5353 down to a 5302 one key improvement was the fire kill on bowser picking up the hammer suit in world 6 to bust out right before fighting bowser used to be the strategy because killing him with just 4 hammers was much faster than having to spam him with more than 30 fireballs however because he have to go out of your way to pick up the hammer suit in world 6 from a mushroom house you end up gaining several seconds from just hanging on the fire in world 8 to kill bowser kuru's item routing also got a bit more strategic in stage 7-2 for example runners used to use a p-wing a valuable item to fly over the first section karua switched to invincibility star which he had sitting in his inventory anyway and probably the most important part of these four runs is that in one of them karua got what's known as the early hammer early hammer results from a series of incredibly lucky events in the world 2 overworld map this is a diagram of world 2. there are two hammer brothers one starts here and has a music box we'll be ignoring him for now the second one starts here and has a hammer which can break down these barriers to help you move to get to new areas on the map sooner hammer brothers move one space after each level you complete or die in and the direction they move is random if they move on top of a level or on top of another hammer brother then they'll move an additional time until they reach an open spot on the map normally this works out just fine the player will move through 2-1 2-2 the fortress up past 2-3 through the sun level either up past 2-4 or down past 2-5 and then the pyramid level before finally reaching the ending airship the player picks up the hammer somewhere in this rectangle on the map and the hammer is then used in world 4 to break this barrier and skip past the fortress keep in mind though the direction the hammer brother moves after each level is random so theoretically this exact series of moves could happen he moves up here after 2-1 up here after 2-2 over and across 2-4 after the fortress since he can't stop on the level itself and then down and to the left after 2-3 instead of reaching him somewhere in this rectangle you reach him on this space which is before the sun level so you could collect the hammer here go down here and break the block with it and then skip both the sun level and 2-5 unfortunately the odds in the hammer brother making the exact moves you need to reach them after 2-3 or around 5 if everything does work you end up gaining around 45 seconds from skipping the two levels but keep in mind that by using the hammer in world 2 you don't have it for world 4 so you can't break the block to skip the fortress and you lose half a minute by having to play through it still it's a pretty nice net gain of 15 seconds overall if you're lucky enough to get it but this was only scratching the surface of the potential of early hammer mitch's next world record a 5259 would demonstrate another layer since the hammer brothers are usually off screen and you can't see where they move it can be tricky to tell exactly how close you are to getting an early hammer so mitch came up with an idea since the hammer brother is forced to move one space after you die he would repeatedly die in 2-3 to try to get the hammer brother to come across so you could ultimately avoid playing the level and instead get an early hammer that would skip three levels instead of just two he'd just force the hammer brother to move and hope that he moved in the right directions to come across 2-3 getting him to come over in just one death or a one-death early hammer saves well over a minute in world 2 netting the player over half a minute overall but sometimes it could take a few more deaths again to come over getting a 2 death or better early hammer has been calculated about 1 to 2 percent likely and after 4 deaths you end up losing as much time as the trick saves and are forced to reset this created a bit of an ideological divide between the top two runners of the game mitch and karua mitch had the world record with the 52-59 and he had a habit of getting a ton of runs to world 2 and just dying over and over to try for early hammer he obviously lost a ton of runs here but would occasionally get one on a super good pace as a result karua on the other hand wasn't a huge fan of dying for an early hammer and instead just took as many runs as he could past world 2. if he happened to run into the hammer bro after 2-3 then he took it but it usually didn't save as much time as when mitch would get it before 2-3 so which strategy was better mitch caught is 52-59 with early hammer in may 2013 but karua beat it by two seconds without early hammer four months later where did you make up more than 30 seconds save by early hammer well part of it was by cleaning up mistakes for mitch's run mitch lost fire in world 4 of his run and couldn't pick it back up until close to the end of world 5. so he lost a bunch of time from not having fire for the boom boom fights and having to use slower strategies in other stages korea was also able to avoid fighting a hammer brother that mitch had to fight in world 4 and got the 7-1 clip in 5 trius vs mitch's 8. these time saves added up to just a bit more than the approximately 40 seconds that mitch's one death early hammer saved and since both runners got one hand in world 8 career was able to finish just two seconds ahead of mitch with the 52-57 since kuru was able to get so many more runs past world 2 he had more opportunity to get cleaner runs with smoother later worlds just two weeks later though mitch was able to beat karua back he didn't have the chance to get early hammer this run but he made up a bunch of time elsewhere as you can see by his splits he fell over a minute behind his early hammer record after world 2 but made up more than half of it in world 4 because he didn't have to play the fortress he made up more time in world 5 because he was able to hold on to fire mario then pulled ahead after a very strong world 7. a minus 1.5 after world 7 like a green split world 8 was more the same cleaning up mistakes from his previous run and then getting no hands a 52-23 without early hammer mitch sums it up best he beat my pb but wait a second remember how i mentioned before that mitch and kuru both did their runs on wii virtual console remember i said to keep in mind for later well not long after mitch got 52-23 runners discovered that playing on the virtual console version of super mario bros 3 was actually losing them about 15 seconds in each run see we virtual console games actually run about half a percent slower than nes games it's not really noticeable when playing the game normally but over the course of an hour long speed run the time adds up drastically so mitch switched to playing on an nes and got back to doing more warpless runs this time with a 15 second advantage february 19th 2014 mitch was doing super mario bros 3 warple's attempts and happened to get a two death early hammer keep in mind the odds in getting a 2 after a better early hammer is less than 2 percent so this was a big opportunity for mitch he was 48 seconds ahead after world 2. look at that as always with early hammer time was lost in world 4 because of having to play the fortress but after that he just picked up time in each split this was turning into a really really nice run and by the time he entered world 7 he was over half a minute ahead but the biggest obstacle in world 7 was right at the start the 7-1 clip come on [ __ ] [ __ ] man i've wasted so much time there 10 tries it hurt but luckily for mitch the rest of the world was great so we didn't lose a huge amount of time overall oh i don't know what these splits are what's going on so naomi had just one focus the hands he was over half a minute ahead and had the luxury of some wiggle room on the hands getting three hands would eliminate any chances of the record but getting two hands or better would make it possible 46 minutes into the run it was all coming down to this [Music] oh my god oh my god what early hammer okay everyone everyone everyone's gotta be quiet right now y'all gotta be quiet got it i think i got it oh my god i got it [Music] i got it yes you can't beat this run i'm sorry but you can't beat that oh my god kitty you understand what just happened it really hammered no hands look at the splits dude like you can't beat it there's nothing you could do well mitch said it himself you could not beat this run mitch and carrillo had battled for years but this run was the ultimate one early hammer no hands multiplying the odds of those two tricks alone we're looking at no better than 1 in 400 odds getting a run this good and that of course doesn't factor in the odds of getting good luck with all the hammer brothers and all the execution you must nail in each stage of the game and that's why it stood and stood and stood for one month 32 days later it was beaten by a run that did not get early hammer by runner that was neither karua nor mitch russian speedrunner outside lutz beat mitch's so-called unbeatable run by exactly one second how did he do it well the most important thing to realize is that mitch's run really wasn't all that perfect he was excited in the moment which is why he said it was unbeatable but for example the 10th try clip in 7-1 sent him back 20 seconds versus outside lutz's first try clip that right there nearly eliminated the advantage gained from early hammer he also got some sketchy hammer brother movements which ultimately led to a couple of extra hammer brother fights he's gotta move back up please move back up what a son of a [ __ ] improving sections like that led to outside lutz and karua five months later both improving mitch's run by a few seconds without the early hammer but in may of 2015 mitch blew them out of the water once more with an amazing 51-28 once again without early hammer one notable improvement from this run was the reintroduction of the hammer suit into the route mitch figured out that by picking it up in stage 7-8 and preserving p-speed throughout the rest of the level you could then use the kill bowser quickly at the end and potentially pick up a couple of seconds over the fire flower this was very difficult to do fast enough to save any time at all so certain writers opted to just stick with the fire flower the whole way but mitch used the hammer strats in this run and was able to get the first worthless world record in the year 2015. speaking of 2015 that was the year that another worthless runner began to threaten the world record cujo cujo played several different categories of super mario brothers 3 throughout 2014 and 2015. his worthless personal best got lower and lower 54 minutes 53 minutes then 52 minutes and he slowly turned into a world record contender cujo eventually began doing worthless world record attempts but he had one problem his hand luck in world 8 was just awful he eventually started highlighting and listing all the world record pace runs he had that died the bad hand look at the very end the number reached 18 before finally one day it happened holy [ __ ] all he had to do now is lock down and focus he just had to not get hit by anything and make it to the end and oh my god the run died because he got hit in the very last auto scroller before bowser thankfully for cujo though a few months later he would get another chance after a run with first try 7-1 clip the hands were nice to him and cujo was finally able to get his first worthless world record [Music] [ __ ] world record cujo's run only beat the world record by one second but it'd stand a lot longer than mitch's record mitch's 51-28 stood for four months from may 2015 to september 2015. cujo beat it that september and entering the year 2017 his 51-27 was still the world record however in early 2017 karua decided to come back to speedrunning super mario brothers 3 workless karua hadn't achieved a worthless world record since 2014 but he had a goal he wanted to accomplish not only did he want to beat cujo's 51-27 but he wanted to take it a step further he wanted a 50-minute time that would require taking nearly half a minute off the world record could that be done the potential was definitely there but kuru wanted some more help to get it so he went into the lab to figure out different routes he could take to save some more time the biggest thing he decided on was to finally start using the 7-9 clips the old route at the end of world 7 was to use the cloud to skip over stage 7-9 straight to the fortress this is because 7-9 is normally a super slow stage you've got to go up down left and right all the way through this maze-like level the new route karua used was a bit different he was not going to use the cloud for 7-9 and instead use it in the world eight fortress he was just gonna play through 7-9 and in order to make it fast enough to make it worth it he had to use these clips into the walls there were two different routes of doing these clips a four-clip route that saved up to 16 seconds and a two-clip route that saved up to eight seconds where he could also pick up a fire flower if you needed it keep in mind each of these clips required both a pixel perfect jump and lucky sub pixel positioning each missed clip costs about 4 seconds and given that runners could sometimes spend a dozen tries on a clip this was really risky to go for he would need to get the two clips in four total tries to break even or the four clips in eight tries but in february 2017 karua had a run 17 seconds ahead of his personal best in the world 7. when he came to 7-9 he decided to go for the clips but was only going to do the two-clip version because he needed to pick up a fire flower and the clips didn't go too well it took him five tries to get the two clips ending with a net loss of four seconds this run however would go on to get no hands in world 8 and be a new world record of 5120 21 seconds away from his goal a month and a half later korea was on a run that was very close after world 7. the 7-9 clips hadn't done in many favors it took him 8 tries to get the 4 clips meaning he broke even on them but he did have a few seconds to save in world 8 if everything went perfectly and then in the last level this clip normally was much easier than the other clips you have to get into the gap as big mario then get ejected out of the wall to the other side but he missed it first try and had to waste a couple of seconds doing it again no big deal right tied world record well shoot it was okay though just three days later karua got a run with the post 2-3 early hammer the type that skips two levels and saves 15 seconds overall bad hammer brother luck in the middle worlds forced him to use a fancy strategy that he had developed in 6-10 to pick up fire and skip having to use the p-wing in 6-9 the 7-9 clip started off poorly with the first clip coming third try but then [Music] six tries overall meaning a net gain of eight seconds for karua he then got a hand in world eight but the time buffer he had still allowed for a 51-13 world record 14 seconds from his goal including this world record karua then had a streak of 20 runs that made it to world 8 on record pace that got at least one hand he didn't highlight them like kujo did but it did lead to a couple of months without any new records and then came june 6 2017. it started off like any other run he fell behind against his early hammer run and then made up most of the time world four and then in the world six fortress he clipped into the ground if he was a pixel too low he would have hit the spikes below if he was a pixel too high he would have just landed normally clipping like this however skipped the room before the boss and ejected him right where he needed to be saving seven seconds world 6 ended up being a gold split it was the fastest kurua had ever completed world 6. he was ahead of the world record then he had this happen in 7-1 and then he had this happen in 7-9 then he went into world 8. after months of grinding for a 50 kurua was on sub 51 pace after the hands for the first time ever a few stages later his journey finally came to an end [Music] the first 50 in super mario bros 3 worthless history karua had accomplished his goal his journey started by beating black hassue back in 2012 with a 54-34 and culminated with a 50-57 in june 2017. not long after this run crew retired from speedrunning he said that it's possible he'll make a return someday but regardless his legacy from super mario bros 3 speedrunning is honorable world record after world record in every category and developing a long lasting rivalry with mitch the only other runner to consistently match his level of play but mitch wasn't done yet he wanted to get the world record back getting another sub 51 wasn't going to be easy so he decided to do attempts every single day starting in january 2018 until he broke the record and since he's mitch he was going to grind for early hammer he wanted the time save he lost run after run in world 2 as he grinded for early hammer but he did eventually see results in march he got his first personal best in almost a year with a 5102 so close so close man he was headed on the right track just a few seconds away from kuru's world record it was inevitable the record would be his soon but nobody expected the run that would come on march 24th 2018. oh my god dude world 2 stop [Music] uh for rta runners it saves no time it started with a post 2-3 early hammer in world 2. this splits on the left comparisons is 5102 and the splits on the right compare against kuru's world record he had a very smooth world 3 in world 4. a gold split in world 5. that's such a dumb time sir after world 6 he was 16 seconds ahead of kuru's world record then came the 7-1 clip [Music] ridiculous he was so far ahead of kuru at this point that since he had the hammer suit he decided to avoid messing with the 7-9 clips so he went back to the old strategy of using a cloud to skip 7-9 and instead playing the fortress in world viii this was some careful strategy for mitch here's why he was 43 seconds ahead after world 7 but it's misleading part of that lead us from skipping stage 7-9 he was going to lose 40-45 seconds of world 8 from having to play the fortress but since he had the hammer suit while karua did not he was going to gain 9 or 10 seconds back from being able to use it in world viii he also had a few seconds to save for mistakes that karua made that meant he was on pace for somewhere around a 50-43 and that was a ridiculous pace but he needed to play really well and on this run more than any other he needed to get no hands this was it mitch's best chance ever to get a sub 51. he made his way through auto scrollers and other stages he went through 8-1 and then he entered 8-2 [Music] unbelievable devastating this shot right here is supposed to take out the sun it missed by pixels after getting a bad pattern from the sun after that it ended up being right where he needed to land and he lost the hammer suit any advantage he had over crow was wiped away he was neck and neck it was going to be close did i do it did i i don't think i did it i did it i did it oh my god [Music] 50 55 and that is where the world record stands today but i can guarantee that's not where it's going to stand in the future a few months after his 50-55 mitch discovered possibly the most revolutionary trick that mario 3 workless has ever seen it's possible to manipulate the game into giving you an early hammer every single run [Music] getting an early hammer is determined by where the hammer brothers move after each level the game determines which direction they move based on the exact frame you end the level on for example if you end it on frame 6523 this guy will move up but if you ended a frame later he will move a different direction instead it's possible to actually get a deathless early hammer with perfect movements after every level they move toward each other then get caught on top of each other and can't separate until they're across stage 2-3 so what mitch did was create a tool assisted speed run which lets him use save states slow down and other tools to let him end levels on the exact frames he needs to this tool-assisted speedrun ends each level in world 2 on the frame necessary for the hair brothers to move closer together and eventually on top of each other the end result is a no death early hammer what the player can then do is play this tool assisted speedrun back while they're doing their speed run and try to time the end of each level in world 2 with the tasks they usually have only one frame or a 60th of a second to time each of these or sometimes a couple of frames obviously it's not easy to get all these timings correctly in a run as it's still pretty new no world records have been accomplished yet with the manipulation but mitch has had some success with it in the few attempts he's done yeah baby and given that this type of early hammer provides a 30 to 35 second time save over no early hammer this game still has a lot of history in front of it so questions must be asked will the rivalry between kuru and mitch resume in the future i got it i think i got it oh my god i got it will a new challenger rise up yes and just how low is the record going to go just have to wait and see thanks for watching [Music] [Music] you
