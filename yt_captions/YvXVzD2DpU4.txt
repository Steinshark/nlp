welcome to the Future where we have chips implanted in our brains and the woolly mammoth has come back to life hey friends welcome back before we get into the video on some of the top Innovative Technologies that will have an impact on you your career and daily life I need to share with you about coding Dojo I've shared about coding dojo in many of my past videos you know I am a boot camp grad myself in a huge believer of the impact it can have on your life as Tech is evolving at such a fast pace which we'll explore in this video you need to be able to evolve and grow with these Technologies and be aware of them and one of the best ways to do that is continuing to level up continuing to upscope and I don't know about you but for me I need a community of people to uplift me while I'm learning especially when I'm learning difficult things that maybe are new to me or maybe I'm shifting into a different career path I need that support of Teachers Community experts and the list goes on one thing that I really love about coding Dojo is aside from their options for flexible courses whether you want part-time or full-time they also too have a huge support for after you graduate once you graduate the program you will have access to their job resources for an unlimited amount of time so if you go and land your dream job but then maybe say a few years down the road you're ready to look for another one your initial investment with coding Dojo will still be active meaning you will still be able to access their job resources as someone who works in tech one thing I noticed too is I'm starting to see a lot of coding Dojo graduates and this is because I work a lot with really interesting oftentimes higher level companies that have really hired the best of the best and I was on their website coding dojo's website and I saw that they have over 13 000 graduates so no wonder I'm starting to see a lot of coding Dojo grads working in the industry which is really exciting to see and I think for you if you are leveling up or looking to level up having going to a coding Boot Camp or a boot camp whether it be coding related whether it be data science related cyber security what it will do too is when you graduate you will have access to this network all of a sudden you are unlocking these doors to have the ability to connect with this huge network of people who are also graduates and as you know you can't help but be a bit in love with other graduates from where you went to school so it's a great way to make those connections I linked more information on coding Dojo down below so make sure to go check it out foreign Labs has been up to they are going to revolutionize in my opinion the video game industry there are two things I want to show you with blockade Labs the first is sketch to AI tools so you essentially can create a sketch whatever comes to your mind and it will create a virtual environment or a digital world you could say and some people have been like well it's if you can kind of do this with other tools already not on this level and not the ability for anyone the general public to have zero training to be able to go in sketch whatever they want and this digital world will be generated this is pretty wild if you ask me and you can really see how this can change the video game industry when you think of how video games are created but also to who are creating video games no longer do you need to be extremely technical to be able to create these digital worlds for video games you can create them faster you can create them with more people involved who aren't even that technical it's really fascinating to me the other thing that I've been tinkering around with with blockade Labs is their Skybox AI but it's not sketched to AI what it is is text AI this is really interesting to me because you can create a virtual space in seconds and I don't know about you but it made me get really creative I'll link this tool these tools down below by the way and you simply can input a text of whatever kind of world you want and it will be output and once again this will really have an impact on the Creator economy on the video game economy super interested to hear your thoughts about it we have smartphones smart cars smart watches It Feels Like Everything nowadays is smart thanks to technology but you know what hasn't been smart yet thanks to technology is our brains well Tiff our brains are already smart okay I know I know what you're saying but just hear me out I'm sure many of you are familiar with Elon musk's company neuralink and it's been around for a while now but they are making huge advancements I was watching one of their demos from a few months ago actually well I was from 2022 and they were demoing the difference between the chip from a 2021 demo versus to where they are at today with a monkey and the accuracy and how quick it can go pick up the yellow dots I'll put on screen here it's really fascinating that was a few months ago and they're continuing to work at a very quick pace so what would be possible with these chips implanted in our brains well a variety of things and I think that's yet to be determined but how they describe it in many articles describe it is something like this marketing pitch you want to learn a new language what about French all you need to do download it on your brain you bad at math no worries have you downloaded on your brain yet sounds pretty wild doesn't it what about I know where as humans our initial reaction is to be like absolutely not I am not going to do that whatsoever what about if I chose what if we kind of changed the the role in the stakes a little bit what about if it meant that someone you loved or even yourself who is losing their memory was able to regain access to that what if it meant that you would have the ability to uh do things that you never even thought were possible in turn making for better quality life maybe more income and overall a happier person now how do you feel about it well that doesn't sound so bad for me especially with the memories aspect that sounds really interesting that's a hard one to lose I'm curious to hear your thoughts though based on what I just shared with you would you be willing to input a chip into your brain I'm on the fence I we have to see where this is going I always try and say open to technology but that's that's a big one next one is dragan and this is at first look you might be like ah it's kind of similar to photoshop you can manipulate images but it's regenerating where you are manipulating images so what does that mean unlike Photoshop where you are simply just stretching out the images and modifying the existing images say with their warp tool what this is doing is it's actually regenerating the image underneath so for these examples as you see especially with animals you can see you know the mouths being open and the teeth shown or the paused placed in different places or even humans you can see their expressions changing that is regenerating it's not just moving around pixels it's regenerating the images and you can actually to look through these images wait not look 3D they are 3D so you can look the entire image around it it's wild I really think this has the potential if they develop more Tools around it to be a huge competitor with Photoshop or at least parts of Photoshop anyways and it definitely is going to be very interesting and kind of concerning to see what kind of images people generate with this tool I mean especially when you think of how it could be used to generate different images with humans and whatnot and deep fakes although it's not a deep fake it definitely you can make people appear in images but they weren't actually that way if that makes sense very fascinating I think there's a lot of good that can come from this tool but I also think it's something that we need to regulate and be very cautious of but overall very interesting tool that will have a huge impact on designers even front-end developers I can see it having an impact on as far as having to take into consideration the content that's being put on page what they want the images to look like or the flow of the page there's so much more control we have now as far as very specific things we want want to use because we can create them now this tool is not released to the public just yet it's in demo form at the moment I'll link an article down below though so you can read more about it at least but it will be coming to the general public soon did you know last year a man lived with pig heart inside of him for about two months yes he needed an organ transplant wasn't able to find one in time so in turn they used a pig heart now there's a lot more to the story than I'm sharing I'll link it down below it's super fascinating for those of you are interested but it really brings up the question around the need for human organs and the lack of Supply this is something that many companies have been working on trying to solve many scientists have and it's already happening in the works it's specifically called 3D bioprinting where they are printing off different layers of skin different tissue bones and in experiments right now seeing how different bodies would react now before I let me back up a sec it's not actually used to the general public right now these are controlled scenarios where they are testing on in Labs on different substances it's not necessarily going directly into humans at this time key word is at this time but very soon it will be so how does this process work though 3D bioprinting essentially it is a 3D printing process that uses the patient's own cells and the main thing that has to happen with this is of course the cells the process begins by generating the cells that researchers want to bioprint which then are instructed to become organ specific cell types this is wild and the fact that this is already happening on a small scale in Labs or in test labs it's really interesting to me curious to know though if you were in need of an organ transplant and these were available to the public would you consider a 3D printed one now this next company how it would impact or this Tech Innovation how it would impact the world is well it would change the world in an instant if this is possible this company is using DNA and Technology to bring back extinct animals so one example would be they're trying to bring back the woolly mammoth Yes you heard that correctly can you imagine the woolly mammoth just walking around the earth again it's wild and they've made a lot of strides to get close to doing this in my opinion it's not a matter of if this will happen it's a matter of when this will happen and yes maybe the DNA structures will be a bit different than the original which could mean a variety of things but this company has raised a ton of money actually let's see how much money they have raised it's called colossal it's the company's name colossal raise all right so I just went on crunch base and they say as of January 31st 2023 so a few months ago really they've raised 150 million to bring back these animals it's wild and if you go on their website they have a ton of different information about why they're doing this how they're doing this is extinction is a crisis that the world is facing we see every year more animals more species going extinct at a higher rate and they are working so they can bring them back now in my opinion this is interesting on one hand but it doesn't solve the underlying issue of why these animals are going extinct or these species are going extinct and what US humans are doing to contribute to that but it is a very interesting thought all right those are some of the top Tech innovations that are being worked on today I'm curious to hear how this video ages in a year or two from now most people come to it and be like Tiff was totally wrong well not wrongs these are what the top Tech Innovations are today but did they come to life or did totally flop regardless though one main thing is that these Innovations will affect our daily lives our jobs the most important thing to do is to be aware of them and also to upskill when you can for more information on coding Dojo I linked it down below as well so go check it out they have some incredible courses as a boot camp grad myself I can see the impact that this school can have on people's lives whether it be Financial Freedom whether it be the flexibility to work remotely it's endless I linked it down below alright make sure to hit that subscribe button that like button and leave some other comments down below around future technologies that you think are going to blow up in in a good way [Music]
