ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Chess World Cup 2023 this is a knockout tournament that starts with 128 players and the top finishers will qualify for the candidates chess tournament which is the tournament that determines who will play for the World Chess Championship Magnus Carlson is playing Hikaru Nakamura is playing Fabiano caruana giri you name it a top player is there and they're probably one of your favorite players now Magnus has started like a locomotive and in this video I'm going to show you how he used a ridiculous stockfish-like idea to deliver a sensational game also how he avoided nearly collapsing there's going to be a Hikaru game we're gonna go all around and then we're going to take a look at the bracket uh it's gonna be spectacular I uh buckle up so uh and as you can see we will also have a good catch game as well uh Magnus Carlson actually in the round of 32 got paired against Ariana who who's the number two from Norway I mean that's brutal you gotta knock out a countryman uh Magnus began this game with the move d4 and invited on this third move the nimso Indian defense normally when black starts like this white most frequently plays Knight F3 to try to play a Catalan to try to play a two-night setup uh but going like this is very forcing because you are trying to play the move E4 and hear Black can play Bishop to B4 which is exactly what black wants and it's one of the most theoretically complicated openings in chess now Magnus plays E3 you will notice he spent six minutes on the fourth move maybe he got locked in the toilet uh but it's more than that it's the fact that the nimso Indian is extremely complex it is very very very complicated there are a lot of branches already white can play no less than something like seven lines white can still play this queen C2 and E3 are the main Lines within E3 and queen C2 there are lines white can play Bishop D2 A3 F3 G3 okay Queen B3 if you really want to um Bishop to G5 there are so many lines and Magnus plays E3 but then he does not play Knight F3 or Knight E2 or Bishop D3 or any of the lines that look like they should follow E3 he plays Bishop to D2 this has become very very trendy and the idea is basically I want to do this and I want to take with my Bishop I do not want to double my Pawns so that is the thing that he goes for now let's also keep in mind these two are friends uh they've probably trained together and they probably know some of each other's opening ideas which makes this a little bit stranger tari plays C5 he thinks a little bit he plays C5 he's going to play C5 and then D5 and then chop everything down we're gonna have a very clarified position Magnus plays A3 so far we have not seen the uncorking of the idea and now tari instead of attacking the center plays Knight to E4 and tries to just get the bishop to something like Bishop D3 take take B6 put the bishop on the diagonal and uh black has absolutely no problems here in the opening D6 Knight D7 it's a totally totally equal position so Magnus plays Knight E2 with the intention of taking back the bishop with the Knight Atari plays B6 the idea to bring out the bishop over here to either of these two squares to apply pressure now Magnus plays this move D5 okay D5 closes up the center doesn't allow black to take anymore and the bishop is open you're occupying a bit of space for moving Knight C6 and also Bishop B7 no longer has any control in the diagonal tari plays Bishop to A6 which attacks the pawn over here which you would think would be defended with the move Pawn to B3 there is literally nothing else uh you could play Queen D3 but that's not a great move because your queen will be induced forward and uh there's a really goofy line here like this but the queen actually gets trapped so you would think after Bishop to A6 that he's going to defend this Pawn with either the pawn or maybe in some obscure way with the queen but no in this position uh Magnus spends a little bit of time and he plays an idea that is really really dank it is a dank idea uh another way to defend the pawn on C4 is to not defend it at all it's to create a threat that's equal or exceeding in danger F3 which attacks the Knight and then if this this and this is defending that and life is good and then if take you know you're gonna take with a Pawn La or the night life is going to be good however F3 does not actually defend this Pawn at all and it looks like at this point Magnus Carlson blunders upon Knight C3 Knight C3 and in this position after I have just told you that this Pawn is defended by this bishop ariantari plays Bishop take C4 and as you can see from the evaluation bar something's wrong he's supposed to be losing a bishop but magnus's move F3 allows Queen H4 check which would attack the bishop and the King you cannot start with Queen to H4 because then I would go G3 but you can start with Queen H4 after this because after it takes Queen H4 you're just going to win a pawn but it's Magnus Carlson I mean obviously he didn't lose that pawn by accident and now Magnus plays H4 in fact he plays H4 instantly because if you subtract 30 seconds from his time that means he played H4 with 20 seconds on the clock he had 24 in the beginning he spent four seconds on this move Magnus Carlsen loses a pawn in the opening just absolutely loses a pawn and just plays H4 doesn't Castle he's moved all the Pawns in front of his King his King is open and Airy and it looks like he can be invaded at any moment doesn't matter you know what the idea is the idea is make a move for black just make a move it's not so easy if you put your night out on the edge of the board he's gonna go H5 if you try to stop him like this he's gonna play Rook H4 and your queen is trapped how did that what how did that happen well that's the idea the idea is to advance the pawn far enough that it just takes squares away and then play Rook H4 and then just play this position put the King on F2 nice and solid bring out the queen Bring Out The Rook Bring Out The Rook to the center bring out this Rook over he just plays H4 and Aryan tries to develop his pieces but after B3 Magnus has four of his five pieces on their starting squares after 16 moves and every Pawn has been pushed but the queen has to go here now there's a fork Queen A5 check this blocks this takes and he grabs the rook in the corner and then he trades the queens and emerges in this position this was Magnus Carlson's preparation he prepared over 20 moves to get this position where he has a rook for a knight and two pawns like a six pawns white has four and essentially he is arguing that due to the split structure that black has like the pawns are not all together they are weak and they are exploitable and Magnus will pose problems in The Rook vs Knight end game so he allows the pawn over here to be captured uh he could have tried to hang on with like Rook C3 but then black would have played B5 A5 A4 so instead he goes here plays King F2 brings his Rook wins this pawn and now basically has to win this end game where black has two split pawns he's gonna go over here but then in that time white is going to sneak over here and try to pose problems and orientare has to defend this absolutely nightmarish endgame against Magnus but he's doing it he's doing it now it's very difficult you know if if he plays King C5 and just tries to advance Magnus is going to play Rook to h8 that attacks this Pawn if takes takes and you push now I've created an outside pass pawn and I'm probably going to win this game all right I don't even have to rush with that but H5 and then after something like Knight F6 I got H6 you play B4 you know I don't know maybe I want to play King of four king of five B3 King F5 it's a very tough position to defend because I'm I'm always fast enough and unfortunately well fortunately depending on who you're cheering for Aryan goes here and that unfortunately strands the H Pawn and uh between the weakness of the H Pawn and the fact that black has four Pawn Islands Four pawns but they're all Islands they have no neighbors and it's very easy to hunt them down black simply runs out of moves King D4 Rook G7 Rook A7 check from the side one Pawn down two pawns down on B3 and this is just the winning King and pawn end game because after King F5 King C4 King C5 black simply runs out of moves and you lose this end game our entare resigned Magnus Carlson played this game at nearly perfect accuracy uh he uh he played an opening which sacrificed the pawn pushed his H Pawn won an exchange and then converted this end game absolutely beautifully now it wasn't all smooth sailing uh the very next day because they have to play two games against each other Magnus played a Karo Khan and Arya and tari just went at him I mean he was he was out for Revenge he went after Magnus look at this E6 sacrificing a pawn to get him to compromise his structure ef7 this was a very complicated game Knight F3 H4 and you know Magnus created this obscure setup and Arya and put pressure on the e-pawn not letting it move forward put his Knight there developed his pieces and had a fantastic position where for the early stage of the game it really looked like he had everything under control and if Aryan could break through over here he would be in great shape Magnus is going to try to create counter play on The Queen side uh this all culminated right around in this moment when C5 was on the board take take and rather than taking Aryan played Knight D3 attacking the pawn in this position Magnus has to play Pawn takes D4 because he has to remove the access to the C5 square instead he played C4 and if Knight C5 now black plays knight uh Knight D7 or there is Knight G6 as well just blocking the pawn and then you will uh simply attack on this side but in this position after C4 Ari antari can do what is called a clearance sacrifice and he can play Pawn to G6 that loses upon three different ways but the idea is that the G file is open and the bishop can go there so after this this he is actually winning he has a winning Advantage versus Magnus Rook G8 Rook G1 Bishop G5 on the way and if something like this oh not like that but if like this and you know over here Queen F2 and it's just a slow matter of time it's just a matter of time before you try to get in on the dark squares of course there is still a lot of game to be played but G6 was the idea but Arien unfortunately gets blockaded and with that side of the board completely sealed the players rotate this way and uh Magnus actually could have probably applied more pressure from this position potentially but the players agree to withdraw uh because uh the only open file now is the B1 and everything is going to get traded opposite colored Bishops and Magnus Carlson Bittersweet moment eliminates his friend aryantari uh yeah there was like this obscure G6 move that that might have given Aryan some winning chances but that's what the computer said all right that is not what I'm saying that is what the computer said Magnus Carlsen has eliminated aryantari uh with an absolutely spectacular win in the first game where he just played he just played this he just played like this he he played some ridiculous engine idea and he won now Hikaru Hikaru hasn't won a game yet in classical chess he drew two games against Karthik venkataraman from India then he drew the first game against Benjamin gledura from Hungary but okay Hikaru was black I mean you can't just beat everybody I mean Magnus was but even Magnus made a draw but this game Hikaru plays a Spanish he plays D3 and uh it's gonna be a long maneuvering complex game we have A3 we have C4 uh the first trait happens after 17 moves of action a very tense position Hikaru captures cladora captures Hikaru goes for his Bishop gladora says no Knight G3 rotates to the king side and there's hikara look at this basically Hikaru is already threatening to win the game essentially what I mean by that is Bishop takes F6 is lethal Queen H5 Knight here block the center bring a rook to the third rank uh it's very very bad stuff so now we're gonna have an explosion of Pawns on the queen side and the following position where Hikaru has a slight Edge he has a slight Edge because his pieces are a little bit more active and a little bit more useful this bishop is sort of staring at a brick wall hikaru's pieces are not and this Rook is staring at an open file and this one isn't but the open file is not that useful Knight F1 Hikaru trades off Black's only active piece let's put it this way so now that Bishop is just gone and now it's essentially a question of whose light squared Bishop is better and it's hikarus and a couple of moves later he makes a couple of preparations uh the dark squares have been severely weakened you will remember that earlier in this game the move G6 was played by gladura this is a massive strategic risk uh it was probably better for him if he was going to push anything to play H6 but because he played G6 Hikaru very very confidently trades off the dark squared Bishop puts his queen as the replacement to the dark squared attacker and just plays F4 and now he is posing some very serious problems gladura has 10 minutes to make 11 moves which is not a lot of time uh he plays Knight to H5 Hikaru plays Knight to G4 and as you can see this is bad and this is gonna open The Rook is going to come to the f file the second Rook is going to come to the f file and then one two three four and five pieces are gonna attack one two Defenders I mean this this bishop just got there and and and you're gonna see it it doesn't participate in this game much that Bishop moved there on uh the ninth move of the game Bishop to B7 and then the entire game is happening without that Bishop's input like nobody is asking for that Bishop's opinion it's barely participating and uh Here Comes Hikaru and in this position Knight takes E5 he wins a pawn and now he is completely winning if he plays Knight takes F7 and Knight takes F7 is not a complex calculation you just go here and the idea is Rook takes you don't take you use the uh you use PP on the PPE which is put pressure on the pin piece Rook F1 and if black defends you take and then you PP on the pp again and then after something like Knight to F4 uh you just take because now there's another PP on the pp G3 completely winning position Queen D3 Rook out four check mate will follow uh and uh you know maybe in this position there is like Queen A2 check and maybe Hikaru just didn't like that his King was a little bit weak here but uh Queen F2 Rook f8 you see like you know the computer makes a little bit of a comeback but um instead of that Hikaru plays Knight G4 which is still winning and he still applies pressure he is still a pawn up and um you will notice that Black's Bishop went back to C8 on developing and then to B7 and this was just a a dominant performance from Hikaru in this position gladura resigned he didn't have to resign but he was about to lose a second pawn and if he tried to defend the second Pawn then Rook F6 would have happened so he would have lost the queen ah bishop or a queen he might have you know he might have not seen that so Hikaru wins and kikaru is into the round of 16 just like Magnus Carlson uh which is amazing uh it's good that we have had no upsets for them we have had other upsets uh this was uh a game from the Women's World Cup uh Elena hobers is playing I'm trying to pronounce her name the Dutch way but listen y'all those of you who speak Dutch you know that this is not easy um it's like rubish I'm I'm doing my best all right I speak a few languages I don't speak Dutch uh she has been absolutely murdering people like when she leaves the playing Hall they drug test her okay I I have no evidence of this whatsoever I'm simply saying she has stomped the field okay and today against Claudia coulon from Poland it really did not stop she played a king's Indian defense which is a very very tense opening position her opponent went at her uh her opponent castled on opposite sides and this is just just a good old-fashioned fight I'm talking about uh Ramirez versus Anderson all right the White Sox game yesterday when he landed the punch that was ridiculous stuff Knight C5 A5 and Elena is just like yo you want to attack me [Laughter] it's like the Joker you want to know how I got these scars and I'm I mean look at look look at this H4 this is she is walking her down meanwhile this is a sniper the a file the queen is coming in b5c69 B3 on the way Bishop C6 white arrives with G5 stopping any black advancements now H5 and takes and Bishop H3 and Rook H1 somebody's gonna get checkmated Rook A5 from Elena now in this position Claudia just had to go because after Bishop takes B5 C takes B5 Rook takes B5 E5 is the key sealing out the bishop and after something like D5 now you play Bishop F1 which forces The Rook away and now you continue your attack the thing is if you don't play Bishop F1 and if you play Pawn takes G6 A3 and then there's B3 and then there's sacrifices and then there's another Knight coming to C5 and then you try to deliver Checkmate but it's actually you who is getting checkmated in a crazy turn of events so it's a very complex position she addresses the position over here and in this position B5 cb5 and white thought her opponent was going to play Bishop takes B5 but in this position Elena sacrifices Rook takes B5 creating a necessity for white to address the attack she takes the Rook Queen takes B5 but the queen gets closer the queen avoids a trade of Queens somehow Black's position is elastic it is defending it is attacking at the same time the bishop takes the Knight but the Knight is replaced with another Knight M5 and here comes Bishop E5 escaping the Trap and hitting the Knight on G3 and then the Rook on H2 Pawn takes E6 Bishop takes G3 attacks The Rook but E7 is a discovered Jack and The Rook is under attack so The Rook has to block The Rook moves out of danger attacking the bishop the bishop moves gives a check the king slides out of danger and now the king unpins himself the pawn is a square away from queening but the bishop on C6 the MVP preventing the queen H5 white is still trying to create an attack but down the e-pawn has fallen Bishop D3 Pawn takes H5 and now that same MVP Bishop who for a long time prevented a promotion rotates backwards and it's not just for defense it is also for offense the king is protected the Bishops guard the king and attack the white king and now it's time to pay up a takes B3 on passion Knight takes E4 Knight C3 is a check B2 is a check and in this position White's King is check mated and Elena moves on to the quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup she has played six games of classical chess and she has six wins she's a beast she is a beast and that that that that women's bracket has also the Women's World Champion Juan Jun uh Alexander okay who was the previous Challenger to the Women's World Championship so it's one to watch but Elena has been a she just like murks people like I don't even her chest style is ridiculous uh and it really really works uh and by the way we've got other uh amazing games we have Alexi serrana versus kiril chefchenko which just a year ago would have been a matchup of Russia and Ukraine because Alexei represented Russia and Korea represented Ukraine but now Alexi moved his Federation for obvious reasons to uh Serbia uh and kiril has moved his Federation to Romania and I can only imagine it's because there's big opportunities right now in Romanian chess like uh report represents Romania as well so uh they seem to be building a very strong team so it's just crazy to see Serbia versus Romania when it's these two players um and this this was a so a quick note about this game it was 26 moves and it was 99.5 accuracy watch it is a grun-filled defense Bishop G5 Bishop G7 and in this position rather than developing he takes the Knight he wins the pawn but black now starts firing away at his Center and continues to fire away at his Center and his B2 Pawn Knight to B3 A5 going after the Knight Pawn to E3 A4 going after the Knight Bishop to B5 check now Knight to D4 and everything is traded and this is the position this is the position but look at the time Alexi Serrano has not spent any time he hasn't thought this is his prep best move for black now Rook A5 Knight C3 Knight A6 King D2 it has been 17 moves he still has not stopped to think the king is coming to the queen side The Rook is going to go to the center line maybe you're going to advance over here he is up nearly one hour on the clock he's not winning but this is a very tough position to defend black plays King D7 which is an inaccuracy you're supposed to play Knight to B4 and try to take this Pawn with the Knight right away King to D7 now B4 now here's the thing about B4 there is onpass song but then you trade the Rooks and night before there is this Knight takes D5 and he gets to take on B7 now Serana actually played the rest of his prep he just stopped to think in this position all of this was the right stuff but here black should have played King C8 allowed this and then played rook d8 and tried to defend this position both Rooks guard the Knight it's unpleasant there might be Knight E4 and Knight C5 but it's holdable unfortunately after 20 moves of getting hit with preparation shevchenko played Knight C7 one mistake Rook B1 Knight B5 and he's simply going to lose the game because the Knight is going to A7 it arrives on A7 there is nothing black can do black plays Rook A8 I play Rook C1 not not Rook D1 Rook C1 and Rook C7 and then I take the I take over there Knight i7 Rook A7 and in this position kiril shivchenko resigned His World Cup campaign is over and Alexis Arana is through to the round of 16 with a 99.5 accuracy zero inaccuracies in this game zero mistakes zero blunders zero missed wins he's just played a perfect game I mean he just played from start to finish a perfect game of chess where he applied pressure onto his opponent in preparation and then he had to convert the advantage and his opponent made one mistake and Serana wins and you know who else we are watching in this event we are watching the newly minted number nine ranked chess player in the world the number one ranked player in India ukesh who's playing SL Narayanan who's a very strong Red Master in his own right and this game was uh was a fun one it was an open Spanish an open Spanish is when black takes on e4 and then plays B5 and D5 we don't see it very often at top level because they're kind of wimpy they prefer to play solidly uh Knight C5 Bishop G4 and uh it was in this game that go cash went for an attack then he took the night and then he went for an attack on that side of the board he's playing in the center he's playing on the queen size playing on the on the king side putting pressure on black Central pawns A4 gukesh is using all his resources it's a beautiful display of how all his pawns on on all three sides of the board are advancing how he's pushing black backwards and black has to defend black strikes back with the move C5 we have takes takes and now the Knight plops into the center of the board B4 white takes on B4 the bishop takes on B4 now white makes a rook move to activate along the C file and now the Knight jumps into the position which attacks the bishop on A5 and hits the Knight on E7 and if the Knight takes on C6 the pawn on D5 is going to fall with various tactics Bishop takes D5 Bishop C6 Bishop F7 pressure various Queen C4 ideas as well Rook C6 Rook C5 all this different stuff black plays Knight to B4 that was not the best move the best move was to take on E5 and then jump in here to cut Communications but like we've seen chess is just one mistake so Knight to B4 Bishop takes A8 we have the queen taking the pawn on A4 The Rook slides out of the way to hit the Queen the queen slides the Bishop to E4 trying to trade off Black's light squared Bishop takes takes Queen takes H3 you can't rush to take the bishop because Queen G4 check is a fork but he's not going to blunder that instead he plays Bishop to E3 now the queen on e4 defends the pawn on G4 the bishop goes back to C7 now the bishop gets chased Bishop to B8 The Rook infiltrates the C5 H5 Rook C1 we trade the Queens but kukesh plays Rook to C8 and that move hits The Rook if you take take I win the bishop with a fork and if you play something like Rook f8 take take and it's more of the same Rook to C8 Narayanan resigns Who cashes into the round of 16 he is now Five Points higher than Vichy Anand on the India ratings list that is the highest Gap that anybody has ever had he's officially and dominantly becoming the number one ranked chess player in India also he is two rating points away from being the number seven ranked chess player in the world gukesh is two rating points away from eclipsing Anish giri and Wesley so two players that have been at the top of chess for over 10 years as the number seven ranked chess player in the world let's take a look at our bracket all right this is absolutely Sensational stuff welcome to the World Cup bracket on the on the video website it's uh at the very top we have Magnus Carlson and Vincent kaima they are going to be meeting in the quarterfinals uh excuse me in the round of 16. here we await the winner of vahal sanap and Anton karabov and vasil Evancho can weigh Yi everything is tied at one Rasmus suane eliminates the Cinderella story of Ting Jing Yao from Singapore and he will play the winner of Wang Hao and and David Howell gukesh monster sending home a fellow Indian it's bittersweet but there are five Indian players remaining okay I'm talking about uh uh where are they video is still remaining and by the way Danielle vocaturo from Italy defeating Daniel dubov that's a massive result vidit is still in nehal is still in we have uh uh we have our generic I say somewhere here where is he Eric I see Arjun Eric icy is still here all right we have uh we have progdananda still here and on the other side we have Hikaru and probably it's going to be Hikaru versus Prague which is uh which is crazy which is an incredible sight uh and uh obviously they are on other sides Java Kirsten from Uzbekistan knocking out Maxim vashay lagrav from France that is a massive result a lot of these matches will be decided in the tie breaks uh and uh on the women's side we have uh we have already some some quarterfinal matchups animals that should qualifying uh she will play the winner of this matchup over here she might actually play her sister which is kind of wild umalova we have uh Alia Medina varda from um from Indonesia which is which is an amazing run and um Elena awaits the winner of harika vs Java kashrilli and you know what's Australia awaits the winner of good ashken versus Divya Des Mook so the women's side is around faster because uh there are there are there are less women that's just the reality and also I guess some of the format stuff but we're not going to open that Pandora's box right now uh Magnus Carlsen winning in in style Hikaru winning in style a lot of matchers will still be decided in the tie breaks this was fun if you're watching this on the day it comes out which is August 6th uh have a great Sunday if you're watching this at any point in the future I hope you've had a great Sunday or multiple great Sundays ice cream and also the day of the week uh that's all for me get out of here
