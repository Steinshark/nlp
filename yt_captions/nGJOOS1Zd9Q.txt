so apparently a few of you people have already seen this short okay I have not seen it but it sounds like everybody's very excited about it PHP is slow and being a blocking language that's a pretty valid statement if we have a basic script that returns back some Json from a file start up a local server and Benchmark it we get about 630 requests per second that same script in node gets us 7,500 requests per second and in go we see over 12,000 go Supremacy go so good so far everything seems right I like it I like it I like it this is nice those are two languages that process requests asynchronously by default allowing for more concurrency or processes happening at the same time we can add this to PHP by utilizing an asynchronous runtime like open swool after installing the open swole I didn't realize PHP had such Chad named libraries what's this one this one's open swole I wrote it while cruising through the hills of my Lamborghini okay okay calm down PHP guy attention in requiring the library we'll have to make some slight adjustments to our code okay that's fair you're making it now running the scripts made made it concurrent we get it made it concurrent uh let's go but server process and if we Benchmark this we're getting almost 30,000 Get Wrecked go get wrecked oh my goodness buns and shambles even phps f faster than bun oh no all that work imagine how much work you went on th requests per second way more than node or go and the average response time is being registered in micros seconds so who says PHP is slow and being a check the comments all right let's go hi Andrew can you record a practical lesson about open swo I can't how can you ever take how can you take the name seriously please show us how to build and deploy production grade uh swole apps what are the gotchas why is everyone really stoked about wow everyone loves swoll open swoll and Laurel octane can you repeat with pm2 node has acing properties but main thread still single what the hell did I just read first off what's pm2 it's a process manager everything costs keep it simple hey man what benchmarking tool are you using that's a good question work okay works good works great but uh let's see but there's a patchy a patchy Benchmark you shouldn't use a patchy Ben Mark I didn't know this Jared uh let me know this one uh it only it it does a non-connection keeping http1 1.1 requests so work seems to be better uh way more than node are you sure about that with fastify you get 40,000 requests per second CJs you get 34,000 ex requests per second also go should be just massively faster too so go you must be goofing up Express is literally one of the slowest HP libraries in node.js of all the libraries you picked one of the slowest and compared it to the fastest pH HP you know only to justify PHP is fast faster than node and go not to mention again go is like way way way way fast that's actually very fast oh no oh no people oh man is this how it does is this how is this how it works all you got to do dude I should start making I should start making the greatest stuff I could make so many bad benchmarks I could make so many amazing benchmarks and start releasing shorts that are complete disinformation think about it where JavaScript is faster than C every person's going to click on that and here's the best part everyone's going to repeat it over and over and over and over again think about it this is basically politics I'm basically becoming I'm becoming a a politician JavaScript faster than C so you're probably asking yourself how ridiculous is that statement well actually how do you know about servers and then what I'll do is I'll create a server in C and I create a server in JavaScript and because C isn't uh by default like uh async read async WR boom that Berkeley socket so slow compared to node so slow serving one request at a time and then just release that or just like toss a mutex in there so that like look it's multi-threaded and then just throw a mutex in one spot where it's counting then just screw the whole thing up see how much slower it is can't even increment a number as fast oh oh this is so good this is so good there's like an entire art here that I really need to learn like lean into you compare yeah I did compare uh just for just so for those that don't know I did do this uh not too long ago this is just an echo server in bun right so an echo server means you give me a string and I send back the echo like the same thing right so that's all the server was doing and boom look at that okay bun was doing 60,000 RPS that's with all of buns best things go was doing 183,000 crab langang was doing 287,000 obviously very very simple server right you shouldn't even really take these numbers now add PHP swole now add that swole the swollen the name did you press like And subscribe and the swollen
