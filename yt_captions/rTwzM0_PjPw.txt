billion dollar bankruptcies are like superhero movies at first they were exciting there were only a few of them you knew they cost tons of money so you figured I'll check it out but at this point we've seen so many it's getting boring this is just a bunch of characters I don't care about with the exact same plot but every now and then a super villain emerges so insane so disgusting that they pull me back in I'm talking of course about the CEO of Celsius Alex machinski and his wife Christy machinsky because as a quick reminder Celsius is a crypto company that is in bankruptcy right now with billions of dollars owed that they do not have so what are they doing to plug the hole are they hard at work no they're selling merch merch that says unbankrupt yourself that's right folks for 28 you could pay the people who caused your bankruptcy literally millions of people have money locked up in Celsius probably gone forever because of the machinski's and the machinski's decision is to sell merch about it and I know the obvious reaction to this is that there must be some mistake they got hacked it's an accident well no because it turns out Chrissy machinski got called out for this and when she did she didn't apologize she said thank you for promoting the shirt they're going to increase t-shirt production because of this this is so unhinged bankrupting millions and then selling a shirt that says unbankrupt yourself this is crazier than if Taco Bell sold shirts saying undiarrhea yourself it's like wait a second you caused this you did this to me with your Dorito taco thing you concocted in a lab right you told me this was food I didn't create this mess like there's literally no way to interpret unbankrupt yourself as anything but taunt the victims of your plan and what's worse is the background to all this because remember unbankrupt yourself isn't just some random saying it's a modification of their original catchphrase remember they told everyone they needed to unbank themselves that's literally the whole point of Celsius the idea that Banks were evil and that Celsius is different because Celsius isn't a bank which makes it awkward when Celsius declares bankruptcy so their motto actually changed from unbank yourself to unbankrupt yourself who knew five letters could do so much of the heavy lifting and I think we have to acknowledge that this is pretty funny right uh while also acknowledging the pain of the people who lost everything and how horrible this is I mean the machinski's are just running this whole thing like a Ringling Brothers Circus so it is entertaining no matter how serious it also is the machitzkis are just Shameless I mean I'm not going to be surprised if they sell bankruptcy documents as nfts after all this but if you thought that was bad it actually gets worse because like the Dorito Taco at Taco Bell there are layers to this Abomination you see recently a secret call of Celsius got leaked it was in all hands where Celsius was supposedly going to unveil the big plan to recover this whole thing remember I said at the beginning of this whole debacle that they should just close up shop Chapter 7 bankruptcy I said it in my first video about them but Celsius told everyone no they were going to save the company so this is the time that they were going to discuss the big plan the big plant that's going to change everything and put Celsius back on the right path so what is this plan to recover billions of dollars third chapter is US reopening our services right so we gave it a code named Kelvin right absolute zero so we're planning to be basically we're planning to reopen with a process that does not require you to trust us in anything we literally made a joke about like Fahrenheit Celsius when we first heard about this doing wait little did I know that that's like their business plan is to try to trick people into thinking that it's a new company by renaming it Kelvin I guess they're also trying to go with this idea that oh this time will be trustless but that's funny because only a year ago Alex was saying their main job was to fight for trust with customers this is a fight over trust right who is going to make the most trust deposits with customers and who is not going to make any trust deposits with customers so I guess y'all are giving up that fight huh like okay guys you were right we can't be trusted which is why our new business model is admitting you can't trust us like they somehow think the word absolute zero trust is like going to get you to trust them again it's such a strange thing like deposit money with us because you can't trust us and we're admitting that not only that it gets worse when you realize that their big plan their big scheme is to start a custody service for crypto one of the foundational products that we're going to offer in the future is custody and the core concept of custody is that that's your property and we're holding it on your behalf so your big plan to save the company and rescue people's accounts who can't withdraw is to get more people to deposit I don't know if that's gonna work out for you which by the way the person who leaked this audio someone named Tiffany Fong is right now being threatened by the machine skis who aren't happy that their terrible plans have been leaked and in another delicious piece of irony Chrissy machinski wants the person who leaked it to pay back the creditors Celsius owes with the AdSense she made from leaking this video which first of all the video wasn't monetized that's for one number two you're the one who owns the Creditor like Celsius people not everyone else everyone else it's not their job to unbankrupt you this is the amazing thing is like they think that's everyone else's job besides them who got everyone in this mess so let me tell you Christy machinski you're in the wrong okay this is so messed up you have to stop selling these t-shirts you have to pay these people back and just stop with all this nonsense about this chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring where you're spending tens of millions of dollars a month on fees and if you're wondering why I'm addressing Chrissy directly is it's because in a funny twist of fate she's actually subscribed she's a subscriber to coffeezilla
