in this video we're going to look at the rise near complete collapse and recent comeback of Japanese whiskey along the way we will look at one of the world's largest distilled beverage companies suntory their histories are intertwined Japanese whiskey has a relatively Short History it has borrowed a lot from Scotland yet the industry has also managed to come into its own pour one out guys and follow along with me but please drink responsibly and if you're like me and can't drink alcohol then get a soda or something a little fun after writing this script I decided to feed the same prompt into open ai's chat GPT been the latest rage feel free to pause the video to read the script and compare it to the actual video that follows but before we move on I want to talk a bit about today's sponsor Masterworks I'm not sure if you know this but I really love visiting art museums and looking at the art inside I love it from an aesthetic perspective but also a business one being a person with a finance background I found myself really fascinated by all the recent news in the present industry about the sale of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's art collection the value of Museum grade artwork is well known but its investment potential remains a secret to many because like a vintage Japanese whiskey Fine Art can often gain value over time with today's sponsor Masterworks you can invest in contemporary art from legendary artists for a fraction of the cost the last time inflation reached these levels Contemporary Art prices appreciated at an average rate of 13.5 percent per year its Museum grade quality with each offering qualified with the FCC in eight of their nine exits Masterworks has delivered net returns over 13.9 percent to their investors in their last three they handed investors 13.9 percent 17.8 percent and 21.5 percent net returns nearly 600 000 people have signed up so far and the list is growing by the day Asian Armory viewers can get Priority Access using the special link in the description my thanks to Masterworks for sponsoring the channel the word whiskey is a Corruption of the Gaelic phrase for water as in Water of Life not even going to try to pronounce that this name stems from the Latin aquavite which means the same thing and refers to the fact that such alcoholic drinks were seen as having mystical properties thus they were exclusively handled by monks and monasteries distillation however quickly became a commercial Endeavor the first whiskey transaction on the record occurred in 1494 between the benedicting monastery at lindora's Abbey and the court of King LeBron James IV of Scotland an excerpt from the 1494x Checker role reads to Brother John Core eight bowls of malt wherewith to make aquavite for the king it's the first transaction we have on record but it's sophistication indicates that commercial activities must have already been going on for a very long time smash cut Japan whiskey was first imported into the Land of the Rising Sun in 1853 when friend Matthew Perry visited to convince the government to open up the country he served American whiskey to the Japanese delegates on his ship the official American report noted that the samurai bureaucrats seemed to relish to drink mixing it with sugar and guzzling it down the next year Perry came back and gifted the Japanese Imperial family and their aides a cask of whiskey a cast can be seen in a painting commemorating the event two days before inking the convention of Kanagawa the first touch between America and Japan the delegates got sloshed on John Barleycorn a non-specific phrase referring to barley-derived alcoholic drinks like beer and whiskey after the banquet one of the Japanese delegates threw his arms around Commodore Perry crushing the commodore's shoulder piece and said nichibe doshin this was roughly translated to Perry as Nippon and America All the Same Heart at the time of the opening the Japanese already had their own alcohol sake but with everything Western at that time being seen as modern and new they wanted to explore Western alcohols referred to as yoshu the first western-style bar opened in the 1860s serving bourbon Irish whiskey and Scotch whiskey in 1871 a Yokohama Trading Company recorded Imports of various Brands these included the cat Mark or Neko jarushi Irish whiskey which was probably Burke's Irish whiskey and a deer Mark or sicko jarushi which was probably Dalmore for many years though whiskey remained a niche market for high-class people most businesses didn't have the patients or finances to distill a drink and then age it over several years so for the ordinary folks fakes emerged made from fruit wine or mixes of authentic whiskey it proved a lot of interest in whiskey and thus incentivized people to learn how to make it at home Japanese whiskey is a descendant of scotch some modifications have been made to suit local tastes but the methods of production are similar this is due to the fact that the industry's founding members trained there in 1918 a young man named masataka takatsuru son of sake Brewers was sponsored by his employer to go to the United Kingdom to study chemistry with a particular interest in making whiskey after taking chemistry classes at Glasgow University he went to the town of Elgin in Moray Scotland to learn from J.A Nettleton a well-respected author about whiskey however Nettleton also charged a nettle's worth of fees taketsuru declined on the basis of being hella poor and decided to try talking to local distilleries in the area one such local distillery in spayside Longhorn decided to briefly take him in as an apprentice for free they are taketsuru received a brief introduction to producing whiskey about five or nine days this first day he showed up in what would eventually be his trademark clean white lab coat which bemused as hosts but there he asked questions made detailed drawings of the equipment and learned all he could after that he traveled to the bonus and then hazelburned distilleries to learn more about whiskey making it is interesting to think about whether those guys knew back then that they were training a future rival all the way in Japan or perhaps they knew that making whiskey is as much art as it was science even if he used the same ingredients same task and same equipment but in different places you get a very different whiskey in the winter of 1919 takitsuru married without ceremony the sister of one of his Glasgow University classmates Jesse Roberta Rita Cowan the families of both groom and bride were very disappointed at this venture the latter attempted to annul the marriage nevertheless the two were incredibly devoted to each other taketsuru was willing to spend the rest of his life in Scotland with her but Rita knew that her husband's lifelong dream was to make whiskey in Japan and agreed to go back with him but upon his return to Japan in 1920 takitsuru discovered that the company who sponsored him to go had changed their plans due to economic pressures so they had takitsuru make fake whiskey until he got sick of it and quit luckily for takatsuru he then came across a man named shinjiro Tori the founder of suntory shinjirotori was born in 1879 the Second Son of a rice Merchant and money changer after attending business school at Osaka he apprenticed at a medicinal wholesaler more like a pharmacy this Pharmacy happened to also sell Western alcohols like wine Brandy and whiskey his first exposure to the field a few years later in 1899 at the age of 20 Tori set up his own shop Tori shorten in the Nishi District this shop would later change his name to kotobukiya or happiness house in 1963 kotobukia would change their name again to a Centauri for consistency I'll refer to them throughout as suntory the shop imported and sold red wines from Spain however Tori found that Spanish wine did not sell out that well in Japan customers thought it was too bitter or acidic so Tori added sweeteners and flavors to make up Blended wine more suitable for the Japanese taste akadama sweet wine as it was called was released in 1907 and eventually took sixty percent of the domestic Market suntory is still selling it today over a hundred years later at the time of its release akadama wine cost many times more than an average serving of rice so it was marketed as a luxury item Tori put out newspaper ads touting the product's health benefits and hired Geisha to promote it most notably Tori produced an advertising poster featuring a shirtless photograph of the very famous contemporary opera star emiko matushima the provocative image caused the then 30 year old matsushima's parents to disowner as well as the disbandment of her Theater Company anyway akadama made Tori a very rich man but he sought to make what he thought would be the next big thing whiskey Japan had recently regained control over its import Affairs in order to encourage domestic production the government imposed High tariffs making imports from Scotland more expensive so suntory wanted to produce Scotch at home in Japan Tori originally thought about inviting a whiskey technician to come over from Scotland but coming across takatsuru decided to work with him instead thus in 1923 the two would build Japan's first whiskey Distillery they argued over where that Distillery would be taketsuru wanted Hokkaido but Tori wanted some place closer to Tokyo for logistical and business reasons he wanted passing train passengers to see The Distillery out their windows they finally settled on a location at the foot of a mountain near Osaka taketsuru Han Drew elaborate Maps which we still have today production at suntory yamazaki Distillery began in November 1924 but the duo struggled with the product takatsuru had to return to Scotland for additional insights and Tori in the meantime had suntory produce a bunch of other drinks like teas to keep the lights on five years later in 1929 they finally started selling their first product into the market shirafuda which literally means white label its slogan at the time is literally translated as absolutely do not need Foreign imports despite being Japan's first real whiskey and the appeal to nativist sentiments shirafuda did not do well reviews at the time said that this Smoky whiskey tasted terrible as though burnt a second lower priced whiskey called aquafuda also failed to take hold in the market this in turn scorched the relationship between the two Japanese whiskey Partners Tori's Whiskey Business was losing all the money his sweet wine business was making taketsuru on the other hand was an engineer through and through determined to reproduce authentic Scotch without compromise not an uncommon conundrum takatsuru eventually resigned at the end of his 10-year contract in 1934 he raised money from investors and moved to the town of yoichi in Hokkaido where he felt the weather was really suited to the production of whiskey there he founded what would eventually be Nika whiskey distilling today Nikka is a member of the Asahi group Holdings maker of that beer and one of Japan's biggest drink companies despite shirafuta's failure Tori was undeterred suntory went back to the drawing board trying a variety of aged and unaged blends taste tests were held in high-end bars in Ginza for feedback finally in 1937 suntory released the suntory kakobin this was suntori's first hit in the whiskey Market the whiskey is known for its distinctive glass bottle which is reminiscent of a tortoiseshell the emergence of a hit product came at the right time for suntory suntory whiskey became widely popular with Japanese soldiers during World War II it was an ideal soldier's drink because it keeps well and was high proof less than two years after sales began suntory shipped nearly 15 000 bottles to the quantong Army it also contributed to the war effort by distilling fuel alcohol for zero Fighters there are military contributions ensured a steady supply of barley and coal in a time of many shortages with Japan's participation in the war closing the scotch import market santori kakubin had the market to itself building a sterling reputation its success eventually paid back the company's initial losses many times over worldwide whiskey sales and consumption boomed after the war ended the yamazaki Distillery was fortunately located far away enough from Osaka that has survived the Allied bombings hundreds of age casks made it through the war soldiers served whiskey during the war brought their Newfound taste for the drink back home with them sales grew at a rapid Pace along with the country's economic rise the 1950s and 60s were some of the industry's best years to encourage Whiskey Drinking santori opened up Tories bars for average folks to gather and drink at their Peak there were over two thousand such bars in Japan whiskey became a part of Japanese culture and Ian Fleming's 1964 novel You Only Live Twice orthodologist James Bond goes to Japan and encounters Japanese whiskey he tells his contact you shouldn't have poured all that sake on top of the suntory I can't believe Japanese whiskey makes a good foundation for anything the contact tells Bond the century isn't so bad in ads but you're wrong about sanitori it's a good enough Brew Century had over 60 share of the total market and whiskey contributed up to 70 percent of company Sales Management started to feel concerned about their heavy alcoholic dependence in 1960 shinjiro Tori's son Kaizo Saji decided that the company should enter the Japanese beer brewing Market in 1963 santori launched their first beer with kidding Asahi and Sapporo already competing it was a risky decision their draft beer product which had a Danish type flavor quite different from the German lager type beers in the market gradually gained popularity throughout the 1970s and 80s in 1967 Century started producing canned beer another unusual addition at the time over the years they gained share against Asahi then the industry's leading provider as it turns out this diversification effort became incredibly useful in 1976 alone sonatory produced over 250 million bottles of Japanese whiskey over 90 percent of that production was for domestic consumption restaurants and the like unfortunately the early 1980s represented the very peak of Japanese whiskey sales by the early 1990s whiskey sales in Japan would decline by 75 percent domestic whiskey consumption became a mere shadow of itself you can point to multiple reasons for this decline first whiskey itself got more expensive in 1981 and 1984 the Japanese government raised a liquor tax on Whiskey the first tax increase caused a particularly large decrease in sales that year second Economic Times got tougher a stronger yen in the wake of the 1985 plazo Court caused a recession the popping of Japan's real estate bubble also caused Great damage to the economy a weak economy not only means that young people have less money to go out drinking with it also means fewer company outings where young people drink with their elders and get introduced to Whiskey and third whiskey just fell out of Vogue it lots the status as a Prestige drink and more started to be seen as a drink for Old Men young people perhaps unable to afford whiskey tried new drinks like vodka gin or shoju and stuck to them shoju an authentic Japanese Spirit experienced a boom of its own with consumption levels Rising 2.3 times from 1982 to 1985. you cannot say santori did not try their best to reverse Japanese Whiskey's domestic decline the company launched and marketed a plethora of new whiskey products in an attempt to appeal to younger consumers examples include suntory whiskey Q launched in 1983 targeted to younger consumers elk launched in 1985 a ride-based whiskey aged in casks made from White Oak Cobra also launched in 1985 a low-priced Corn based whiskey targeted to young men none of these really worked and suntory had to lean heavily on his diversification efforts out of whiskey to survive the slow 1990s these efforts were most successful in the non-alcoholic food and drinks businesses for a long time suntory sought to build a foreign market for their whiskey during the Allied occupation after the war foreigners got their first taste of Japanese whiskey and seemed to like it which was encouraging in 1961 suntory opened their first American office but had a hard time selling product liquor store owners in New York City asked what is Japanese whiskey is it a rice whiskey made from rice from the very start suntory tried to distinguish Japanese whiskey as its own thing not just Scotch whiskey made in Japan one of their print ads from the 1960s claimed with bombast like other classic Arts of Japan sanctori claims an ancient Heritage it is made by Artisans whose ancestors distilled the world's first Spirits more than two thousand years ago love that wording yet despite such efforts which include a massive suntory Royal whiskey billboard in Times Square whiskey exports remained very small perhaps a few bottles in a luxury department store things on both the export and domestic fronts turned around in the 2000s one of suntori's ideas during its difficult 1980s and 90s when they were releasing random products to try and win back the youth Market was to try gaining recognition outside of Japan so they instructed their distilleries to produce single malt whiskeys more in line with global tastes so to compete for international Awards in 2001 Nikka Distillery the one founded by takitsuru won its first International award from the British magazine whiskey Magazine with the yoichi 10-year son Tori's hibiki 21 year old won second place in 2003 yamazaki 12 years old won a gold medal at International Spirits challenge centauri's first hibiki would go on to win various trophies including the world whiskey Awards world's best Blended malt whiskey a total of five times 2003 also saw the release of the Sophia Coppola movie Lost in Translation which prominently featured suntory Whiskey in the plot products like these helped Raise The Prestige of Japanese whiskey and contribute to its exports export quantities bottomed out in 2006 but have since surpassed 2001 levels growing nearly 700 percent from their lows International praise and the growing China Market might have helped exports however the domestic Market continued its malaise finally in 2008 the company brought a 30 year old mixture back to the market the high ball or high baru and it finally caught on a high ball is a mixed alcoholic drink there is an alcoholic base and a non-alcoholic mixer often in high proportion the whiskey high ball is made from whiskey soda water and a lemon it had been quite popular during the days of the Tory bars in the 1950s but fell out of favor for a while in the wake of the global financial crisis highballs caught on with the local Izakaya crowd has a low-calorie sweet drink that is cheap cheaper than a beer and can be enjoyed while eating in 2009 60 000 Japanese bars and restaurants sold whiskey High balls that nearly doubled the next year to 110 000. total domestic whiskey volume shipments in Japan have growned over 2.3 times in the 10 years from the highballs introduction in 2008 to 2018. sanatory encouraged this with some Savvy advertising the most notable of which were TV commercials featuring model actress koyuki famed for her role in the movie Last Samurai making and drinking a highball the whiskey high ball Revolution might have been one reason why suntory eventually decided to double down on Whiskey with a 16 billion dollar acquisition of Jim Beam in 2014. today the majority of sun Tories nearly 20 billion dollars in sales are not from alcoholic beverages but rather foods and canned drinks their canned coffee product Boss Coffee famously promoted by Tommy Lee Jones is one of Japan's most popular such brands but the company also has a strong position in canned green and oolong tea as well as mineral water the company has also set up Japanese joint ventures with outside brands for instance they had a majority share of the unit running all of Japan's Subway stores from 1991 to 2016. and Haagen-Dazs Japan which they have had since 1984. they even run a restaurant chain managing stores in China North America Singapore and Japan this company is doing a whole lot here what strikes me about the story of Japanese whiskeys was how their rise in global Prestige comes after the passing of their Glory years back in the Glory Days of the 50s 60s and 70s the industry had no need to make a whiskey capable of winning Awards it was only after the domestic Market collapsed that Centauri started to produce whiskeys that the global critics liked globally Japanese whiskeys remain highly regarded the competition is always Fierce how can I help but note the recent rise of Taiwanese whiskeys like kavalan such distilleries are following the same Market entry tactics that Centauri and Nikki did and will challenge the established players in the future for now swisskey seems to have rediscovered a place in Japanese culture I look forward to seeing it prosper in the years ahead alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the Channel Sign up for the newsletter and I'll see you guys next time
