- I spent $30,000 on lottery tickets, scratch-off tickets, whatever
you want to call 'em. These tickets are $30 a piece
and I bought 1,000 of them. The top price for these
tickets is $10 million so I could win 10 million
or a couple million dollars or a couple $100,000 or I could lose tens of
thousands of dollars. Who knows? Originally, we were gonna scratch off each card individually but after doing that for, like, 10 hours, we realized that would take,
like, a really long time so we thought of a better solution. How about we just use the
lottery app to scan it? This app said this ticket won $50. So this was a $30 ticket that won. Ticket number two, no prize. Chris. All right, so we're
negative $10 right now. The third ticket didn't win. All right, we're negative $40 now. So, so far we've won
$110 but we've spent 120 so we're negative 10. There's 1,000 of these, there is a chance there
could be a $10 million ticket in one of these, like,
if I won $10 million, imagine how much I could
give to Twitch streamers. That's $100 ticket. - Whoa, wow.
- Look. Can you see that? $100. He even gave me a confetti. Ethan, are you time-lapsing me right now? $100. So we're $50 negative. Good thing we still have $29,000 to go. No way. - What? - It says, "Winner.
Claim at Regal Office." - What?
- Wait, what? - Hold on, let me scratch it off.
- Scratch it. Scratch it.
- No, I can't. - Scratch it.
- Wait, wait. - Scratch it. Hold on, hold on.
- Wait, wait. - Ooh.
- Times 50. - Ooh.
- What is the times 50? Chris, what if that says $10,000? - Oh.
- Wait. - 20.
- It's $1,000. - Oh.
- Oh, it's that much, okay. - So it's the absolute minimum. - Oh, man. I know you guys are probably like, "Wow, you guys are super spoiled." My last video, I spent $25,000 and it wasn't even
sponsored so, like, $1,000, like, barely even covers a
fraction of one of my videos but it's still cool. Darn it. - The hype there.
- I know, I was so hyped but, like, I thought it was $10 million. Good thing we still have
a crap load of tickets. - And 20. - Hey, we won $100. - Hey.
= [Chris] Hey. - 40.
- 40. - Let me scan this ticket real quick. Let's see if this ticket won $10 million. It didn't, it won nothing but you can save money by using Honey. Before we go any further, I need to tell you guys about Honey because these scratch-off
tickets were really expensive and I just couldn't afford
them without a sponsor. And that is why Honey
came in to save the day. Honey is a free browser
add-on that scans the internet for coupon codes and applies
them to your checkout cart. As you see right here, I'm on Hanes, you know, I ordered some shirts because who doesn't like ordering shirts? You just click on Honey in the top right, it's super convenient. You hit Apply Coupons and now it will scan the entire internet and find coupon codes to save you money. You do nothing. We saved $11. Dude, our total is $55 and after Honey, it was $44. Boom. I clicked once and I saved $11. You're probably thinking to yourself, something this great and convenient must be really hard to get your hands on and shocker, it's not. Just go to joinhoney.com/mrbeast, click Add to Chrome, click Add extension, boom, I clicked three times,
I now have Honey on here and anytime I check out,
it will save me money. And one more cool thing about Honey is they also have this feature where you can do save and price watch. And basically, you can set
it where they'll email you if it drops below a certain price. If something's $100 and
you wanna pay $80 for it, you can, you know, set that up and then if it drops below
80, they'll email you, you buy it, boom, 20% saved. There's literally no
reason not to add Honey to your browser today. Get Honey for free at
joinhoney.com/mrbeast. That's joinhoney.com/mrbeast. You'll save money left and right and, like, there's
literally no negative to it, like, why wouldn't you? Have I ever told you how
much Honey gave to me? - You gotta tell me how much is the money? - 60.
- 60. - Yes. - You're not good at your job. - Boy, you trying to fight? - Yeah. - All right, well, I'm gonna
throw this loser at you. Get outta here, you
no-money-winning-having-ticket ass. - We're officially at 12- - 100. - Hey.
- We're officially at $1,230. - Spent. So, so far we're up $500. Ooh, $100. It likes when I clap. Let's try our secret method again. No prize. $50. All right, switching the stack worked. $30. $30. - Hey. - We're on win streak. I mean, we're not making money though, they're just breaking even. $50.
- Hey. There we go. - $100.
- Ooh. - $50. $60. $30. $50. $40. Scratch-off. - You hit my face back there. - Good. - And now, he's crying. - I wonder why. - Screw you. - Hi, side camera. I won $40 again, side camera. - Ooh. - Oh wait, that was $100. Stupid side camera distracted me. I'm not talking to you guys again. That camera sucks. All right, guys, you better pray I win 'cause if I win, you're all getting $1. 50! - There we go.
- Is that what you wanted? - That is what I wanted. - 40! So far, guys, this is our pile of winners. Look how it measures up to the
cards we haven't scratched. Another loser. Holy crap, I haven't won in forever. Is this a winner? 30.
- Hey. - You got your wish. - So far, we've recouped
3,500 of the 30,000. 30. 30. 30. - Getting 30 on a scratch-off ticket is like getting socks for Christmas. - Worse, it's like getting
batteries for Christmas. 30. - But usually if you get
batteries for Christmas that means you got something
cool that takes batteries unless your family just buys- - 50.
- batteries. - It's just like, "Here you go, Johnny. Here's some batteries." 60. - Yay. - Ticket's upside down. According to Chris, this
shouldn't work, but it did. - But it's still a loser. - 30. - $100.
- Are you serious? - $100? - Yeah.
- Whoa. - Oh, my goodness.
- Hey, dude. - We have officially- - Crossed $4,000 earned. Hell yeah. 4,050 now. Jake, can you take over for two seconds while I reply to my text? - Sure. 30. 50. - Oh, really? Hey, quit
winning money without me. 100. - Hey.
- Ooh. - That's enough to buy,
like, a lot of Snickers from every Walmart. It's enough to buy one leaf blower but you need, like, 100 to fly. Take it so we can buy a leaf blower. - Here you go. - And then we can try to fly. Well, that's what we should do. We should use all this money
to buy more leaf blowers to combine with the leaf
blowers we have to actually fly. - No. - 50. Hey, dude, they're funding 'em. 50. 40. ♪ Johnny do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Johnny do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Johnny do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Johnny do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Johnny do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Johnny do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Johnny do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Johnny do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Johnny do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Johnny do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Bam ♪ - $50. ♪ Do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Do-do-do ♪ I'm gonna be real with you, Fam Squad. How much have we used this camera? - I don't know.
- I don't know. - Yeah, exactly. Guys, have you noticed this camera? No, so cut that off 'cause this SD card's almost full. Yeah, goodbye. Be gone, thot. $30. $500. - Really?
- Yeah. Five- - Hey! - 500 smack-a-roonies. I don't know why I'm showing the camera, you can see on the phone
which is clearly right there but 500 smack-a-roonies. So we've scanned around 200
tickets which is $6,000. ♪ Down, down, down, down, down ♪ ♪ $60 ♪ ♪ $60 ♪ ♪ Down ♪ These are all the tickets we've lost on. - See all those losses we've taken? - All right, let's keep scanning. You would think gambling
like this would be fun but after a while, it kinda sucks. I just wanna know, did I win $10 million or was this a waste of a lot of money? My mom's laughing at me. Mom, do you wanna scan one? - Sure. - I was hoping you would say no. Hey, guys, fun story. After this, I'm spending
24 hours in slime, and that was $30 but I don't
feel like picking it up. $100. This is like my 10-hour challenge. Here's 50. You just slowly see my energy
crashing the more we do. - Don't worry, we're
doing a 24-hour challenge afterwards. - Yeah, right after this, I'm
spending 24 hours in slime. Fun. Unlike the water one, I think I'll actually be able to nap so it shouldn't be too bad. So currently, we're about $2,000 negative so if I just wouldn't have done this, I'd have two grand more than I have now. Tsk. You lost us, Jake. - What if one lesbian- - Oh, that was $100. - Oh my God.
- Wait. Which one was it? Was it this one? Dude, it took so long to load. I was just like, "Loser." And then I was like, "$100." I'm like, "No." I really wanna win $10 million. Can you- - You'll probably throw it behind you. - I knew that was coming. - No. All right, I got that one. That was a $50 ticket. Please tell me this is it. Okay, I got it. I got it.
- Oh my God. - Dude, like, literally, it's nothing and then I throw it,
it's like, "Oh, you won." I want the $10 million one. Is that so much to ask for? 50. - Actually, yes.
- Yes. - Actually, it is. - 500. That was a $500 ticket. - Do you wanna throw it?
- Oh, you wanna throw it? - $500. - Really?
- Yeah. - We just won $1,000 off two tickets. - At this rate, I feel
like I'm gonna lose, like, 10 grand off all these tickets. 500. - What?
- Another one? - Yeah.
- Let's do it. - Dude, we keep getting
the 500 smack-a-roonies. 40. 40. So far, we've won $8,500. 50. 50. 60. $100. $100. - No way. - Good job.
- Was it really? - Yep. All right, food break. Don't take your anger out
on the camera, you viking. - He said food break,
not break the camera. - Must smash. 40. - Ooh.
- The one you just dropped? - I don't know, was it
the one I just dropped? - I don't know, was it
the one you just dropped? - I don't know. 40. Hey, Jake, what do polar bears listen to? The radio. - So a duck walks into a bar. - Okay. - on the floor and then leaves. What's green and has wheels? - What?
- Grass. I lied about the wheels. - I'm good at long challenges when they don't require manpower. It's like those people that are, like, when I was counting to
100,000, they're like, "20 hours in, you missed one number." Like, okay, sorry. All right, it's time to kick
this into hyperdrive, boys. Right one's 30. Left one's nothing. We're doing two at a time now, boys. Kicking this into overdrive. 40. $100. Nice. Hey.
- Hey. - So far of my $30,000,
I made 10 of it back. To you, this might have been
a couple minutes but I've... Hey, $60. Been sitting here all day. Actually, we've been doing
this for three days straight. - Please subscribe.
- I just want them to know, like, if I look like a zombie, that's why. Hey, $30. We've been doing this for three days now. - Mr. Chris, this is Alex
calling you from DirecTV. How are you doing today? - I'm doing pretty
good. How are you doing? - I'm also good so thank you very much for asking me. - I'm actually working right now but can I get you to call me back? All right, thank you. - You're welcome, sir. Have a great day. Bye-bye. - Someone's gonna be
like, "What I clicked on, $30,000 scratch-off tickets. What I got," and it's gonna cut to this. - That was real. - Jake, please leave. - That was real.
- That's disgusting. It smells like viking farts in here now. - They should bottle that
and make it a perfume. Wait, feel the backside
of that piece of paper. It feels cool. - It feels like Hiero... Kylog... Hiero-
- Are you tryna say Kylo Ren? - Hieroglyphics? - Hieroglyphics.
- Hiero- - You see, it's not as easy. - No, it's not easy when you're saying the wrong thing. It confuses me.
- Hieroglyphics. - Kylo Ren? - 40. - 40. - 30. - 30. ♪ I wanna do ♪ Hello? - Hey. - That was a $500 ticket. - Oh my God.
- Are you serious? - Jimmy might have just
lost $500 on the ground. - Is it this one? No. I threw the card before I saw the result and now, we gotta find it. These are all the tickets and
one of these tickets is $500. Whoops. Yeah, I found it. This is the $500 ticket. - Mouth open. Right in the eye. - Ethan, edit smoke here. Show off your GFX. Wait, you've gotta be kidding me. Are we almost through this? We're coming down the final stretch. I think we're like 5, $6,000 negative and I think we've scratched
off like 70% of them. We're doing good. No, actually, we're not doing good but... $30. Okay, this one. 50. 40. 30. Wow. 60. If you're, like, a
little kid, don't gamble, as you can see, I'm currently negative. I'm actually losing money so, yeah, gambling's not fun. I'm actually losing money. Bad. Don't do it. Okay, well, this one was $300. - Holy crap. I've never seen 300 before. - Actually, I never had,
I thought it was only 500. 30. We started off the year with
2 million subscribers, Chris, and now we're on 8 million. We're four times this year. That's so impressive. Oh my gosh. - Oh my God, we're so big.
- We're so good. 30. We're, like, literally the greatest. You wanna know what's funny? 'Cause, like, we are saying it ironically but there are YouTubers
that say like that, not ironically. I hate when people are
arrogant on, like, YouTube. - Yeah.
- It's, like, so annoying. 60. It's funny too because someone's
probably gonna take that and then, like, in two years, I'm gonna say something slightly arrogant and they're gonna be
like, I'm gonna be like, "I'm the best." And it's gonna be like, "I
hate when people are arrogant. It's so annoying." Everyone, save that clip for
when I say something arrogant and then be like, put it, like, in a meme. Also, should we do another one of these? Let us know. $40. If this one's $10 million,
I'll do another one. It was nothing. $15. Dozens of hours this week just literally scratching
off tickets and this. Don't you hate it when
all scratch-off tickets do is take all your money? $10. And I'm sorry. For most of this video, I've
been looking at the screen on the side instead of
looking at you directly. I apologize. All right, guys, we're coming
down the final stretch. No prize. Hopefully, we'll win $10
million or all this was in vain. Scanning error. What the freak? Basically, all these cards
come back with scanning errors so we're gonna have to manually check 'em which manually checking these cards, 'cause there's like 100
numbers, takes forever so we'll see you guys in a couple hours. $30,000 was spent. Only 20,380 was earned. Over $9,500 was lost. Chris, what could you
buy with 9 1/2 grand? - Two fences, three fences. - Four fences. Four fences was lost. These were our winners of the tickets. As you can imagine, there
was way more tickets. In conclusion, I spent 30
grand on scratch-off tickets and lost $9,000 so you don't have to. I know that's what you've
been wanting to do. Don't. You're basically just gonna lose money. Don't buy scratch-off tickets. Let me do it for you. Shout out to Honey. We're gonna cash these
in, don't try to rob us. By the time this video's
uploaded, these will be cashed in. All right, I'm gonna go take a nap. This literally took, like, 30 hours. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I just wanna remind you, make sure you add Honey to your browser. Users who have installed
