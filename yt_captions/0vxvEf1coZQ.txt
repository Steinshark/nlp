vr gaming couch gaming tabletop gaming board gaming this room does it all or it will you see beneath its tidy organized facade is a veritable chaos zone of straps adapters cables game consoles controllers and all other manner of accessories that i need to turn into a cohesive gaming experience and oh at the center of all of it is going to be lg's qned mini led lg sponsored this video and this bad boy will hold over a thousand nits in a 25 window that coupled with features like auto low latency mode extremely low input lag and accurate colors are gonna make this the perfect centerpiece for this space because as you guys may or may not have noticed there's a lot of freaking bright windows coming into this room meaning that a low brightness tv is not really gonna cut it oh look at this the cavalry's here i'm obviously gonna need some help oh i was about to say help from our sponsor but our sponsors lg roll the intro [Music] the first thing we're gonna need is your geek squad skills jamie that's right you're mounting another tv why not but this one presents some special challenges see we thought lg was gonna send the 86-inch version of this which is an amazing set but we got the 75 that's why jake got a wall mount that weighs over 50 freaking pounds team lift meanwhile dan you and i actually get the worst job oh crap we get to move the foosball table which prepare yourself weighs about a thousand pounds i don't think i'm that strong and clear all the camping stuff out of here so first things first let's get this moved over that way oh he was lying well it feels like it to me the thing about being really slow to put away your christmas stuff is by the time you put it away it's almost time to take it back out again there's not really anywhere to pile this stuff in here yeah there's some right here oh my gosh in all seriousness how do you want this organized there's no plan it's real ah i mean i get it you're new here you figure ah it's gotta be just an act the way he is on camera [Laughter] organized free guess is what this is suppository clear evidence that i have small children that's what i was going for close though hello homeowner where would you like me to hang the tv oh my god can you just dial back the geek squad for for 10 minutes you said i had to use my geek squad skills where would you like me to hang it then tell me it's too high [Laughter] here's what i'm thinking we're probably going to end up with the 86 inch version of it at some point because it's a pretty big wall but we also have to consider that this can't go too far that way yeah so that we have access to the vacuum hose plug and then it can't go too far this way because this grille right here is the air return for the hvac we've got both power and network and a recessed wall plate here so that we could even mount something like a completely flat gallery style tv we've got a conduit here that runs two locations it runs down to the bottom so if we wanted to have an av receiver or something like that in the console it would wait what holy crap did they not oh they didn't punch the hole for it no okay we'll have to find that yeah boy wait oh i see wait what the the hell was their intention here oh my god oh it's right behind the whites it just it's right behind the electrical socket why would they do that all right uh you as you can um it's not that ain't gonna work yeah this is stupid you want me to take the thing off uh yeah i should kill the breaker here though uh were you about to stick a screwdriver in there yeah whatever it's 120 volts between friends yeah if we share it it's only half this one's tripped something's singing yeah it's the microwave uh the breaker apparently tripped no no these are these are not the right ones no no no no no all right yeah wait so it's off yeah it's off we found where the fish wire comes out yeah but it appears to be just like a hole in the wall there's not no actual conduit in there oh good yeah we have no idea if that's going where we think it is but the fish wire seems to know where it is yeah this is not very professionally done um in my opinion are low voltage contractors watching you heard me i wouldn't have done it that way but i'm also not a low voltage contractor why is nothing ever simple that's what i'd like to know oh there it is okay okay i guess it works there's just no point of egress for it no and there was no plan for hdmi other than just what you kind of run it like bare back right next to the freaking metal contacts like i don't understand what they what their intention was also they kinked this cat6a in a couple of spots oh nice screwdriver thanks it's going to be ltteststore.com eventually someday we are going to take the tv out of the box dan and i we're gonna measure up the the plate on the back of the tv dan doesn't know how to use a knife that's fine and then we're gonna see how it's gonna sit on the wall we'll use the template for that while they're working on that i am finally going to replace my ancient nf s12a fans with these nfp12 reduxes they're better for static pressure which i actually found was a problem because i've got a grill in the bottom here that made it so that it's quite a bit more restrictive this is the compartment that contains the vr gaming pc by the way whatever you do don't break the sponsor tv that's a good idea it's a thick boy that's how you get full array local dimming though it uses an ips panel and then it has a mini led array behind it that will selectively dim in the darker parts of the scene and selectively brighten in the brighter parts of the scene to achieve a much much better than native contrast ratio natively this thing will do a little over a thousand to one according to ratings.com and then with the most aggressive local dimming setting it'll do more like six thousand to one andy i'm gonna put the arms on the back of the tv and dan's going to throw the instructions away because we don't read them anyway but why we're doing that is so that we can take a measurement so that we know uh where the tv is going to sit on the wall dan have i ever told you how many tvs i've mounted well judging by your experience maybe one or two at least at least two it's like somewhere between six and eight hundred i did it for four days a week ten hours a day two years now i get to continue doing that no i'm letting you do it this time oh there appear to be plenty of studs to choose from well there's four in this room nice this is gonna be way better ah not only did i upgrade the fans but i also got these cool little noise isolating thingamaboobers that cover the entire frame of the fan so we shouldn't have any vibrations from these bad boys i don't think my arms are long enough to reach both sides oh slenderman you need slender man no i'm good i got it slenderman's useless i wish i had put this tool kit somewhere else all right those aren't going anywhere cool hey linus do you want to be upset about something dan wants to make you upset sorry what this is about where the bottom of the tv is going to sit roughly the bottom of the tv is going to be here yeah that's way too tall so we can take this and just bring it down until it's like yeah uh-huh or we could just hang it above the fireplace as god intended disgusting that might actually function dan we're gonna do it like we did the projector screen where we completely mess up the magnet holes and then have to put the thing on twice how many tvs have you done 800 or so i don't know you're the one measuring there kiddo so it's gonna be slightly off center you okay with that linus i mean well the choice the uh the full motion part of it will make it on center but also the plate will slide on the on the watchmaker oh wait no it won't oh the hoojima doodles because what we could do is take this off yeah and then have a horrible horrible hole in the wall like that one what why is it that every time i tune into what they're saying it's something awful something awful yeah well um so where's the sledgehammer and then we'll make a bigger hole also don't let him see this don't yeah don't let him see that why don't we sort through here and figure out what some of the key items that need to go in the console are we've got the wii u network switch this will do 10 gig to the main computer here and then a 10 gig link back to the house and one gig to everything else that's from asus uh oh vr trackers this is a vive tracker 2.0 and a track belt so this gives me hip presence in vr that's why i can never lie in vr og shield a big fat heavy one ultimately all gonna have to be wired in somehow ow that ain't going anywhere can you try and hang off it then like nathan drake oh my goodness you guys are putting the tv on yeah uh do you need help can i help nope we're done what that was it doesn't look very done uh i guess it's a good time to mention the anti-glare coating on the front of the screen uh yeah it's not on right now but that's another thing that the additional brightness will help with is reducing glare from these windows back here wow in spite of the weight um hey credit to this mount it's pretty manageable actually i kind of have access to the conduit hole here okay this tv is officially never coming this far out from the wall again because i am going to need some more slack there comes a time in every man's life when he must move the stand closer to the wall yeah that's that's what i was going to say oh what what you tried you tried to rip it oh well that was close yep oh we good oh look at that look at that and then yeah freaking easy all right our tascam's batteries are dead so we're filming on my cellular telephone he's um currently taking down a lighthouse for linus's vhar unit now we're gonna go up in the attic and take that wire oh down oh yeah dan is currently engulfed in whatever that is it doesn't taste good it's trapped behind a thing i have to go deeper in yes i'm gonna get very very fluffy i hope nothing bites me it goes through the wall where is this moving anything over there where you are yes oh can you pull some black wire dan has emerged from the attic more fluff than man dan tell me how they taste like what oh no ah success oh god damn how would you rate our success today yes yes yes out of five yeah five out of seven perfect perfect score all right i'm hoping to just transplant my old harmony remote setup here and just pick up right where i left off so it's one button to select all the right inputs and outputs and you know power on devices power off devices if not i'll have to find another solution there are other universal remotes that exist now that logitech shuttered the harmony division or i could just rely on cec but the issue is that with a pc relying on cec which is where you power on one device and it tells the associated devices to power on is that pcs are just not really designed with that in mind so what you need is one of these old microsoft ir receivers and then you can tell it to issue a sleep or wake command to the computer so that it won't just be sucking back 100 watts all the time it's got a 3080 in there soldering some wires and then dan and i are going to try and figure out how this thing works some kind of transfer always make sure that when you're working on high voltage electronics you use a metal chair so that if you screw up you don't have to do it anymore or come to work again this is a really neat little box it's basically a 12 volt distribution block it'll deliver about an amp to what looks like 18 different sources yeah so we're plugging all of the lighthouses into this yeah we're definitely doing that wall warts in here well i put the transformer in and that didn't immediately explode so sick let's try it with this okay ready i see it something just happened oh the light flashing oh it's moving is there a laser inside there there is a laser and there's a little motor and it spins the laser and it blinds it oh don't don't breathe that don't breathe okay we're done it's like there's a law against everything going right in a vlog two out of our four power cables for the vr base stations are dead in some way this one doesn't appear to terminate anywhere and the one over on this side seems to have gotten a nail through it at some point because we can find the other end of it but can no work no power the good news is hey lg good job the tv managed to turn on so that's awesome but there is a bit of extra work that i'm to have to do because an excellent attempt was made at cable managing and installing everything into the console but this computer does not go in like that because the intake is right here so it needs to sit right side up so it can draw that fresh air from the bottom fans in uh let's go oh wow look at this this door is gonna come off too freaking fantastic thanks wayfair is this one from wayfair yeah i do yeah thank you ah wonderful and let's never do that again here's something special about this machine it's got this old i believe it's made by sonnet old usb card that has an individual controller for every one of the four ports having more than one of these on a single controller and some motherboards might have two or maybe three controllers but having them share with any other devices can lead to unexpected problems so i've given each of them their own dedicated usb controller freaking ridiculous there we are that is a couch come on oh man it's almost like that's how you use a couch are we trying to make things look pretty for the video or are we just trying to go for functional how about pretty functional well i have one thing that might make it look better which is really easy a carpet what a good idea yeah let's do the carpet okay now we go we are not centered not even a little we'll fix it in post i had these grand designs about how i was gonna put little magnetic things and have everything cable managed really perfectly against the back but instead we're gonna do classic cable management okay there now it's centered nice i mean the space is starting to look kind of gamery actually all right let's talk features finally okay we got dolby vision support we've got filmmaker mode support uh here if we fire oh you do i have plex on here heck yeah is this even gonna find my plex server this was last plugged in at my old place no internet connection what the switch is not powered oh because i didn't plug it in is the sound bar kicked in settings hdmi arc device look at that did it just pick it up no problems i mentioned that it has the alpha 7 processor it does like 4k up scaling this is 4k content anyway but it has that so that's the reason that i chose to use my old shield that does not do ai upscaling here and then i've got my new shield over in the theater room actually the glare is not that bad which is exactly the goal in this room even with the studio lights on motion smoothing is on that's stupid so let's go ahead and fix that i think there's actually more optimal setting than off so don't quote me on that but off is one way to make sure you're not getting any kind of smoothing wow the hdr looks awesome though i'm fairly certain it's on it's not even oh wait it's not on you know ratings said that their sdr readings for this tv were really good like really bright but wow that's really bright i thought hdr was enabled well i guess we're sliding all the way to the right okay and that's better this looks awesome though not much else to say thanks lg for sponsoring this video we're going to enjoy many an hour playing games in here massive shout out dan and jamie from logistics who were coerced into being here against their will how much if you enjoyed this video maybe you'll enjoy the last time lg sponsored a living room facelift pretty cool video as well stark before and after oh there's your problem your anus ain't distended enough oh god
