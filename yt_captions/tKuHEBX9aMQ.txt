we've known about fuchsia OS for a while now Google's new exciting different operating system that some people are calling the Android killer well Google pretty much refused to acknowledge that even existed until now they have just lifted the lid almost entirely by going live with the fuchsia OS developer site and before we get into that let's take a look at the UI itself so this is a super early Developer Preview running on the Google pixel book this demo lets you take a look at how the software might look on a smartphone as well as a laptop and you'll notice a few things it seems to really embody material design every pop-up has this card style not too dissimilar from recent versions of Android there's a demo application of this rotating shape and you'll notice when it's minimized the app is not just holding its place but running simultaneously the multitasking generally looks kind of amazing it's looking like you'll be able to have five or ten windows at a time functioning in whatever space you like and you can even drag one on top of the other to enter tabbed mode so that's the ability to still run apps in full-screen whilst also being able to seamlessly switch between them like tabs in your browser anyways there are hints all over the place that fuchsia has big goals if nothing else the name itself fuchsia is a color and it's a combination between pink and purple pink being apple's codename for a potential Mac operating system and purple being the codename for what ended up becoming the iPhone we might be reading into it too much here but pink plus purple does suggest an operating system that spans devices of multiple form factors but I wanted to talk about this idea that fuchsia oh s is going to kill Android the idea that this is going to be the smartphone operating system of the future that is definitely what the initial consensus was but having seen what I've seen recently I'm starting to doubt that notion at least for the next five years at Google i/o this year they had these little interviews called fireside chats and this particular one with hero Sheila Kaymer one of the founding members of the Android team is probably the most open conversation that's been had about it there's a few things said here that raise some eyebrows the first thing he says is that fuchsia OS is an experiment it's a concept that allows Google to test new ideas which in itself implies that are still in very early stages the second thing is that Hiroshi completely dismisses the idea that because this is a new operating system from Google it must be the one operating system from Google he said that fuschia can happily coexist with Chrome OS and Android and then the third thing when afterwards asked specifically about Chrome OS he said we're going to be better than Mac OS and Windows and this is important because a big part of why people assume that fuchsia OS was going to be a replacement is that currently Chrome OS doesn't exactly work perfectly with Android and so it would have made sense for Google to have one unified OS but judging by what's been said here Chrome OS is about to become a bigger focus for Google not a smaller one this could all be part of a plan for them to dismiss the idea and then swoop in later and surprise us all but I doubt it Hiroshi was really open when asked about fuchsia he straight-up said we enjoy that you love the intrigue in it but there really isn't anything to be intrigued about it looks like whilst fuchsia is capable of running Android apps it has no intention of replacing Android it's trying to coexist to improve the capability of devices that otherwise might not be very smart at all okay but there is one key difference with fuchsia one key advantage it is based off a microkernel called zircon which compared to the Linux based Android has massive scalability it is an OS that could work on anything whether it's as powerful as your desktop PC to as low powered as your toothbrush and this has an important implication you might remember when the smart home was this really intriguing really exciting prospect that was at least five years ago since then there's been surprisingly little progress for something that was supposed to be the next big thing and I think part of what's been slowing the whole thing down is the fragmentation of software so even right now I'm using a bunch of smart home devices I've got this Phillips hue light bulb directly behind me I've got these not only four or panels on either side and downstairs I've added in a couple of lifx smart bulbs and by far the biggest problem I have with all of these is that they are the opposite of seamless the philips hue bulbs need a separate $50 box to work properly the brains of the system these nano leaf panels I love them but you're still setting them up typing in pairing codes and I've had a really hard time getting these to work well with my Amazon echo and then as for the lifx bulbs downstairs without a Google home installed if someone wants to change the light color without setting and syncing everything up on the lifx application they're out of luck it's not a specific complaint with these bulbs it's the market in general but it's looking like fuchsia can change this it could shift even small scale devices like bulbs from being dependent on some sort of hub or application to being completely independent smart devices that just need a power supply I think it's all pretty exciting anyways as I mentioned at the start Google has just published a brand new fuchsia website pretty simple looking but nonetheless massively meaningful it is trying to get developers involved by literally giving instructions on how to build apps for it as well as a searchable directory so they can get to grips with this new capabilities as we already know bringing in third-party developers and being really developer friendly is completely crucial for a sustainable platform and so the father Google is doing this the making all this effort is strong indication that this is not just a site throwaway project it's a really big part of Google's future if you enjoy this video then I've got
