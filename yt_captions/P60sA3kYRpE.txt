in 1980 the south korean government banned college students and school teachers from making money through private tutoring it didn't work few governments have tried more to corral their people's private education spending than south korea yet each year koreans still spend billions of dollars of their own money up to a third of their income to send their kids to supplementary learning excessive spending on the private education industry is an issue across asia but the education fever in south korea is particularly strong in this video we're going to dive deeper into south korea's ridiculous private education problem during the japanese colonization period ordinary koreans lacked access to education the administration's shameful primary goal was to distort the culture and values of the korean people and keep them in their place they were not interested in human capital development so when the new south korean state gained its independence the populace was sorely under-educated the literacy rate was 22 percent and less than 20 percent of children had gone to secondary school strong man singh bin ri initiated a massive primary education push to ameliorate this the south korea had few resources then so state support for schools was meager since resources were so limited the government added comprehensive testing exams for middle and high school to limit the size of incoming classes the exams also solved a serious corruption issue some korean colleges admitted whoever paid them the most money rather than who was the most qualified early on outside observers noted that this could lead to future issues in 1952 unesco noted that 75 of the funding for secondary and higher education came from parents they recommended that the government pay for 100 of primary school costs and at least 50 percent of secondary school and higher the government's early lack of initiative in this area would lead to the out-of-control privatization of its education sector when pak chung-hee took over as president he sought to build up the country's supply of human labor in support of his economic policy of rapid industrialization that means building factories and a rich supply of trained human workers to run them such workers only needed to have basic to moderate levels of trained skills why send them to university furthermore the park government had concerns about the revolutionary potential of idle college graduates running around learning silly things like socialism and so in 1963 the korean government opened vocational schools or sometimes also referred to as technical high schools as an alternative to the traditional system referred to as a general or academic school it was hoped that up to 70 percent of students would take this second track and be set up with the practical knowledge for a successful career successful examples of this dual track system can be found in germany for instance but korean employers soon complained that their vocational school graduates had outdated skills and capabilities the difference was that in germany trade unions work closely with the vocational schools on the curriculum in south korea no such unions existed because the government desired low-cost labor and saw unions as a gateway drug to left-wing ideologies i.e communism even if the vocational system worked properly however the korean baby boomers would not have likely accepted it scholars in korea's confucian society had historically commanded respect and the general schools carried on their prestige by the late 1960s the fierce testing competitions into elite middle schools were causing primary schoolers to suffer from stress and tension a situation referred to as examination hell in 1967 it was estimated that 9 out of 10 6th graders the last year of primary in seoul received private tutoring if kids didn't test into a school of choice they opted to repeat the sixth grade to prepare again for the next year's middle school entrance exam you shouldn't be doing this to your 11 year olds so in 1968 the government abolished the exams and instituted a lottery each middle school got a mix of high and low scoring kids it also forced private middle schools to accept standardized curriculums tuition and teacher levels this was in effect a government takeover it successfully reduced the intensity of the rat rates for elite middle schools but only by transferring it over to elite high schools by 1973 about 27 percent of students suffered mental and physical stress from the high school examinations referred to as middle school third year disease thus in 1974 the government instituted the high school equalization policy private and public general high schools are randomly assigned their students within residential districts exceptions are made for certain rural areas and vocational schools these two equalization policies were and remain very controversial people pointed out that the middle school equalization policies merely shifted the trend up to high school a high school policy would only do the same for a university and they were right in south korea where you go to university matters a whole lot i know that this is also the case in the united states only one current u.s supreme court justice didn't go to either harvard or yale which fyi to me is a bit ridiculous but the influence is especially strong in south korea there are three domestic super universities seoul national university korea university and yongsae university or sky a top university opens the door to bigger and better things fifty percent of ceos forty three percent of politicians and eighty percent of judges have graduated from a sky college it also guarantees job security this is an older stat but in 1988 83 to 90 of sky graduates are able to secure a job this is in contrast to the 70 employment rate for all other four-year college university graduates it also guarantees higher earnings seoul national university graduates make seven percent more even after adjusting for social background and labor productivity sky phds are more likely to get a 10-year track position at a domestic university than a non-sky phd though both fall short of a phd from a top 100 university abroad and finally graduates from prestigious universities show higher rates of job satisfaction so they get better jobs make more money and are happier i hope that i have impressed upon you the multiple benefits of graduating from a prestigious korean university throughout the 1970s the middle and high school still struggled to deliver a high quality education class sizes were still regularly in the 70s and total annual spending per student was about 10 to 30 usd thus many turned to private tutoring as their best chance of entering a prestigious korean university tutoring eventually evolved into full-on shadow schools referred to as hagwon for-profit entities with the sole goal of preparing students for their university exams by 1980 13 of primary school students 15 percent of middle school and 26 percent of high school students received tutoring families found themselves separated into two unequal classes those who can afford hagwons and those who could not when chuntu juan came to power he sought to make more radical reforms to this arrangement and that is why in 1980 he banned private tutoring with the 7 30 educational reform measure 730 was a wide sweeping reform of the system it banned almost all forms of private tutoring with some exceptions carved out for kids who have failed tests the reform also raised the university quotas abolished several university entrance exams and modified the national curriculum it also implemented a radio and television network for low-cost tutoring the educational broadcasting system or ebs kind of like pbs in the us at this time south korea had not yet democratized but even with the full authoritarian power of a military government the authorities struggled to enforce the private tutoring ban korean parents willing to hire tutors at any expense turn to the black market and the black market recognizing that they might be caught raised their prices to account for the risk premium now only the richest could afford tutoring enforcement eventually lightened until the south korean constitutional court finally struck down the ban in 2000 throughout the 1990s the korean government increased investment in its public education believing that parents sent their kids to private tutoring because of the perception that public schools sucked i feel that while it is true that the korean government early on underinvested in public education great improvements were made during the 1990s for instance in 1983 the world bank notes that korean secondary schools had a student-teacher ratio of 36.4 to compare canada had about half that 17.96 by 2000 this ratio fell by 40 to just 21 students per teacher it still lags behind canada's 17.4 number but great progress regardless today south korea's total expenditure on its education institutions as measured by the percentage of its gdp is not all that different from the oecd average but the more public schooling improved the more parents still saw private tutoring as a way to get ahead of everyone merely sending their kids to public school so the south korean government developed low-cost substitutes in an attempt to disrupt private tutoring this included adding entrance exam prep to the aforementioned ebs broadcasts and after-school programs that copied the hagwon curriculum they also worked with the universities introducing elements into the entrance exams that cannot be gamed with simple memorization high school records extracurricular social service involvement long essay style questions and social economic disadvantage factors none of this succeeded despite this improvement the number of hagwon exploded and continued to explode growing from an estimated 381 in 1980 to 14043 in 2000 tax records in 2013 show that there are nearly 105 000 hagwon in korea then the number of students enrolled in private schooling grew 10 times over the same time period from 118 000 to 1.4 million roughly a 70 to 80 percent participation rate today south korean households spend up to 30 percent of their income on their child's and it's usually just one education this spending is heavily geared towards higher income households families with incomes over 50 000 usd spend 2.5 times more on private education than their lower income peers nine out of ten households consider this expense burdensome 29 of them very burdensome with nothing else working in 2006 the national government proposed a curfew for the hagwon about 10 pm imposing this curfew was difficult and took three years to fully implement a reflection of korea's new democratic era hagwan owners argued against the ban pointing out that high schools already kept students in until 10 or 11 pm hagwon students would either go to tutoring early in the morning on the weekends or hire private tutors to fill the time parents and students petitioned the constitutional court saying that it violated their rights but finally in 2009 the court declared the curfew constitutional and it went into effect research on the curfew's effectiveness is lacking but one quantitative study found that the curfew did indeed shift parents to move to private tutoring for those who could afford it another study somewhat corroborated this finding that families in seoul which are usually richer increased their expenditures on private schooling families in busan and others found a reduction in spending or no significant change one reform that did end up working however came a little bit earlier after school classes first introduced in the early 2000s the original intent of these classes were to provide arts and cultural enrichment a more holistic education that quote-unquote experts argued that regular korean schools didn't have however korean parents gave feedback that they weren't interested in this and soon the after-school programs evolved into de facto tutoring schools teaching academic subjects with the goal of bending the demand curve on household private tutoring costs it seems like that parents and students find these after-school programs effective replacements for private tutoring a study found that one hour after school school each week replaced about 30 minutes of private tutoring and 22 minutes of studying alone replacing any amount of expensive private tutoring with publicly subsidized after-school classes is a financial net win for the home a 2006 government study corroborated later in 2018 found that adding after-school classes reduced spending by about 2.2 percent of household income this finding sort of hints at the role that the hagwon's for-profit nature has in fueling korea's educational industrial complex furthermore since they don't have to commute to their hagwon the students get additional time about 16 minutes each week on average that they usually spend on sleep do these programs actually improve students scores in the same way private tutoring does the answer seems to be yes though it also seems that they are more effective at the high school level than in middle school and in urban areas more than rural areas it is interesting that even with the presence of an affordable alternative however the hagwon industry has continued on today the results are hard to deny almost every child in south korea goes to primary and secondary school and nearly 80 percent go on to university additionally korea produces some of the world's highest scoring children with top 10 rankings in the math science and reading categories of the 2018 program for international student assessment or pisa for comparison the united states ranks 38th in math 19th in science and 13th in reading yet at the same time beyond the aforementioned financial costs the intense academic workload and competition takes a psychological toll on both korean children and their parents including strained parent-child relationship issues anxiety issues and depression and then there is the demographic cost for korean society korea has the lowest birth rates of all the oecd countries the 2019 fertility rate was 0.92 birth rates are a complicated indicator with many involved factors but surveys have shown that women's willingness to have an additional child decreases as private child care costs of which education takes a significant portion increase the multi-billion dollar for-profit education market has also become a big business hagwons have become large profitable corporations that employ tens of thousands of educated tutors a critical employment tool checking their growth will certainly create negative economic feedbacks even if you don't take into account the lengths to which parents will go to give their children an edge i read a very interesting recently published paper locked in by sonia xle of the london school of economics in it she argued that if it is not addressed early then private supplementary tutoring entrenches itself into modern society and basically becomes irreversible as i mentioned earlier taiwan japan and singapore also struggle with regulating their private education industries but south korea's education fever appears to be stronger than them all with one exception amongst the households in urban china a 2020 shanghai consumer council survey found that over 70 percent of families in beijing shanghai and shenzhen send their children to private education spending up to 10 of their pre-tax income this troubling trend is likely why in 2021 the chinese government recently converted its private education companies into non-profit entities amongst other regulations they are trying to head off the 100 billion industries entrenchment and blunt a brutal rat race that fuels skyrocketing child care costs chronically low birth rates and a growing tang ping or lying flat lifestyle amidst the use south korea failed to achieve this in time and it costs them china is looking to avoid a similar fate alright everyone that's it for tonight
