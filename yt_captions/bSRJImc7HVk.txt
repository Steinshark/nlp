viewers in England and Wales and and all over there and that's beautiful uh my friends it's time and go to waterstones check them out link is there get the book I want to go to the UK with the book so we'll we'll talk about that later um crazy matchup Magnus versus Ninjago so quick quick note about nijota basav 69. that is the number that he is ranked in the World Cup he was the 69th highest rated player in the world cup and now he's in the final four and he's probably qualified to the candidates uh which is crazy and a quick introduction about Magnus Carlson is he plays Pawn to E4 he he doesn't need an intro what do you don't know who Magnus is if you are watching this unironically right now because you clicked on the video somewhere on YouTube and you don't know who Magnus Carlson is welcome to the world of Chess Where Have You Been we're cool now we're cool we were like the the kid that was ugly in high school who you saw 10 years later and you know gained 80 pounds of muscle and has a successful job and that's that's who we are now so magnus's opponent plays the Sicilian Defense uh which is I mean that's already a very clear sign that like he doesn't want to draw with black I mean at this level of Chess uh you try to play for a draw with black uh and then you try to win with white no he he's trying to win not only is he trying to win against the uh open Sicilian plays Magnus Carlson's opening against him that's gangster Magnus Carlson plays this vashnikov he plays D4 CD Knight D4 Knight F6 Knight C3 E5 that's what Magnus plays with black now I don't know if a Bossa was going to do that but Magnus played this in the entire world Chess Championship against Fabiano caruana that was ages ago in 2018 when we were still the Ugly Kid in high school uh Bishop to B5 Rosso limo chosen by Magnus putting pressure on the Knight on C6 and basically saying if black doesn't do anything about it I'm going to take it black doesn't do anything about it Magnus takes uh there are lines where white plays this move but then doesn't take but then black is going to go here and now if you take black has suffered no damage to the pawn structure so that was just kind of stupid so Magnus takes now a very big decision again nijot takes with the B Pawn so already very interesting developments the B file is going to be useful the a pawn sucks uh the pawns are doubled so depending on where this Pawn gets placed it's going to determine what happens to the rest of these pawns why because Pawn to D5 will leave um what is wrong with me today Pawn to D5 will leave this Pawn weak Pawn to D6 will leave that pawn weak so D6 and now in this position Magnus could continue developing but he chooses not to because he doesn't want his opponent to build this brick wall so instead of that Magnus plays E5 and that move is is actually deceptive because after Pawn takes E5 the idea is not this that's not the point uh although it looks like the point because actually if Queen to D4 is played here there is Bishop B2 and if you take the queen is trapped Queen A3 uh there isn't Knight C4 but you go here and then and then and then that and if the queen didn't get out there was just Knight C4 so uh but Magnus uh doesn't even do that plays D3 and the job plays F6 you will notice Magnus has given a pawn to damage his opponent's structure Beyond repair all right so Magnus playing a Gambit now his opponent C pawns are doubled isolated and immobile they cannot move forward F6 now if you just picked up this position right here and I asked you what is the ELO of the players you would say 600. because who else plays chess like this but black hasn't moved any piece off the back rank uh and how about this Knight to H6 I mean definitely 600 right not not an ELO Point higher they are two they are 600 yeah I mean like 2 000 points above that but you know close uh let me explain why they're playing like this white plate like this to make it very difficult for black to develop black is kind of stuck what is wrong with me today I cannot draw arrows how many arrows have I tried to draw and I just can't I don't I don't know what the I have to record this recap I'm I'm gonna go treat myself I don't know what's going on I don't know what's happening I just my hand is not reacting to my brain I anyway um it's the mouse it's because I was in Los Angeles for pogchamps five now I'm back home setup so uh White play like this because black now has tough development uh bad Pawn structure and uh immobile position what okay Magnus doesn't Castle but instead plays Rook to G1 the point of this move is that you delay castling and you want to play G4 and nijat plays Bishop to A6 after eight minutes of thought um he has other moves he can develop Blake Queen A5 but this is actually shockingly difficult to deal with white completely restricts the black position here black has to go Knight F7 white ghost Queen E2 and if black plays something like A5 A4 Bishop A6 uh whitechus plays long castles and just goes for an attack and the computer evaluates this as losing for black because black can't move any pawn you go here I take you open up my rook and also E5 is loose you go here I take it go here I take so Rook G1 G4 this looks stupid okay this is stupid what look at this position he's down a pawn he played Rook G1 G4 all part of the plan Queen to E2 I told you this is all about controlling the opponent's movement nijap plays Bishop to E7 Magnus develops the bishop to B2 preparing the forces and now nijot plays Queen A5 he plays Queen A5 because Magnus cannot Castle because he will lose the pawn on A2 believe it or not this is still fine the computer evaluates this two Pawn down position with a queen breathing down your neck as equal if not just purely better for white because the idea is Rook to G4 Rook to A4 I mean what the f what what something is vibrating in an orifice I mean this is I don't know what what anyway now Magnus plays C4 he plays C4 because if he doesn't like let's say it's blacksmooth black could actually play C4 himself the idea being that you open up the bishop and potentially The Rook like you you actually create some good attacking chances so Magnus plays C4 shutting out the bishop shutting out Pawn to C4 now nijok plays G5 okay firing back not allowing Magnus to expand over there Magnus does expand over there and he just buckles down to defend himself and now Magnus plays Rook to H1 this is the weirdest game this game is impossible to break down to an amateur audience it's a very very goofy game white gave up a pawn early in the game to basically sabotage Black's development black was too full to run so black couldn't activate his pieces his stomach was bulging he couldn't activate anything uh now both sides Castle Queen side but look at look at the structure right blacks just can't move anything black moves this everything gets weak right black takes this is isolated and and backward and and Magnus magnus's position still has a lot of forward movement so he plays Knight to E4 uh and nijot takes on H4 Magnus takes and is now looking to infiltrate immediately still nothing can move when you have so many pawns but you can't move anything you're probably going to be worse you know who does have Mobility with pawns Magnus yet another Pawn has joined the attack trying to butcher open the black position if black play something like here White's just gonna play F5 He's Just Gonna Keep suffocating you you take suddenly my knight is in you still cannot move any pawns and I'm going to start bullying you and attacking you and my queen defends everything your Bishops are blocked out one by my pawn and the other by your own pawns so Pawn takes F4 Knight takes and now the position opens up Magnus does hear what's called a transformation he transforms the position from menacing and only slightly better for him to potentially winning and now he goes here drops back and uh he is no longer down upon and he also has a winning end game advantage in the form of Black's Pawn structure so what Magnus could do here is get into an end game and likely purely win it because he's gonna win a couple of Black's pawns however Magnus did expand with the pawns and maybe his King is going to be weak so nijot plays Rook to E6 Magnus gets out of the way and tries to bring the king to defend a little bit which is a little bit dangerous but he's doing a good job controlling that Pawn's gonna fall that Pawn's gonna fall or that's gonna fall Something's Gonna Fall here Queen G5 Magnus takes and uh now we have a rookie two and Rook H5 and he's holding everything together the pressure is on Rook H6 Pawn on C5 Black's position is absolutely miserable but nijad is defending himself I mean he is and Magnus has good long-term pressure but you know he plays Queen to H2 here oh no Magnus is losing Magnus played this move to defend his Bishop to potentially threaten Bishop B8 and queen C7 and to win this Pawn but this move stopped defending that square and now Queen F1 is winning for black why because after take take you win the bishop if you don't take on H6 after Queen to F1 and you play something like I don't know Queen D2 Now The Rook comes in and if white goes here Rook G1 oh oh oh and if the king Runs Out to the corner you have this and you get the bishop Magnus Carlson is losing but a boss of misses it he plays Rook G6 before playing Queen F1 now Magnus blocks the Queen's path he consolidates everything and he's won one of the pawns Queen to G6 and now the king is safe on the dark squares Rook to E6 and Magnus in this position has this move Bishop takes A7 with Queen F2 check to follow up somehow Magnus plays Rook H4 instead Bishop to G4 Bishop takes A7 and actually here Wing G7 might have given I I don't really even quite understand this uh with Queen G5 back and some sort of but a boss of plays this I think a boss of was kind of ready to lose this game King to B4 now if Pawn to C5 check is played you just take so D4 Queen E7 Ponto C5 and a boss of resigns as his Rook is hanging the king is super weak the bishop is hanging and then there is like a Checkmate in two as well Magnus wins a bumpy game a bumpy game a nervy game but he got the job done Magnus up one nothing and now a boss of has to strike back a boss of with the white pieces on the very next day plays a London my man Magnus does what every player should do to a London player oh yeah you want to play a London okay two could play at that game two could play at that game we gonna we're gonna we're gonna copycat you the whole time you want to play a London so do I all right so do I C4 and Magnus forcing all the pieces off the board he's trying to get the knights off trying to get the knights off trying to get the Bishops off Magnus just has to draw this game remember it's the best of two Knight takes F6 he's doing the exact same thing back to abbasiv now a boss of does get a nice space Advantage here he's a microscopic Advantage he actually just moves his King because it's very safe gonna put his Rooks here and they're looking nice and pretty but Magnus just plays long castles and look here is essentially the situation a boss of has to win this game he's traded multiple nights he's traded the Bishops same color Bishop queens and Rooks let's go the boys prepare their Rooks look at this everybody's coming to battle and now Magnus doesn't wait around anymore he could sit back relax no C5 let's go let's go let's trade everything you take I take take take and at the end of it I get my Pawn back with interest so C5 we shut everything down now he slides his King out of the center line and a boss of still looking for him but now mud Magnus trying to create a blockade here comes a boss of coming on the queen side Queen C5 check and Magnus just chopping everything down look it's simple math you trade all the pieces off the board there's only Kings remaining and a boss up still trying trying to expand into the position but Magnus knows it's math you trade all the pieces you are not going to win you trade all of the pieces you are not going to win he's doing his best but you trade all the pieces you're not going to win bishop and three pawns each and it's actually black who is playing for a win because he has two pawns connected and this weak Pawn in the center want to see a way that the black could win this game very easy by winning this pawn and it's simple math you trade everything you win you win all the pieces you also sorry you trade everything you make a draw right uh you trade all the pieces Bishop H3 King C5 Magnus trying Abbas of the reason Magnus is not winning this Pawn is because after take take actually white just wins so that would be tragic I think my friends you know where this is going at this point it takes 74 moves magnus's pawns run down the board but there's not white has to go play defense and it's all going to come down to this final Pawn there it is A1 Queen takes F5 and in this position the game ends in a draw and Magnus Carlson has knocked out the Cinderella story of Ninjagos of and this is his first ever World Cup final it really could be the year of Messi from Magnus Carlson beautiful stuff uh Magnus is a real Madrid fan but hopefully he's a fan of Messi because uh he now qualifies to play the winner of the match versus Fabiano caruana and pragnananda Ramesh Babu this is again a matchup of gukesh Magnus Fabiano is the same generation as Magnus I think there may be a year or two apart Prague is the same generation as gukesh Fabiano in game number one plays an Italian an aggressive Italian well he might he he literally is an aggressive Italian by the way uh A4 taking space on the queen side pushing krog backwards with moves like A4 B4 B5 Prague defending himself against the onslaught of opening preparation Pawn to D4 look at this expansion into position Queen D3 creating a weakness on the a file Knight A5 hitting the C6 Square hitting the A6 Pawn 15 minute time Advantage pawn takes D4 Knight c6s is and now this is very very bad moment for Prague he's got to play something like Rook B7 but then Queen A6 and pawn D4 and Knight A7 also Knight d8 is a fork so what does he do Strikes Back Knight C5 forces the queen to move now this ugly but necessary defensive move putting all the pieces on the back rank this is what we call carpovian School of Defense Anatoly carpal was the master of Defending with pieces on the eighth rank like a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu expert getting submissions from the ground Queen to D5 Knight E7 check if you take you lose your Rook Pieces come off the board Fabi Begins for the next stage of the game which is pressuring Prague in the end game steady slow Improvement progs Rook has absolutely no moves and he has two minutes on the clock to make eight more moves take probably marching him down look at this Pawn to E5 prog is has no moves on the board and two minutes on the clock this is why we call it modern generation versus the generation that has been in place take take look at this sliding on the back rank tetris-like trading the Queens Fabi says come trade on my on my terms so I get my king closer to the center proc says Nope C5 infiltrates with the Rook frog on the ropes one minute remaining on the clock he throws the C Pawn forward The Rook stops it but now black circle activates very difficult decision which Pawn do you take if you take this one I have a fork and I'm gonna win that one so he goes for that one instead the pawn Runs The Rook goes to stop it I'm gonna trade your a pawn for the C Pawn why because the a pawn is an outside pass pawn and four versus three simplifies down to one versus zero that's a draw they know how to draw rook and pawn versus Rook you also can know how to how to do that if you get my end games master class it'll teach you a bunch of intermediate and advanced end games King G7 King G8 Fabi tries Fabi tries he tried for over 70 Moves In this game nearly 80 moves walking Prague down simplifying it down and he wins the pawn two things help Prague here number one short side defense he's on the short side of the pawn so he's going to be able to stop it and fill it or defense villador sixth ranked defense he's not getting it here but he's got short side defense Rook B7 check and now a very important moment if Pawn to E6 in this position checks from the back and if you don't play Pawn to E6 then uh then I will do Philadelphia Rook F2 staring and now Rook B8 check short side defense on the short side The Rook stays looking at the pawn ready to snipe the king at any moment Rook A2 ready for side checks uh something like rookie one would have allowed some check here but the king would have just gone back to f8 and it's a very instructive way he gets back in front short side defense Fabi tries but this is just a drone King and pawn end game and a clutch defensive effort I mean my friends you go back to move 30. look at this position as Fabiano was just laser beaming the black position and Prague had two minutes on the clock to make eight more moves back against the wall holding his own against one of the best Grandmasters of the last 10 years and uh now proc has a chance to knock out Fabi with the white pieces Prague begins to put the pressure plays a Catalan this is one of the most vintage openings but one of the most Cutting Edge modern openings as well Pawn takes C4 A6 trying to get him to take and play Pawn to B5 with the tempo A4 stopping that here Bishop F4 Bishop D6 looking to trade now the queen drops back to replace the bishop on the F4 square and Fabi plays a very modern approach giving up the bishop completely trading Knight to C6 and applying pressure on the center if white plays a move like Pawn to E3 which looks very natural the queen is trapped whoops whoops the queen is trapped so instead we have Knight A3 you'll notice that Prague has spent 25 minutes on that move because the best move was take take Rook C1 and black will play Rook B8 this is clearly more Cutting Edge preparation by Fabiano caruana on how to take down the Catalan look of Fabi not spending any time at all Knight A3 a mistake according to the computer because Fabi has to take the pawn but then he would lose this Pawn but then he would win that pawn very complicated instead Fabi just plays G5 anyway and does it this way but let's keep in mind Fabi just has to not lose Rook A7 and Fabi anchoring the knight in the center of the board prog realizing very very quickly the opening did not go how he wanted Fabi demonstrating really nice opening preparation and very soon we're gonna have an avalanche of pieces flying off the board if you're confused about what happened that was a fork but Rook C4 would have led to this so he gives it up and uh Prague just has to stop the pawns sorry Fabi just has to stop the Pawns and uh he's gonna do that but first he's gonna create some problems of his own and in this position Knight B4 Knight C6 Prague offers a draw because rookie two if Knight C5 there's B4 you're gonna stop this pawns two pawns each and the players make a draw and they will settle this in tie breaks Magnus will play the winner of that match the shot will play the loser of this match and that leaves me with one final game of wins this game she is the Women's World Cup champion of 2023 and by default gets granted the Grand Master title I have nothing else to say this was a Queen's Gambit declined exchange variation very classical opening and garage gonna played A5 and B5 and norgul fought back on the queen side a little bit uh but realized very quickly that you know garyachkin is actually probably first there so if you try to fight with your pawns then black is going to first of all black can just take black and also play C5 and you don't want to play where you're not stronger you're stronger here and here so Knight F4 but good Edge can adjust look at this I mean an absolute avalanche on that side of the board so nirgil says you know what I'm stronger over here you could have all of this I'm going to go check may you Pawn to G6 you kick me out put your weakening your position we're gonna trade Knight back to D3 and now suddenly you're are you stronger here cause I'm getting there you're fighting back but now Knight to E2 we're all fighting for the same stuff you put these pawns here you were trying to push them forward but now you didn't so now I'm going to consolidate and you have an isolated Pawn so I should block the squares in front of it and potentially create a weakness we dance a little bit with the Knights Bishop G3 Rook C6 norgul whoa she won a pawn in all of that remember a long time ago black played this well all of a sudden nirgul whoa now the pawn has to go check the girls just Pawn up clean Pawn up a clean Pawn strong Knight oh my God that's a fork Rook D5 Bishop E3 The Rook moves on to G5 trying to get out G3 oh my God no Google's gonna win Knight C4 Ubuntu F4 take take take take Rook D5 there's got to be a way right Rook G5 is pressure Rook E5 wins the pawn both of these pawns are just waiting to die there's nothing black can do she's doing her best rookie five King F7 their GEOS up two pawns two pawns up Grand Master title World Cup champion title on the line black goes for counter play but white is still crushing this game but here comes Knight F2 would have been a little bit better Rook H7 check King G6 she trades the Rooks because you gotta you're up a pawn you got up two Pawns in an end game but here comes H5 check you can take but then you're gonna lose the Knight so you can't do that Rook F1 King H6 is completely ridiculous how is black two pawns down in an end game but not losing and now suddenly she she wins upon back Knight D5 oh my gosh oh my gosh good that's gonna might find a way to win this game what is going on she was winning and now nirgil just says you know what take my knight rook and Knight versus Rook is a draw even if you play it out and they did they did play it out white ends up losing the pawn but there's no way to defeat a person with a rook with a rook and a knight even a rook and Bishop and that's more complicated and this takes 50 moves it looks like you're about to get mated but you're always able to give checks there's also stalemate traps you cannot take this because the King has absolutely nowhere to go it takes 118 moves nor Gil will unfortunately not win this game not get the Grand Master title and not be the Women's World Cup champion until at least tomorrow August the 21st because that is when they play the tie breaks that is when they play the tie breaks um and uh that uh that that Championship will have to wait unfortunately which is a uh which is a very very big deal so two draws and this will be decided in the tie breaks uh unless uh it is decided in the best of four format in which case scratch everything that I just said I'm jet lagged and they're either playing a tie break tomorrow they play two more classical games well nobody watches 27 minutes of a 27 minute video anyway right I'm sure viewer retention is this far is low so nobody will know that I made a mistake definitely don't point it out in the comments but definitely uh check out waterstones if you're in the UK use my code I'll see you tomorrow get out of here
