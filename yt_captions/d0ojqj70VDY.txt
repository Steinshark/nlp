welcome to my top 15 smartphones from the whole of 2018 and I've put them in some kind of rough order just based on how much each one has impressed me let's get right into it number 15 is the sony xperia x f3 and just generally it's a bit of a weird phone everything from its general shape to just where the fingerprint scanner is placed but actually there is a lot to like here the HDR screen is very good especially with video and the camera is a big improvement from past generations alright then we've got the very recent Nokia 7.1 and it's not a flagship phone but in some ways feels like the compact flagship phone we always wanted for the price it's not amazingly powerful but the camera is very capable with a lot of features to play around with and Android 1 means it's got zero blow wear and their latest updates not to mention it feels just really robust then we've got the honor play which aims to be a gaming phone but while it was at it managed to become one of my go-to recommendations for anyone on a budget the screen isn't just fantastic but the screen to body ratio - it's as high on this phone as it is only $1000 Galaxy Note 9 it's also powered by the akhirin at 970 chip which is not the most powerful chip in the world but was good enough for the 2018 flagship Huawei P 20 pro and so it's more than good enough on this phone at barely a third of the price iPhone 10 s and iPhone Tenace max I've been using the tennis max on and off ever since its launch and I'm constantly impressed by the cameras especially the front camera and how it handles HDR battery life - on the Mac's surprised me although I'm still annoyed that they include such a slow charger in the box it takes over three hours to charge this phone with the given charger that's like twice as long as my MacBook we do also have the 10r but personally I've not been as impressed by this I'd say the screen is only as good as competitors up to about the 350 dollar mark and even the battery life which was meant to be one of the main selling points of the phone just hasn't been that great Oppo find X a phone that is just beautiful from ever angle it's surrounded by gracious curves and has a display with easily one the highest screened body ratios out there I would say it is let down by the lack of a lot of standard features that you just come to expect like by P rating NFC a microSD card headphone jack and even a fingerprint scanner and this leads me on to the vivo NEX and these two phones are often bundled together but that is because they are a very similar proposition but with the NEX you're getting an in display fingerprint scanner a headphone jack and a lower price tag I would say it doesn't look quite as slick as the Oppo but at the same time is a better value proposition number nine is the honor 8x which I did switch to for a few days and normally when I switch out from a flagship phone to a cheap phone it's not a fun process I normally can't wait to just get back to my old phone but this was different because in my opinion the 8x is one of the best-looking phones all year and there was so much to play around with like real night mode on the camera that I actually kind of enjoyed it next up is the Asus rogue phone and I've managed to go hands-on with not just that but pretty much all of its main gaming phone competitors but to me the wrong phone feels like the one to go for it has most of the pillars of a good flagship even to my surprise good cameras but also all of those over the top gaming centric features that you secretly want things like a vapor calling chamber 90 Hertz display which does actually feel noticeably smoother than the 60 on most phones and even a side mounted charging port so you can carry on gaming even when you're plugged in then we've got the mate 20 which is a very different phone from the meet 20 probe but at the same time very much a flagship and very much worth the money the cameras and the charging speed are as impressive as that phone but still pretty good and then when it comes to performance screen to body ratio and battery life it beats almost every Android phone out there the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and this is a firm that I use day to day for two months straight and I found it to be not just reliable but also pretty fully featured it's built like a tank with good initial battery life but unfortunately the battery deteriorated very quickly and after two months I was barely getting a day on a single charge not to mention that whilst its variable aperture is definitely useful it's kind of been beaten out by phones from Huawei and Google that pretty much used software alone to take better night mode shots okay top five and kicking things off we've got the pixel three XL which like its predecessor is a firm that isn't really done justice by its specifications alone because a big part of its proposition is in the software for example the combination of new touch sounds a faster UI and improved vibration feedback make every action just feel really good whether that's typing pulling down the notification bar or just scrolling not to mention while the camera is not as big of an upgrade as the pixel 2 was over the pixel 1 Google has added quite a few meaningful improvements like wide-angle selfie and the new night sight mode which pretty much works like magic and if you haven't seen my video on this I'll leave it as he caught above ok number 4 is the real need to pro you might remember that when I made my round up video for the middle of 2018 I featured pretty highly the Xiaomi me 8 - well the real me - Pro is a very similar proposition but better in pretty much every way it misses out on being an Android one phone which is definitely a shame but compensates by being cheaper prettier and having a headphone jack and expandable storage 1 plus 60 and on one hand this is an incredible value phone but on the other hand I'm not as impressed by it as I was the 6 just a few months ago I probably have preferred a camera improvement instead of the in display fingerprint scanner and while companies like Xiaomi and Huawei have massively picked up the pace in 2018 the oneplus 60 feels like one giant sidestep but that doesn't change the fact that you're getting a serious amount of phone for the money here and I definitely appreciate the extra bit of battery in this new phone ok number two is the pocket phone f1 which basically has the performance of the oneplus 60 with the price of it and the 1 plus 60 is hardly an expensive phone as it is and what surprised me about this phone is that I tried a really hard to find some sort of major flaw here you'd think that surely with performance this good at this price that the battery would suck or that the camera doesn't take good photos or that it's really fragile but none of this is true turns out that aside from its issue with HD video in Netflix it is very tough to fault and even has IR face unlocking that works in the dark okay that leaves us with one phone and this might be a complete surprise to you or you might have seen it from a mile away but that device is the huawei mate 20 Pro it is the phone I've chosen to use daily and in so many areas it is not just good but outstanding when it comes to camera battery life performance and charging speed it blitzes every Android phone out there and I'm not getting paid to say any of this since using this phone I've had a fair few moments that just feel straight out of a commercial for example a couple of weeks ago I was on a plane and outside the plane it was dark but it looked incredible and I remember the moment where everyone around me was fiddling around with flash and I was just there using night mode and I'm pretty sure my photo turned up better than theirs so yeah it's not a perfect phone and a few people I've talked to about it just can't stand the way the software looks but for me it's been very good so far but I will keep you updated because things change thank you so much for watching it really doesn't mean a lot to me my name is Erin this is misty the boss I don't catch you in the next one [Music]
