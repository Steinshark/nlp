valve's portal series has gotten raving reviews ever since it started back in 2007. it combines puzzle elements with a first person perspective as the player a test subject must find a way to get through test chambers by shooting portals on a surface although it seems trivial at first it becomes everything but as you try to work out a way to get through each level but since then this game has also gotten another reputation for years hundreds of gamers have been racing through the game trying to beat it as fast as possible in fact according to speedrun.com portal is the seventh most rand speed game of all time pretty impressive given that it's just 10 years old let's take a look at the world record progression for portal the first thing that can be a little bit confusing about portal is all the different categories the three most popular are glitchless inbounds and out of bounds glitchless is pretty self-explanatory you run through the game without using any glitches inbounds lets you use a bunch of glitches which i'll cover later but both you and your portals must stay within the boundaries of the map and finally out of bounds lets you use whatever glitches you want to get through the game no matter how crazy while glitches and out of bounds still have a lot of runners the most famous category by a long shot is the inbounds category perhaps something about the mix of not completely breaking the game while still providing an entertaining run attracts people to it so to keep things relatively simple i'm only going to be talking about the inbounds run in this video also it should be noted there's a couple of different ways of timing this category with loads and without loads there's a random albeit brief loading period after every map so in order to keep runs consistent this load time is removed at the end of every run in recent years people have developed software to automatically remove the load times in the splitting software but initially the final time you would see of a run would be about 20 seconds slower than how fast the run really was so if the time you see on screen doesn't match the time of the run that i say now you know why for starters the first runners that were known to be going back and forth with the inbounds record were zimbabwe and vitalis they took turns pushing the wrecker down to around the 16 minute mark but then they both got stomped by a runner of the name in existence he beat all the test chambers in 15 minutes and 26 seconds in july of 2012. how did he do it well let's take a look the first big trick that inexistence did is something that's known as accelerated back hopping it's very similar to bunny hopping where you build up a bunch of speed by doing several quick jumps and it was actually the result of valve trying to remove bunny hopping from portal if you jump forward turn around to mid-air and keep jumping backwards you can keep accelerating more and more with each jump the reason for this is because the game tries to slow you down whenever you're moving too fast but the way they try to slow you down is by adding backwards momentum to whichever way you're moving the game assumes that you're moving forward all the time so you can keep building up this backwards momentum as much as you want in existence did this as often as he could throughout his run another commonly used glitch was portal bumping where he shooted a portal right next to a wall and confuse the game it doesn't know where to put it so it puts it right behind the wall in existence uses twice in escape 1 as well as several other times in chambers 15 16 and 19 to progress more quickly through the level by getting to different parts more quickly as for the rest of the run a lot of it was just coming up with really creative ways to get from the start of the level to the end such as right here he shoots portals over and over off of nearly every surface you can see constantly changing where the next portal is going to take him in existence his run stood for several months until a player by the name of sully jhf came along to beat it by 10 seconds that september there's not really a whole heck of a lot that he did differently from existence either he just optimized tricky jumps and perfected his movement soy would go on to keep improving his run more and more and eventually he did find some tricks to help him he brought it down from the mid-15s down to the mid-14s and then into the mid-13s one thing that greatly helped him remain unchallenged for so long were two valuable tricks the edge glitch and the save glitch normally the player and the camera are located right on top of each other and there's no way to separate them however if you place a portal right next to the edge of a wall and carefully walk near it in just the right way your player can go through the portal and end up at wherever the corresponding other portal is while the camera stays at the same location this can let you shoot portals from different angles where you'd normally be able to because the portals still come from your body's different location but you're still aiming with the camera but then players found a way to take it a step further while still technically staying in the bounds of the map if you do a quick save and load while stuck in the edge glitch you can actually continue moving around the map while your camera and body are in different locations so in chamber 4 for example you can walk right through the door and finish the level without having played through any of the actual puzzle among the other smaller tricks included the acute angle glitch where you shoot one portal then another one at a precise angle and then go through the angled portal with enough speed if done correctly the player gets put at a different location than the angled portal once again this can be used to help to get to different locations more quickly and he used it in escape 1. finally though after sully had beaten the record more than 10 times a guy named azorei came out of nowhere used these tricks and just barely beat sully's record which was into the 1420s by that point with a 14-18 g-g someone had done it slowly had a rival and azore seemed to be up to the test it seemed like these two were going to be taking the record back and forth for ages to come but no he's done it he's done it no 1347 holy crap no holy crap oh my god sully completely obliterated azorez run over the following months getting more than a dozen more world records through better implementation of the save glitch and other tricks before pushing it down all the way to 1309 by october 2013. he's done it he's done it oh my god holy crap oh my god ah seriously the run that was the god tier run of porno himself claimed that it was an extremely good run and stopped grinding the category after it he said that it was likely to never be beaten unless new strategies were found and after months passed it seemed that he was right it seemed to be nearly perfect and it was just too daunting for anybody to beat eventually though a new runner blizzak emerged his skills got better and better and eventually he got within seconds of solely's run and over the course of several months in 2014 he took the time lower lower and lower but something was a little bit different you see this save glitch that i was talking about earlier ended up being a really really big deal at first it was used in the fourth chamber to help get through more quickly but runners eventually figured out with the help of a famous segmented run such as portal on inbounds that the trick can actually be used in a lot more places for example look here he's in chamber 11 and is setting up the same glitch on this wall he saves and loads and then is separated from his body since chambers 11 to 12 are located on the same map all he needs to do then is go through the walls with his camera shoot a portal right near the exit of stage 12 and go through the portal with his body boom two chambers skipped in a matter of seconds after grinding for months he eventually took the time all the way down from 1309 to 12 10. by the end of it he wasn't just doing safe glitch in chamber 4 anymore he was doing it to manipulate stages 2 3 4 5 11 12 15 16 19 and escape one by this point the main focus of the game had changed quite a bit before save glitch there was a heavy emphasis on movement but for blizzic there was a larger focus on the accuracy of his portal shots that were needed to get the save glitches to all work these save glitch routes revolutionized the way that people would speedrun portal after taking the record to 1210 blizzak had firmly cemented himself as one of if not the best person to ever play portal the combination of his masterful execution of the safe glitch route and his beautiful movement in other areas were able to launch him far ahead of any competitors his 1210 was standing strong and it seemed like nobody could beat him and then a guy named noir came along [Music] ah [Music] holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] boys holy [ __ ] voice but [ __ ] dead what [ __ ] dead [Music] [ __ ] [Music] someone had finally done it through all of his practice doing segmented runs noir had finally been able to top the mighty blizzak he didn't beat him by much but it was enough to send a shockwave around the community maybe he would be here to stay for a long time to come and once again this time stood for months and months but as always in portal new routes were discovered and the category evolved once more the save glitch began to be used in stages 13 and 19 as well as the chambers it was already used in and the movement and consistency of players once again made a significant jump by now the time was so close to the 12 minute mark that players began to wonder who would be the first to get a sub 12 minute run as it turned out it appeared to most that thin z would be the first to do it he got 1202 beating noir by 3 seconds and then a 12 minutes flat run a couple of months later but fun z couldn't quite get there it would take another runner to be wix to pick up a sub 12 minute run in october of 2015 and once he got there it was amazing [Music] [ __ ] yes and little did anybody know bewix was just getting started [Music] pb [ __ ] holy [ __ ] that's good oh my god that's good and that's where the world record for portal inbounds is today even though it's just 10 years old portal has been one of the most common speed runs found online with the amount of runners and the amount of dedication these runners have to developing new tricks the progression of the world record for portal showcases this amazing community off whether it be from its incredibly precise movement strange chicks and glitches or any of the hundreds of pieces of tech in the run portal is without a doubt one of the most fun speedruns to watch and has something for everybody thanks for watching i'll see you all next time [Music] [Music] [Music] you
