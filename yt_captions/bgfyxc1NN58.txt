Jordan if you look at the security there are many parts of it yes one part is government interference regulations laws but then another part goes deep into who we are I think the issue is not with how security restricts creativity but how actually have a room for creativity while you maintain [Music] security [Music] hello everyone watching and listening today I am speaking with the Secretary General of great Arab Minds his Excellency SED El nathari we discussed the origins of the United Arab Emirates how the Abraham Peace Accords and the tri Faith initiative have taken effect and open dialogue between the peoples of the abrahamic faiths we discussed the project spearheaded by SED for the education entrepreneurial development and empowerment of young emiratis and how the unique vision and strong values of the United Arab Emirates have lifted the country to Heights unimaginable only half a century ago I've interviewed a fair number of people from the Arab world and and from the Muslim World more broadly and I've also delved to some degree into the um Abraham Accords which I'm very excited about and I'm very much interested in talking to you today about the United Arab Emirates and so I thought we might as well start with some really basic questions because lots of people who are listening won't know as much about your country as they might and so the first obvious thing to talk about is tell me tell us exactly where you're situated geographically who your immediate neighbors are and and the size of the country just the basic details well Jordan thank you to have me on uh it's great to see you screen to screen and hopefully very soon we'll be meeting face to face in the UAE uh the United Arab Emirates located in the Middle East uh I'm not sure how accurate is Wikipedia but it says you were born in 1962 Jordan if you look at the United Arab Emirates in 1962 you would see an area of sand uh it had almost every single reason for it not to be successful for it not to exist it had every single factor for it to be an impossible Nation located in the Middle East one of the world's most unstable region ongoing conflicts in the Middle East tensions failed States and then beside that you have the environment the harsh climate heat waves I just recently saw an article that there are some Western cities May face an environment or weather that's somehow close to what the Middle East is experiencing but in 20000 that risk comes 70 years to experience what we have been experiencing for 50 years and then you also had the infrastructure B basic infrastructure uh I grew up listening to stories about how hard it was to move from one place to another uh how small were the houses families were and very limited small houses where you barely have a place for your bed uh you had all these factors the unstable region the environment the infrastructure yet here I am living in one of the the most secured safe cleanest diverse cities on Earth and that's the UE the U we live in today along with 200 different nationalities it has one of the world's top competitive cities Dubai Babi and many other cities uh it have been a bacon of Hope if it have been a model that is homegrown in the Middle East and it Prov one thing that you have been discussing for so long Vision what does it mean to actually visualize a vision visualize a goal I think the UA is the ultimate case study to showcase the power and impact of a vision and so so tell me let's go over some Basics again and then we'll talk to the talk about the vision what's the population of the UAE now it's almost 9.5 million and Dubai itself how many people live there well the exact numbers I don't have the exact numbers handy now but there are millions as well and who are your immediate neighbors who are you surrounded by we're surrounded by Gulf States you have Saudi Arabia Aman and many other countries there in the Gulf States all right now you talked about the vision of the UAE and and I presume since we started talking about 1962 that there was very little in the UAE in 1962 and you talked about the importance of a vision so what was that vision and how did the UAE develop both economically and socially Jordan if you look at the history of the United Arab Emirates how it was formed uh from basic uh infrastructure uh some bwin families living in many different areas small houses uh small towns uh divided uh areas uh our Founding Father the Le shik Zed have came with a vision thought the power comes in unity uh the power and Futures also could be made by unity he thought we should unite different emirs different tribes under One Vision that Vision was to create hope out of the stre region that Vision was to actually build a nation that represent us in a way that should be represented globally who are we as people of this region what are our values what are our culture tradition how can we turn every single challenge into a solution uh into an opportunity well if you look at the location being in the Middle East is not something easy it's f f with challenges it fills with instability but then you could also turn that into a huge opportunity you are a hub to the whole world you are a a hub to two billion people you could reach East and West uh that's how you turn a challenge into an opportunity if you hear the uh the messages that have been recorded by the uh founder shik Z he was a very wise leader who believed that he would see uh this future coming he could visualize stuff I can still hear some of his TV interviews in 1971 and 1975 as if he speaks about today's reality he thought yes we will uh grow yes we will focus on education yes we will focus on trade on economy but then we will also stick to our identity to our culture to our values we will will send the message of Hope out of this region because I think our neighbors the 108 million young Arabs are would love to see a message of Hope out of this region we have seen for so long many challenges uh many conflicts happening uh and I think there is a huge hunger and need to see more messages of Hope coming out of this region from this region for this region to show a model that works what what were the Emirates and you you made reference to tribal groups that were United what were the Emirates exactly and when did they unite when when did the when was the country established the country was established in second December 1971 at that day so it's very very new country yes it's a young country and I think I think being young made us all see how vision and hard work could actually turn the impossible into possible who thought that in 50 years time you could turn a place in the middle of the desert into the wars trade Hub into a place where it's among the top 10 most competitive cities in Safety and Security and trade and business uh and you name it I think if I'll speak about the rankings and I'll speak about the competitiveness of the cities in the United Arab emirat I can speak for the next hour about how many uh stuff that have been done in a way or in a quality that could compete with any City around the whole world and what were the Emirates if you look at it uh well I wasn't born in 1971 but what I hear from my uh family my father my grandfather it was Desert Sandy area where you had 10 in some areas you had uh people who would work in uh in farming in some areas people who would go into fishing and pearl diving and to trading uh I think what was there back then it was a trade Hub it have always been a trade Hub because you trade with India you trade with many other countries around and but then the skills were different the products were completely different the Services were completely different uh one thing was in Commons people wanted to actually invest in themselves and their families so they would even fly to get educated they would also uh go and meet uh in many different universities or schools to actually get access to education education was very limited in the whole region uh most of the services were were very limited but I think our Founding Fathers uh the leadership saw a potential saw an opportunity saw a belief and this goes back to the history of this region if you look at the Golden Age of the Arab uh this region were behind many contributions we're behind many Sciences you name it Al Jabra alism and Medicine uh names of the exploration of different Stars uh there were many people in this region who contributed to the fundamentals of these Sciences I think this has been building our confidence that we can do it and that the way today so you you said that say back before 1971 the economy was rather rudimentary and the governmental structure was essentially tribal and shik zad United all the all those various tribes now they had been fractious for a long time what did he do that brought the unity about you made reference to Identity culture and value but but I'd like to know in more detail why did these tribal groups decide to band together and why has that maintained itself given as you also pointed out the tremendous instability that has characterized the Middle East for well forever as as far as of us living today are concerned so what did how did he manage this vision and what are the elements of identity culture and value you think that unite you and allow you to be prosperous I think Jordan one thing that was clear enough for everyone that the direct intention that the late Z had he he wanted good for everyone he wanted to ensure that Unity bring better good for everyone uh it didn't happen in one day or one month he have been into that continuous conversation with the ruler of Dubai rash B with a ruler of different areas at the United Arab Emirates discussing how we can bring Unity how can we build something that's bigger than all of us uh that's what we study in history that's what our parents actually have experience and lived so my uh my dad was following that these discussion and everyone celebrated on the 2 December 1971 when it happened actually happened because they heard about many Trials of unity in the region many of them filed and many of them didn't work but what made it work I think that deep uh bold hard work uh plan to stick to a vision and showcase a vision uh with good intentions with uh purpose and with passion if you hear the speaks about Unity or human resources he usually do it with passion you can know how uh honest he is you can know how how he actually visualized that vision and that's look at the way today went from a Sandy place to exploring Mars to uh right now we have an astronaut at the International Space Station so one of the things that everybody who's watching and listening might do well to consider is that um say just made reference to the honesty of shik shik zad and we have this idea often in our culture especially among the people who are more cynical and N nihilistic that if you're manipulative and you take advantage and you win in your business dealings and you're you're a hard ass sort of Wolf of Wall Street kind of character then you'll come up on top with your dominance and your and your willingness and ability to use force and almost all that's nonsense I mean most of the criminally Psychopathic oriented types who use dominance they end up well they often meet a violent end but they're very rarely successful and the reason for that is that you can fool people once or twice but you can't fool them consistently and this is actually why I so interest interested why and how the unity of the UAE was brought about because in order to make something work over well let's say Generations but even over the span of a lifetime you better not be lying to the people that you're negotiating with because if you do they will especially if you've come you know like a wolf in sheep's clothing they will not be happy about that and they will absolutely take their revenge and so if you want to be successful you said he he did genuinely want the best for the people of the region so he was aiming up and he was honest and you can get an awful long way aiming up and being honest and so all right so he had a vision and he was a trustworthy person and he spoke with passion now how did the UAE develop economically that was primarily oil I I I presume and and and but and people might think well the reason the UAE is doing so well is because it has oil and that's basically cheap riches and it doesn't take a lot of work to do well when you're receiving billions of dollars but I would counter that by saying that there are plenty of countries on the planet that have no shortage of Natural Resources um that are corrupt beyond belief and that are miserable Beyond imagination and all of whose wealth is devoted to a very small number of people who are in fact very crooked and everything is hell and so money alone is not going to bring the kind of stability and vision that you're talking about in relationship to the UAE so what what te tell us how the tell tell us how the economy of the area has grown and how you guys have determined to diversify and to like stabilize your economy across time well you say that Jordan oil is an enabler and you can't be over depending on oil actually if you look at uh many different countries oil could be a curse sometimes uh because over dependence of on oil would let you make short-term decisions to actually increase your revenue and so on what have been made in the U is completely different actually we started thinking of diversifica diversification of the economy right right away let's say Dubai for example today 95% of the GDP is not coming from the oil it's less than 5% % depends on oil that's Dubai one of the most competitive economies in the whole region I think what we did very well is turning of your problem into an opportunity uh look we use location very well to be a hub and a trade but then to actually be a hub you need a complete redesign of the environment you need to design Logistics you need to design enablers you need to design an environment where people feel safe to chase their dreams feel safe to actually be part of what's being built and I think that what made uh today's economy the economy we see because everyone felt that they want to be part of this thing happening in the UAE part of bringing hope to Life part of bring bringing Vision to a reality part of challenging uh every single obstacle I think it became uh a sort of a movement that Humanity felt we could see a civilization being uh built here right in the middle east in the UAE and then you see many companies have trusted uh the UAE and its stability they moved their headquarters to the uh there are many homegrown uh companies like herat aine which is among the worst top airlines Airline another great company and then you have DP Ward handling many ports worldwide uh you have many other companies one after another and then you have uh foreign investors coming uh I think we we also went into advancing our skills in many different Industries we have now many Marais actually uh in many different Industries and Logistics and transportation and materials and Engineering uh you they have different companies they have products uh and we maintain to have credibility on the way we work we maintain to have uh also consistency because if you look at the UA in 1971 and then 1975 and then 1990s 2005 2020 every year makes the UAE stronger uh brighter it it turns the story into a story of vision that came true and a vision that guides us for the next 50 years yeah well you know my my daughter has spent time in Dubai and she she's enjoyed a lot she she said that the entrepreneurial Buzz there is remarkable um I suppose in algus in some ways to Silicon Valley or maybe an algus at at the moment to also modern Israel real Hub of development she also said that it's an extraordinarily safe and clean and well-run City and I I have some questions about that um so we had we I I had talked to her about uh potentially considering moving some of the operations that I'm involved in to Dubai and let me ask you the questions that had come came to mind as a consequence of that and you you must obviously know the answers because you've attracted all sorts of companies I know the tax situation in Dubai is favorable to people who are engaged in entrepreneurial Enterprises the concern one of the concerns I had was um let's say the sanctity of private property I mean a lot of people who've invested in China have had second thoughts in recent years because they've found that it isn't obvious what exactly what they own you know and one of the advantages to being located in somewhere like the United States in particular of the United States but you could say the same thing about Great Britain and most of the countries derived from English common law tradition is that if you own something you can be pretty damn sure that it's yours and that's a really hard thing to establish right because in the entire history of humankind one of the most likely consequences of owning something was that someone was going to take it from you and now you said you know the UAA has had a pretty good track record for n on 50 years and that's starting to become a reasonable amount of time why do you think it is that companies have trusted you to move their assets to the UAA and why do you think it is that they can trust you Jordan well I'm I'm glad that your daughter experienced what Dubai is and I'm very excited for you to experience what Dubai in the UAE is I think they don't they didn't just move their Camp their companies and businesses I think they move their most valuable asset their families uh I I hear hundreds and thousands of stories of people who have been moving to Dubai and bhabi and the UA uh with their families uh growing their children here in this environment I think what we did very well and I can't speak about the whole government or the UAE but with my own personal view is we designed an environment where we feel we we own what we work hard for uh now currently the real estate market is booming in Dubai U there are thousands of people moving into Dubai there are thousands of people buying in Dubai they do that because basically they trusted the system they trusted the government they trusted the environment and you can't buy trust there is no way you can buy trust but you can build it and you can earn it and this earning and build comes in a result of a long credible consistent hard work and a system that works uh I live in this neighborhood in Dubai uh in a very in every single neighborhood you would find a marati family you would find families from Canada from uh UK from uh China from Bangladesh you name it from India many other uh people 200 different nationalities have chosen Dubai to be a place for their business for their families for their growth uh they chose the UAE because they know that living in one neighborhood walking at 3:00 a.m. at night they wouldn't even face a 0.1% of a threat to their safety to their security to their assets to their privacy we have respect but we also have order uh and order that works uh to maintain a lifestyle that Humanity deserve I think what we managed very well is now they speak a a lot about uh micro ecosystems and micro environments when you try to design a micro environment a garden a shading system in your house where you design your own micro environment I think what the UA have been doing it designed a whole micro W in Dubai and in maab and the UAE where you would see the whole world the ideal part of the world being flourished here and that's why people trust uh because they trust the system they trust the order they trust the way it was designed as the holiday season unfolds it's a time of Joy gratitude and reflection in

I spent a fair amount of time 25 years ago looking at the difference between Japan and the United States on the education front also the economic front and uh this was at a time I guess it was in the 1980s so I guess that's more like 40 years ago um when there was concern throughout the Western World or apprehension that Japan was going to be a monolithic and dominating economic Force because it had you know exploded onto the scene in in an absolutely remarkable manner produced a huge economy and one of the things that struck me about Japan and uh was that it was in some ways a very very conservative Society now there are some advantages to that the Japanese education system before University is top rate their universities aren't very good though and and that's relevant to the to the place that I'm going now in the US the grade school system isn't as good as the Japanese school but the universities are a lot better and in the US there's more crime but there's also more creativity and if you look at the curves for criminality and the curves for creativity across the age span they actually match pretty closely and that's because there's actually a fair bit of entrepreneurial Drive in criminal activity so for example among drug dealers in the United States drug dealers are more likely than their peers to also be employed and so now I'm not making a case for the benefit of of criminal entrepreneurial ity my my point is this is that it's very difficult to get the balance between security and freedom right right and if if you tilt towards too much towards security you risk suppressing people to the point where you'll interfere with with creative free enterprise expression not just on the business side but on the generally creative side and so do I know that from all reports that do is an incredibly safe environment and you know you hear about you hear exactly the same thing for for example with regards to Singapore and Singapore also is doing extremely well economically but but the question arises in my mind is that well are you buying that security at the price of um a necessary freedom and is it what's the evidence that that's a re reasonable medium to long-term trade so have add her i' I'd like to know your thoughts on that well Jordan if you look at the security there are many parts of it yes one part is government interference regulations laws and stuff that we we maintain to maintain security and order but then another part goes deep into who we are our DNA which character we build in our people uh and that goes into the society into the environment into Generations I think what we managed to do is we we managed to build people or attractive and people who can know the difference between Order and Chaos who can know the difference between having a secured environment safe environment and having a creative environment which is which also could be uh Al long with that environment I think the issue is not with how security restricts creativity but how actually have a room for creativity while you maintain security and there are many uh opportunities where you can see that happening in Dubai if you just Google Dubai or Google do a search on the most beautiful buildings worldwide or when did Humanity uh actually showcase their creativity in the way they build the stuff and the way they design stuff you would always hear Dubai you would always see Dubai uh we have creative artists designers from all over the world came to this place to actually showcase their creativity to actually uh also showcase where humans can show different ideas we have ideas on tolerance ideas on connectivity ideas on culture differences and similarities uh we hosted the word Expo uh export 2020 uh where almost every single country participated designed something that represent that nation and showed the whole world on what are their values and beliefs and their culture and it was like a beautiful competition where we compete on building better civilization better future for uh for Our Generations uh and that's happening right away it was live in Expo 2020 and Dubai uh and yet zero crimes at Expo 2020 extremely safe environment uh I guess the number reached 25 million visitors uh to that show uh the Expo 2020 show and you see that happening every day you have zones you have the Clusters like the Dubai internet City Dubai Design District Dubai Media city where you have people from all over the world coming in uh to work and build and design something so I think if you design the right environment and then build the right or embed the right values in people's DNA you can actually hit the formula right okay okay so let's let's talk about that for for for a minute I mean one of the major contribut contributors to criminality and general chaos in the west and that's particularly true at the moment in the United States is the rise of single parent families right fatherlessness kids especially fatherless boys because they're much more likely to grow up to engage in UNT behavior and so that raises a question which is if you're not going to rely on oppression and the police for example to maintain security but you want to build uh a society that's predicated on values that are solid so that security and creativity can can both flourish what are the values that you have to instantiate and so what do you think that you're doing right on the value side with regards to your culture that's providing this more optimized mix of security and creativity I think uh Jordan part of that comes from who we are uh if you look at the Arabic values Arabic culture the values of this region uh for decades have been based on tolerance based on accept ing others based on generosity based on the golden rule that many different faith and religion speaks about that you wish for others what you wish for yourself hundreds of and of quotes and examples and stories about that that what our parents and families speaks about the the our responsibilities towards the community towards neighbors you will find it in our faith you would find it in Islam you would find it in our culture hospitality is a huge thing in the Arabic culture you would see it in the Traditions you would see it in every single part of our culture and looking at all of these I think we managed to build a character and character building is something that uh somehow turned to show its results today because when you build a character with the right set of values you embed the right set of values you actually also build immunity immunity against uh different thoughts that may not work align with who we are and that's something very very important for us to maintain as a legacy that yes we are a global City yes we are part of a the whole world but then we also know exactly how to differentiate between what represents our value and what doesn't represent our value this doesn't mean that we will disrespect the other this doesn't mean that we may always uh put a block in different thoughts we learn we grow but then when you build that immunity system I think it works like how our body works it knows which vitamins or which part to take and which part to leave or actually defend against and that's what we made uh I think it it's it happened I see it I see it every every day I see it in families I see it in parents I see it in school I see it in universities where even before you see an action in government I think you would see people to mentioning that oh this idea actually represent who I am and this doesn't represent who I am I think we should maintain this for the Next Generation because you see how the words getting uh scary to see where the word heading in some areas uh you you scroll down on your phone you may see uh Jordan Peterson speaks about vision and personality but then you you swipe and see some horrible ideas on uh different Acts or different beliefs that I don't that aims to takes us back 100 years ago or 200 years ago or takes us into chaos and here is I think where we build the immunity and the wisdom wisdom of of picking the right decision so so I I I'm particularly curious on the family front how what to what degree are families in in the UAE still traditionally intact rather than broken what's your divorce rate like I don't know if you have those stats at hand and maybe you don't um and what's the birth rate because you know in the west the birth rate in many countries is plummeted far below replacement it's and it's part it's part of the fractionation of the family and that seems like a very very bad long-term strategy so how are you guys doing on the birth rate and divorce front and what's the typical structure of a family in in the UAE well I usually prefer to be accurate when it comes to numbers but then I don't have the numbers handy yet uh if you look at how the lifestyle of families here in the United Arab Emirates I could see my family itself the bonding is all the family is always a big thing here the family always comes first the family always is the the first guiding uh campus for us on where are we heading uh who we are uh what are our beliefs and values uh and I think we have many rituals where we actually always allocate some time to spend days spend uh different uh occasions with family like just last week was the Eid holiday where you'd see families Gathering it's a celebration for everyone and then I know most of the families around where they we they meet every week and uh we used to have way bigger families before uh where almost every family consists of five to six members maybe with the uh the current busy lifestyle numbers sometimes get decreased a bit but I think the value of family stayed very very strong well I've got some stats here that are very interesting so in 2018 in the UAE the divorce rate stood at 12% and then it was 133% in 20192 but it dropped in 2021 to 9 and continued its downward Trend in 20 22 to 3% testifying to the development of processes and interactive programs that have proven beneficial to the parties to the conflict so it looks that's Abu Dhabi judicial outreach program succeeds in reducing divorce rate to 3% so it looks like you're doing pretty good on the divorce rate front um the the birth rate let me just check that because that's also an that's also an issue of Interest let's see what have we got here on the bir rate 1.46 per wom per woman so it's it's it's it's low but not as low as it is in many countries so now okay so now you talked about the values that stabilize the country that make it secure and that also allow for creativity and maybe we've gone over this but I'm going to hit it one more time those values in the Middle East have been around for a long time including the value of hospitality but the region still has been extremely fractious now you've quelled that to a large degree in the UAE and so I'm still curious about that you've you've obviously done something like universalize these values so that they can Embrace a larger number of people but and you said you did that through passionate leadership and vision and trust and and then fortunate economic circumstances and maybe maybe that's maybe that's a sufficient answer maybe we'll maybe we'll turn to something else yes I a couple of other things um what's the situation with women's rights in the UAE and and how is that similar or different to the to the to the to the state that obtains in the countries around you well the case for Women rights and gender balance in the UAE is very very unique I think it's competitive worldwide if you look at the workforce in our government for example more than 60% are women uh uh I have worked in 12 different jobs six of them I had female managers uh in many cases uh woman rights is something we have been raising uh and growing and having it as a priority priority uh we it's part of who we are again uh I have I have a daughter who I think every single member of this family have celebrated from the day she were born when she is born she she got a letter from the UA president uh telling her that we want you to actually represent the values of the l z we want you to carry that Legacy forward and then women get educated and I think we are on the top highest rates from moving to school to University worldwide uh in terms of how many graduate women we have I think the rights women have in every aspect of uh of the the quality of life here in the United Arab Emirates you could see the the balance you could see the the the support you could see everyone enable her to flourish enable her to be who she uh to build a family to build a career to build a success uh look at marriage uh there are hundreds of policies to actually support uh marriage look at uh uh being in the workforce there are lots of policies Now with harrid uh model of work uh with uh flexibility in hours and timings and attendance and all these stuff I think it made it even not only easier but Al also made it even safe to be who you are if you decided to focus on your family or you focus on your studies or focus on your office uh working hours or focus on your career growth or your business you can basically get support and the government will handle its responsibility and families will handle its responsibility to celebrate you wherever you are and uh so you may hear that many people actually called let's say my name is but some people call me bu which means the father of Shem and we have that in Arabic tradition where they know that the most valuable thing for a man is his daughter or his son so they name me after my daughter that's how much we respect actually uh woman or how much I respect my daughter and and actually I feel proud every time I hear her name and I want to be the best father I could or be the best best employee I could for her and for many others finally some good

me although Saudi Arabia has been liberalizing its attitude towards um women's rights in recent years it seems to me that there's a marked difference between the UAE and Saudi Arabia on the women's rights front and so why did those two societies develop in different directions and what do you see happening in Saudi Arabia on the women's rights front well I like how I think the region is diversed if you spend time in Dubai and then go and spend time in Cairo or spend time in Muscat or spend time in Aman is different yes there are common values they are always I language there is always Islamic Traditions but then the way the societies live or grow is completely different there's different opinions there's there are different point of views and I think the region is somehow heading to a very bright positive side uh I see something happening in the region I see hope in the region when I meet uh young Arabs when I meet decision makers in the report uh Dubai just hosted World Expo and now you Saudi Arabia is applying to host World Expo Doha hosted the World Cup uh you have many other cities are planning to build new cities build uh on new islands have new tourism experiences and I think that goes back to an event that I attended in Riyad in Saudi Arabia where the conference had a talk there and he said in back in 90s he saw a man or a leader that showed and proved to the whole region what could be possible and how to design and build something Global out of this region and that person was his muhamad the UA prime minister uh it made me feel proud at that moment of who we are and what's our impact but then I see it everywhere Jordan I don't see it only on Jesus I even see it across the globe uh I see articles I uh I saw an article on BBC where it it was about the next Dubai of Africa where could be the next Dubai be in Africa where could be where are the next growing cities in the Middle East or many different areas I like how the UAE how Dubai how Babi became a model that works and that shows you can actually achieve what what your dreams or Vision are in a very short time and your age and my age we can actually build a whole nation so so let's talk about your I'd like to talk about the the the international scene a little bit now and so um your how are your relationships with your immediate neighbors and so I I want to know that and what what what direct influence you think the success of the UA has had on their development strategies let's start with that how are your relationships with your immediate neighbors who who are your strong allies who do you feel that you're collaborating with to build a more positive vision of the future on the Arab side okay I'm I'm not a diplomat uh I won't speak on behalf of uh our embassies or our ambassadors but what I see is UA have maintained a positive relationship a respecting relationship with almost every single country worldwide that's why we gained trust from many different countries that why we became the word a smaller word in this nation uh you would see us participating in every single Mission or act that helps Humanity grow uh look at the numbers look at the numbers you would see the way among always among the top five when it comes to foreign aid when it comes to support human human Arian activities that goes back to 1971 you would see many hospitals many schools many universities many clinics worldwide are named after the or named after the UAE just recently I was in Washington DC and I met a friend of mine there he he told me I actually go for my Clinic appointments to a hospital where the UA invested uh heavily ion for its research for its services in Washington DC and the same you would hear it in many different countries where actually you would see the UA and Leadership footprint there that there is something uh good happening there is that what again built credibility in this country that's again built why this country is special this country is different uh you would hear many head of States speaks proudly about their partnership with the UAE uh it's a small country but it show the whole word that you could actually have a a huge impact what's your relationship let's talk a little bit about the Abraham Accords and your relationship with Israel what what's happening on that front and um what are the challenges and advantages to those to such initiatives you you have lived it you have hear it for 20 30 years conflicts and tensions we didn't see a result uh I think there were no winner in conflicts and tensions the UA took a whole different directions uh the UA took the direction of actually looking at peace and tolerance but then be brave and bold enough to act on peace and tolerance we all want we all in campaigns uh in strategy say that we want to be more tolerant more accepting more respecting but then what proves all these campaigns or all these beautiful messages is what are your actions or what are your movements toward peace and I think that something we have showed very clearly in the UAE where you would see everyone from any other nationality any religion that would feel respected it will feel safe and actually feel feel inspired feel inspired to accept the other and feel inspired to see what brings us together I can spend this our uh Jordan to speak about how close we are when it comes to thoughts or I can also look at that it from a very dark lens where we see how different we are uh I think we chose the right lens we chose to be also a Beacon of Hope uh to send that message loud to even Inspire others if it's works in the U and you see peace actually in action in the UAE you see uh respecting different cultures and nations are happening here right now why do you want to wait for for for you to actually be more tolerant uh I think no one will win against tolerance so you're you know you you mentioned earlier that you see in Dubai um a competition between different modes of productivity and generosity let's say who could who can make the best offer you know and I I've been thinking this through on the religious front we H in the world we have three major religions um emerging from from the Middle East all part of the abrahamic tradition all monotheistic all people of the book um embroiled in internally in conflict over nominally religious matters ma matters for centuries in the west and in in the Middle East and then also engaged in conflict between the major religions um and it seems to me that you know we're at a point in our historical development where where what we should be engaging in is something like a competition of invitation and you could say well you know if you have faith in your tradition then you could be an avatar of that tradition and you could live in the most no manner you could possibly imagine and if you turn out to be a shining beacon on the hill and other people are attracted well then you win and that's a good competition and now I know there have been multifaith initiatives in the UAE um it has a tradition of I don't think religious tolerance is exactly the right word it's it's more like something approximating a genuine appreciation for diversity do you want to talk a little bit about what's been happening in the uee on the faith on the faith side on the because I think that's that strikes me as extremely important and the UE you would find mosques you would find churchs you would find synagogues uh we have the abrahamic house in Babi I think what what we have been building here in the UAE is actually an environment where we respect every single religion and we respect our different differences in a way that we accept others we accept what's different and what and we focus on what brings us together like I had a conversation with many from different faiths and we were speaking about leadership building and about character building and then the name Prophet Moses came a prophet who who we do respect and uh the counterparty spoke to me about a a leadership program where they designed based on the Journey of prophet Moses uh and how he actually became who he is and who he was and that's something we really appreciate in the Islamic culture and Islamic tradition uh because that story is in our Quran you would see it in Bible you would see it in many other books and I think focusing on areas where we see how different faith faith brings different uh messages or uh different different stories or different values uh and see where are the common areas I think that's where our strength come from and uh and there are hundreds and thousands of areas where you could agree and I could agree and many other people from many different faiths could agree that yes this is part of who we are or this is part of who we believe in or this is the God we worship uh and that's how we worship him and that's how we actually serve our nation our planet our community well one of the most remarkable initiatives that I've seen in recent years along with the Abraham Accords which established peace between Israel and a variety of Arab states is the abrahamic family house which is a um very impressive complex that has on the same site a mosque a church and a synagogue and you know that seems to me to be symbolically emblematic of what's happening in the UAE now that Rec that just opened recently I I believe right that's opened what in the last is it is it the last six months it's certainly within the last year yes it is and so um what what is the conse what has been the consequence of that Enterprise and um how was it set in motion why did it succeed today I was spending some time on social media and a VI a video of a student I think almost seven years old student came out that he actually went to a tour with his family to that abrahamic house and he was telling the whole world I think sorry was among 10 12 years old I'm not sure how old he was but he was telling the whole word that oh look at this place where actually Muslims Christians Jews could worship in different buildings uh that represent present their different worships or different Faith worshiping one God uh actually happened here right away in Dubai in Abu Dhabi this place is public it it built on an idea that's simple yet bold and sharp just think about it many different religious religions faiths people from many different Faith coming together in one place living with peace it's actually possible it's happening you don't need a magic stick for it to happen you you will need to design the right environment for it to happen the right conversations the the right dialogue the right inspiration for Next Generation and I I don't see any challenge to bring it to life to bring it to bring us all of us together and closer yeah well that would wouldn't that be a wonderful thing I mean you know I I I was ill for a couple of years and wasn't paying much attention to initiatives on the international front but when I sort of sprang back to life in 2020 um one of the first things I turned my attention to was the Abraham Accords and the fact that something genuinely new and positive seemed to be emerging in the Middle East and like it was a big deal and I was quite stunned by in some ways by how little attention was paid to that in the West because it struck me as one of the most vital developments on the international front well certainly in the last 50 to 70 years but perhaps even beyond that especially if it's Allied as you're pointing out with an actual transformation of vision you know if if if we could tilt things the collective we if we could tilt things so that we started to regard people of Faith let's say as allies instead of as mortal enemies then God only knows what we could produce and I would also say that the people of the abrahamic faiths let's say have bigger fish to fry on the enem enmity front than each other you know there's there's uh uh and this is particularly relevant in the west if the traditional religious structures collapse all sorts of bizarre systems of belief um make themselves manifest as a replacement and as far as I can tell those Replacements aren't all that desirable and so it's it seems to me to be only wise on the parts of part of Jews Christians and Muslims to look to what they have in common and to Foster that and it's very very heartening to see uh country like the UAE which can punch above its weight and which is small enough to be governable but large enough to be a model to actually take the initiative on this front I'm I'm very much looking forward I'm going to go to the UAE I think I'm going in October in early October I'm very much looking forward to going to Abu Dhabi and seeing this Tri Faith establishment that's for sure and then also obviously to see the other cities I'm very much looking forward to that because I think it's a huge deal this is this is something of historical significance the establishment of the abrahamic house you know the fact that you were able to do it that it's been successful I know that it was in let me see here uh the pope visited in 2019 um it was the first by a pope to the Arab Arabian Peninsula during that trip he signed a joint declaration with the grand Imam of Alazar that called for religious tolerance and dialogue it's like well you know hey how a little more of that would be a very very good thing so that's all extraordinarily positive and so all right so let's turn our attention a little bit more specifically to the sorts of projects that you've been involved with you have spearheaded 50 projects a lot of them concentrating on youth so why don't you delve into what you've been doing on that front um because I'm very curious we talked before this part partly what brought this podcast about I we had a conversation previously about um what might be done on the psychological front to end the demoralization of young people and to provide them with a certain amount of Hope and um it's c the case that helping young people develop a vision for the future is a is well an obvious necessity but also an extraordinarily coste effective and efficient way of guiding developing Souls into a beneficial and productive and generous future you've been doing such things for a very long time so why don't you walk us through some of your projects so Jordan I'm I'm also very excited for you to visit and experience the UAE and one part of UAE being a young country most of our population are actually young people almost 50% of uh the UA's population are young under the age of 35 uh the U government have established a minister of State for youth Affairs and have established I think it took the the boldest and the biggest steps when it comes to Youth Empowerment uh you would hear people speaking about Youth Empowerment uh in many different countries uh in panel discussion and round tabls and in many occasions these are strategies that Management Consultant offered 500 major strategies that end up in the desk or sometimes end up to be a recommendation or discussion and you don't see it all from a reality or you don't see uh actual steps taken by the government uh to transform all these recomend recommendation into actionable uh results or facts and figures the case is completely different in the united arabis I used to work uh as a director general for for the federal Youth Authority uh what my main ultimate mandate was to actually ensure we designed the right environment for young people to reach their full potential and today if you look at the young people of the United Arab Emirates you would see that spark in their eyes they want to be part of something bigger that's something that I always wanted to be part of back in 2009 uh when I was a high school student like many other young people I thought what would I want to be part of why do uh where where I'm heading what's the work I have I want to uh accomplish or what are my achievements one ultimate source of inspiration was the UA leadership I saw the Prime Minister working on many different projects working on delivering uh different clusters different economic achievements different uh stuff when it comes to uh to infrastructure and so on so like many other young people I went and ask the big question on where I'm heading where do I want to 10 years from now that was back in 2009 so I found the prime minister's who page and back then hot mail was something cool and everyone used to mail uh others and I found a link to actually email the Prime Minister and I ended up emailing the Prime Minister telling him that I'm amazed with all these achievements I'm amazed with the way you transform vision and reality and I want to to be part of this I want to be part of your team I want to be part of this purpose I want to actually help others the way I saw you guys inspired me inspired me to be part of something bigger and I send that email in many countries you would think there are 10,000 20,000 50,000 of emails goes to the leadership and or sometimes ending up in with the assistance I didn't have big expect I thought maybe maybe one day among the 100 or 1,000 emails that my email could reach to the Prime Minister surprisingly enough few days later I get an email says Dear s ambitious is great work hard look at the role models around believe in what we are building and one day you'll have the opportunity because every single young person here here in this country would have an opportunity it was signed personally by the the Prime Minister himself I I kept that email printed and framed in my office I remember 10 years from that email uh I met the Prime Minister for one of the events he was in my office during that time the smile I saw uh the the moment I lived I felt every second and deep inside I felt That's The Power of having the right role model That's The Power of actually having and visualizing a vision and then working hard for that Vision to happen and that's the moment where I thought I should be part of and be responsible to help others find their goal find their path find their role models that's when I ended up being part of uh the Youth Empowerment initiatives and policies uh we have many policies and projects where it sets young people into their priority they are the one who designed their strategy they are the one who design their policies uh we used to have uh circles where we actually have the top decision makers young people students discussing certain problems or certain challenges and then actually Empower them to design the solution it's stuff related to education to mental health to housing and let me give you an example on housing uh we had we had uh the public policy adviser we had a decision maker participating in one of the circles and we were young people discussing well building a house is not a task that is as easy as we think because many of us are not designers or not engineers and and sometimes you will need proper budgeting you would need proper timeline processes and so on and we discussed maybe part of the solution could be actually to have a one1 fundamental course or guideline to help young people take that step and there were the government a week later signed a policy by the Prime Minister where actually it equips and train people to take that Milestone forward to actually be prepared to build their house and we have the same for building a family we have the same to actually joining a Workforce or a university we have a lot of enablers and we have policy okay the same meaning okay yeah okay so so the same meaning you you you talked about family you talked about career um you you talked about education these enabling processes what what what exactly do you do and and how how many people is that affecting and how do you know what the effect is so how do you enable the young people on all these fronts well we design products products and policies and services so one example we have a policy where in every single government Authority or in department or agency you allocate a seat for young people where a young person would be part of that board uh would be part of that board meeting would be part of that discussion to actually transfer young people's views into the ultimate decision Mak layer at that Authority that's one that policy is signed you have seats allocated for young people you wouldn't find that in any government worldwide where we allocate a seat for young person every single board uh another initiative or policy was actually designing different uh youth councils across the country across institution across cities we have the Dubai youth Council the ababi youth Council uh we have councils across companies like M youth Council uh DP WS youth Council we have an agencies and Ministries where you have the ministry of economy youth Council this youth councils acts as uh representation of what Young what young people Aspire from these different Ministries or these different Corporation and they sit uh high enough to have a direct engage engagement uh with the leaders actually have some they actually have some influence exactly they they do have not just proor yes they do have influence they have the toolkit they have the support they have the enablers uh and I think what's very very special in the United Arab Emirates is that direct bonding between young people and the leadership uh go in the streets in the neighborhood during your visit a random survey on how many young garais are actually met the the president himself you would find numbers and answer that you couldn't find in any other country worldwide uh our president desik Muhammad bin Zed I think he designed an engagement model between leadership and young people that doesn't exist anywhere uh he opens his place every week sometimes every Monday sometimes every Tuesday where anyone I could go and visit and discuss some of my aspirations or discuss some of the challenges I'm facing uh he is part of where are we hidden uh when I got married I got a letter from him uh on congratulations on your marriage and then he he also I have met him almost five times that's me I think there are hundreds of others and thousand people who met him maybe 10 times or 20 times uh but that built the TR trust so if you look at the formula on why the UA is successful in terms of Youth in terms of economy we have the vision we have a leadership that we trust and we trust because they represent who we are and when it comes to values but they also show performance performance that is exceptional I think uh if you look at the achievements and the deliverables and the policies signed uh during during uh crisis during hardest times it shows that this leadership not only care about this country but cares also about the generation would would come 10 20 30 years from now and part of it comes from the responsibility of representing the founding father's value uh uh I remember one of the occasions where the UA president had to meet one of the state leaders in one of the buildings and I was there at that building and I saw his agenda I know he had a long program then while he walked in in the building he actually spent time to have a direct interaction he came uh not only to say hi but to also ask about any challenges we face or ask about our dreams have that conversation I think what this leadership show in the United Arab Emirates it gives people the value the value they deserve uh I have been living in the United Arab Emirates I never ever saw any part of the ruling family cross a signal the street uh I saw them in our weddings I saw them in our with us in our hardest time I saw them actually leading projects and going into the field to see their projects and vision coming uh to life and I don't and you would see that and you would experience that during your visit because it's facts and Figures it's numbers it's achievements it's not an emotional op opinion but is a credible opinion do you feel like there's there I would say there's widespread demoralization among young people in the west and I think that's particularly true of young men and I think the reasons are basically threefold the first is is that we do a very bad job of managing the play preference and the activity preference of boys in our Early Education System and so our elementary schools are not welld designed for what boys need and then on the ideological front we insist at every possible turn that any manifestation of masculine ambition is part of the P system of patriarchal oppression that's uh what would you call wreak havoc in a demonic way since the beginning of time and so the boys learn to identify their ambition with with uh pathological power and then if they manage to escape those two things then the next thing they're told is that all human activity is nothing but destructive that we're taking the planet into an environmental apocalypse and that everything's going to collapse in any case and it's the fault of Human Action and the combination of those three things is uh you could add pornography into the mix just to mop up any boys that might have escaped from those three things and we've done a pretty spectacular job of demoralizing young people in the west and it's not pretty and so would you say that in the UAE that the young people that are part of your culture are looking to the future with hope I mean I know you're you're putting forward an optimistic vision and and it's a credible vision and it's credible because there are markers of its success right it's not just talk but you know at least to some degree what's happening in the West on the ideological front and the demoralization front do you think that you guys have been successful at providing a positive vision and motivating while young men in particular we talked about young women already you you've got the women's rights um approach fully active you said women are well integrated into your culture at every level are are your young people looking forward to the future with a certain degree of hope so Jordan I have studied with young people worked with young people and also been Ser uh offering public service to young people part of my mandate was to actually interact with young people on daily basis and what I saw is not just hope I actually saw a drive a drive to build something big to build the next big thing for this nation to actually turn another impossible into possible and we have many examples on uh stuff that happens in schools and universities uh 10 years ago if you ask a young man would you ever dream to go to the space or would you all what would be your dream I don't think the the answer about going or exploring a space with exist back then in their report uh it was something almost impossible it was something that's far away you don't see young Arabs actually exploring space for so for decades for 30 40 years now if you go to the schools in the United Arab Emirates and meet many young uh kids and young men many of them would say we want to be the next astronaut who goes and explore uh space because they have someone and they have a role model that exists today we took that box we made it possible we turned something impossible into possible we turned the whole dream into an actual visual story and we have many of these stories in the UI where actually men could see others do it and they feel that oh I can also do it I can also design my own startup I can also be part of this Mission I can also be part of this uh program actually if you look at the cabinet uh many members of the cabinets are young ministers they are under the age of 35 they are under the age of 30 uh they are ministers of economy Ministers of artificial intelligence minister of Youth affairs minister of Community Development and in a way showcase again hope in many different formats uh and that goes back to the whole region there were a survey called the arw survey now they did it almost 10 times every time they they questioned almost 3,000 young Arabs every time the UAE became the ideal location for them to actually follow their dreams and every time they saw the UA model as a model of Hope and a model of optimistic future and not only when it comes to views or how we see the future but actually how we design it and how we build it uh you go and walk in the United Arab Emirates you would find incubators everywhere for young entrepreneurs you would find youth hubs where actually either if you were an artist a musician uh a scholer a writer a researcher where you can have a whole path uh one thing that we did very well Jordan is basically we we taught people how to find their point B and then how to go and walk that way toward point B because not knowing the destination is scary and it it creates that Gap and hopeless yes exactly if you look at most of the challenges Arab youth face a big part of it because many of them are hopeless or many of them didn't find hope in a way uh almost 70% of PhD holders in the reward are living outside Theo and there where we have uh an an initiative called the greater of Minds uh an initiative that was launched last year the ultimate idea and purpose and objective of this initiative is actually to build role models in medicine in physics and chemistry in economy in Technology and Engineering and in design it's an award that's not only contributes with the financial rewards but actually it recognized different contribution it recognized uh the the gems we have in the aort uh for so long many of our scientists and Scholars uh were hidden gems in our society and sadly uh in our communities in in the Arab word if you look at the numbers many are leaving the boort and that's something uh I don't mind people chasing their future anywhere but then we should also understand that the Arab world needs them the most it needs more role models for the 108 million young Arabs in science and economy and design that's where the UA came up with this initiative uh which I'm currently busy with is actually not to explore who are our hidden gyms and turn them into visible gyms uh but also to recognize them to empower them to reward them sometimes all what they need is a pat on the back they want someone to tell them well done you have done it you are a role model for our kids uh and sometimes we do that late you have you have many names in that report like look at Z she was a designer she she built and designed buildings in many different places in the whole world I think today we value her and we we notice her value but then who is our current who is our current ibun of psychology who is our current and the in the wholeo and that's what we are trying to find and I think this is the ultimate message of Hope and confidence because part of what we do is we build confidence in people if the UA made it if someone made it to the space station if someone built a city in 50 years the most ideal and one of the world's best cities you can also do it so let's let's um let's turn for a moment to tell me a little bit about what problems you see besetting the UAE what what what are the major challenges that you guys are dealing with at the moment and maybe we can conclude after that with a description of where you'd like to things had over the next 10 years but let's start with challenges what are the major challenges that you face in the UAE I think we Face challenges that are similar challenges that many nations and generations are facing worldwide one thing is the impact of social media and the impact of uh bringing everything closer uh well that had a very uh positive uh impact on doing business on work on studying an education but also showed some threats that we some I see in many different areas worldwide people are losing their identity they are losing their hope or sometimes I don't know how can I define what we see in many different parts of the whole world so my ultimate goal always for that's I see it for myself and my family how to ensure that we we have that immunity and we have that guarding values to ensure that not only my generation can take the right decision but my daughter's generation could take again the right decision and her next Generation could be also take the right Generation Well the well well the problem the problem with that information influx as you said it's very very rich but it it's also sufficiently um overwhelming to be uh a dissolvent and a and an agent of chaos right I mean when you have access to everything it's hard to be something and it we don't know what this extension of our nervous system because that's definitely what the social media platforms are we don't know what that extension exactly is going to do for us and you know you made reference back to some of the earlier points you made in the discussion is that you guys are trying to identify your core values and to leave them in Bedrock position in your culture and you're hoping that that will enable your young people to turn to the benefits of our interconnectedness without falling prey to the possibility of chaos being induced you know it's very hard to set up a complex information system that's optimally what interconnected so the brain is set up so that it has areas that that only communicate locally and then those areas communicate distally like every neuron isn't connected to every other neuron you get nothing but chaos in that situation and so there has to be a balance between order and stability and and connectivity and we are all wrestling with that around the world right I mean these new technologies are absolutely amazing but they definitely do have the the possibility of spreading chaos at at the same rate they they they distribute benevolent information I think that again goes to the way we want this generation to raise and grow uh part of it we take full responsibility on uh I think we should take full accountability and responsibility on what are the values we want to embed in the community's DNA in our family's DNA and and how do we do that often in different doses we do it in school we do it at home we do it in University we do it in workplaces I'll give you an example uh I had a program called the national values program here at the United Arab Emirates and one one of the main products of that program was to actually measure values in the society and in the community so we used to do social experiments and then one of the social experiments I said okay let's let's take a permission where we have a car by the side of the street where uh someone who needs help with his mechanics of his car his car is not working it's at 2 p.m afternoon in the summer uh it's a time where maybe most people would be busy having lunch with their families and we said let's let's record that and see how many actually young imatis with come and provide help or Provide support Jordan in one hour the number of people who actually stopped and paused their journey to where wherever they were heading and paused by and parked beside that car to actually offer help it was more than 15 young people they decided to actually voluntarily uh something in them felt that oh I should offer help and that's something I see on daily basis uh I don't think you will see a single incident where we think twice before uh providing support or before uh providing help to people around and that's that value that's part of that tradition of hospitality yes that was part of our generation's hospitality and the way we have been raised but then My ultimate concern is always I have to be as good as my father and my grandfather and building that and my daughter and building that in the Next Generation to ensure that I embed the same values uh that grows in her the way I saw it happening in me and in many other people during one of my latest visits I was waiting for for a plane and watching the news on TV and there were an incident in one of the cities in the western world where someone was being killed in a Subway and people were filming that and people were standing still and filming that it's scary to me at that moment I felt where are we heading as human beings that's something I don't want to ever see not in 50 years but in 100 years in our country and I'm sure it won't happen because we are taking full responsibility and accountability on defining who we are uh because that have been happening since 1971 and it will keep happening till 2071 uh for the years ahead but then also that reminds me to a story we all know Cain and Abel uh I think uh yes Cain was angry he was jealous of his brother and he ended up killing him but then if you look at the word today I think can and it will exist almost in every single community and sometimes maybe some maybe some people would say they exist even in you uh but then you decide on who wins and you decide that you never allowed to cbel in your community or you cbel in yourself and that's something very very important to us because we know we know that sometimes in some communities and we saw it happening people lose it I think they lose the idea of being a human being the being part gets lost uh they they don't Define their values or they don't Define what's right and what's wrong uh I think that's something we do very well and my ultimate passion is to continue to do that I want to close this with an invitation to you um I've been working with a group of people uh centered in London but um with active participants all through Europe and Australia and Canada and the US um and then increasingly in other places in the world where we can manage the reach we have a conference coming up in London at the end of October October 31st 30th 31st and November 1st and followed by a public uh um event at the O2 um the group is the alliance for responsible citizenship and what we're trying to do is to formulate a positive story for the future a positive vision and uh I would like to extend an invitation to you and also uh uh what would you say a codicil on that invitation it would be delightful and helpful if you could help also help us identify key people that we might invite in the UAE and in your broader network of contacts to bring people there because we want to get everybody on board to the degree that that's possible and we are doing kind of what we discussed during this podcast you know we want to put together a vision of the future that isn't going to involve compulsion and force but that offers an active invitation to the kind of future that we might all want to have if we could pick the future we would actually want to have if we were being able and not cane let's say and so you know it sounds like our interests in that regard are very much aligned so and I'm also looking very much forward to coming to the UAE and to meeting you in person and to seeing what's going on in there and I would like to thank you um for talking to me and to everybody else here today to clue Us in about the positive developments um in the Middle East I mean we've in the west you know we've sat through Decades of stories of misery and Dread emanating from the Middle East and you know that's kind of part for the historical course in some ways and it's so bloody positive to see things switch around and to see peace break out and to see the possibility of real generous cooperation emerge and so you know congratulations on that front it's such a major accomplishment and hopefully that ethos can spread throughout the Arab world and and everywhere else wouldn't that be good uh Jordan will thank thank you for hosting me thank you for your invitation uh you're a psychologist and I think you know that feeling when you have a dinner with your wife and you eat something that tasty and delicious and you you go and tell her oh I think you should try this or you watched a movie that's uh somehow moved apart on you and then you said oh I think you should watch this movie is that feeling where you want the other side or the other part uh or the other community or friends or family to enjoy what you have enjoyed or to actually have something good or experience something good as you did it as a human being and I think that feeling you would see it in Mar UA Nationals we feel our leadership did and built something that works and something that shows results something that built hope something that made me feel um Unstoppable when it comes to serving when it comes to building something better uh and I wish I see that in more communities I wish I see that in many different areas because I have tasted it I have lived it I have experienced it and that that's my ultimate purpose in life to actually help others see the good we so and or experience because part of being who we are or part of defining uh your purpose is seeing the good in others and having a good impact in on others as well well Amen to that brother so well I'll see you in the UAE in not so many months and I'm looking forward to collaborating with you on that front and to having you in London and uh for everyone

conversation I think I see your Clips more often in the feed of our young people uh I see my nephews watching some of your Clips because actually your content when it comes to setting goals sitting Vision uh character building or exploring character and a lot of the values you are speaking about it's somehow the same language we understand yeah and we see uh I'm not sure how much you dig deep into the culture of the Middle East the W and the Islamic W but I could say the the the areas where we could see alignment Agreements are huge and that repres presentent who we are I think it does the the news you hear about this region and the conflicts and the people of this region I think we we again we didn't do enough when authoring our own story many people spoke about who we are but I think we know better who we are and we should send that narrative to the whole world great well you know all of that uh shared Foundation means that in principle we have something to build solid to build on in the future and so you know hoay for that all right good to talk to you sir bye-bye [Music] everybody
