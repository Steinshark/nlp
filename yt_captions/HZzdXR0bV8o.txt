well welcome we are in uh the world's first national video my game is ian i'm the director i'm another one of the folks at work here uh and this is what you see when you come in the first thing is is a massive uh blue blue hedgehog this wall over here will tell you all the games that are in here that changes all the times there's tons to play but it's all about playing is it's almost about making games so the big thing about this place is um we think everybody should be able to play games but also we really like people learning how to make them too you see these fantastic people at this desk they'll say hello to you just like this goodbye so he's actually like that there are arcade machines to play there are old things to do too and then another kind of peculiar thing about the building is there's lots of stuff that's only here so a lot of games that we've commissioned that you can only actually play in this building the first one you'll see is this one which is called dash and bash this is only in the national video arcade it's made by an artist called aleister hsn it's a fantastic game that allows you to kind of spot these symbols and you have to bash other people by the way and bash the bash the buttons to get to the right one before anybody else does so like we really wanted to like kind of right away show people that games aren't necessarily just about kind of standing like this they can be about bashing things too and that's really what we wanted to try and do with this a lot of people do this is kind of warm up you might want to come through here into the toaster bar now it's not just a clever name the toast bar is called the chest behind the step uh because it will it has a variety of toasts that it will indeed venue and lots again of games for you to play tends to be the older stuff in his mother playing nintendo 64. you can request a different game from the bar if you want to in the summer because it's nice in the summer right stay outside and play a game so i need some toast trying to welcome you as much as we as much as we possibly can so come in and out here this is mission control this is a game about making games so the idea here is the two-player game and whilst two people play it other people can be changing it so you can kind of change the graphics you can change the gravity you can change the spawn rate of aliens kind of really gently get people into this idea that they can change and what games are and really see what games are made of the weird thing about games is you don't often get you often get kind of look inside the kitchen of what they are like other things that are just here this is room racers this is a fantastic game my eleven for this is like micro machines but the magical part of it is i'll just start this up for you by the red car here racing around but this is the cool part anything that we put down the car crashes into so you end up with like a couple of different games happening one of them is like a racing game and a lot of people lying on here to be kind of raced around so anything that we put there a car can't pass through so it's kind of about two things it's about playing games and racing cars but it's also about what makes a good race track right this is that kind of big main stairwell that goes up and down most of the buildings and when you design a museum like often what people do is try and hide um the computers and hide the way that it works and we kind of went the opposite way we wanted to just expose everything so even if even if you don't really know about electronics like you can see that all of the orange stuff is power right all the purple's network so similarly all the exhibits that we built here if they break and they do break sometimes um we just fix them in front of you because you can because you can do that we're trying to capture the um i suppose the sort of spirit of like when i was a kid if the video recorder broke we'd have the back of it in the kitchen table yeah you know you can put it back together again but you have to go at fixing it it's that kind of idea of like being able to open stuff up and sort of kind of x-ray it and really kind of get involved is what we're trying to do um so the whole building we wanted to make kind of transparent so gallery 2 is the hall of inputs arranging from like really like the kind of controllers that you might be used to having at home a game of trials with a with a quite complicated but nonetheless you might recognize xbox controller two arcade machines so joysticks and buttons you'll be familiar with what they are to mouse and keyboard games so indiana jones the fate of atlantis fantastic adventure game to text adventures with twine to light gun games the time crisis and duck hunt cockpit games of driving games like the star wars or sonic races to the music rooms this kind of rock band guitar heroes can get quite out of hand to get quite loud in this room from time to time and this is one of my favorite bits so this is um this is the kind of wall of inputs these four games always look quite different uh control mechanisms um so we've got um version of a game called tempest here which is using a spinner which you spin around to shoot the aliens yeah so a single button game oh i'm not really good at it though terrible at this game uh and a trackball game so miss our command so some of you may remember this so you're moving the uh crosshair around with a trackball so they're all played in quite different ways and what we're trying to do is like in a really gentle way here just get people to think about uh the fact that not all games are controlled with a the kind of controller that you might have at home there's loads and loads of different interfaces of the game so by kind of gently so we change these around quite often we change the games around and change controllers around um to just kind of gently draw attention to the fact that like the assumptions that you might have about video games might not necessarily be true a lot of people either play with a keeper on a mouse or they play with you know play with a play with a game path and there's so many different things that games are so we have kind of smaller installations on these rooms so these change around every few months we'll put a different kind of more experiential game in there right now it's panoramical which is kind of generative music game it's like the late 60s on the wall and then we move up to gallery three so this is our most kind of gallery-like gallery i guess the problem with exhibiting video games they're probably talking to people about video games is that quite often um like they rely on you as a customer being good at video games so if i want to talk to you about uh sonic the hedgehog right and show you what some of the hedgehog is i could hand you a controller and you know let you play something hedgehog and hope that you are good at signing the hedgehog because if you're not you won't be able to see those bits so what we're trying to do with these little game inspectors um is experiment with giving people snapshots of specific ideas within games to experience so this is gang beasts if you haven't played gang beasts you must immediately get dang beasts has been made in sheffield it's a kind of drunk jelly babies fighting in a car park physics brawler game a company called boneloaf like i was a boneloaf made for us a game inspector so this is a demo showing you play the game over there and over here you can play around with seeing how the physics work so you can see as he turns red at the collision points and you can also see how the animation armature is working so you can see actually what this person do is rolling around on a ball but when animated you get a much better sense of the movement so this is a look like inside a game that you'll play over there that you would just never normally see one of the things i always liked about like exhibits or classical things it's actually the sketchbooks rather than the finishing you know they're kind of working it out and how big their head is so in here um we invite any developer to show work um that's not finished yet right so people get to place it before it's done they leave them suggestions in the in the feeder developers box so people get to see games before they're done and feedback and then just be able to say things like it shouldn't be faster or slower it's too hard or the colors aren't right and it's a it's like it's a look inside games that most of the public never really gets most of them you encounter a game it's like shrink wrapped and it's finished it's beautiful um just exposing again this fact that there are things that are made it's really really important this is the greenhouse and then our most kind of gallery-like gallery this is a history of video games in a hundred at least objects roughly 100 objects and it's like a loosely chronological journey around starting here so whenever people come in they will gravitate towards the area they recognize this will be my childhood um right here and again these are all machines that people can play um we have a bit of a bit of basic on the window if people want to have a go at programming at bbc i'm always really like delighted and surprised with the amount of time that people spend in here i think like people of a certain age um like me we spend quite a lot of time along this wall we've been trying to show this sort of social history of games too so things like this may mean not much to some of you but things like pirate cassettes from the 80s with kind of hand drawn schoolboy artwork things like maps from video games things that kind of spin off board games and keyboard overlays and kind of i guess the sort of ephemera of what games are and what games meant to people is really what this um this room is trying to capture so it's not just about um again you know kind of kind of playing things but also things like the lara's aid donated by no less in livingston doom 2 master like a couple of weeks ago john romero turned up here so john romero was was the co-designer of doom like the seminal first person shooter and this is one of the gold masters of doom 2. like incredibly influential designer um yeah just right rocked up about the first thing i know i was at home first thing we heard about was somebody like saying we have this thing called slack that we use internal messages oh i got john romero's in the building and everyone like went nuts he did a little talk here for some of the some of the dads to recognize who was it's quite for a special moment people tend to spend you know kind of kind of like most of the day here when they come and that combined with things like the classes if you've got kids you're going to want to learn how to code they come from the saturday mornings the pixelated clubs during the week and lots and lots of events that happen in the evenings for every group um we're trying to be uh i guess a sort of community center really for people are interested in this kind of stuff you know if you're interested in football you can join a football club you can do music you can join orchestra some games which is technology culture like come here and help us help us make it better so that's the national video game arcade we'd like to
