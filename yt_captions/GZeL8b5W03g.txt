ladies and gentlemen good morning from New York City the World Chess Championship 2023 begins right now contested by yanyuponushi from Russia and ding Loren from China as Magnus Carlson has declined to participate in this edition of the event the World Chess Championship is a best of 14 format it is a two hour for the first 40 move format after move 40 they get an additional hour it's a seven hour game potentially today's wasn't and it will Crown the champion of the world I'm about to show you what happened in game number one welcome back to my channel if you've been here before hi hello uh if you are new before we jump into the game today give me a minute of your time I know you're supposed to skip the sponsored segment but this is not a sponsored segment I'd like to tell you about something a lot of you know I have chess courses okay but we have just created a brand new way to train chess a brand new way let me show you what I mean um first of all I have obviously chess courses and during the World Chess Championship they will be 50 off so that's number one number two we also have chestly plus and in particular what we will launch with Chastity plus which is like a patreon Edition we will be going in depth in all of these world championship games that's great that's wonderful a lot of you can be we're going to give you tactics and strategic quizzes from all of these games in much greater detail than these Recaps but my team and I created a game called anti-puzzle in anti-puzzle we will be training you to find or not find puzzles because when you train tactics 100 of the positions have a solution and in this game we will be training you on what positions do and don't have an actual tactic in them much more practical application we also have a game called Poison Pawn and we have a game called defense we launched three new training games you don't even need to pay a cent there's a link in the description you can try out our free samples and all courses are 50 off for the next few days including chestly Plus folks that's I just want to tell you all right it's time for game number one let's finish this game those of you that want to get a greater detailed analysis you can check out chestly plus it's a really really great feature and these training games are going to be incredible really I mean it alright folks begins with E4 we have Clocks by the way E5 played by ziggly run Knight F3 Knight C6 and Bishop B5 okay number one the Spanish is the opening of choice for game one and both players have very interesting repertoires ding Lee Ren likes to play a Spanish with A6 and Knight F6 already he is not playing the Berlin defense the Berlin defense could appear in this match the Berlin defense is kind of known as the Spanish killer and recently rather than allowing black to capture the opponent E4 which in many cases leads to very forcing lines where black is completely fine um a lot of players are playing ANSI Berlin uh chances that we see an ANC Berlin in this match pretty high I would say but we will see but ding plays A6 Bishop to A4 and the idea of the Spanish of course to put pressure on this and this now we have Knight F6 castles Bishop E7 and normally what happens in this position uh is white plays something like rookie one defending the pawn and black oftentimes will Castle I'm playing you know B5 Castle something like this white will play C3 to try to play D4 and black will play D5 this is known as the Marshall Gambit this is exactly why dingly Ren does not touch his deepon well folks it did not take very long because after just five moves Uncorked a massive surprise this position has been reached hundreds of thousands of times and in this position after already retreating his Bishop Jan took the Knight took the night we are now down to a territory played less than five percent of the time from this position 90 plus percent of games go rookie one sometimes they go D3 now we are down to around four and a half percent of Master Level games remaining we are deep into the woods we have gone deep into the forest the point is that you've just given up a bishop now white can take this Pawn it's not the best move to take this Pawn because it's the only piece you have out and black will very quickly get this the idea is to well what is the idea Jan then plays another really rare move you see in this position Grandmasters have played the move D3 before and then have developed naturally and basically said look yes I gave you a light Square Bishop but your Pawn structure is a bit damaged over here and for the beginners watching you really shouldn't give up a bishop for a night this easily you really just shouldn't it breaks a lot of principles another move in the database that's been played here is Queen E1 this is an absolutely fascinating move it's used to be popular back in the day uh to defend like this and then play for D4 and B3 and Bishop B2 so I was very fascinated with Queen E1 I mean to me it looks interesting the point is you unpin yourself you don't want to be pinned and now Knight E5 but we have rookie one okay and ding plays Knight D7 voluntarily on developing so that he guards the center pawn another idea here is for black to do this and after H3 Bishop H5 there is G4 trying to kick you out black can sack the Knight now I'm sure that dings saw this possibility it doesn't win the game the point is though if your opponent is playing a surprise you don't play into the most cutting-edge surprise right so if your opponent is doing something super aggro and like they know everything and you're like oh my God I haven't looked at this in forever you're not gonna play like this so ding plays Knight D7 and now Jan plays D4 so essentially Yan has traded a bishop for a knight to damage ding's Pawn structure and also make ding play a bit passively you'll notice that his pieces are kind of stuck in front of the king and the queen we have ed4 Queen D4 and now ding castles is king So that this is defended Bishop F4 a very active aggressive position Giannis two moves away from essentially assembling the five pieces of Exodia uh and getting a very very very promising position here to start now uh ding plays Knight C5 did I say ding or young was very close uh you'll also get very promising positions if you check out chestly plus training games um now Queen to E3 and ladies and gentlemen it took no later than move 11 of game number one for us to have our first inaccurate move of the world championship and Yani bomnishi has an advantage daily Wren was trying to finish his development you will notice his Knight has made one two three moves already and ironically the best move is actually to move it a fourth time and block the bishop that's what the computer wanted it wanted you to kick the bishop out and then play like A5 which you know and then maybe try to get the bishop out this way maybe play F6 to prevent the knight from coming in ding is a human though and develops this here's the problem Knight D4 Yan is better not only is yawn better Yan has a 20 minute time Advantage this is bad dingly Ren is starting off real bad Jana's gonna go H3 Knight C3 and Rook D1 so ding plays Queen D7 essentially the thing about his pieces is ding has no Pawn presence so he doesn't occupy any meaningful space and his pieces are sort of standing around but without tangible targets so Knight C3 rook d8 and now the critical moment of the opening stage as yanya bonusi can play the move H3 attacking this bishop this bishop is uh not very easy to defend why because if you try to step out of the way I'm going Knight F5 and I'm I'm pressuring and I'm going G4 and queen G3 and Rook D1 in the future this Knight is a beast and white gets a very very powerful initiative on this side of the board look at how the black pieces are squished okay white has a massive massive edge here if you play H3 however if you play H3 black is the ridiculous move rookie eight and the point is that if you take the bishop I'm gonna take this and you might say Levy wait a minute wasn't that hanging the whole time I wasn't paying attention I just like the sound of your voice and I would say thank you very much yes if Queen takes D4 what's funny is there is 95 disconnecting the queen from The Rook so that if you take the queen I take with check King h8 and at the end of it two pieces hang so you're just losing it's completely lost so H3 Queen D4 there is Knight D5 but rookie 8 defends the bishop so that now there is no Knight D5 since that is protected very very cutting-edge stuff here right you bored yet don't look at anything this is the World Championship where are you going all right 9f5 was played immediately though Jan had to play H3 here move 14 and the game could have gotten very sharp and very complicated instead he goes Knight F5 and he grabs the bishop on E7 and comes back and starts building up this light squared Pawn wall and basically says look this bishop is bad and I have long-term pressure over here yes the way that this that this game was played it's completely advantaged to uh to Yan but notice the time is like back to even right here's the thing though Jan has four healthy pawns versus three this is barely four on three for black and these pawns are sitting ducks so ding is gonna have to defend this position both sides make a couple of improving moves ding comes back with the bishop and now White Once Again has an opportunity to advance forward how are you gonna do that how are you gonna Advance forward from this position A3 maybe to stop Queen B4 maybe F4 F5 H4 to try to attack Yan plays Rook D1 and in this position the computer for some reason really wanted ding to do this and make white play B3 it really thought that this was the way to go and it would be very difficult for white to make any forward progress um ding played B6 so now A3 to stop that is good and now A5 to stop B4 is good and now F4 is a very nice idea for white white can play F4 here with the intention to yes of course play F5 uh and frankly I I don't exactly know what what Jan didn't like about this I mean I because you're gonna get the pawn to F5 for sure maybe he didn't like the hole on E5 for instance Rook D1 Rook D1 maybe black can try to trade uh Rooks or something but there was a very nice idea here to try to play a four or five and let's keep in mind if the bishop gets in it's over black will lose all his pawns so Jana is the one calling the shots 100 okay because Jan is a chestly plus subscriber and has played anti-puzzle defense and poison pawn and you should too Knight to E2 though is what he chooses we have a rook trade and now Rook D3 now he is still up 14 minutes on the clock dingley run has 37 minutes remaining to make 17 moves or he will lose on time he has to make 17 moves in 37 minutes that is not a lot of time all right he plays C5 and C6 and all of a sudden Jan has a plus one advantage this is very bad dingly Wren is suddenly down 31 minutes on the clock he now has 18 minutes to make 15 moves and he is losing he's losing this game by virtue of the infiltration that is coming she trades the Rooks dingly Wren cannot trade like this because if he does in comes the bishop and the pawns will fall and you could temporarily save yourself but unfortunately I will eat everything and then I will win so it's looking really bad after C6 as ding is down nearly half an hour and he's got to make 14 more moves and he's looking like his Queen side is about to fall apart yeah is about to strike and take a one to nothing lead in the world championship 2023 he infiltrates with his Queen the queen has arrived on the back rank the biggest advantage of the game ding 13 minutes to make 13 moves or he's gonna lose game one he plays King H7 sidestepping off the back Rank and now a big question do you play Queen C7 here trading the Queen's immobilizing the knight in the corner or will black sacrifice the pawn why would black sacrifice the pawn well in a lot of end games folks opposite colored Bishops are a draw even if a side is up a pawn sometimes but sometimes if a size is up two pawns it's still a draw because opposite colored Bishop end games have such a high drawing tendency so Bishop D6 is what Yan chose he chose not to play Queen C seven and all for the trade the best move might have been this to sneak in and grab the A5 Pawn Jan might have not liked this because his Bishop is on the edge of the board so instead of doing it that way instead of doing the queen trade he plays Bishop D6 and now ding ice in his veins 12 minutes to make 12 moves Queen D7 the only move if you take on C5 now I infiltrate and I got news for you I'm pissed all right the queen is mad that the black pieces have been bullied around and if you try to defend yourself Knight E6 remember what I told you folks opposite colored Bishop end game and the pawns and the King right so Queen D7 and suddenly young goes damn I hit a brick wall what do I do let me bring my knight notice seven minutes spent on that move 96 now Jan in this position can play C3 that stops the knight from ever coming into D4 but instead of that Jan plays F4 an aggressive move allowing the infiltration of the Knight because if you take take maybe the Knight is stuck now the computer as you can see thinks it's a draw the computer is unimpressed and it doesn't think this is scary but Knight F5 Queen f8 all of these moves could lead to a Checkmate so for that reason after the move F4 my man dingley Ren with 11 minutes on the clock to make his remaining 10 moves there is no bonus time yet if ding's clock runs out he will lose this game this is the most important match the most important game of his life dingley Ren with janipomishi walking him down Strikes Back like yesterday's addisonia knockout of Pereira H5 the pawn in front of the king being mobilized to dislodge the White Knight on G3 he says you want to come get me with that five I'll dance into the middle and I'll boot you and you can't go there anymore now I got news for you I'm also fighting on the light squares in the future Yan thinking C3 the time Gap now down to 10 minutes per player and now see for and inaccuracy a slight inaccuracy in Low Time by dingly Ren he probably should have continued with his plan but he plays C4 so now the Knight can always Gallop into D3 from a different direction Jan here clutch finds the best move H4 now ding will not be able to play H4 F5 is coming this and this is impossible Yan is a move away from getting an irreversibly better position and winning game number one and dingley ren with the clock ticking six minutes finds Queen to d8 cold-blooded defensive chess from dingly Ren found in 10 seconds volunteering a voluntarily entering an end game where he has certain uh problems but after Bishop C7 96 hits this and this and if you get greedy I take on F4 and black is the one that's actually playing for a win Queen d8 a smart move but Jan Queen B7 super tricky he could have maybe taken on d8 he could have maybe done this and restricted the black pieces the computer seemed to like this but it also might think that this is drawable instead of that Jan plays Queen B7 hitting the bishop now if you take this and this looks like I'm getting in right but who said I have to take who said I have to take the bishop dingley ran once again the best defensive move Bishop E8 the bishop guards this pawn and this Pawn the two massive weaknesses of the black position the pieces are stuck on the back rank he infiltrates again with the Knight but ding meets him at the top Queen to D7 Queen to B8 let's trade let's trade he got nothing else ding creates an impenetrable Fortress of pieces and pawns and yawn runs into a brick wall there is nothing that you can do anymore he did his best but now the Queens are off and if you play Bishop C7 I already showed you I have 96 I can also go Knight B7 so we have Knight D4 and E5 and the players have made the 40th move look at this an hour gets added to his clock on move 40. he had 27 seconds on the clock this man dingley Ren going back to move 30 was in an uncomfortable probably borderline losing position but one inaccuracy from Yan Bishop D6 Queen D7 and suddenly here came ding with his H Pawn with his C pawn and the bishop on E8 the rubber band holding everything together Queens are off and I got news for you folks this position is not losable because Black's King gets to F7 the clutch Pawn on H5 preventing any infiltration we have Knight to D3 E6 take take but black is in time to take on B2 Five Pawns each Knight and Bishop each and on move 49 yanyupomnishi offered a draw as no further progress can be made why do I say that well if white tries to play Knight C2 and King D4 Knight C1 the king tries to walk over here I got 92 check at a very minimum so King E3 draw a fascinating battle I gotta tell you a very interesting thing first of all a super super massive surprise in the opening massive surprise I have no idea what else awaits Us in the Spanish ANSI Berlin's Mainline surprises Bishop C6 has not been played in the last two decades at all much I mean there's a few games in fact the nichigiri ones played I think Bishop takes C6 but it's very very rare then nepo building up a fantastic opening position missing a critical opportunity but building up to a spot where he was up 30 minutes and a much better position after Queen F4 it looked like ding was on the ropes and ding machine-like cold calm H5 are you kidding me with seven minutes on the clock to make the remaining nine moves ridiculous we got everything we wanted and more an opening surprise young starting strong Young making a tiny inaccuracy and dingly ren clutches ever ice in his veins defensively up to the task holds the fort game one is drawn half half you know what dingly Ren actually benefited from my my friends before you go we the recap is finished but he uh benefited tremendously uh from playing the defense game on chestly plus it's a game where you have to Hold Your Position you know you have to anticipate your opponent's threats and stop them anyway that concludes game number one um I will be here every single day covering all the games for you all the courses are 50 off uh for the next four or five days as we launch the world championship and um definitely check out the free samples of all those games uh we're constantly improving them uh it's been a long time coming I'm really excited about anti-puzzle it's going to be a much more practical way to do puzzles how many of you write in the comments how many of you are a thousand points higher rated on puzzles than in Rapid chess all right seriously we there's a much better more practical way of learning in my opinion um that's all for today I hope you enjoyed the recap I'm very excited for the match and I will cover all the drama for you now get out of here
