[Music] Welcome to My Day in the Life as a software engineer I wake up at 8:57 a.m. roll out of bed to my remote morning standup where we talk about the fascinating coding problems we're about to solve that day with my super interesting colleagues after it I check out my bank to see that my first paycheck has come in oh man it's good to be a software engineer then for the rest of the day I go back to bed and start coding at the pace of one word per minute software engineering truly is the best job in the world yeah that's not really what it's actually like to be a software engineer and there are many harsh downsides to being a professional coder that almost no one ever tells you and all of these reasons actually let me a freaking coding YouTuber to leave my job as a software engineer and to instead build my own projects and I'll tell you exactly what the reasons for that were and you might not have considered them before but first just for some context I wanted to lay out the top three reasons why I wanted to become a software engineer myself that I saw as massive benefits of this industry and for each of them I will show you the actual reality of whether that reason is actually true or not and be warned because you will find that the truth about all these three things is a lot more nuanced than the tech industry likes to make you believe so the first one is the juicy one money 150k salar straight out of college well it's possible but let me give you the Nuance that you need to be aware of so here is a report that shows the different salaries based on your region in the world and in this case based on your region within the us because apparently according to these reports the US is the only place that exists but don't worry we'll get into different parts of the world in a second so what you can see here is the average salaries highly depend on the area where you're working which makes sense because cost of living vares highly by the area you're working but the thing to understand is that the highest salaries like 150 K like straight out of college these are only really possible at the very very highest cost of living places like San Francisco or New York so I was doing some calculations on this for a tweet I was making follow me on Twitter by the way thank you very much here is the harsh reality of these top salaries in San Francisco with a gross salary of 150,000 straight away 48,000 of that goes to taxes then around 39,000 goes to rent assuming you're renting the average one-bedroom apartment 8 ,000 goes to food assuming you're eating out twice per day and then based on just some average data and some assumptions you might spend an extra $ 27,000 on other stuff which leaves you with net Savings of $16 16,826 K salary and so for this tweet I also calculated the scenario where you have that same grow salary except you live where I am in Dubai where you pay zero taxes and much less cost of living but let's put a pin on that because I also have some things to say about that in a second and now let's not even talk about going to Europe like London where I used to be but basically if I only had my salary which fortunately enough for me was not my only income Source because I also had this YouTube channel that salary would barely have been able to enough to even get me by in London so yes a software engineer will make an above average income in almost any city in the world but thinking that it will make you rich fast because of these high seeming gross salary numbers is absolute nonsense to become rich and to do it quickly you will have to see how you could use your coding skills to make more money as a self-employed person instead or perhaps in freelancing or something like that I talk about more ways to make money with coding in that video which I will leave down below next is another classic one that I definitely fail for Freedom now I will say that as a software engineer you do have a lot more freedom compared to the other corporate jobs that I'm personally comparing it to because these are the jobs that I did before like Consulting and and banking I usually only had one meeting which was my morning standup at the start of the day and also pretty quickly I was also allowed to work from home but the biggest deal for me comparing to my consulting job was that the hours I was working was so much better every day it was from 9 till 5: and not really any more than that that is unless you have a deadline tomorrow and your code still won't compile so at least normally like 9 days out of 10 I had the time after my work to work on my side hustles or perhaps if you're a family person you would have the time to spend with your family while still getting paid really really well and that is definitely a massive Pro of being a software engineer so is true that in some sense working as a software engineer is very chilled out and it does give you a lot of freedom of flexibility but that is only when you compare it to the worst of the absolute worst which is other corporate jobs and make no mistake as a software engineer for a big company you are still a slave to your boss you still have one employeer that controls all of your income and if they decide to fire you like a lot of companies have by the way you are out of luck now you need to scramble and find something else very quickly so that is why I always recommend to all software Engineers to start side projects perhaps do some freelancing on the side code an app of your own not only will this make you a much better software engineer but it will give you these extra income sources and it is these extra income sources and not being dependent on one source of income that really in my opinion gives freedom in the this world because you never know what's going to happen and on the topic of working remotely most likely at the very first job that you work you're not going to be allowed to go and work from Thailand for example at my job I was lucky because very quickly I was allowed to work from home fully every single day if I wanted to but not at the very start I sort of had to earn that trust but also I still had the Restriction that I had to work from the UK which is where my job was paced these kinds of remote jobs where you're literally allowed to work from anywhere globally and really optimize for taxes and things like this are are something that you're going to have to work towards although again software engineering is perhaps the best field in the world to work towards this kind of Lifestyle if that is what you are looking for but don't expect it right from the start now to take us to the third reason which is also the biggest sort of unexpected thing that I really did not expect about software engineering I need to tell you a story so I had this colleague at my first job let's call her Sarah she was really awesome by the way she had basically done exactly what I had done which is to learn to code herself and then like just transition into technology within the company which is a really awesome thing that this company offered and so what she told me was that she was very excited about coding and learning it like I was but there were two reasons why she disliked being a developer the first of which was that she was a really social person one thing to keep in mind is that it just so happens that developers are often the most boring people on the planet like I'm not saying they're like boring people necessarily it's just like the culture of being in develop veler like a technical person at these big companies doesn't really lend itself to being social so let me just paint this picture for you remember the morning standup that I just mentioned that was like the only meeting of the day and how great it was that is the only meeting of the day well even in that one meeting just imagine that there's 20 people there and literally two of those people turn on their camera so like literally some of the people I worked with for months and months I still to this day do not know what they actually look like I don't know what they look like because they never turned on their camera in their meetings like how am I supposed to like have a human kind of relationship with people anyway the second is that while coding like learning coding is super exciting and super interesting that is very different from doing it at your actual job now the third reason why I wanted to become a software engineer was that I wanted interesting work I wanted work that stimulates my mind that where I get to solve interesting problems yes I do still think that software engineering compared to many other jobs compared to many corporate jobs is still in the big picture very interesting I love the act of coding it gives me a lot of fulfillment and it's certainly more interesting than making PowerPoint slides for some insurance company or something like that but I do have to admit that I mistook the excitement I had for coding my own projects for the excitement that I would have to code for the project that my company happened to be working on I had to break your bubble but espe is a junior developer for a big company there practical things you'll probably be doing are something like copy pasting some config files or like moving some button around some front end or something like that yes that is literally what my first weeks at my software engineer jobs consisted of so interesting work well no but it's but it's possible if you prefer excitement and more fulfilling work you might want to work for a startup like I've founded my own startup now and I can tell you that the work in the startup is so much more interesting because you actually have a lot of responsibility and you're building something new and just the environment is a lot more exciting or if you're looking for more freedom then perhaps something like becoming a freelancer could be the right option because it's more likely that you'll be able to work remotely and have a lot more flexibility around your clients and things like this but then again those options as well will have their downsides so what's the conclusion that you should not learn to code and not become a software engineer well maybe and maybe not the real message of this video is not that you should or that you shouldn't become a software engineer is that you should see every career for what it is every single career has its pros and its cons what you need to do is look at the pros of every career then look at the cons of every career and then look at what are the things that are actually important to you and what are the downsides of the cors that you're most willing to endure I heard this quote I believe is from Mark Manson and it is is the thing that you should do is the thing that feels like work for others but like play to you and just remember life is too short to do something that you don't want to do and just because you're doing something that's okay is not a good enough reason to try to not go for something better
