so a little while ago i built my first ever website and i did it in the way that most people think most websites are built by coding the entire thing from scratch and while it was a great learning experience it was also pretty daunting and took me like two to three weeks to finish the whole thing i call it myself a whole back end and pretty much every little feature i was adding to the website i had to figure out how to do it from completely scratched and when it now came to the point where i wanted to completely revamp my website because it wasn't that good and i now have a completely different idea for what i want to do with the website the idea of doing everything all over again from scratch that way was pretty demoralizing but it actually turns out that there is a much better way to build a website in 2022 than coding the thing from scratch and that's what i want to show you in this video and i'm also going to show you my process of how i ended up taking my website from looking something pretty basic like this into this it is literally one day of work but first let's talk about why you might want to have a website let's say you're clicking on this video but you don't really know if you even need a website in this day and age just having a presence online can be really valuable there's any ideas you have anything that you want to share you might as well just have a blog where you share it or for example if you want to sell something you might want to have an ecommerce site or as programmers as designers when you have monetizable skills it's extremely useful to have a portfolio to showcase these skills if you've ever coded anything you pretty much want to have a portfolio to be able to showcase it to potential employers and to anyone really in the world who might be interested but when it comes to building a website for a lot of people the idea of building a whole portfolio website is pretty daunting because it's actually a pretty involved process to do all of it from scratch coding a whole backend figuring out how to connect it to a front-end and all of that it's a great learning experience and if you want to be a web developer you want to know how to do that but if you're just building like a simple portfolio website or a blog website or something like that you really don't need any of the customizable features that coding from scratch would give you so it's much better to use something like wordpress which one i'm going to be using in this video using a platform like wordpress as essentially a drag and drop builder probably allows you to make a website that's a lot nicer a lot lot faster so that's why even if you want to be a programmer for your personal website this kind of workflow that i'm going to show in this video is probably a lot better for you so if you want to build a website what do you actually need so first of all obviously you need the actual design the actual files that hold your code for the website second thing you need is hosting essentially if someone wants to access your website the files that hold your website need to be served from a service essentially from another computer who holds those files into the browser of the person who's viewing your website and technically you could use your own computer as a server but it would need to be online all the time basically you don't want to try to go through the process of like configuring a server for yourself so pretty much whichever method of actually building the website you use you're going to need to have a hosting service to host that website and the last thing you need is a domain so that's essentially just the web address that you write on your browser for example google.com that's the domain for the google website and the first part the actual building of the website is completely free but two parts that do cost a bit of money is hosting and your domain but as you'll see using the service that i use is extremely extremely cheap so the way we're going to be using this is using today's video sponsor hostinger osinger is essentially a website hosting service but they actually offer a lot more than just hosting and it's actually perfect for the workflow that i'm about to show you because it's designed to integrate perfectly with wordpress which is going to be the system that you use to build your website and actually if you choose their premium plan you're also going to get a free domain as a part of your registration so essentially all those three parts that you described of building a website you can do by hosting it so that's why it's just a great service to use for building your website and if you don't like it they also offer a money 30-day guarantee so you really can't lose so this is what we're going to be using for this website we're going to be building so to get started you want to head out to hostinger.com so they have a lot of different options so let's just go to pricing to see what's out there and you can see that they have a lot of different options but basically for just your basic website or like a personal website like a blog or whatever you're building you're pretty much going to be fine just using well they're shared the web hosting plans which are the cheapest options that they have because the cheapest one starts at as little as 1.99 a month um what i would go for is either the single or the premium one if you know that you're only gonna be needing one website then the single one is fine if you think that you're gonna be needing more websites then the premium one for only one dollar more per month is probably what you want to choose this is personally the plan that i have and the other thing to consider is that the premium one is also going to give you a free domain and the domain usually would cost something like 10 to 15 a year so that's a year another month so it's extremely cheap regardless but if you go for the premium one you get one for free so you don't need to worry about it and to actually save even more money on this what you're gonna want to do is apply my coupon code internet made coders you're gonna go here and i'm just to piece it right here and look at that we've saved even more money i know you like saving money you're welcome once you complete your registration you're going to enter into this kind of page next we're just going to go to setup and it's basically going to ask you a couple of questions so i'm going to be building this for myself we're gonna go for wordpress because that is what we're gonna be using to build this website even if you're not using wordpress and you wanna code it from trust using html css and javascript at this point you would just choose other and it will give you an option to upload your files which would then basically be your website but we're going to choose wordpress i think it's the best workflow so in here you can start off with a template to essentially get you started so you don't have to do everything from zero but you can choose these latest or what you choose here it doesn't really matter that much and this is where you could choose your domain if you chose the premium plan which gives you a free domain you click here to select your free domain i actually already have a domain which is with my current website so i'm going to use the internetmadecoder.com domain for my website and then it's just going to initialize it and you can start building so i'm going to see you in a couple of moments so once you've done that and you click on the website you're going to see this page and then you're going to want to click on edit website to actually start building your website so this is the wordpress dashboard i'm still not even familiar with all these options myself but basically you don't need to worry about a lot of them all you really need to do to get started is choose your theme to get started and this one specific plugin that i know is going to help me on your law which is called elementor essentially elementor is a way to create a much nicer interface for you to start designing your website so all you're going to do is go to plugins and look for elementor and we're just going to install that then you're going to go the themes basically there's a lot of free themes that you're available great place to find themes as well is using this place called start the themes i actually had a link for this on the home page and if you're using elementor like i am you just want to click up here to check elementor to make sure that the theme that you choose is going to be compatible with elementor i'm going to go to personal websites this one looks nice alex james this is for someone who's a web designer but i think i could i think i really like this design so we might just go with that one and then you can just go into elementor and start editing a lot of these fields like the color schemes and the images and the text just so much easier to do it with something like this rather than having to figure out everything with css and all of that and sure if you like using css if you're really pro with css you might be able to do all of this by yourself but at least for me using css is like my least favorite part of developing a website i just i just hate using css so having something like this is so much easier so we're gonna see what i can build and then i'm gonna check back with you in a few moments for a status update [Music] okay so i've spent some time trying to figure out what i'm doing here and i think i've now got a pretty good idea of how this actually works so when you're on your dashboard what you want to do is click up here on your website and then edit with elementor this is going to bring you this window which essentially allows you to start editing your site and roughly you have three areas on the left side here you have your content which allows you to edit like the text or the image and you have the style which allows you to edit the colors and background and stuff and then your advanced which allows you to edit like nice animations and a lot of different stuff that i'm gonna be using on my website which i'm really excited to include here and so essentially then you can just get started and this video isn't going to be like a full tutorial of how to do everything because i think the best way for you to get started is to just to follow the steps that i described up until this point to get you started so feel free to just go back and watch it again if you actually want to do this and then just start figuring things out how you actually edit things here is pretty intuitive essentially this drag and drop system if you want to add something new click on this corner here which allows you to add text or an image or something and then you just essentially drag it to wherever you want on the website and whenever you want to go back to the actual wordpress dashboard you click here and then exit the dashboard and then if you want to go back to edit you just go with your website edit elementor or if you want to edit the colors you're actually going to click here on customize which is going to bring you to this section where you can necessarily edit the color schemes a lot of like the footer for example a lot of sort of global settings for your website and it can seem daunting at first because there's a lot of moving parts here but it's actually very intuitive and i'm sure that if you try you're going to figure this out very quickly by the way if you have no idea what you want to do start with the template and then look at websites that you like for inspiration absolutely fine to do that the real idea of this website for me is that i wanted to essentially be this repository of different projects that i built that i then make tutorials for if you're looking for inspiration for coding project you could go to my website and just pick out some of the projects that i've done or if you want to actually contribute to my projects on github by forking it that would be really cool if some of my projects would actually become open source projects for this internet make coder community that would be really cool my original website it didn't really have much of a purpose sure it had a link to my notion template and it had a couple of blog posts but nowadays i do my blog on medium anyway so i didn't really see the reason to have my blog on my website as well but this new idea for this website is really to be this project based website where you can get project ideas i can show my project any resources that i create in the future is also going to be stored on this website over here so i'm gonna keep going and i'm gonna check back with you in a little bit [Music] in the process i also designed a logo for myself and for that i used this website called logomaker it's a free website where you have some icons and texts to create a simple logo for myself i didn't need anything complicated and i think it looks really nice so if you want a logo for your website this is another completely free website to do it basically check this out let's say you open this project site over here boom look at that look at those animations isn't that cool you go to the homepage that's really cool the way you do that if you want these cool entries animations you click on any of these elements and then you go to advanced and you go to motion effects which has this entrance animation property so you can check out any of these animations let's say we choose what we're going to choose bounce in now this is what's going to happen to the image when someone opens the page i think it just makes the website a lot more fun and a lot more interesting for people to look at so you might think that's really dull and stupid but i think it's really cool so yeah okay so it's now around 24 hours since i started building this website so let's have a look at what i've been able to do boom this is the home page you have me programmer and youtuber my email a link to my youtube channel a picture of me again take a look at this other message isn't this satisfying boom boom boom my story what i do youtube videos okay i already showed this and then this is going to be a preview of my project section so it just has two projects here and i'm gonna actually go to the project page here and this is the part of my website that i'm most excited about for now it just has these two projects but i'm gonna keep adding more as i essentially make more and i have a lot more which i haven't really organized properly yet to have on this website but essentially it's gonna have a link to a live preview for example for this sorting visualizer which i made this is essentially a way for you to visualize different sorting algorithms so if you use merge saw it's going to sort these bars like this essentially we'll link to a preview into the source code on github a link to a tutorial which is still coming soon i haven't made that yet uh the other one is imc finance which is essentially from cs50 so any of you have done cs50 one of the final projects was creating a like a stock trading slash investment tracker app with fake money obviously this is my modified version of that i've added so i'm like nice pie charts and stuff like that i've used the wp forms like the basic forms widgets to have this form for people to sign up for my newsletter this still looks pretty bad let's be honest i haven't figured out a way to make this nicer yet and then it has a resources section which for now only has my free computer designs know some template for now if you want it you can go get it from the description of this video and then there's a nice quote programming is not about what you know it's about what you're going to figure out truth um but essentially that's where i'm at with the website at the moment i'm still going to be building it a bit more before i release it but essentially all of this i've done in less than 24 hours which is pretty cool and if i wanted to completely rebuild this it would be so much easier doing it this way than doing it from scratch and if you want to do it from scratch i'm going to have tutorials coming in this channel obviously if you are a web developer and you want to build a website to have as a project to show on your portfolio to show you to employees you want to know how to do this from scratch but the point is that for your personal website for like a simple website like this there's really no point in doing that where you can do it so much easier with something like this so if you do want to build a website like this feel free to watch this video back like from the first part where i actually showed you how to get started definitely check out hosting it the sponsor of today's video they supported me so go support them as well by joining the one of the cheapest options for you to do this whole thing if you want to save even more money make sure to use my code internet recorder to get an even bigger discount on hosting up for now if you want to know how i'm actually learning coding extremely effectively i made this video about one of my favorite techniques to learn things extremely quickly so if you want to learn things fast coding or whatever definitely go check out this video next
