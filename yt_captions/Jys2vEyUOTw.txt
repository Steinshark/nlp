we have shown you the lab my master plan for revolutionizing the testing that backs all of our content at least the shell of it and we've shown you the person in charge hi gary but that's only two parts of a much bigger puzzle and we've already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on testing equipment so it's a good thing i'm already on the floor ah let's take your journey then and see exactly who i can introduce you to so far and what it is that they've been doing right after i do tell you about our sponsor vue sonic their elite xg321 ug mini led monitor offers a 4k native resolution ips panel with a 144hz refresh rate it comes with g-sync ultimate r4 and a quantum dot color layer so it's great for both gamers and creators learn more at the link down below [Music] long term our intention is to have an expert for every major field of technology we cover that'll include mobile phones displays tvs monitors projectors pc hardware audio pretty much any other category that you have seen on our channels the script calls for me to talk about our mechanical engineer antoine but instead we're going to start with sam you've been speccing out a gauntlet of grueling tests to run headphones speakers and microphones through in order to help our viewers decide which ones they should consider i mean i think it's clear from what we've talked about so far that our intention is not to say definitively this is the one to buy because it's a very personal choice but there are certain things that can be absolutely quantified we've got frequency response tests distortion tests isolation tests leakage tests and more what are you working on right now so in terms of update i can tell you that we have placed the order for the head simulator bianca 5128 and also for the audio precision 517 testing system because the equipment hasn't arrived yet i've been looking at all of the frequency response measurements that i've done on humans on the budget on a bunch of headphones and i have something interesting to show you in terms of the headphones that have noise cancelling do you want to see really yes i would like that very much this is really cool i feel cool a lot of people don't know that with close back headphones having an airtight seal between the ear cups it's critical for delivering a lot of bass and if you have glasses on or ltt store got hat pay these guys or ltd stir beanie sure uh you're gonna break the seal between the ear cups and your ear and you're gonna get a drop in base however noise cancelling headphones use their the microphones inside the ear cup to listen for how much bass you're hearing and they compensate for the drop-in bass no way so you've actually recorded this it should be noted that the measurements here are normalized so even though uh the bass line looks flat the actual measurement wasn't flat i'm just making it flat so it's easier to compare we're looking at relative yes this is the frequency response of the qc35 in the base range up to 4000 hertz without glasses without a beanie without a hat when i add glasses with noise cancelling off you see a little bit of dropping bass so about 3 db 2 db of dropping bass right which sucks yeah that's significant if you're listening to games or bass heavy music you're gonna notice that or you'll just think your headphones suck or the audio in this game sucks my headphone doesn't have enough bass even though the measurement shows that it has actually enough pace if you use a hat you get even more dropping bass oh i thought you said hats were good you just made me spend 40 thousand dollars on the hats different hats hey now and if you add a beanie which you use when you're liquid recording the banjo this is the amount of dropping bass that you get it's about i knew my voice wasn't that high pitched when i'm monitoring almost 14 db of dropping bass at 100 hertz but when we turn noise canceling on this is what we get again this is the baseline this is the measurement on me without it without glasses or hats or a beanie this is with glasses on whoa so compared to the old measurements where we lost like 3 db of base yeah here we lose only maybe a db or a half a db with a hat on again we're getting maybe only one db one and a half db and if i put on a beanie we're getting maximum like four or five db of dropping bass but with noise canceling off it was 14 db of dropping bass that is wild so if you have a noise cancelling headphone and you want to make sure that you're getting good amount of bass all the time turn noise cancelling on this doesn't happen with all the noise cancelling headphones but the better ones from sony from bose from apple they all do this so if you want to if you want to make sure that you're getting enough bass with your headphones turn the noise cancelling on cool antoine meanwhile has done all kinds of other cool things here including actually designing the desk made of radiators though i think he was still on probation when we did that video so we weren't able to credit him properly but hey we made up for it now you've got a lot of stuff going on here first of all you stole our high-speed camera we haven't had that for production lately and i think you have a demo to show off today as well it's a robot right i have a few and video makes their own latency tester why do we need that oh wait what have you done here you've got a metal key cap on here it looks like no you've just got copper foiled tape on it and you've soldered a bunch of stuff to it what on earth are you doing sir yeah that is meant for mars yes not for keyboards yeah so i kind of so you didn't care about that at all and you made it for keyboards exactly antoine is our keyboard testing specialist press the key for me do i have to do it hi whoa okay it's so aggressive wow yeah does it have to hit it that hard it's to minimize the impact of just the travel of the key i think you're maximizing the impact on the travel of the pun intended what's the point of this surely every keyboard is fast enough okay that's fair enough isn't it actually they might be but what i think we can all agree on is that keyboards have not necessarily reached peak feel how do we quantify that meat what do you call this thing keystroke test i have an actuation force analysis machine we'll figure we'll figure out a cool name for it later it might not look like much but it's really cool this piece right here is a force load cell and it can measure to a resolution of .001 newtons that is one tenth of a gram of force and there's a lot more to it than that i mean we could theoretically just grab this thing and like go like this along every string single key but that would be madness we would need an army of antoine's to test the what is it we're planning to get through the lab like 200 plus keyboards by the end of the year with the help of g fox over here we've created a machine vision system that will automatically detect the edges of the keys and then direct our x y axis what this was just like ripped out of a 3d printer or something yes yeah prusa nice that will direct our force load tester and move and press each of the keys in turn many times which is where actually he and the rest of the development team are going to be working on the backend front end and software tools that we're going to need to actually log all this data now from a software standpoint it occurs to me that not every thing on a keyboard can be pressed down like this dial for example gee is it just gonna push the force load tester against it and go in no that doesn't work or no before every test run we have a ui that allows antoine or whatever other tester is going to be doing the test to actually uh remove or isolate those options cool okay uh i think that's pretty much it can we run it yeah sure let's go ahead this is pretty cool this is just a cheap photography box and this is to ensure consistent lighting from all angles so that our cheap webcam well expensive webcam cheap camera can see all of the edges really well how do we account for like all the different legends that you might find on the keys and all that kind of crap once each key is pressed we're going to get the signal into the machine to say this is the key that was pressed so we don't actually need to read the keys off the top we just need to detect the individual key caps show me the money lots of money oh my god it's so it's a slow prototype okay fair enough is the aim to pay respects here to my wallet right now i'm sure our goal is to hit the center of the key but in the long term could we test the variability from corner to corner to corner to corner to center yes we could now that would be really cool because that's one of the things that really changes the feel of a keyboard particularly on something like a laptop where you've got a scissor switch you can have a laptop keyboard that uses a low-end switch technology but feels great because the stabilization of the keys is excellent and then you can have one that feels like crap even though it has a mechanical switch because the stabilization sucks because we're not perfectly accurate we don't hit the center of the key every time we're typing oh my god it's testing only the second key now we're gonna need an army of these things and an army of ant ones how about a robot ah that looks really expensive if any robot manufacturers want to reach out and they want to work with us you know maybe we can maybe we can figure something out that would obviously be a much better way of doing it than what we have now and i'm told you have more yes i do who is this it looks aggressive if it's anything like that whoa hi [Music] so the goal of that guy is to test the wear on kickers to compare abs against bbt double shots so this these are basically little fake fingers fascinating and the idea is to have some fake oil yeah and just wait until we get this guy going on mice and other input devices it's going to be lots of fun and you do what exactly oh i have no idea but i learned powerpoint today i know i did not have time to do a demo i promise you he's doing stuff he's working through the incredible backlog of applications because as you guys may or may not have noticed not all of our key product categories are covered yet what we do have though let's go have a look at that that's where fallout guy comes in here he's our first full-time software engineer and he is already making a huge difference to our workflow the thing is you guys probably think yeah you guys play with all the latest tech but you would be blown away by the number of things that we turn away because of how manual our test procedures have been up until now so his job and the rest of the team that we're going to build out is to make things as automated as possible we then need to be able to take those results and turn that into information that we can quickly and easily present in our videos as well as in an online database that anyone can access why don't you show us what you've been working on instead of having to launch a game and babysit a benchmark yourself and with the push of a button away we go now what is happening here is this just basically glorified auto hotkey or like what what am i looking at uh some parts are but some games have menus that are not navigable via keyboard so we're also using computer vision here as well to identify some buttons interesting and will we use computer vision to identify what our ideal settings are so that we can have it configure it to whatever it's supposed to be or how does that work we can do that however changing the settings is actually a lot easier to do if you just manipulate the files underneath got it now i know it's not implemented yet but our goal in the long term would be to also use machine vision to identify any kind of artifacting or visual anomalies in the picture is that correct yep that's something we have to be able to do when it's a very good question to the other software engineer and it's done to be clear it's not that much today but this foundation is going to allow us to rapidly scale not only how many tests we're able to run but what kinds of tests we're able to run and on what products this is going to be the backbone that the entire lab runs off of and it's going to be epic wait a second so you're saying that you know once it works better than the load tester we don't even need to make graphs anymore like it'll just it'll just spit everything out ready to go just about and i'll save them the time okay i mean does it do that yet where does where does the data go what's it how does that work what what data points how does it read the results even so it spits out uh readings of csv files which then we uh parse and send into a database which is great but i'm about to show you something cooler antoine whipped this up in his spare time you know gary tried to take the credit for this right that he inspired you really i mean he has nothing else he has nothing else to his name so he's got a he's got a kind of weasel in there just kidding antoine this was a completely an antoine initiative and it looks like progress has been made it's really cool we're just not sure how much we like needed it so um why don't you show us what you made so basically the future of the lab this was all done in unreal engine 5 meaning that it is basically a game level of what it will be like to walk through lab 2. it's amazing i still can't believe you did this this will be the non-ltt writers downstairs take us to the server room nice where's the server yeah where's the server it's coming what the heck dancing what's going on i'm i'm kidding i'm kidding you really don't even have absolutely and then what's here is this the lunchroom or lunchroom meeting yeah cool show me the aquarium i want to go to the aquarium you told them they were upstairs yeah i removed them still i'm working on it so oh interesting okay that's my office i'm apparently an open concept kind of boss now that's fine i'm into it jake where's your desk gonna be somewhere somewhere there right there oh and then this is the aquarium so the gary this is where you're going to sit thank you you're welcome make power points in there logistics is going to move over to lab 2 since that's where pretty much every product that crosses our threshold is going to arrive first a lab will test it tell us if it's good or if it's crap and then it will be sent to ltt or short circuit or maybe sent nowhere because it sucks that's that's a very real possibility so that's why logistics needs to move here and we're going to use logistics area which is actually right below us for i don't know more sets or something along those lines okay everybody's workstations and then this is the testing area so like cpu bench gpu bench we wouldn't do any displays here or anything like that i wouldn't think would we not necessarily some some of the tests some tests here okay there's obviously some optimizations we could make to the layout for example if we wanted to test laptop battery life and having them like a nice little rack where you can pack them in nice and tight would be a huge advantage is this oh is this your work area did you take us right to your desk yes i love it okay so you've got your are you working like that yeah yeah the keyboard tester do you have the unreal engine on your computer in the unreal engine and what am i looking at here so this is for the first room that is for deep and to use with the smartphones smartphones okay we've got some really cool smartphone testing coming it turns out there's all kinds of tomfoolery that goes on in the smartphone industry around like fake reporting 5g connectivity and all kinds of cool stuff that we're going to be able to dig into in there i believe this is the first big guy oh is it actually that's the second big check where's the power supply tester [Music] it'll look a little something like that cost over a hundred thousand us dollars but it'll allow us to analyze every aspect of a computer power supply and then this is a theater room right yes we can do projectors in there we can do speakers just anything that you need a larger space for is going to happen in here thermal chamber freaking exciting
