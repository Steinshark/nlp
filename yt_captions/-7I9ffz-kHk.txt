at this point of your Python Programming career you're probably very familiar with the random module and in this video I want to show you something that really helps with testing and this is something you will probably use in your future workplace or to make your apps more robust by testing them and I'm just going to jump right into it so first we're going to go ahead and import random and the feature we're going to be talking about today is called random dot seed so I'm going to be explaining what the seed is and why you should use it in certain situations because it does provide us with some very important functionality so to explain exactly what this seed is I'm going to go ahead and create a function which is going to print some random numbers so here we'll type in print random and we'll do for I in range five we're going to go ahead and print random dot random integer and that's going to be from 0 to 100 and we will also Define the end which is going to be an empty space so we print all of the numbers on one line and we can compare them easily so let's go ahead and print this to make sure everything works perfectly if we go here and right click on Main and run it we're going to get five random numbers and each time we replay this we're going to get five different random numbers and this has to do with the seed each time you run random it generates a random seed for us so we're always going to have different results now if we really want to replicate certain results we're going to have to go ahead and Define a seed and this can be a string this can be a number it has to be something identifiable to the program and in this situation we can just go ahead and insert one and as soon as we Define a seed and rerun this program we're going to get random numbers of course well what's going to be very interesting is that if we rerun this we are always going to get the same random numbers it doesn't matter if you run this a million times two million times you're always going to get the same set of numbers which ultimately will help you with testing because you can go back and find out which numbers were used and that will help you understand why your program broke at a certain number for example so it's good to keep in mind that you can have a seed and each time you define a seed it's always going to generate the same random numbers and this even counts if you generate 20 numbers or a Million numbers it will always generate the same exact numbers for that seed and as I mentioned earlier you can say hello and that is also a valid seed in Python but anyways I thought that was a very important feature worth mentioning in Python I hope you enjoyed this video do let me know in the comment section down below if you have something else that you consider important or something you would like to share I would love to hear it and possibly share it with the rest of the channel but with that being said as always guys thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
