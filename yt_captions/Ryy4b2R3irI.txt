Samsung has just announced the galaxy AAT their first smartphone ever to have a full-screen Super AMOLED infinity display there's no knotch there is no punch hole the front is pretty much all screen and there's actually quite a few new features that something is debuted in this phone right here but to me the most exciting thing is this camera let's find out why so the AAT has a triple camera setup which is cool in itself but it's nothing we haven't ever seen before you've got a 3d depth sensor a 48 megapixel main camera and then the ultra wide on the far right and aside from not having a telephoto lens here it's kind of similar to the setup we've seen on a galaxy s 10 you can seamlessly transition between the main camera and the ultra wide depending on how much you want to capture and this new animation they've added makes that transition a little less abrupt and what I was impressed by is that like it's more expensive cousin it does have most of the same camera features like 4k video recording slow motion as well as super slow motion it's even got the same super steady video at 1080p that the STM phones do although I would say this is not as good as a stabilization on the p30 Pro generally speaking now because we've also got that 3d depth sensor it does open up a few new possibilities like being able to use augmented reality to measure objects in real time but before we can fully get to that this camera flips around when you flip to the front camera the entire camera module Rises and then turns and yeah sure that in itself is pretty cool but the implication is much more important and it's actually something I've been asking for on a phone for a long time it means you can take selfies with the main camera on this device and the quality looks amazing it means you can take them with a full ultra-wide the same ultra wide you would use to take your rear landscape photos and it also means you can take good quality live focus selfies with nice blurred backgrounds and crisp defined edges and whilst it's not yet time to throw your DSLR at the door this phone can also do live focus video and it's better than I thought it would be it takes advantage of that depth sensor to calculate in real time or what is foreground and what is background it only works in 1080p as opposed to standard selfie video which you can shoot in full 4k so that still makes this one of the first phones in the world that can do that oh yeah and if one of the five people that actually use these AR stickers they do it pretty well here alright there is one thing that worries me a little bit about this phone when you open up that camera module aside from having just lots of moving parts in one go you've also got the fact that there are two stages to the movement of that camera rotation it's not one continuous smooth movement and so that does make me think that there's potential over time for this to start to go wrong a little bit but we'll have to wait and see alright the display kind of surprised me because it's a massive six point seven inches in size with only a full HD plus resolution I was a little worried thankfully having spent some time with it I would say it is one of the highlights of the phone it is insanely bright and super vivid thanks to that Super AMOLED technology and because there are no physical cutouts on the phone in some ways it looks more impressive than even high-end flagships like the p30 pro sadly compared to that phone and compared to the glamorous device this thing is pitched as I think it kind of looks a little bit dull the AAT does have a few different color options but most of them I found were pretty dull looking which considering how exciting the concept of this rotating camera is feels a little bit contrasting out of all of them this one's probably my favorite this rose gold finish and I do like the bronze metallic shiny sides the phone loses the dedicated Bigsby button we had on the s10 I don't think too many people are gonna be bothered by this but what you will probably feel a little bit more is the lack of a headphone jack alright when it comes to the software I don't think people are gonna have much room to complain here it's running Samsung's 1ui skin based on Android 9pi and I like the way it looks I like the simple aesthetic I like the way it's animated and I like the speed and compared to the experience on the s10 nothing feels substantially different here and that's a good thing there's also a little bit more going on behind the screen in this phone we've got an in display fingerprint scanner in the bottom half and then in the top half instead of a traditional earpiece you've got a speaker underneath the screen for me personally one of the most important pillars of a smartphone is good battery life it's so freeing to have a phone where you can almost forget about the need to charge it during the day and it's looking like this phone will fall into that category it's got a three thousand seven hundred million power capacity not amazing but also decent considering that this sliding mechanism probably takes up a fair bit of space inside the phone and the fact that the resolution is a little lower than top-tier flagships and the fact that it's running on the Snapdragon 730 ship instead of maybe an 855 will also help boost this battery a little bit and they're combining it with 25 watt fast charging which I was kind of surprised by considering that this is beyond the charging speed of even the s10 Verne's CA there is a lot of cool stuff going on here and in some ways even leapfrogs the Galaxy S 10 and the S 10 Plus this is a 679 euro phone which on one hand no is not cheap but on the other hand does leave a good amount of price gap between this and the more expensive options but just bear in mind that compared to that phone you are missing out on a more powerful chip as well as stereo speakers you just get a single mono speaker in the corner here if you enjoyed this video it'll be massively appreciate it if you could smash that subscribe button down below ton more cool stuff coming my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
