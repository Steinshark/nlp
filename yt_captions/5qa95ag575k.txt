Samsung has built literally everything from a family car to a butt robot it's a crazy company so here are my top 40 things about them Samsung has a huge office park in Korea all to itself called Samsung digital city is quite possibly the company's most important bunch of buildings it's where their Galaxy smartphones are designed and even where some of the first curved TVs were conceptualized and this samsung city has a couple of interesting things about it there's a special ice chamber that is decked with soundproofing pads to create pin-drop silence and this is actually where the audio performance of phones is tested they even have a sound lab filled with instruments which is where a lot of those iconic ringtones and Samsung alert sounds are actually created plus something has a philosophy here called work smart where employees can sure but whatever time they want to up until 6 p.m. just as long as they feel productive I quite like this one and even aside from this headquarters Samsung is big and it's actually tough to conceptualize just how big they've got over 320,000 employees and for some perspective that's as much as Google Plus Apple Plus Nokia and to manage all of them not one not two but three CEOs Samsung's revenue brings in about 17 percent of the whole GDP of South Korea that is the entire value of everything produced in the country they've also sold over way for it to billion galaxy phones that doesn't count tablets that doesn't count a lot of their non smart ventures just galaxy branded phones that is a quarter of the number of people on this planet something has become it's so big there in fact it's a to branch out within the Samsung group there are a whole load of sub companies ranging from Samsung life insurance exactly what it says on the tin to Samsung Heavy Industries and Samsung techwin and this is where the true depth of the company starts to become clear Samsung Heavy Industries is actually one of the largest believe it or not ship building companies in the world and techwin was founded as Samsung's and defense or military division in a very literal sense of the word it developed the k-9 thunder an anti infantry tank that can shoot targets up to 40 kilometers away and this was actually used by the Korean Armed Forces but it gets better Samsung have also developed a smart sentry gun and there's a good chance this was the first that combines surveillance and red camera to pick up human activity voice recognition and of course the ability to shoot things there was a car division Samsung Motors they sold hundreds of thousands and Samsung's construction company built the Burj Khalifa the tallest building in the world and you probably guessed it I could go on for a while it doesn't end there helicopter engines fighter jets and toilet seats something isn't afraid to give something a go speaking of which if you do enjoy this video a sub would be amazing anyways Samsung and Apple you might already know this they've been locked in a legal battle for seven years ever since Apple first accused Samsung of copying the design of the iPhone things like touch to zoom and the layout to the homescreen Apple's initial plan was to try and get Samsung smartphones completely blocked from sale after this failed they pursued two billion dollars in damages but they only ended up walking away with about five hundred and thirty million they won but this amount of money for a company like Apple was barely worth their time in fact Apple also had a couple of losses during this battle when it came to tablets they filed a public complaint saying that Samsung's Galaxy Tab had blatantly copied the design of the iPad but the judge disagreed it massively backfired to the point where Apple was told to run both newspaper and online adverts just to state that actually Samsung hadn't copied the iPad that's a big ouch it's a bit strange then these two companies they're out there suing each other when actually they knew each other samsung supplies about 90% of the OLED panels used in iPhones meaning that without Samsung Apple would be struggling for displays and without Apple Samsung would have lost a massive customer for its display department we don't realize it because a lot of Samsung's products they're not retail products with the company's brand name slapped on top of them but Samsung is everywhere whilst you probably know them primarily for their phones that's only about 20% of their business display panels for other companies and their semiconductor sector processors storage chips and mobile image sensors are significant too they're doing so well across these businesses that in total Samsung earns just under $400,000 of revenue per minute that said it's a company that likes to reinvest a lot of this back into the company in 2018 Samsung became the world's biggest advertiser it's a bit of a weird title but the implications are massive no company across any industry spent as much as Samsung did on advertising and also last year they were the biggest filer of patents in the entire United States in fact right now Samsung has over 300,000 active patents that call have been cheap if you've seen the video I made all about Apple or the one I made about what way you'll know I find it fascinating seeing how such massive companies had such humble beginnings Samsung is no different they initially started by selling noodles dried fish and groceries it was a company that before they even found their footing in electronics dip their toes in everything they were founded in 1938 but they didn't make their first electrical product till 1970 that's over 30 years later the name has been the same throughout the entire company's history but what a lot of people didn't know is that such a bit of wordplay going on some means three and some means is stars this was chosen because the founder saw his company being as everlasting as the Stars these three stars were then present in every single historic Samsung logo up until about 20 years ago when they were ditched but the underlying space theme has remained off their mobile division has changed logos many of Samsung's other sub companies still go by this one which looks an awful lot like a Milky Way galaxy Samsung's entire smartphone sub brand is called galaxy and even in the way these phones have been themed there's been clear space inspiration in fact this Milky Way logo it's pretty cool it supposedly has the s and the G on either end spilling out of the galaxy to show that Samsung is always pushing boundaries in the 1990s Samsung's reputation was very much quantity over quality they were churning out products but they just weren't all that great the Chairman at the time he decided one day that he just wasn't gonna have any of it he ordered over 2,000 staff to gather round a pile of 150,000 Samsung products and just watch as he set them on fire there's about 50 million dollars worth of product gone just for the sake of manias statement you could say it's a bit harsh but the company did turn themselves around and it's possible this was why more recently having become this giant company churning out tons of products which have been complete runaway successes Samsung has also made a couple of questionable items the Samsung dream doghouse is a $30,000 pad containing a pool a treadmill or controlled snack dispense and this is the best bit a galaxy s tablet in a press release something actually said that this is for dogs who have social media profiles what probably makes more sense is that this will be used by the owners to keep an eye on their dogs we might see in a movie called The Matrix Reloaded if not it's a sci-fi action film with this being one of the props used in it so of course something had to make it reality by working closely with the matrix team they brought it to life complete with the infamous matrix wallpaper and a spring-loaded earpiece you might have also seen that new foldable Motorola RAZR phone Welton Samsung actually detailed this exact concept some time ago as a way to make a firm that was a bit more manageable in size and their current Galaxy fold which when unfolded is more of a tablet but on the subject of folding things it's almost a secret that Samsung actually currently sells a smart flip phone it's called the Samsung folder - it runs full Android it is touchscreen it's just a very weird choice for anyone who's not having severe withdrawal symptoms from 10 years ago now it's pretty clear that Samsung has always wanted to have their own software platform just as Android was starting they tried to compete with something called bada os and even after this failed and Samsung moved to androids they continued to insist on creating alternatives to many apps and features that Android already has they wanted to make a Samsung phone feel like a Samsung phone not just any other Android device it's kind of ironic then that something actually had the opportunity to buy Android and they said no back in 2004 the Android team was looking for funding and so they approached Samsung but Samsung didn't see any potential they apparently found it almost amusing that the Android team had such lofty goals but there were only a group of paid people over time this was just two weeks before Google eventually bought Android the entire landscape could have been different just think about it Bixby it could be a life assistant right now you might have heard of routing routing allows you to gain administrator permissions over your phone enabling you to do things like block adverts and install custom software anyways Samsung doesn't really want you to route your phone because it can present additional security risks so over the years they made it tougher and tougher to do so it got to the point with the galaxy s5 where there was literally a bounty or cash reward for the first person to successfully root the phone it started at 500 but as people kept chipping in this he went all the way up to eighteen thousand four hundred and seventy dollars and now for some of my absolute favorite samsung facts they've had some pretty great social media moments in 2013 a man messaged them on Facebook this was just after the galaxy s3 was announced and he said I was wondering if I could get a free Galaxy s3 most including a drawing he made of a dinosaur bear in mind this was made by a guy who is 26 years old anyways Samsung saw this and somehow decided to not just gift him the phone but a one-of-a-kind custom s3 with this guy's drawing all over the packaging and device it's actually tough to tell who was trolling her in this situation maybe something thought the drawing was so bad that it would be funny to give him his phone with that on it Samsung Medical Center is a fully functioning hospital in Korea which of course a is used to treat people but being is what Samsung uses to test potential future medical technologies and some non-medical wants to Samsung also owns Everland South Korea's largest you guessed it you probably didn't actually it's a theme park and I'm not gonna lie it looks really good plus they had their own professional eSports team playing Starcraft and League of Legends and a professional basketball team the seoul samsung thunders who to this day they play in the korean basketball league and finally in this digital city we talked about earlier they've got this dedicated department just for testing the quality of their smartphones they'll put the phones under as much strain as possible to see if they can hold up under load and for example by playing a game for long periods of time whilst the phone is charging or getting a but robot to repeatedly sit on it after the fiasco of the iPhone 6 bending this was a pretty odd way of Samsung making sure their note 4 didn't follow suit if you enjoyed this video don't forget to check out the ones I made on far away Apple and myself and with that being said I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
