the first thing that really helped me when i 
was getting comfortable speaking up in meetings   is realizing that it doesn't have to be 
this grandiose gesture that i start with   i often thought that i needed to ask this big 
question in order to sound smart so people   didn't think i was stupid and this whole cycle 
of thoughts kept on going on my on in my head   and i realized so quickly that a no one's 
really fully or very little little chance   is that someone's fully paying attention to 
what you are saying you are your own biggest   critic and we put so much pressure on ourselves 
and judge ourselves so much more than we would   judge others which is really interesting and 
once i came to that realization i realized you   know what why not just start with a very start 
with small steps so for me what i did which   i was terrified of speaking up in 
meetings so it took step after step   and what i did was i just unmuted myself and 
would do small things such as if someone said   something that i agreed with or that i was excited 
about i would just comment on on their statements   so yeah that sounds great mike or thomas or 
susan i don't i'm just making these names now   but yeah that sounds great susan and that alone 
just feels okay i can do that much okay and just   starting with really small steps of just even 
reiterating what someone said or reconfirming   what someone said made me realize that hey 
maybe this speaking up thing isn't that scary   from there i was able to start by asking 
smaller questions you know questions that   weren't uh i knew were things i was seeing 
but maybe weren't these massive questions   there were some times where i asked questions and 
i felt silly afterwards but no one made me feel   that way it's more so because i realized oh shoot 
i actually do know that but once again most people   aren't really paying attention to you as much 
as you think they are another thing i did when   i was starting to contribute in meetings is decide 
how many times in a meeting i wanted to speak up   and i did this to hold myself accountable 
otherwise i'd go into meetings saying   i do want to speak up to myself like okay tiff 
you've got to do this you've got to speak up   but in turn i'd get in the meeting and i 
would never speak up because it wasn't the   right time or you know i i want to let other 
people speak so what i did was i said to myself   okay i promise in this meeting i'm going to speak 
up at least twice i'm going to ask two questions   and this does a few things one thing it really 
does is make you pay attention into the meeting as   to what is going on and the other is it holds you 
accountable and these questions can be very small   questions again even sometimes what i would do is 
join meetings early so i could have a conversation   well not early but right on time and usually very 
little people are right on time for a meeting   so it'd be me and maybe one or two other 
people while we're waiting for others to join   and during that time it's a great way to unmute 
yourself have a more personable conversation and   realize that hey maybe these people aren't 
as scary as they sometimes seem to be in   our own minds and this kind of brings me to my 
third tip which is to speak early in meetings i   think it goes to the whole point of the longer you 
wait to speak up in meetings the harder it becomes   and the more it's like okay i'll start next 
time next meeting i'll start and you start   making all these excuses for yourself that you 
wouldn't have done if you would have just spoke   up earlier in meetings and it kind of takes off 
the pressure versus you just start to think about   speaking up in meetings so much and then to the 
point that you actually get work yourself up to   not wanting to speak in a meeting so speak up 
early in meetings is another great thing that   really helped me at the end of the day though 
there is no secret formula or i wish i could say   to you if you do this and this you'll become an 
excellent speaker in meetings no the reality is   you just need to start small step after step put 
put yourself out there and once you realize that   it's okay no one's going to judge you or think 
of you as silly for asking you know even silly   questions but at the end of the day it's it's the 
worst thing you can do is not speak up and when i   realized i thought okay well i'm not doing myself 
a favor here by not speaking up so clearly i need   to do look at it from a different point of view 
and start speaking up you have a lot to contribute   you have a lot to say you're in the meeting for 
a reason people want to hear from you and you   have a perspective that only you can bring to the 
table and i really wanted to film this video and   have a candid conversation about speaking up in 
meetings because i think as technical people we   really struggle with speaking up in meetings even 
more so because we're scared that if we are asking   a question that is technical or how to implement 
a solution or different things around a feature   being built whatever the case may be around 
your code it's even that fear is even more   elevated to to the next level or elevated to 
the next level because you are so worried about   if you will look like you don't know what you're 
doing will it show that your skills aren't very   strong and we put this added level of pressure 
on ourselves but with a little bit of practice   and just really taking small steps believing in 
yourself you will get there i can tell you if   i was able to get there you will too because i 
was my face would turn red my palms were sweaty   it was just it was terrible so i know you can 
get there and my biggest piece of advice is just   to start small step by step i'm curious to know
