chiang kai-shek never personally said that he wanted a cult of personality in fact he had been quick to criticize the cults around stalin and mao zedong but it would be hard to ignore the fact that during and for a brief period after his lifetime a powerful propaganda machine arose to adore and admire him today many of his statues and pictures have been taken down people including historians and artists have dug up the horrors of this rule and the politicians of his komindan party today tend to avoid mentioning his name in this video i want to talk about the taiwanese cult of personality around chiang kai-shek why it happened how it happened how it got taken down but first i want to talk to you to uh to ask you to subscribe to the asionometry newsletter i'm starting to get on a bit of

days at 1 am taiwan time much thanks the republic of china positioned itself against the chinese communist party and the soviets but it also employed many of those organizations same leninist tactics one of those tactics has to do with the reverence of a great leader even before the roc came to taiwan the chiang kai-shek cult had been on the rise in the nanjing decade the 10 years prior to the outbreak of the second sino-japanese war chang sought to cement his position as china's leader by positioning himself as a wise confucian leader and disciple of sun yet sen in the story chang told the chinese people sanyetsen was the revolutionary of the republic the lenin of china so to say and chang was his chosen successor and loyal follower thus the deification of sun would in turn be a backdoor deification of chang as well so i guess that makes chang stalin that's an uncomfortable metaphor let's ignore it a number of private organizations took the lead in spreading this propaganda one notable organization was the omea the officer's moral endeavor association which was made up of wampoa military academy graduates this private organization began as sort of a chiang kai-shek bank club giving the leader adulation and adoration as chang drew recognition from around the world for his work in the second sino-japanese war this work intensified and developed its practitioners drew on techniques from soviet and american propaganda photography language etc to emphasize his specialness for example they like to photograph chang near or on mountains it helped developed an aura around him as a hero or a god reigning high above the people in 1945 japan ceded taiwan to the republic of china less than 200 days later the first chiang kai-shek statue was unveiled the rsd government began a series of propagandizing campaigns to make chiang kai-shek taiwan's new god leader taiwan-born statue sculptors were commissioned to make bronze chiang statues for public squares and streets the slopes of yang ming shan the mountain near taipei were decorated with the characters of his name dongdan per the mandarin pronunciation chang chose to adopt this name to emulate sun yat-sen's name which at the time was dongsan omea members relocating to taiwan after the civil war would found a news organization the fu xing kang college under the leadership of jianjin guo and continue their holy work of spreading the gospel of chang this includes iconic paintings inspiring photography posters and more they regularly provided such posters decorations and statues for anyone who would like to adore chiang kai-shek they even tried to promote a response to ccp's mao zedong thought chiang kai-shek thought that one didn't much stick though as time passed the adoration of chiang kai-shek sort of passed into a weird place as it is in other authoritarian countries officials started to venerate chang not necessarily because they loved him with all of his heart but rather it was the best way for them to get promoted local officials competed with each other to honor the great leader in their towns or counties yet at the same time taiwan during the martial law period never quite got to a place like in cultural revolution china where you absolutely had to adore the leader or face persecution you are able to opt out of it if you wanted to taiwan was one of those rare societies where the political ruling class the minority wife chandra and people were not well represented in other aspects of the culture that includes business arts what not the voluntary aspect of it had some funny consequences on one hand it meant that the people who loved him tended to love him pretty genuinely it also allowed people to hate him with equal fervor opening the door for the culture wars to come the cult of personality likely reached its peak upon the elder chang's death his death in 1975 triggered a wave of grand acts and commemoration it's during this period that the amazing cks memorial would be billed in taipei by 1976 the administration faced major challenges from both inside and outside of the gomidan party a number of corruption scandals rocked the party's credibility ren ren minister of justice and close associate of qianjin guo was accused of extorting 3 million ntd from a businessman henry gao lost his position as minister of transportation after nearly 200 bus and train accidents in taipei over the span of a single year on the outside fierce criticism from independent candidates running for seats in local elections payatsan for example attempted to run for a seat but was arrested for sedition 10 days before election he directly criticized janjin guo for a number of personal items for driving an american car hiding his personal wealth and using his power to get his son enrolled international taiwan university he urged taiwan to establish close ties with china and the ussr this item in particular was the one that got him jailed but he was just one of many other candidates offering such criticism there is no doubt that much of the adoration of chiang kai-shek after his death was genuine but the chang regime and its inner circle also encouraged it so to secure the secession the decision to make jianjin guo the next president was certainly not final the chain cult helped cement the sun's grip on power the dpp would eventually take presidential power with the election of chen schweibien after taiwanese democracy he came to power drawing a minority of the vote that acted like as if he won the election by the biggest margin in history president chen sought to make broad changes to taiwanese society and this would include the removal of the chang statues okay let me try to say what i'm about to say in as far away that i can considering the dpp's difficult history of struggling for democracy and chang's involvement in various sordid affairs of taiwanese tragedy it is understandable that they would seek to quote unquote cancel him documentation exists at tai chang to terrible events like the yellow river flooding 228 and the murders of the white terror he has plenty of blood on his hands the dpp saw their work washing away the references to chang has helping to solidify a national identity around taiwan rather than china it helped shed light on aspects of taiwanese culture and history that otherwise would be forgotten or made obscure i'll leave that to you to judge whether that to be a good thing i personally kinda think it is there is certainly room to rebalance the excessive references to chiang across taiwan's cities for example when the dpp took control of the taipei majority the road in front of the presidential palace was named jesho road it literally means the road of chiang kai-shek's longevity chan and the dpp renamed it to ketagallan boulevard after the taiwanese aboriginal tribe same goes for the taurian airport which used to be named chiang kai-shek international at some point it's just too much chiang still has dongdan district in taipei dongdan road in new taipei city and others for himself note that there still remains a jet show park right next to katagalan boulevard in addition we cannot discount his achievements unifying china fighting the japanese and leading taiwan as the free china chang came to taiwan along with a million weishan ren they believed in and looked up to him as their leader there is still a lot of that warm feeling left even after the news of his involvement in horrible things furthermore we would be in error if we were to tie every horrible thing that happened directly to him for instance while chang was indeed the head of the guaming dan and the nation at the time of the 228 incident it was not directly responsible for its carrying out you should probably look to governor chen yi for that but when the dpp came into power it seemed like they got into the mindset that chiang kai-shek was the singular reason for every bad thing that ever happened in taiwan post 1949 it would not be a stretch to say that during this period of time the dpp got caught up in needless culture wars and it hurt their re-election prospects constant battles over the anti-chang cancel culture called choo chen hua or di chang kaiseki vacation awkward exhausted the public and freaked out the business community along with other moves they made it eroded the government's credibility and distracted them from the core goal of competent governance things peaked with the government's attempt to rename the chiang kai-shek memorial in january 2008 to taiwan democracy memorial hall the timing right before a presidential election was unfortunate it seemed to have really crossed the line and energized the woman don voters vomit on candidate main zhou would shortly sweep into office with the greatest margin of victory yet recorded in taiwanese history a record to be broken later in 2020 i have been wanting to write this particular piece ever since my visit to the chiang kai-shek statue park in dashi i had been wondering about why a statue would make its way here to the park as opposed to staying at the school or public square it has been the canceled culture of today's modern society is seen to be a recent phenomenon but it seems to have been happening or things like this seem to have been happening for many years for organizations and governments looking to satisfy themselves and their supporters with such movements i think one should keep in mind that they will have consequences all right hope you guys take care of yourselves see you guys later
