ladies and gentlemen the world rapid chess championships concluded today and surprise surprise we had two things which are seemingly in every single bit of Chess content nowadays a little bit of drama and Magnus Carlson winning yet another event his 16th World Chess Championship but the road there was absolutely nuts with a lot of upsets a lot of crazy victories crazy emotions and before we jump into today's recap I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video woku folks how many times have you done this oh the we love chess but it can be frustrating you know where you can't blunder your queen in woku woku is a block puzzle game played and loved by millions it's basically a mix of Sudoku and Tetris you need to clear rows and columns by sliding in these Nifty little blocks and the sound effects are super nice too just like in chess you've got to think ahead for which pieces you might be given or you're going to run out of space and end up looking like me a 297 woku is a nice zen-like mental workout which you can enjoy in daily challenge classical or Journey mode and here's a couple of crazy fun facts about woku that I never knew before first of all it's played in 185 countries around the world that's like pretty close to chess it also has been downloaded 250 million times globally that's also probably similar to chess in fact 15% of the United States alone has downloaded woku now frankly I think chess should be at like 100% but you know with your help we'll get there and woku is 100% free to play folks you know how this works to play woku right now all you got to do is click the link in the description now let's get back to the video thanks sponsored Gotham my friends here we go the final recap of the world rapid I will cover both events the open the womens's the women's had a wild wild finish so did the open and it all starts and really features uh it starts with Magnus Carlson and features three prominent names Vladimir FV uh formerly from Russia now representing Slovenia and vidit GTI of India this all begins with the game feta versus Magnus Carlson Magnus going for a NSO and credit to Fed of for actually allowing a NSO right rather than just playing Knight F3 and stopping Bishop to be B4 stuff now FF plays it like this this is a bit of a sideline Magnus takes damaging the structure and compromising White's ability to put a pawn in the center and then he plays D6 he plays Rock solidly bit of a sideline here Queen E7 not developing his piece is not castling and then takes the dark squares with this move C5 right he gave up his dark squared Bishop so he replaces that real estate with the pawns like this FV has a major decision to make is he going going to advance in the center or what is he going to do if you take what you give yourself is really ugly Pawn structure doubled C pawns not impressing anybody so instead he takes a little bit of Center and then he takes a little bit more space Magnus continues to replace pawns on dark squares he's very close to fulfilling the destiny of having no dark squared Bishop but a rock solid formation and as you can see now he's able to start walking his king that's a very provocative move naturally you would think he wants to Castle and castling does look pretty natural but maybe there's a world in which V have actually starts some sort of attack over here while Magnus Castle there the computer is not impressed but clearly Magnus moving his king is not a is not an IRL Mouse slip right so Knight back to D2 Magnus walks his King to C7 he's kind of provoking fetv to advance over here which fetv is a little bit hesitant to do and Magnus is still playing very very kg chest the thing is for for Magnus to win the title he's got to provoke his opponents a little bit it's very difficult to win with black like if white does nothing if white just goes bing bong bing bong bing like back and forth especially in a position like this where the position is very locked and not just locked white has a lot more space like black is going to have to take the fight to White which is not easy so you you kind of give the opponent a little bit like you're waving the red flag in front of the charging bull and I mean FV has six pawns advanced in the center like this right so at some point he's going to come forward Magnus shuts down the queen side so now fedos have can't do anything over there it would be nice for Vladimir to do this Knight D2 Knight B1 like that that is possible but maybe there's nothing lethal about it for example if the Knight goes to D2 maybe there is B6 maybe Knight B1 Bishop A6 Knight A3 I don't know we go here and then this actually has no potency anymore because the last thing that you want to do is block your own position right so I don't know what the idea there was but FV does this and now Magnus doesn't lock the position at all he takes takes he wants to create something he wants to create a little bit of something it's still a very very Cy position the queen goes to B3 now Magnus rotates the Knight this way is he preparing F5 no way he's not in the position to call the shots he's moved his King a bunch he has like no development whatsoever FV also moves his King and there comes F5 this man Magnus is playing for a win Magnus is like he's like a he's like he's like a wrestler he's like a brawler but if you get him on his back right being on your back like like this generally not a really good in the guys pounding in your face but um pause but seriously when he's on his back he can still submit you he get you in a triangle choke I don't know what this is he'll get you in a triangle choke right he'll get he'll get an arm he'll rotate the position like you think oh all of magnus's pieces are sort of stuck back here no he finds the only Pawn break in the position now white has to deal with the imbalances right fed have still putting pressure on that beat but Magnus is just defending he's just defending and what's going to happen now is feda is going to start spending time but he's not he's not feda if anything is a guy that is very good on playing on Instinct but he's going backwards right there's he can't do much anymore most people here would just sit with white and go oh my God what am I going to do I I can't make any more progress well that's fully accurate and fetv now starts trying to fight on the G file Magna says no I open the G file the G file is mine the queen goes to H7 to seize the diagonal and now it's a waiting game there might not be a chance yet for for black to break through the position is about equal but we're going to wait it's going to be a waiting game Queen G all right now Here Comes The Rook All Right Here Comes The Rook FV trying to use his final Pawn F4 Magnus shuts the door knowing that that pawn is Going to Be a Menace In the End Game Queen D7 and now he's prying apart the the the defenses of the white position uh-oh who's going to defend that pawn I got news for you that pawn was nice when it was an attacking mechanism but now black is completely guarding the position both players are now at at around 2 minutes Rook ag3 FV is just restricted look at his pieces getting absolutely flattened in their ranks Bishop C1 Queen B6 excuse me I I said Queen B6 H Queen G3 B6 would have been on the other side Bishop C4 Magna sacrifices material and just gets the bishop back and the king is in Dire Straits one of the most incredible things about this game is that this King crossed the center line the king crossed the center line got mated Magnus beat for which one of White's other pieces crossed the center seriously let's take a look at this seriously so D5 I'm talking about pieces look at pieces not pawns not pawns G4 those are all pawns those are pawns those are all pawns not a single no way this is crazy not a single this can't be happening not a single P not one of of Whit's pieces not one of Whit's pieces cross the center how insane is that have you ever seen something like this Magnus Carlson restricted his opponents Knights Bishops Queen and Rooks to this side of the board he never crossed the center line it's like a a boxer too scared to punch it's crazy the only King that crossed the center was the the only piece was the king the king was the only one courageous enough and he was courageously stupid cuz he got mated he got m on the other side of the board and that is the way and apparently Magnus was taken for a random fair play check after this game I saw that video on chess base India everybody get scanned it's like you know when when athletes get drug tested after good performances they took Magnus for a fair play Scan because they were like no no no no no no no no no no way no way you just did that to one of the best rapid players in the world now while this game was going on we had other games all right we had other games going on my man vidit GUI yesterday suffering a tough defeat against Magnus but he has been absolutely ridiculous this year first of all he's opposite side castling and this man is actually adapting his playing style a little bit vid's gotten a lot more aggressive which is actually he's he's the reverse as a person he's gotten like much more Zen he's doing a lot of meditating he's always like posting about his meditations and I should really try meditation um but he's actually gotten quite aggressive and as you can see here he's got bad intentions for kabov now let me tell you Anton kabov from Ukraine one of the most creative players very very perennial 2700 is rapid as 2600 cuz rapid ratings aren't real but you know uh Rook E8 Knight B3 and I mean as you can see he's got very bad intentions for one of the most creative players in the world if one guy has an attack here on the other it is clearly Ved attacking kabov and corov trying to defend himself now of course the computer says it's equal because the computer is is a piece of garbage and kills all imagination and tells children that I was going to say certain things aren't real but you know what if I have like 5-year-olds watching this who's who they're real everything's real it's all real it's all real until a certain age at which point you will be institutionalized Rook e s Rook B3 look at this attack he has 20 22 pieces of material bulldozing down his opponent's side of the board and it's not even about taking the pawns it's about restricting pawns control Knight A6 is a massive threat so the King goes to AA now Rook A3 is made he's not going to blunder it G3 waiting move and at some point maybe vid is going to maneuver oh oh B is not having he's not having it he's trying to create counterplay now vided goes around the other way Knight E4 still looking for mate still poking still P there nothing here there's nothing here the only way something's going to happen is if somebody blunders something Rook C8 oh that's an annoying move look at Queen B6 wow that is annoying now it's still equal if black just does nothing black can play F5 maybe you know obviously white wants to do all of it and then here here CaRu plays A6 he loses the game on the spot kbov thought A6 prevents B5 he's not wrong and now he's going to try to play Queen A7 but he forgot about the sacrifice of The Rook Rook A6 it's the most obvious move too like you would think it's the most A6 Rook A6 and the idea is that black is stuck he's going to lose his rook and then he's going to lose all his pawns literally he's going to lose all his pawns I mean you can probably just trade as well and win this end game but oh my God a present vidit aggression pays off and he beats corbo V is now in the hunt he is in the hunt for the gold medal as well at the very least the silver medal crazy stuff is going on now the next round featured M and by the way everybody's making draws like every other player in the event except these guys is like making a draw they're all chasing but then then you got Magnus who comes back from the random drug test and he's playing um Iranian Grandmaster puani who I think is uh young guy maybe in his 20s uh unless I'm completely wrong but I'm pretty sure he is Bishop C4 Magnus has been playing this beginners Sicilian like we tell beginners not to play you know have you've got you guys have all done this you've all done this a lot of you um you learn an opening right you learn the Vienna and then you go this is the Vienna and I'm going to play the Vienna against everything I give I teach you how to hammer a nail so you try to hammer everything okay screws bolts like everything and you say well this is the vi no so you learn the Italian and you think oh I'm playing the Italian what this the Italian right four boom boom boom no Italian is against E5 but it turns out you can do it basically turns out in 2023 you can do whatever you want at any point in chess and it's fine worst comes to worst it's equal and it doesn't really matter because equality is good it it's a good thing in society in economics not like rampant not like not communism you know historically but you but that's not this is not a this is not a you know socioeconomic Channel this is a um anyway castles C3 Knight C6 D5 so what you get when you play chess like this is a game you get a game the computer's like equal doesn't matter the meta in chess used to be you try to get an advantage The Meta now is you just get a position where you are probably going to be more comfortable than your opponent and let me tell you right now you take any chess player on the planet Earth sometimes you can even pair them together and they can't beat Magnus Carlson all right B6 Knight bd2 Knight to B3 Bishop B7 Bishop G5 that just gave me a really good idea aide for a series what if I did like Magnus and a tag team of grand Masters you think Magnus could beat two of the top 10 players in the world at the same time do you think they would be willing to do that is that like a huge ego thing like what if I took two top 10 players and they were on a team and they were playing Magnus I think that would be fascinating he could beat them at the same time Knight E7 Queen E2 I don't think they would do it I think it would be too much of an ego hit Knight F4 big maneuvering game Knight E5 Magnus season control still applying a lot of pressure here Knight D7 is an idea but black is fine black is fine Magnus trades the Queens trades the Queens we're going to a this is this is a very early stage end game it's still I would call this a queenless middle game but magnus's pieces look very nice and he has what the kids call a uh a a rizzler of a of a pawn majority over here Bishop to D5 nobody really knows what rizzler means like this is just the thing that children say Bishop E5 Rook E5 and and still Magnus has a majority so this is probably going to come in handy all right there it is Rook E3 defending his majority maybe he's going to make a couple of tra what the heck just happened whoa whoa whoa well it turns out defending that pawn is really difficult because if you play a move like Rook B7 I play F3 your knight moves and I fork you so instead of that puya runs in and grabs this but Magnus is like bro I am the best endgame player of all time and I am a pawn up and I have two pass pawns do you think my man okay I'm only a pawn up now but it's a really good Pawn do you think I will not be able to beat you I told you a long time ago that Knight is super annoying and Magnus does not rush walks his King forward doesn't even take yo this is really really high level stuff this is really high level stuff Magnus has a free Pawn 100% certified Free Pawn but it's better for him to run the king to help the pawn that is that is that is easy for Magnus to spot that this is the right way to play to give up all of this and just go invest in the pawn but that is brilliant for the average chess fan B6 time is of the essence you have to go defend yourself King C6 and now there's no point trying to sneak in because I go B7 there's no point trying to sneak in because I block you that's the point and I queen would check that is that that is the idea here so takes takes King E7 and that's it the pawn made it because the King was too fast and Magnus Carlson seals the door seals the deal and the most important thing here is there is a universe in which you know if you don't know how to win a rook versus King and pawn endgame you draw it because the king runs up and you make a mistake not here King is just way too close Magnus keeps winning now this is the game to determine who is going to play Magnus who's going to contend versus Magnus for the gold medal the winner of this game we'll probably get gold or silver again you we kind of ruined it but it is what it is D4 D5 vidit versus fetv the match up we've been dreaming of it starts with a semi slav starts with a just a regular Main Line takes takes Bishop D6 critical line black striking back in the center black actually never played the move B5 which is very very provocative so instead we have a massive exchange Queen d8 vidit grabs the pawn fed of grabs it back but vidit enjoys an advantage because of Black's awkward King because of the two Bishops the the Bishops love space now you cannot take this Pawn you take this Pawn I'm going to play Bishop G5 I'm going to force your king out here and black is just too slow black is going to get probably mated but Rook e one Bishop back and now he takes it Bishop B2 and we take on G7 this is the position that we have to work with vidit has the bishop pair and he has three onone traditional logic tells you that vidit is much better and the computer does agree the computer thinks that vidit definitely enjoys a very pleasant Advantage all signs are pointing to vidit grinding down his opponent in this game black plays A5 vidit says no fesa plays Bishop G8 vid brings his King just like Magnus brings his King you can't take because of this so how is f have going to defend this position both guys have five minutes minutes tens of thousands of dollars are on the line an international gold medal is on the line what now Rook to E7 we bring the bishop back very nice idea to put some pressure on this Pawn FV defends it now we attack that pawn so much is at stake right now every piece is interacting with every other piece The Rook goes to B8 now vid says what's a better time to push my Pawn majority than right now so does fedf here's the problem you can't take with the pawn you cannot take with the pawn because you relinquish defense of the Knight and the the bishop you would lose so he has to take with the Rook now his pawns are split now Bishop A4 FV goes for this and tries to get creative but his Advantage is ballooning the advantage is ballooning for vidit who now has a one minute time Advantage where is this Knight going to go I got news for you nowhere it can't move because discover check Rook C4 Bishop B1 the game is over Knight back to E7 vidit Bishop B6 has a completely winning position if he wins this game he is tied with Magnus for the gold medal spot he lost to Magnus but if they tie for first they will play a playoff they will play a blitz playoff to determine the champion of the open rapid championship this is unbelievable stuff vidit is getting it done he is a pawn up now apparently not even the best move apparently Bishop D3 and Bishop A6 is even more ridiculous because he just wins like it's just mate The Rook goes there so Bishop D3 was a little bit better but he grabs a pawn who can blame him Rook to A4 now Rook d8 he plays it he can play Rook D okay he could play Rook D7 Bishop C3 also not so bad but now FV starts consolidating his King crawls back into the ditch grabs the horse says I got you the bishop goes to A2 F of this is a sniper of a move and now vidit also low on time Knight to G6 insane game vid a pawn up E5 he advances the King goes to mess with the Rook again where's The Rook going to go it goes back the bishop goes to D5 the bishop goes to F5 the Knight jumps out to H4 oh my God the stress 20 seconds on the clock fet sa of using his final Pawn to pry the the defens is away from the bishop E6 vidit making a break for it Bishop E5 is Checkmate by the way it's straight up going to lead to a Checkmate somehow but Rook A3 pinning the bishop oh my goodness the king gets out of the way here comes the Knight The King has to guard the bishop Pawn takes G4 and vidit sneaks the pawn forward the only defensive move now is Bishop F7 this Pawn is hanging and the Knight is hanging after that so vid it takes but it's a losing mistake it took vidit 47 moves to make one major error and now there's a check and in the most cruel way possible the white position falls apart the king can now no longer defend the bishop and when the bishop Falls the Knight is protected and the promotion is still stopped vided gujrati all of a sudden is completely losing Rook G3 he he's trying to push his Pawn but there's nothing he can do and apparently we still get back to an equal position we still get back to an equal position King G3 it was it was so many plots to his King G3 Rook H1 it's now back to maybe equal King H4 vidit makes a run for it but that's it that's it his King has been sniped Rook G4 he tries to defend himself but Knight F5 the second piece is lost the pawns are stopped and vidid GTI sat there with his head in his hands and that's chess that's chess for anybody not named Magnus Carlson it has been a decade of fighting for the gold and silver maybe maybe I'm sry the bronze and the silver but vidit was if vidit had won this game he would have been tied with Magnus going into the final game but instead it is fetv who is half a point behind we will take a look at those two matchups because there was absolutely insane stuff going on in the women's section so this is the drama of the day the last round begins in the women's rapid Championship leting from China and Anastasia bodnaruk from Russia are tied for first this is the full game leting offers her opponent a draw on the third move which by the way shouldn't be allowed like I don't even at least move 20 right and even then she offers a draw and they tie for first they tie for first one person can catch them that is Indian grandmas and Legend humpy koru she can catch them in a three-way tie for first she does catch them in a three-way tie for first which means the three of them get gold silver and bronze but they have to play for it except that is not true what well here are the rules in the open section if there is a time for first a playoff shall determine the champion if more than two players are tied look at B1 a knockout tournament will be played but on the women section for whatever reason the playoffs say the top two players by tie breaks what why do they have different rules now of course it's the players's responsibility I'm not saying it but the players should know that and they probably shouldn't make draws in three moves but why why are the rules different be this happened a couple of years ago in the open section when some of the men tied and then they couldn't play for a playoff because only the top two so they changed the rule but they kept it in the women's now who knows I don't know was this agreed upon did all the top women in the world like say yes to this I don't know does Fay talk to the top players to determine the rules I don't know but leting does not get to play in the playoff despite tying for first the playoff is humpy Koro versus Anastasia bodnaruk I think leier will be kicking herself for this decision I don't know I I don't know for how long I I I haven't spoken to her maybe she won't maybe she doesn't care but she gets bronze and this is the gold medal match because they were top two on tie breaks some of you might be wondering how is that even determined it's a couple of different things it's like the sum of your opponent scores which means you played really good players the average rating of your opponents which means you played really good play like there's a couple of things um this is their fourth tiebreak game because the first two they traded blows they each won this is their last tie break game and it was absolutely ridiculous it started with a uh Neo ready that's what it was it was like a ready system white came back from a trade of Queens it's by the way they play Blitz to determine the champion of Rapid because there's no other way to do it I mean they can't like they don't have all day they can't play more I don't know CH breaking ties and chess is not easy it really isn't all right they got to do it some way they they might as well do blitz so the game is a very balanced game it's it's completely symmetrical until the 20th move when black gets her Knight trapped on the edge of the board The Rook is hanging the the the the getaway square is stopped Rook C5 only move the Knight is trapped the only way not to not to have the Knight trapped is to move the bishop to Target the Knight there's also D5 I guess which targets the bishop danger levels you danger level the Knight and then you move the Knight to F4 but what you don't do is this you said danger levels but now you have two hanging pieces humpy Koro is completely winning she grabs a knight now she it's not like hopeless because black is going to get a couple of Pawns here but F4 takes takes King F2 I mean it looks like white should should be completely winning but it's actually a little bit tricky it is surprisingly tricky because of how powerful the bishop is and how powerful The Rook is targeting the king and all of a sudden within a span of a few moves black has a couple of Pawns and it's anything but clear and humpy has 7 seconds she plays King E2 she's trying to trade the Rooks but black is staying active black is zipping in white is up material but it's very difficult to prove Rook D3 trying to trade Rook D2 Rook C1 A5 okay she's making progress now our King's going for a run Rook H3 the king is going for a run the evaluation is building Rook e one king C5 Rook C1 and now humpy had to go here she had to go there pause and do the damage with her Knight instead she runs in with her King and loses her Pawn disaster the bishop is pinned she can't take on B7 so what is she going to do she goes Rook D4 she gets pinned and she loses on time she had two second bonus but she she froze up here she didn't know what to do she couldn't take she couldn't really she didn't really want to do this because if you take you're under severe pressure so Bishop D5 and she froze with 4 seconds on the clock and she didn't make her move in time and she is the silver medalist and Anastasia bodnaruk is the first International Master to ever win the women's world rapid Championship she might be the first I am to win any rapid period by the way which is crazy open or women's and Leia gets bronze after a three move draw that is that is so wild why are the rules different why are the rules different can somebody explain that to me nobody is able to explain that to me I don't get it why do they have different rules anyway here we go if Vladimir FV defeats Demitri andreen he might time Magnus Carlson if Magnus Carlson wins against prananda he wins there is no debate well I got news for you it was a short round it was a short round I think again if fed have plays for a win he might lose so what does he do it's a queen's game but accepted and on the ninth move of the game he offers a draw that's what he does so FV gets nine and a half points a bunch of players have eight and a half they could try to catch fed says you know what I'm good with a draw which is I don't know why they do this but maybe they're smarter than me which means nobody can catch Magnus so around this point magus plays the four nights against Prague under traditional circumstances this is a game that like Prague would be playing for a win but there's no point in getting aggressive because Magnus doesn't even want to play for a win and this is the position after 10 moves Magnus looks over at the other game and goes oh they made a draw so I just have to not lose and that's what he does he plays in a way where he just doesn't lose he trades pieces and this is the position after 23 moves Bishop C7 is a dead draw slightly L uneventful conclusion but that's what happens when you absolutely murder the opposition for the first 12 rounds Magnus Carlson just won his 16th World Championship five in classical five in Rapid and he has six in Blitz and he's going to try to win a seventh this one particularly impressive Magnus has now won the world rapid Championship three out of the last four years um he got Bronze in 2021 because I think of that rule because of that rule cuz it used to be the top two and they changed it and yeah and they just never changed it for the I I don't know I don't know how they do anything I don't know how they make any of their decisions uh what I do know is Magnus won and he didn't just win Magnus had no bad positions in 13 Rounds and if that forecasts anything for the world Blitz Championship which begins tomorrow I think his opposition is pretty fudged fudged they're they're fudged is is is as as as as the kids say um that's all I have for you today congratulations to all of the medalists congratulations to Magnus Carlson Vladimir f Yu yangi now you may wonder why I haven't covered yui's games he drew all four games in the last day there was a lot of draws but Yu yangi oh let me actually show you real quick the standings for the open were crazy how look how many people tied for third Yu yangi vidit Vadar Muran a young man from uh from Russia very good defeated nepo he defeated uh Lon aronian Maxim dubov Prague Demetri andreen Nock it was like a 12-way tie for third but you yangi emerged with the best tie breaks so congratulations to him and on the women's side obviously it was bodnaruk on the S buaro winning the gold medal humpy Koro a heartbreaking defeat for silver and Lings yet gets bronze but I mean if she's I she she must be kicking herself I can't even imagine World Blitz starts tomorrow uh that's all I have for you today I think get out of here
