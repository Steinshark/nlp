- Welcome to the Wild
World of Wii Controllers. That came at me very quick. We've got, ugh, I thought
this was a new item. Look how freaking gross that is. (coughs) Full of cigarettes. (coughs) Didn't know you can still
smoke bowling alleys. Oh, okay. If your fingertips are
too big or too small they've got a bunch of
additional finger tips. It's a little big. - I don't like that noise. - You don't like the
sound of the Wii ball? (scraping noise) Actually, it's kind of a - [Matt] We have to
censor all of that now. - Get your mind out of the gutter. (laughter) - Let's go! Well, that's a simple accessory. If I push buttons on the outside, it just pushes it on the actual remotes. Oh, my ball is pointing. My ball is pointing. This is not ergonomic to use. I will tell you that - [Joanna] Mii Channel? - I did not do that. Oh, you know what? The ball also has a habit
of just rolling around and pressing buttons when you set it down. - [Matt] Yeah, balls roll. - It's just, it's just pressing
different things right now. Okay, so I need to use, oh, okay, immediately I found a problem. The D-pad to actually adjust
is over on the top, which means that you are really extending out, like I feel like I'm gonna
get like a cramp or something. Cause it's a lot of
weight that you have to kind of hold and then you're pushing down (video game character yelling) - [Matt] (laughs) - [Joanna] Is it that heavy? Goodness gracious! - It surprised me! When you throw the ball, all
that weight is meant to fly. But when you're still holding it, I'm like I feel a lot of tension here
in like, sort of my wrist which does not feel great. I'm gonna say that while
you're almost certainly gonna give yourself carpal tunnel, thumbs up on the Wii bowling ball. Next up we have - [Matt] This is practice. Something so upsetting about this coming in a vacuum sealed plastic bag. - I feel like I'm not in
on the joke right now. - [Matt] You never are. - Is this a baby? Is this the baby from the This Is? - [Matt] Let's go! Wait, what baby from This Is? - [Austin] We did this
on an episode of This Is, when we did some of the weird controllers. - [Matt] Oh yeah. I don't watch our content. - It's the baby. It's so cute. And it has a hole for a Wii Remote. Oh no, I don't like this. Who thought this was a good idea? - [Joanna] From the
bright minds that brought you brought you Cooking Mama? - Wait, was it Cooking Baby? (laughs) - [Joanna] No, oh my God. - [Matt] No, that's the DLC. - [Joanna] No, it's Babysitting Mama. Oh my God. - [Austin] (laughs) I meant it like you're like
a baby and you're cooking. - [Joanna] That still makes no sense. (laughs) - And that's all you
get, your home button. - [Matt] Just point the baby butt at the - [Austin] It doesn't go through the butt! I gotta take it out. You gotta launch the game before you put the remote in the baby. (all laugh) - This is not right. This is not This is not right. Babysitting, babysitters guide, memories, options, versus play. I'm gonna do babysitting. - [Matt] What is versus? - Who's got the cooler baby? You don't do that, Matt? - [Matt] Oh my God. - [Austin] Okay, I gotta take learn how to take care of a baby. What do I do? Oh, okay, okay. Okay, what, what was going,
what am I doing wrong? - [Joanna] He's learning a lot. - [Matt] This is where we learn that Austin's a horrible father. Careful, one more strike
and they're calling Child Protective Services. - Milk! Milk! He needs some milk. Ah, don't get angry. Don't spit up! Don't spit up! - [Matt] You're burpin' him next. - Yeah, let's go. Yeah, let's go. Sorry. I just, I just don't
like any part of this. I don't like the fact that
you've got some cyborg baby with a Wii remote sticking out his back. Thumbs down. Thumbs down. The double thumbs down. - [Joanna] Are you going to, you know, yeet this one like you do
all the other packages? - No. I will gently give it to
Matt so he can deal with it. Cause my turn's over. Matt - - [Joanna] You're the proud new owner. - [Austin] Don't shake the baby. ("yeet" background noise) (explosion sounds) - [Austin] Wow. - [Joanna] No! - [Austin] Cold-hearted. Are these just boxing gloves? But wait. Oh my. (laughter) So this one clearly seems like where you're supposed to put the Wii remote. Won't get it in there. Okay, here it comes. Oh, I don't like this Bro, this thing's in there so tight! So I have my, Wii remote on the outside which I will say makes
my fist feel very stiff. Creator Clash, here I come! All right, here we go. - [Matt] You're a little, you're a little out of breath there buddy. - [Austin] Actually kind of fun! Why are my hands literally
not in the right, my right hand is like way above. - [Joanna] Oh, the, this music. Let's go. (video game music plays) - [Matt] Are they gonna copyright this? - [Joanna] No, it's fine. - [Austin] The gloves
actually work pretty well. Certainly feels better than just taking the Wii and the nunchuck. Now gimme five minutes to
get out of the ring here. - [Matt] You seem pretty out
of breath after doing that. - [Austin] No. - [Matt] Let's do something
a little bit more your speed. - [Austin] Okay. What is this? (laughs) The fishing, wait, it comes with the Wii remote and
nunchuck and everything? Oh, what a deal! Have either of you guys ever been fishing? - [Matt and Joanna] Yeah. - [Austin] Okay, good. - [Joanna] Have you? - [Austin] I have two
fishing trophies from when I was a child. - [Joanna] Oh, wow. - [Austin's Mother] Go Austin, go! - [Austin] I caught the most
fish when I was six or seven, and then I caught the biggest fish when I was like eight or nine. Got the trophies. - [Matt] I feel like
I'm very quickly being encased in boxes over here. - [Austin] It does look like you got a lot of Wii accessories. - [Matt] Oh, this video's just
getting started my friend. - [Austin] So I'm gonna
insert my Wii remote in. Wait. Ohhhh, wow, that feels terrible. Try it. - [Female Video Game Voice] Miss! - [Austin] What do you mean miss? Let's move on even
though you failed to cast correctly after three attempts. - [Joanna] It got
sick of waiting on you. - [Austin] Okay, yeah, I'm done with this. This sucks. If you've got the patience, maybe. - [Matt] What happened to, "I have a bunch of fishing trophies?" - [Austin] Sometimes
they're not biting, Matt! It's called fishing, not catching. - [Matt] That, that was weirdly poetic. - [Austin] I've gotta
give this a thumbs down. It works okay, but it seems
needlessly complicated and also not that accurate. Also, it's not that much fun. Sorry. - [Matt] All right, so
fishing wasn't your game. Maybe hunting would be better. - [Austin] Chicken Shoot. Wait, this is your game? - [Joanna] Yes, the game of my people. - [Matt] Yikes. - [Austin] Well, okay then. What accessory do I
need for Chicken Shoot? Is it a Wii - - [Matt] Okay. - [Austin] A crossbow. Not a word I can't say on YouTube to get demonetized, a crossbow. - [Matt] I believe it's
officially the zapper. - [Austin] Zapper, I can say zapper. - [Matt] And if I remember correctly this one had a bunch of
channels to run all the cables. - [Austin] Oh yeah, you're right. This whole thing opens on the bottom. I can run my cables. Ah, look at that. This was actually designed
by people who care. Sorry, where were we at? Okay, this is designed by Nintendo. Let's not go that far. - [Joanna] Okay, my dad bought me this game, so say nice things. - [Matt] Why is it using a Glock? - [Austin] I'm zapping 'em. - [Matt] What is that thing in the bottom? - [Austin] It's a minion. A-ha, I got it!   I'm shooting planes down, I mean, zapping planes down. - [Matt] Okay, dude over here
trying to (bleep sound) thing. - [Austin] Okay. - [Joanna] Okay. - [Austin] Let's try a different game. I think it's the time that we
move over to a different game. All right, let's try the zapper and Link's Crossbow Training. Well, I will immediately say
this looks nice for a Wii game. I'm actually feel okay about this. This is not bad. Oh, I can zoom. Oh, that's helped. Okay. This is actually kinda fun. There's a lot of latency,
but honestly it's it's still like fun enough. Oh, my target score was 20,000. I got 4,000. - [Matt] (laughs) - [Joanna] Wow. - [Austin] I thought I did good. - [Matt] Uh oh, there's a skeleton. - [Austin] My years of arcade
target practice is helpful. Ah, why am I turning? Turn, turn. Link, What are you doing? What are you doing? Turn! Ah! Why? Why am I turning?! Bro! I'm not even doing anything! - [Matt] I don't think you're
gonna make that target score. - [Austin] I'm gonna still
give the zapper a thumbs up because this is definitely
the most high quality accessory I've tried today. But boy, I appreciate modern
technology so much more now. Next we've got the
wonder stick for my Wii. Well the good thing is
it's completely portable. I can take it apart and take it with me. Never leave home without
your wonder stick. That's what my dad always told me. I appreciate, though, that this is a relic of a different age, it's still completely sealed in the box. This doesn't feel like a pool cue. This feels like a big wand. Wingardium Leviosa! Okay. - [Matt] Mike! - [Kinsey] (high-pitched laughter) - [Matt] Mike! - I have no idea how I'm playing, so - [Kinsey] Uh oh. - [Matt] Oh no, - [Kinsey] Uh oh. - [Matt] Oh. - [Austin] Oh. - [Matt] Really got ahold of that one. - [Austin] Oh God, this is terrible. Did people actually pay money for this? - [Matt] Well, we did. We paid $50 for this. And also it is known
for blocking the censor. - Yeah, about to say, you know being able to use it for the game. Thumbs down on the Wonder Stick. - [Joanna] (laughs) - [Austin] That's heavy. That was really heavy. Okay, okay, okay. Let's see what we got next. This is awesome! It's a real go-kart for Mario Kart?! - [Matt] Well, sort of. - [Austin] It apparently supports up to 250 pounds and can
be used for all ages. - [Joanna] You
know, that was my game. Thanks Matt. - [Austin] Let's blow the cart up. - [Joanna] Okay. - [Austin] Oh god. - I'm gonna take off
my shoes for this one. - [Matt] It sounds awful. - I'm gonna be Luigi, the correct option. - [Luigi] Yeah, ho! - [Matt] (laughs) - [Joanna] You might want to go. - [Austin] Oh, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, ah, no, no, no. Hold on, hold on, it actually reversed. Hold on, hold on, - [Joanna] Not there, but - [Austin] Hold up. I gotta, I gotta flip this thing around. All right. We're finally up and running. I'm being lapped somehow. Dude, you have to turn this so much. - [Joanna] I mean that's just, that's just how it goes
in Mario Kart Wii, okay. - [Austin] This does not feel
like it's designed for adults. I'm just gonna say that right now. Does anyone else wanna try this? This is very frustrating. - [Kinsey] Okay, alright, alright. Let me, let me uh, - [Austin] It does say for all ages. - [Kinsey] Let me get into compact mode. - (laughter) - [Kinsey] Just perfectly guys. I just gotta go like that. Oh my God, no, this
steering is so, this is so it's not responsive like at all. - [Austin] This seems like a cool idea but I think it'd be better
just to do it like this. - [Joanna] You mean
like the Nintendo Wheel controller they, you know, - [Austin] Yeah! - [Joanna] made for this game?
