I love Randy what's going on boys I'm gonna make a complete game start to finish let's go Randy that's right absolutely nothing look let's go Randy these are gonna take a while sir step number one boot open text editor of choice step two give Jay blow some sloppy toppy and get added to the closed beta of his new programming language nice he's gonna do Jai look at it go he got he has a zip file wait if I were to do Jai myself because I actually emailed to be a part of this the whole Jai thing does that mean I have to use Windows is this Windows is this Windows like three Windows 95 I can't tell three spin up a cheeky little hello world okay yeah profit I may or may not have weighed a little bit when I said from scratch Jenny's already got a lovely Smorgasbord of modules in here ready to use I'll take a free lunch when it's given to me another day passes without me having a touch to win32 it's a good day let's try to first start off game programming and it would take to just have a corn flower blue the classic cornflower blue like Graphics window up and running it was like 400 lines of code I had no idea what the hell was happening I was copying and pasting it the amount of capital letters in DirectX it should be a crime the amount of capital letters in DirectX should be punishable I'm not sure by what I feel like I I feel like the only reasonable like punishment would be if Linus got to walk up to Bill Gates and and full hand not full not for not not open hand not on this side but backhand you know just a little bit of backhand throw the baby powder on there and give Bill Gates the biggest backhand slap of his lifetime you know it's insulting it's not painful it's not like he's gonna have to go to the hospital afterwards but he does get a backhand slap with the baby powder that's what he deserves for how many capital letters are involved in DirectX it is just the worst thing ever okay it's just the worst thing ever it's just the worst thing ever gotta get some graphics going in this bad boy there's already a module in here called okay sounds just that but I ain't no Shimp somebody's [ __ ] I'm gonna [ __ ] do it anyway now I've already used d3d11 in the past and I've done my time with her pengu so I should be a piece of piece you've gone on one of yourself check the resources in the description okay hold on time out what the hell is a piss a piss can we go back here now I've already used d3d11 in the past and I've done my time with her pengal so I should be a piece of piss a piece of damn it I missed it again somehow I I'm just not fast enough you piece of piece ah a task that is considered easy generally this is a term used in Australia do you think you can finish six Piers before they close the puff a piece of piss mate no worries I've never heard the term a piece of piss what is Randy Australian or something honestly I I always I I always thought Randy was just from Nebraska go on one of yourself check the resources in the description highly recommend everybody say hello to hello triangle now we just slap two of those bad boys together and got ourselves a quad use that example into a texture and we've got ourselves a little dude each product he just skipped so many steps right there that he's already so much better at game programming than I have ever been in my lifetime just that just that just that small little tiniest little Skip and I'm just like I don't know how that just happened he lost me I would at first means like Triangle Square I was like I got that now we got some UV let's hit him some textures and boom I have no idea what else just happened my best hits real killing in clutch here next up we just drop him into the world with this formula and my patented extremely sophisticated high-tech Collision resolution algorithm yeah right there is physics look at that that is nice man I finally figured out how textures work properly and I've got my own renderer working with them and all these kind of good [ __ ] and whole rewarding essentially was free which is right here that's the entire thing not bad holy [ __ ] what are we watching next stop I'm gonna work on font rendering why can we just take a moment here and just wondering just I just have to ask the question what is juicing the camera okay how can we did I'll come he hasn't talked about juicing the camera yet okay I want to know about juicing the camera I want a little ogre boss demo I want a little ogre polish a little game menu get little ogre in there I like how it starts with little ogre in there ogre boss demo ogre polish like look at that that's already a whole timeline of things to do right there and we all know you don't just polish an ogre okay One does not simply polish an ogre easily all right it just doesn't work that it just it doesn't work that way okay anyways doing font rendering the world's worst activity ever am I not just sharing my screen and pointing my phone at the computer I don't know Best of Both Worlds boys all right yeah yeah [ __ ] seat down there now this is actually going to be surprisingly easy and even though I'm not using simp because I'm not a simp it's actually really well modularized so I can just use the font section of it I'm already using the bitmap section of it so I can just piggyback off the phone stove slap in my rendering solution and then we have thanks for Android balls why does this look so easy why is this so easy why does this look nothing like my game programming okay it's oh it's editing is it Jai or is it what is it because Randy's awesome what's what's the reason the Witcher 3 balls deep what is it as as is the Jai standard uh framework because Randy is the goat Randy is the goat last vid one year ago no no this guy is this guy is the best YouTube Creator on the internet did you know that Randy I I'm gonna be real with you for a second I want you to zoom in if flip if you're editing this video I want you to zoom in maybe play some gentle music something with the piano something that kind of really brings in the emotional feels maybe turn down the lights a little bit light a little scented candle really just you know enhances the atmosphere here build okay you got that uh I know most people call you flip I call you build okay it's a Time past time immemorial okay um here's the deal Randy I'd just like to let you know yep keep zooming keep zooming Flip Flip you guys you got a zoom flip okay Zoom it in flip Randy um here's the deal that when I started off making YouTube videos you know who what my number one inspiration was you guessed it the tech lead uh but you know who number two was a very close number two Randy Randy was Randy was by far the greatest second inspiration in my life and I just wanted to let you know Randy appreciate you this video is amazing you've already made a video more entertaining than anything I've ever made in my lifetime who does number two work for he works for himself okay he works for himself so what's really cool about everything that I just did is that I've now got the building blocks to be able to make absolutely anything for example you when someone says that I have the building blocks to make absolutely anything it really means I have currently made something in which when I make something it will still take an incredible amount of time I have a I have a lot of building blocks and they always take forever a lot of building blocks one moment please beat this [ __ ] wow what's this strange looking pile of things it's telling me to press X oh now I may or may not have lied when I said that all the foundation pieces were complete um [Music] every time every single time no matter what you build it is this this is the story this is the story right here in fact this needs to be the box art to this video flip hey flip can you can you can you flip can you zoom in can you zoom in on that guy Flip Flip and flip can you zoom in on him box art people let's box art flip build I forgot about one very crucial piece of the puzzle sound so I've been hard at work plowing through some resources scouring the internet going on various forms and Discord servers and trying to figure out how the [ __ ] do I tackle this whole audience and it's actually surprisingly easy as always handmade hero excellent starting point I just plowed through this it gives good fundamentals and all that kind of stuff I use Circle audio to get access to the sound bumper so I could read some [ __ ] into it starting out with a basic sine wave at 40 Hertz you know I I recently had to do a little bit of audio also driver and it was on a small device and let me tell you uh nothing makes you feel more inadequate than playing with a sound driver you know what I mean I'm gonna turn it down now I just happen to pause it at the best time I literally have never felt more inadequate try to play with the sound driver you know how many times I overflowed a buffer under flow to buffer not a buffer forgot to initialize the zero value and see yeah pretty much everything that I've done incorrectly I did it all while trying to make audio work uh did you use rust no I used c a real man's language okay okay that easy see not C plus plus okay we're not weak around here not Zig oh I need someone to hold my hand when something might be null or undefined values being zero value no I used C and I did what all real men do I cried in the evening due to the bugs I could not figure out do to see okay that's how you really do it and if you think it's any other way you just don't even know that's fact of life okay so apparently it's gonna get really loud so I turned down the volume a little bit base warning [Music] and now that sounds working time to try loading a web file from disk that is a very valuable lesson here that was pretty good [Music] yeah classic cool it turns out that collection is kind of easy playing two sounds just as easy you just like literally plus the samples together but now you've got a combined sound I'm not gonna go over classic superposition when you think about it you know it's classic I also like the fact that he wasn't using us everybody knows that a lot of sound drivers takes in two byte two bite samples everybody knows that the one over forty eight thousand those those one one of those those samples two bites everyone knows that what's he doing tossing in the wrong unit like that does he even know what he's doing no he doesn't but how I need this actually actually he does he's actually really good works because I'm just gonna do a second rage job explaining it so if you actually want to learn check the resources in the description so for example if I hit this button it's gonna spawn a new instance of a sound and play it I just did a sound mixer so I'm just sitting down for work today we'll see where the wind takes us okay I like that he's shirtless [Applause] [Laughter] okay I just don't get it I just don't get it I just don't get it got hit with another got hit with the Nightcore the tempo of that video is great dude Randy is just the best he's the best he's literally the best on YouTube right now I don't think there is a better Tech developer on the internet I actually think he's better than Michael Reeves yeah I said that I think he's better than Michael Reeves yeah you watch your videos that went alone 100 yeah I said that I said that who's Michael Reeves you'll shut your dirty mouth Warren buffering okay you'll go buffer up some tunes Michael Reeves tunes that is go watch him come back okay I consider you better than Michael Reeves I'm not better than Michael Reeves Michael Reeves is a a second to Randy in storytelling second okay what about Sebastian what about Sebastian not a Randy I'll tell you that much uh even better than Chris even better than krazam though I do love krazam a lot all right the name is I'm a big fan of Randy again flip zoom in right on the eyes right here yeah closer no closer the name is the primogen
