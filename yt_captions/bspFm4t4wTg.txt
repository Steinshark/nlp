we're living in a golden age of Cinema cameras where the differences between top and Hollywood cameras and the systems available to Independent creators are getting smaller and smaller every year now with cameras like the Sony FX line or the Canon C line or the pocket cameras from Blackmagic or any of the other options out there smaller creators can get their hands on high-end camera bodies that aren't exactly cheap but at least they're not going to cost you the same as a down payment on a house but once you get that camera body you're only part of the way to getting the most out of it apart from the camera and lens there are some key accessories that I found over the years seriously expand the capabilities of your camera rig and that's what we're going to talk about in today's video four accessories that will help you turn your camera body into a super powerful documentary shooting rig at the end I'll give my opinion on which one I think is the most important where I'd start on a limited budget and as a bonus I'm going to share my favorite very cheap trick for mounting audio accessories to my rig that I use on every single shoot okay let's get into it [Music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is Luke Forsyth and on this channel I teach the skills I've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer that sounds like something you're into make sure to hit the Subscribe button because I post new videos every week it's kind of hard to know sometimes what qualifies as a cinema camera these days and before I get into my favorite accessories I also want to take a second to clarify what I mean when I talk about a camera rig versus just a camera for me personally a camera doesn't become a real rig until you can get it up onto your shoulder and keep it there now I like shooting from the hip or the chest as much as the next person but in my opinion you always get the best results from shooting up here on the shoulder it's more stable and the movement you get is more fluid than when you're holding it with just your hands you can get amazing results shooting in a lot of different ways but when I say a camera rig it means something that at least can be shoulder operated doesn't mean that you can't still shoot from the hip when the scene calls for it or hold it out in front of you I shoot my fx9 in all three positions but if you can't camera onto your shoulder at all it's going to limit your shooting style try filming for an hour straight with a 20 pound camera held out in front of you like this tell me how long it takes for your arms to start going numb I regularly have to operate on interviews that can easily go twice that long and I wouldn't want to have to do that from here with a shoulder mounted camera you'll definitely still get tired but you can generally keep it in position for a lot longer my main camera is this the Sony fx9 but no matter what the job is I always rig it in pretty much the same way even if I turn up to a job and they want me to shoot on a different kind of camera I can use the same accessories none of this stuff is camera specific so what are they my fx9 has an amazing 6K full-frame sensor that shoots log footage with crazy dynamic range and having resolution like that is great but it creates a problem because if your shots are out of focus even by a little bit it's super obvious and the shots are pretty much unusable in my opinion 1080 used to be a bit forgiving if you were off by a little bit but these days you 100 need to nail your focus every time but for some reason the monitor that ships with the camera is about two inches wide and even with the peaking turned up to Max I'm never quite sure that I'm focused on the right thing when shooting wide open Sony also includes this cheap plasticky Loop thing that makes it a little bit easier to see but the design is a little chunky and it feels really cheap for a camera that's worth more than my car that's why I always ditch the stock Monitor and replace it with this thing which is a small HD 502 ultra bright monitor I've had this thing for years now and I think it's been obsoleted by the 503 but this one is still working great and I don't really see a reason to change it now it's a lightweight five-inch screen with false color histograms Lut support and all the other bells and whistles you could ever need but most importantly for me it's really sharp and the focus peaking helps me to nail the focus every time now this monitor isn't cheap and the new model costs around 1700 bucks before tax so it's not a small investment by any means especially when there are a lot of other companies out there like Andy cine or Lilliput or Porky's or whatever putting out similarly size monitors for just a few hundred dollars but trust me not all monitors are created equal and there's a reason this one costs as much as it does I recently bought a seven inch Andy Cindy monitor for my fx3 because I was having such a hard time focusing with the stock Monitor and decided to save some money by going with the cheaper one but even though the screen is big enough and bright enough and it might work well for basic Framing and reference as a working Focus monitor it's pretty bad I tried a bunch of settings with the focus peaking and I've never been able to find a configuration that I actually feel confident in and as soon as I tried it out I regretted not waiting until I could afford a better one this isn't an ad for small HD and they're not paying me anything and there are other brands like TV logic is also really good that can make a great monitor but this one has been amazing for me and so it's the one I'm going to recommend the motto of this channel will always be to get what you can afford and use it and I don't want anyone to think they need a two thousand dollar monitor before they can tell a story but if you can swing it the better monitor is absolutely worth the money in my opinion and a monitor should last across multiple camera systems so getting one with decent build quality will probably save you money in the long run these small HDs are tough and light and they just work so they'd probably be my first choice but like I said I've also used ones from TV logic that work well I'll link to both in the description if these monitors seem outrageously expensive there are tons of budget manufacturers out there but I'll be honest like I said I haven't had the greatest experience with those I tried out the one from Andy cine that I mentioned this summer and it was so hard to use that I eventually stopped using it entirely so this is one accessory for me where the extra money does make a difference I've had this small HD monitor for almost six years now so for me it's totally been worth it most external monitors these days can run off batteries like the Canon LP or the Sony npfs but unless you get really big ones they tend to run out of power quickly and once you put a giant npf battery on the back of the monitor things start to get really heavy and unbalanced with that in mind the next accessory I'd add to my rig solves this problem by adding ton of power options while also helping to balance the camera for steadier shots I'm talking about batteries the stock batteries that came with my fx9 are decent and actually last quite a while but what I really needed out of a battery was the ability to power external accessories and for that you need either v-mounts or gold mounts because they have these things DTaP ports DTaP ports sometimes called Pita ports are standardized ports that you can power a ton of different things with like monitors or evfs or Wireless Systems like the teradek the only real difference between v-mount and gold Mount is the shape of the connection like you can see this one is shaped like a little V and you could really just pick whichever one you like it won't make any difference to the size of the battery a lot of people say gold mounts are sturdier connections and less likely to fall off but v-mounts are slightly faster and easier to pop on and off I personally went with v-mounts and I haven't ever had one fall off but do your own research and pick whichever one you feel most comfortable with just be consistent and stick with one connection and they'll power both your camera and external monitor for hours on top of that Cinema rigs have a tendency to be be really front heavy especially once you start editing monitors and big lenses and it can get actually really hard to hold it steady over a long day by putting a v-mount or gold Mount system on your rig it actually adds a little weight which is a good thing it shifts the balance point of the camera backwards so it doesn't tip forward so much it can take a huge relief on your wrist and make for steadier shots all around so that's an added bonus lastly you can use them to power other things than your camera a lot of lights like any of aperture's popular ones like the 300D or 120d or my westcod Flex panels can run on wall power or v-mount batteries you can power a ton of other things with them too like directors monitors or audio gear the ones I have also have a USB port so I can use them to power a Stills camera or a GoPro or even just to recharge my phone they'll power recharge almost anything in my kit and I've used them on every shoot I've been on for the last five years just pick either v-mount or gold Mount and stick with them and you'll never run out of power again you can get these batteries in a bunch of different capacities and some of them are massive but if you plan on shooting documentaries and think you might need to take them on a plane one day make sure you stick to ones that are under 98 Watt hours they don't get blocked by Customs I use idx 98s as my main battery and I love them but there are a lot of other manufacturers once you get up to about six to eight of them you can power pretty much anything you need and not worry about running out even on those massively long shoot days to get them running on most camera systems you'll need some sort of battery plate adapter as well there are a bunch of options out there I personally use this one from shape that mounts directly to the back of my camera but I know wooden camera also makes a good one and I'm sure there are a lot of other brands that will work for you too you'll also most likely need a dummy DTaP power adapter to power your monitor all of these extras not to mention the hard cost of the batteries add up fast but the sooner you get all your gear running from the same battery type the easier will be to keep everything charged and working at the end of a shoot but even with bigger batteries on the back of your rig with a monitor lens and shotgun mic all pointing forwards odds are it's still going to be front heavy to keep things steady and secure the third accessory I'd consider a must-have is some sort of grip I personally think these shape arms are the best engineered handles out there and the way they adjust with just a push of a button is so much better than anything else I found the fx9 does ship with its own handle and grip but it's way harder to adjust than the shape ones you have to unscrew and twist these knobs and tighten them every time and when you're holding the camera it's not very easy to do compare that to the shape which is just push and turn and over the course of the day changing shooting positions and moving the handle so you can put the camera down on the ground that's going to save you a ton of time and fiddling around might cost you the shot or your sanity [Music] the downside of these is that they're both expensive and heavy but for the build quality and ease of use I'd say they're worth it this is another item that I've had across three camera systems so far and I'm pretty sure it's going to be working well after I've stopped shooting it's so over engineered I actually had a custom sky at the airport try and take it from me once because he was concerned it could be used as a weapon so you can be confident it's not going to break on you you'll also need a rosette mounting Point somewhere to attach this thing to your rig the fx9 has one built right into the body but most other cameras you might need to add these with either a VCT base plate or a cage or maybe a rail mounted rosette just go on b h and search for the name of your camera plus Rose that you'll see a ton of options at all different price ranges while we're on the topic of ways to hold your camera the fourth thing on this list is in the same category and that's the top handle there's nothing wrong with the top handle that comes with most Cinema cameras these days but for me there are a few good reasons to switch it out for a third-party one like this the first for me is because it makes it so much easier to mount my monitor by adding the ability to clamp onto a 15 millimeter rail I can just use this lightweight rod and NATO rail thing made by wooden camera stick the rod into the handle clamp it down and it stays put some high-end Cinema cameras have stock handles that allow this but a lot don't the second reason is because it makes your camera more durable and less susceptible to rain and water damage the top handles on most Cinema cameras are connected to the camera with an electronic connection but they're not usually that well weather sealed once I was shooting a dock about bats in Kenya and I had to wear a hazmat suit while filming I was sweating so much that every time I held my arms at the sides to carry the camera so what would literally pour out the ball bottom of the sleeve and all over the top handle after a couple days of shooting like this my old camera a Sony fs7 shut off and never turned back on I tried three times to get it repaired but it never worked properly again by removing the handle you can seal up the electronic contact point and in my opinion it makes the camera much safer to use in bad weather finally it's just so much easier to take on and off the one I use just attaches to this cheap NATO rail from small rig and when I want to take it off I just twist one knob and it's done to take the handle off the Sony you need an allen key and when you travel as much as I do and you're constantly packing and repacking for flights being able to get this thing off without tools is really convenient the downside is that you need to lose the hot shoe and whatever buttons are built into the stock handle I personally don't use the hot shoe for anything and I never use the top handle record button or Zoom rocker anyways so it wasn't really a big deal for me if you use those lav mics that need a hot shoe connection I could see this being a deal breaker but it hasn't been an issue for me and the strength packability and mounting options of the wooden camera handle are totally worth it there are also other options from small room and other companies that are way cheaper and I'm sure they'll work almost as well so those are the first four accessories I'd get for my camera rig to turn it into a documentary shoulder shooting Beast of all the things I'd probably say to prioritize the monitor first because like I said with resolutions getting higher and higher it is so so so important to nail your focus I also use the false color histograms and waveforms a lot and most of the stock viewfinders just don't compare with features Oh and before I forget the super secret bonus tip for today is also conveniently the cheapest by a long shot when you get to the point when you're shooting docks with a fully built up Cinema rig like this chances are you'll be using lav mics on almost every shoot or maybe even working with a professional sound guy who's going to want to attach mics and time code boxes to your camera there are all kinds of weird brackets and Magic arms out there for this but they just add weight and can be annoyingly expensive luckily there's a hack that weighs next to nothing and doesn't cost much at all and that's velcro I always keep a roll of industrial strength adhesive Velcro on my camera bench and I also like to put it on the back of all my batteries and then also on top of the rig itself then I put the opposite side on all my audio accessories like the backs of labs or time code generators and when I need to use them I just stick them on the back the velcro is easily strong enough to hold them there all day and I've never had to replace it I learned this working from sound guys and a lot of them will put Velcro on anything they might need to attach to a camera in fact it's so common that these time code boxes from tentacle that I use actually ship with the velcro built right into the design just make sure you keep it consistent and put the softer side or the loop side on the camera because you always put the hooks or the hard side on the accessories so get some velcro growing and you'll be able to put audio stuff all over your rig without adding much bulk or weight I'll put a link in the description to the stuff I use but just get one roll and it will last you a very very long time I personally love hacks like this so let me know in the comments what you think of putting velcro all over your rig or if you have any other crazy uses for it that I might not have thought of okay so there are the four first accessories I'd add to my cinema cameras for shoulder rig dock shooting you can absolutely tell an amazing story without a huge shoulder rig and there are lots of situations where you might want to use something much smaller you can get great results with a far smaller build than this but in my experience when you start getting into the world of professional doc shoots most Crews will be using a shoulder rig system of some kind if you're more into making your own passion projects then by all means shoot with whatever works for you but if in the long run you plan to get hired to shoot for a big production company on a high budget dock you might want to think about building up your own rig over time because they're still the industry standard that's it for today's video I hope it was helpful and that it gave you some ideas on how to build out your own dock rig down the road there's no perfect way to do it and let me know if you do things differently down in the comments but after working with dozens of different Crews all around the world I can say that most high-end doc Shooters will use a rig setup that's pretty similar to this one as always build up slowly and remember that story trumps gear but gear still does matter and when you're eventually grown into a rig like this you'll be able to use it on pretty much any documentary shoot out there if you like that video maybe give it a like or think about subscribing to the channel so I know it's working for future videos and if you did like that maybe check out this other video I made about five things filmmakers don't need when they're starting out see ya [Music] [Music]
