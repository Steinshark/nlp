ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the candidates 2024 this is a double round robin 14 Round chess tournament to determine who will play next for the World Chess Championship this is round number three and I'm going to take you through all of the games both on the open side and on the women's side then I will give you an update on the standings and um that's the entire introduction the games were today were Sensational once again they did not fail uh to deliver and if you're watching this video and you are enjoying the Recaps and you'd like to get more into chess with beginner intermediate courses end games middle games tactics any chess opening all my courses are 33% off I will put a link in the description to celebrate uh this incredible tournament my friends we are going to kick things off with the game between narab basov and hikara Nakamura uh Nar basov is from aerb he has half a point out of two he lost the game and he drew and so did hikaro hikaro looking to bounce back after a tough game yesterday against vid gudra who played a brilliant game of chess and Hikaru sits down and plays D4 D5 which is not like really you know a lot of people were wondering what hikaro was going to do if this was 2014 hikaro would have played a Kings Indian defense the problem is that nowadays the Kings Indian defense is a really difficult opening to play as black so instead instead what Hikaru does is he plays D4 D5 which is pretty rare most people are playing Knight F6 and he plays the slav that's interesting the SLO defense is a if you if you look at the database it is not a popular way to play it's just not like it's a big risk you give up a lot of the center to White and you either are going to play Pawn takes or you're going to play the semis slav right you're going to have the the Adidas but not the not the car uh so yeah I mean that's the slav but niot on the third move does what every slav player hates he does what every French defense player hates he trades the pawns he plays C takes D5 and the reason why he did this is because now the position is going to be completely symmetrical so by playing like this he's basically saying I will never lose this game but also by playing like this he says there's like a 98% chance I won't win unless Hikaru has a heart attack and Hikaru plays A6 he does spend a bit of time he does play like this but the truth is you know you know what's the craziest part black can make a draw so easily E3 E6 Bishop D3 Bishop here Bishop here Bishop here take that that wasn't a bishop move but whatever and they make a draw Hikaru plays this in a way where he does get a little bit he he does imbalance the position he does and then he goes here and you'll notice that from the opening Karo was down a lot on time but that was mostly because he was trying to remember the directions to the local pizzeria all right like he wasn't actually thinking much and the truth is that this is just a completely equal position there is no risk involved here at all and I know that I just intro this by saying well the games today were insane yeah except this one and um the pieces all get traded off the board and the Queens come off and nothing happens just a whole bunch of nothing just a couple of things to point out black has seven pawns on light squares to counteract White's light Square Bishop that is pretty instructive and uh the players Shuffle they make it what was that like a lot of you are wondering Hikaru just lost why would he not try to beat a guy he out rates by 157 points because it's not that easy like the truth is if Hikaru takes massive risk and loses this game that's a horrendous result so Karu does what he can and when his if if his opponent kills the game there's nothing he can do it's kind of the onus is on the opponent and nadab basov did say after this game he wasn't feeling well I don't know if that's emotionally spiritually uh physically but I hope he's okay and you know hikaro winning with black against the lowest seed is possible but n did a very similar thing against nepo a couple rounds ago so hikaro is going to have to wait to get on the board I mean if this is the way niot wants to play in this event that that's going to be tough to beat he's going to be forcing the uh the players to take a lot of risk now this game oh this game's a banger these guys both won so they both won yesterday they're tied for first it's only the second round but you know this is round three they both have one and a half and this one gets really spicy early we have a Catalan we have a slightly different move order we have instead of Knight F3 and nepo does not play some some he plays C5 which is a very very forcing way to play he plays this way which you know it white is supposed to be a little bit better after cd5 ed5 which must have really been surprising for uh gesh because generally the pawn takes and you block no no no Knight takes D5 and uh that is why gukesh spent 7 Minutes developing his Knight it's not that he forgot how to move the Knight it's that this is a massive surprise from nepo who then proceeds to be up 15 minutes on move seven so a massive surprise everything gcash prepared completely out the window he's got to improvise but the good thing is he has 100 minutes so he goes nepo goes Bishop C5 and castles and by the time gash gets to this position he spends another 18 minutes remembering how to push a pawn which is by the way why chess will absolutely never get on television in this format but that's another thing I'm not blaming gkes is playing within the realm of the format um if we want chess on TV with like big sponsor like I'm just I'm just telling you right now like I I I does anybody watch these games like does anybody sit there glued to their screen for 18 minutes cuz I don't do that that I walk my dog I come home one move gets made anyway E4 now this position is according to the engine deemed equal it's never equal it just never feels that way and gukesh keeps the Queens out of staring contest slowly improves his position right kicks this Knight out kicks that Knight out backs up and defends his pawn and he's just better I mean you talk about a better position for white more space strong activity all the pieces coordinated and now Yan does what Yan does in this position nepo starts doing the nepo which is play Fast play Fast put pressure on the opponent you'll notice right five minutes now GES Bishop F1 Knight comes back to D6 and gukesh very nice idea here it's very difficult in chess to make progress in a game by trading pieces he trades the Knight because it removes an active piece from Black's position and that piece is is a problem but look how much time gukesh spent 20 minutes 20 minutes it is the 20th move gukesh has 30 minutes to make 20 moves Bishop E3 down to 30 nepo quick A6 kicks out the bishop not even the best move by the way right might be but I think plays B5 right he's playing intuitively he's taking space but those pawns could be weak Knight C5 taking advantage of the weaken Square now Rook d8 Nowa playing quick every move two to three minutes building that time Advantage gkes trades the Rooks he's slightly better Rook C1 he's just slowly improving King F2 now 21 minutes on the clock for gukesh now Jan gets rid of the Knight he decides to give up the bishop and gives gukesh the bishop pair plays Bishop B7 gues plays King up rook here but kukes all of a sudden might have a winning position and this computer doesn't even realize it in this position white can play A4 this is a brilliant concept the idea of A4 is to sacrifice a pawn and go Bishop here and this is a very difficult position to defend this black black can play Rook D6 all right but slowly what I'm going to do is I'm going to push the Rook back and then I'm going to play moves like F5 and I'm going to put some pressure and on a high depth the engine does EV value this position as much better for white right now it doesn't but this stockfish is not as strong as one of a higher depth and that stockfish really liked the idea of A4 Bishop C4 it really liked this concept there's other Concepts as well but it really liked Bishop C4 now again to the human eye it it it it's not that playable which is why in this position gcash did not go for that and instead traded the pieces and he's still a little a little bit better but the guys oh and here's something really idiotic happened I just want to just say um so in this position gukesh got his extra 30 minutes but it's move 39 so somebody set the clock's wrong so the the the people there set the clocks wrong like white is supposed to make their 40th move and get the extra time not 39th this is the 39th move white got extra 30 minutes so they set the clock wrong sick uh but the players AG with draw crisis averted lukash had a chance maybe to put some pressure but the game ultimately ends uh in a draw Now to pop on over women's side tanong two for two she won her first two rounds doesn't get any better than that humpy Koro right from India as well uh playing uh some sort of Catalan setup black playing in a similar way to to over here right this sort of concept with these two pawns see openings are overlapping uh but this one a little bit different here black takes the entire Center and this this opening is actually a grun field defense but in Reverse you don't have to know that it's not going to be on the test white applies a lot of pressure and does in fact bulldoze into the position but part of me here sort of feels like they just played a lot of theory and what ultimately happens is white is a pawn up but black has the activity look at Tong's time 40 minute time Advantage with black 50 minute time Advantage but this is the there's no way to get out Bishop H G5 just F6 nice idea by white to find Rook C1 if you take the bishop I take your bishop and uh yeah this game tan literally did not think she just played literally all her prep and they made a draw she started the game with 130 and ended the game with 135 I mean what a flex now you didn't win she just played everything she knew like she literally memorized this game before it happened I mean you talk about you play 30 moves that were just like well if my opponent plays like this I can't win but I also don't lose so tanr on Two and a Half all right that was a quick one obviously not a huge amount happened there now Ali Resa fua and uh Fabiano Carana put on put on quite a game and then obviously we have uh we have a series of games after that and we will end with uh vidit and uh Prague they put on a show uh first let's quickly pop in on L J versus Alexander good uh half a point for Lei GK with one and a half she's in clear second we have an Italian and this one and Evans Gambit Evans Gambit in the candidates this is the good stuff this is the good stuff Bishop takes B4 very very common Gambit right this is this is super rare to see stuff like this Kachina brings the bishop back to E7 she's not spending any time so clearly the surprise factor is not really there she obviously knows what she's doing she plays in a super solid way uh doesn't lose her Knight on the edge of the board both players bust out a bunch of opening moves that they know Ling not even thinking not even thinking gets the queen back to C2 still not thinking Knight to G4 finally white is thinking Pawn to H3 uh gacha surprised in the opening 35 minutes down on the clock right this is what we are seeing in the in the candidates like uh very frequently from all these players is they will frequently surprise each other and get into uh these crazy kind of offbeat openings but then they stabilize and the thing is they have enough time but leting put a lot of pressure put pressure on the queen side push Black's pieces back Gino was down a lot on time Bishop F1 Knight D4 now pressure on the queen side pressure on this Pawn a lot of pressure from Ling yeah but a well time just A6 holding it together and Bishop F6 creating some counterplay on the white position and Ling J still trying and she blows open the board pawns are staring pawns are staring at each other Knight is staring at the pawn very cool common collect it just trades the bishop and then just trades the queen and leting tried her best but suddenly you're in an endgame and you got to trade all the pieces off the board Rook B8 Bishop B5 and it all settles with a nice little tactic Rook hits the Knight you're going to lose this and that's it I mean this is just a draw there is no way to lose this unless you hang a knight in one move or somehow you you you you get made if you have brain damage but that's other you know these players just make a draw a good attempt from lingi did show up and play a very very aggressive opening but unfortunately it was not meant to be now fua and Fabiano this one a sicilian Fabiano senses weakness Fabiano senses weakness Ali Resa lost yesterday Fabiano won yesterday Ali Resa Fabiano Fabiano goes for the Sicilian Defense he's looking to put the young man out of his misery he understands 2022 was a bad candidates for fua Fabiano wants to pounce you know what he plays in this position after the Ros Lio plays Knight F6 that is such a sideline now there is an even bigger sideline known as the nimich Sicilian which is bad you won't see it in the candidates but the Knight F6 Rosal Lio is so unpopular like let me tell you in terms of the percent the move Knight F6 is played very very very rarely but it has been played by Carana before he actually has played it uh and he's played oh I'm sorry I'm I'm looking at the database uh he has played it a little bit this move Knight F6 the point is that it just allows E5 like that's just the point like it allows Knight C3 E5 and the Knight has to dance around the board and that's what happens Al Resa plays Knight C3 and now Knight D4 super provocative allowing the pawn to come forward he grabs the bishop enabling his Knight to come to the center alyza goes here and then alyza plays Knight back to C3 and just doesn't allow Fabby to get what he wants and now he takes Fabby out of his comfort zone um super provocative I mean I'm telling you Fabiano taking massive risk that's why it's the name of the recap massive risk here okay uh trying to win the game with black then he plays this move D5 he spends 15 minutes because I think he was trying to understand the difference between these two moves right like I think that was really it he plays D5 now Resa does something funny he spends 33 minutes on this he was not locked in the toilet he could have taken taken or played D4 so he was either calculating to take this way he was probably calculating D4 the concept of which you know this looks really good for white but it's not because of B5 and somehow black has enough counterplay it's completely nuts castles B4 sacrifice the Knight take take Queen C7 bc3 like I'm sure oliv Resa was deep in the calculation here but after D5 ultimately instead of trying to blow up in the center of the board or taking the pawn he takes on pant and just says you know what I'm going to do it like this and play D4 Bishop B7 both guys castle and Ali Reza does not have the bishop pair but he has a little bit more activity this Knight is a little bit stupid and he might be microscopically better he plays Bishop F4 and the idea of Bishop F4 is either black has to block his bishop or black goes here but allows potentially some Big C you know complications potentially the Knight gets to D5 where it could be very strong for the duration of the game so a very big decision and Fabby plays Knight E6 Vin 20 minutes let me tell you something right now you could spend like two years thinking about a position it wouldn't match up to what Fabiano comes up within 20 minutes of calculation I'm not trying to insult you I'm just saying when a guy like Fabiano goes in the tank and calculates bro sees the future like he sees the lottery numbers he Knight E6 deeply calculated the bishop comes back to defend the center and that was done for a reason a deliberate reason but then he went back then he went back and basically he was like this is what I'm going to do now if oi Reser repeats we're going to make a draw like obviously I'm fine with the draw I'm playing Black fine I throw away you know a quick black game but the thing is Ali Resa doesn't have to repeat remember a moment ago the position was this so he he didn't repeat exactly he allowed Oli resa's Bishop to be in the center now Oli res is not dumb he doesn't repeat the position he just makes an improving move he doesn't allow the bishop to pin the Knight and slowly he improves the position now here with Queen D2 Fabby thinks for a long time and like I said when fabbi goes into the tank big things happen he tries to clarify the matters plays D5 all right and the point is that before he takes back he plays C4 this a crazy concept Pawn takes Pawn C4 none of the white pieces can get to that pawn so what's going to happen is he's going to lose the pawn and it's very messy a lot of pieces are staring at each other and actually Fabby just gives up the pawn he's just if you count material Fabiano Carana is just down a pawn what he has for the pawn is active compensation he has the bishop pair so this is White's extra Pawn but he he can't really push it cuz black is going to snipe from the distance with the Rooks and the bishop and that's what this game turns into Bobby ends up winning the pawn in the center for that pawn this is Ali resa's extra pawn and it's completely meaningless now if Fabby were to do this well then you know white has some damage pawns but the more pieces you trade the worse this gets okay and then if you trade too much you trade the Bishops you trade the Rooks you're going to be in a losing end game the evaluation only grows okay so Bishop B6 and Fabby just defends just defends keeps the Bishops and the only way that white wins is by pushing these pawns and he can't he he can't push them you might be wondering like why why can't he just go B4 because A5 and let me tell you you're you're just you can't save this Pawn it's just not savable so he can't push the pawn and despite Fu's best efforts the players end up making a draw so fabbi shows up plays very provocatively fuja kind of calms the whole thing down and he does go up upon but it's crazy you could just be up upon in chess and have absolutely nothing all right so big games big battles this game was crazy so this is Anam musuk versus kater lagno uh this is on the women's candidates Mainline Spanish H3 D3 and black is gambling a pawn so this is the idea to play with the bishop on B7 this is called Marshall style uh Frank Marshall back in the day used to gam at the pawn in the center and the ru Lopez and then get Pawn down compensation again you don't have to know that but now you can win your local trivia Knight and what happens in this one is white doesn't accept the sacrifice and instead goes on and attack all right black defends and we get Knight versus Bishop with attacking chances and also Queen side play muzichuk goes Knight C5 now we have queens and Rooks just the heavy pieces I'm not calling them fat they're just called the heavy pieces now we have some trades all right and here Katerina decides I'm going to get rid of my a pawn I'm going to get rid of my a pawn I don't care if it's Tak taken because it's going to be a weakness but but black does not win the a pawn back and now Anam musuk is on the attack black has to play defense white comes back white is still poking and trying to get into the black position and she does and she does get into the black position but she's not really winning she's not really winning and it might be a draw it might just be a waight a minute wait okay they repeat moves now the setup is Queen F5 and Rook d8 is going to be made and suddenly white is winning Rook d8 white completely gives away the pawn on A5 white hunts the king now white has no time so she repeats the position she repeats the position but two times that looked like it was three but the first time the queen Came From a Distance this is the first time this position has happened second time now white can think look at this she goes from 2 minutes to 31 and the evaluation is completely winning Anam muuk is winning she has 30 minutes to find it it's a 30 it's a chess puzzle 30 minutes to find a win she fails the winning concept was Queen E8 check if the King goes up to G5 you go Queen F7 and it's actually impossible to stop the attack but King f five you have to give this check the king can't come forward because it gets mated so the point is you hunt the king over here you have to bring the queen down to the home Square King C7 leads to a brutal mate but King C5 white has one winning move and the winning move is Rook d8 threatening Queen D4 mate and if black lows let's say queen A4 you have Queen D6 King B5 and the winning move is C4 and then if Queen C4 you have to see Checkmate in 10 with Rook B8 King A6 Queen C7 threatening mates you can give a check I'll go King H2 you can sack The Rook I will take you can give a check and then sacrifice your queen but that is the that is the winning move you have to find Queen E8 check and amuzu thinks for 20 minutes she doesn't find it and the game ends in a draw that's tough that is tough it was basically a chess puzzle but the draws are over Vali ramish Babu by the way some of you in the comments are saying vashali is a grandmas she does have the Norms the three norms and she does have the rating she doesn't have the approval you see the international governing body of the game can't just approve things so because they're I don't know because everything in chess is outdated not modernized doesn't make much sense but the international governing body meets once every 3 four months uh I don't know why they can't meet once a week uh and uh they look at title application so her title application has been submitted but nobody has confirmed it yet so she's a Grandmaster but she's not because they haven't approved it it's kind of like getting a Visa I mean you might meet all the details but if they haven't approved it like so she's technically still an IM am her opponent is just an IM am just very strong but and and plays a petro and Vali in this game plays a very classical way literally it's called classical then she does this and in case you can't tell opposite side castling attacking and everything but what has been played here before is Bishop D3 and then black plays C5 and the players get into a big scrap Bishop D4 has never been played before maybe online but in no serious Master Level game this move is an antidote of this move because you are just going to take the Knight and then take the damn pawn and if this well then black is terrible at chest and should be kicked out of the candidates Bishop D4 the best move here by black is Bishop B6 at which point white would probably make one of these moves King B1 or A3 and then continue to try to create an attack nul it does not react well to the surprise she thinks for 20 minutes 25 and Vali just steps on the gas I mean Vali showed up today like like the devils and Rangers a couple of days ago just fighting on the opening face off like she just wanted to assert dominance of the of the younger players it's 22 and 19 these are the two younger players one of them's got to beat the other Knight G5 H6 and she says take the damn night take the damn night you want it so bad take the damn night this does not look good this looks like an avalanche waiting to happen in these types of positions black has to be faster like that is why the bishop needed to go to E6 nil finds the best move by the way she goes Knight G4 but Vali sacrifices the Knight I mean you got to look at things near the opponent's king that are only protected by the king and that is a gangster move black has to take and it's a roller coaster Bishop C4 a check the King has to go back Queen D3 and who's guarding against the queen and here n officially panics she had to play Bishop F6 Queen H7 and a defense Ive Rook sacrifice would have held together the advantage queen h8 king E7 which is nuts but at Le well excuse me if you don't do that this would have been the defense and this is the game but uh nul plays Bishop G5 and uh vashali doesn't even so this is badass she doesn't even take the bishop she just plays King B1 so she's still threatening this she's still threatening this and nurul has 8 minutes nurul has eight minutes yeah it's it's bad it's very very bad she plays Knight E5 by sh takes and um she sacrifices another bishop and in this position just takes when it's all said and done she has seven pawns and her opponent has four V won this game in 20 moves absolutely dominant win gets a couple of other pieces and uh nil played on for a little bit but this is a completely lost end game and in this position nuril resigned because she is down four pawns and that is generally sufficient at this level to resign not at your level that's just the beginning but at this level it's over big win for Vali huge win on the board after a loss yesterday a very very big win for her and uh nulle with one point after a couple of draws and dear Lord this game was absolutely freaking nuts so this game started like any game between two 2700 level chess nerds the Spanish all right like talk about Spanish we talk about A6 right we've seen Berlin yesterday vidit played the Berlin against Hikaru we just saw the Spanish in one of these games uh in the in the in the muuch chuk game and also no this one was in Italian but uh the you know this game right we have a Spanish blah blah blah no um same position and in this position my man prag on plays F5 let me tell you something right now I have a course by the way 33% off uh I have a course where I recommend the schleman the yanish the counter Gambit with black to try to play E4 you know send wh's pieces into a whatever this is the defer schleman he basically played the schleman but included these two moves and vidit played very principled clearly spending five minutes doesn't remember all the analysis but he knows this is one of the most dubious ways at the highest level to play it is a massive risk if you will D4 black takes white plays E5 now black can't develop with the Knight and black has a weak King and now Prague plays B5 Bishop B3 in this position about 95% of games have gone Bishop B7 and there's a trap kind of if Knight takes D4 Knight D4 Queen D4 C5 C4 white gets the bishop trapped that's the trick but Prague does this he does not develop the bishop and he does not wait for white to Castle so this game goes into completely unexplored territory after Knight takes F5 nobody has ever played like this before Knight takes B3 a takes B3 we just pause here vidit has an extra pawn and black has a weak King but modern-day engine analysis has made chess a Battleground everywhere and black goes D6 and do you know what the idea of D6 is it is so Savage the idea of D6 is that if white takes I go Queen D7 the idea of D6 is not to trade pawns it's to free the queen up and then Castle long this is the point to give black snipers baz on the other side of the board and black is fine black is down two pawns with a wideopen king but it's completely fine this is nuts so vid it here thinks for a long time I took my dog for a walk here with uh with Lucy earlier and you know 23 minutes Queen E2 and uh Queen D7 allowing the pawn to take with a dis discovered check because the best move is King F7 how is this even possible Prague lost yesterday to GES Prague played like a psychopath yesterday with white and he got humbled GES played perfectly yesterday and proc shows up today and he does the exact same thing doing the same thing and failing is the definition of insanity where the same thing happens over and over Prague allows vidit to walk into his position push around his pieces and guess what guess what he then proceeds to kick out his Knight and kick out his bishop and then just play Knight E7 vidit has an extra pawn and another pawn two squares away from queening in the black position and he's not even better he's not even better not only is he not better he's down 40 minutes on the clock Prague is a beast I love the way he plays chess vid it under pressure here but he does get his King castled and Prague messes up what Prague should have done before he castled is maybe secured the outskirts of the position a little bit or he could have castled this way so Prague had to decide which way to Castle and I think like I showed you the idea of the opening is ultimately to Castle long prag Miss times it and is much worse here if vidit plays Knight D5 Knight D5 gives white A major advantage and the idea of Knight D5 is that if black take by the way if black doesn't take like if black goes here you trap the Queen the queen is trapped Queen C6 Knight B4 Queen's trapped you have this move it's not mate you lose your queen so you lose a piece so Knight D5 is almost winning for white because it's check black has to go here and then in this position vid has to find before he takes the Knight he has to throw in this move by the way you can take the Knight but there's a very complex line here Knight F6 takes takes the pawn is sneaking through you try to push it through if Rook here you have Queen G6 vid had to C C at all of that and in this position after long castles he had to be brave he had to but vid was on the back foot psychologically it's difficult to call your shot and vidit makes a couple of Preparatory moves before he plays Knight D5 and now he's worse now he's worse and what makes it even worse than that he has 16 minutes to make 18 moves you got to get your bonus time on move 40 hopefully they said this clock right and Prague now just starts cleaning up E7 King B8 and Prague now is winning he's got a dominant position vid has 10 minutes for 13 moves he going to lose on time he just he can't can't keep this up good idea though from vidit trying to split the defense all proc has to do now is play Rook H7 this is not a concern because this Pawn can't be taken because you just go here pragas to put this Rook on the right Square Rook H7 he doesn't he doesn't now vid might be back in the game but he's got 9 minutes for 12 moves pressure is on plays Queen D4 good move V yeah Prague doing his best Prague is still up a pawn queen C3 is no longer up a pawn prag is back up to up he's back up a pawn Knight A5 looking for that Bishop four minutes for vidit to make nine moves he's going to lose I mean there just no way right and proc says take the damn Bishop you wanted so bad and you have to you have to take the bishop you cannot allow black to keep this bishop if you got to take the bishop here and you have to play this end game down on a pawn and what you have to do here with white is go Rook A1 and just get into a fight black is going to play G5 you have to say no we're not opening the position black is going to play G4 trying to win your Pawn you have to go here and attack The Rook black is going to go here defending you got to take the pawn on A6 it's basically just that's it I mean it's the Hunger Games out here vidit plays Knight A5 and then he doesn't take the bishop and now proc takes over this was vid's Final chance he played very well he was very coldblooded up to this point he was up for the task but he slips because he just doesn't have enough time and as you can see somebody's King is about to get the ever living you know what beaten out of him and finally he takes the bishop but it's too late the G file has been opened it's like opening the Chamber of Secrets this is falling and pragna nand Rish Babu after losing to gcash and the previous round cleans things up and beats vided the leader one and a half out of two with black Prague just won with black we've had more wins with black than we've had with white you have never seen an opening like this at the candidates I mean it it is Sensational what Prague just did and these are your standings after three rounds of action gesh and nepo draw their game gukesh almost one and not almost that was a strong statement Fabby with two vidit Prague with one and a half and we have Ali Resa hikaro and N with one it's still separated by a point the women's candidates is now separated by one and a half it's kind of a two horse race but it's a little bit too early to tell what around friendly reminder get yourself a course it ends tomorrow 30 3% off uh we can't just have the course the entire candidates or maybe we can get out of here
