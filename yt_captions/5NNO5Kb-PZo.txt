all right all right the results are in i have it here on this device so the award for most extra tech feature goes to the xiaomi smart wireless charging pad [Music] what's up mkbhd here welcome back to dope tech brought to you of course by the dope tech t-shirt this one's a healthy mix of great stuff and weird stuff mostly thanks to this guy so xiaomi released alongside their new me 10 ultra they're really impressive phone that's also a mirror they also released this smart wireless charging pad it's this pretty big pad and it was sort of inconspicuous at first i took it out the box i was like yay cool another wireless charging pad but why is it smart so then i plugged it in and i started using it and i got it so this charging pad has one gimmick and one gimmick only it's a 20 watt wireless charger and the number one thing it does is move that coil inside to find the device you put down somewhere on the charger and line up the charging coil automatically for you so it's this huge pad on purpose and you can put your device down anywhere and then you can hear the motors move the coil inside to line it up so yeah not gonna lie i thought that was pretty cool when i first saw it uh it's impressive that it does find the coils and line up every time no matter where you put it down uh it sort of takes away the pain of trying to line up your wireless charger perfectly every time you just kind of slap it down anywhere and you're good but on the other hand that's it that's that's all it does that's the whole thing i mean i've weirdly i posted this on twitter and some people said that there was multiple device support and i think that's kind of stretching the definition a little bit because when i'm using it i put one device down and it moves over the charging coil just like it should perfect charges that then i put a second device down and as long as the first one's charging nothing happens really the only thing that you could say is multiple device charging support is when i finish when it finishes charging the first one it moves then over to the second device and starts charging that which is cool so regular charging pad doesn't do that so you can leave several things i guess in theory on this pad overnight and it'll eventually get all of them charged for you but it's not charging more than one thing at once either way though not gonna lie i kind of love this thing it's 20 watts is good enough for me it's not super fast charging but that's a high enough rate and i just kind of leave this thing on my desk now and i just slap my phone down whenever i just need a couple extra percent battery and eventually it'll have me covered that's pretty dope alright so next up is this little box right here this guy is called the hachi infinite m1 so hachi reached out and they wanted to sponsor a spot in a dope deck episode and they sent over this box and it's a projector and i'm really glad they did now projectors usually pretty boring right but this one i can confidently say this is definitely the smartest projector i have ever seen so this one has a snapdragon 670 inside has up to six gigs of ram and 128 gigs of storage and it runs android 9.0 but customized into a ui they call infinite os so it's basically basically a whole android tablet inside this guy and then you can see aside from the projection it's got cameras and there's sensors at the front and the top plus a gyroscope inside keeping track of its orientation so the way this thing is angled basically you can put it up against the wall and it'll project up to the wall or you can put it up against a flat surface like a desk or table and it'll project down onto the table once you do it'll automatically sort of start to calibrate itself and sharpen it up and once it's done you have your projection but here's the catch it's a touch screen projection so this 10 point multi-touch element kind of unlocks this giant tablet experience anywhere you can find a flat surface which you'll start to realize is like all over the place and it's actually a lot more responsive than i thought it would be maybe it's because i've tried some pretty garbage gimmicky versions of this in the past but this one is really good basically the limitation is you still got to make sure you're not casting a shadow on the element you actually want to touch so if you want to hit this button for example don't block the light from above it you just got to come from the other side of the light and touch it and it works perfectly but once you get the hang of that it's all green light you can literally play multiplayer games 1v1 against people whether it's tic-tac-toe or board games or pong or air hockey we've tried all of them and they all work and on top of all that it's got a built-in battery so the thing is pretty portable so you don't have to find a plug everywhere you go you can be on a train basically and just plop this thing down and start using it like a tablet so now you can basically turn any surface into a giant gaming controller without the need of a phone or a tablet i'm sure you've played pong before but you've probably never played it on your kitchen counter or on a table and then in the os there's some other dedicated ai integrated apps they've built with different themes for example there's an education feature where you can use physical objects like actual plastic letters to teach spelling because it uses image recognition from the cameras to tell if you've spelled something right or wrong there's a kitchen feature called future kitchen that lets you project recipes onto your kitchen counter for example or your cutting board and it guides you through cooking them on your counter and it'll even use that camera to recognize ingredients you scan there's also even a fitness app where in one direction it points the workout program video onto the wall and then on the other side is the camera facing you and it helps correct your form and count your reps and track your body so really interesting stuff that's been benefiting from the ai engine in the snapdragon 670 chip and it just got me thinking about projectors in a way i honestly never did before so it is pretty expensive at the site it's linked below it's 9.99 so basically the value proposition is you can either get one really nice projector that only does one thing which is just sit in one room and project an image on a wall or you can get this sort of like swiss army knife smart projector touch screen ai focused image recognizing tablet thing that you can take anywhere and uh i think that qualifies as dopetech okay last but not least is this guy this is samsung's ipad pro killer that's being a bit generous but hear me out so this is the galaxy tab s7 plus it's an android tablet and so this is the bigger one there's two the galaxy tab s7 and s7 plus and this guy you know android tablets used to be a lot more popular than they are now there just isn't that much competition in the android tablet space right now but this one as far as premium android tablets goes has a lot of good stuff going for it like it's got the high specs the snapdragon 865 plus which makes it 5g capable and there's up to eight gigs of ram and half a terabyte of storage and the design i think is nice it's a really thin tablet probably thinner than the phone you're using right now but it's metal it's got sharp edges and it still fits quality quad speakers in all four corners and a 10 090 milliamp hour battery so it is not a poor useless pace and then you get a bunch of little things too there's dual cameras one 12 megapixel primary and one 5 megapixel ultra wide and they're pretty good they don't have to be great because they're tablet cameras but they are definitely functional and in fact the camera you'll probably use more often on a tablet is the front-facing camera which is up here in the middle of landscape mode which i love because most of the time you're using a tablet like this it's going to be sideways it's in landscape mode samsung knows this and puts the webcam in the better place unlike the ipad that's actually also why the fingerprint reader is over here on the right hand side because you hold it sideways and double tap and unlock it just like that easy and the bezels are thin but not too thin because if you're holding a tablet you do need some place to put your thumbs down and actually hold the thing so it's got just the right amount of thickness to hold that bezel and not touch the screen it's just an overall really nice design my favorite quirk though is the s pen it comes with so this is the new and improved s pen it's got all the same improved technologies from the galaxy note series it's the new nine millisecond response time all that fun low latency stuff but i say quark because it's kind of like they saw what the ipad pro did with the apple pencil and said oh we like that we're gonna do you mind if we copy that but sort of make it look like we change it up a little bit and so that's how we ended up with this they copied apple's homework but changed it up just a little bit so the s pen only attaches and charges this certain way so it's got to have the tip facing the cameras and in just the right spot and the magnets are nice but they just aren't quite as strong so i can't do it blind as easily as the ipad maybe if i used it for longer i'd get a better hang of it but it just feels like it should be a little bit stronger and when you lay it down without the case now that it's on the back it kind of props it up a bit because of the pen like is that what they wanted i don't know the case for it really is one of the best accessories you should get for this tablet but the reason the tab s7 plus makes dope tech is because of this screen this is the best yeah this is the best screen on any tablet including the ipad it's a 12 inch 16 by 10 120 hertz super amoled display it gets super bright the colors are excellent and everything on this screen whether it's videos or photos or games whatever it is it just looks super sharp and vibrant i mean this is seriously a great screen which i guess we'd expect nothing less from a high-end samsung product oh and yes this also does use the full quad hd resolution and 120 hertz at the same time i mean it is a tablet but it's still nice to see this screen like if you want a media machine if you watch a lot of youtube netflix whatever you do like this is this is the screen you want to do it on and it's lightweight enough that you can carry it around watch it on a plane this is the one so this is dope tech just because of the screen now it is still an android tablet so you're going to have a lot of partially unoptimized weirdly vertical not quite right apps and if you're willing to deal with that because that's part of the android tablet experience then the rest of this package might be interesting to you but i mean come on this screen is awesome so that's about it that wraps up this dope tech some pretty good stuff here but hey if you have other suggestions for stuff you want to see in dopetech in the future now's a good time to leave a comment in the comments section because there's a whole wide world out there of great stuff and weird stuff and quirky stuff and we'd like to i would like to feature it on the channel i think it's a lot of fun so thanks for watching this episode and uh we'll catch you guys later peace
