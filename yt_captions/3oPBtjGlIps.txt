so I have been making YouTube videos for over eleven years now today a video this week pretty interesting um well it's been a great run I think that's about time to do something a little different I am going to give away my youtube channel so what does that exactly mean well obviously we have a ton of fun toys here right I mean I like shooting videos on 8k read what the thing is I don't need it I'm shooting on my phone right now and it is just fine but I'm gonna take it a step further by letting a bunch of strangers on the Internet make my video for me something good up to notes um and while yes it may or may not be an entertaining well-thought-through masterpiece like obviously all of my normal videos are fragile mm-hmm but you know what we've got going for us is the fact that I don't have to make it so there's a big plus there so what happens when we let a bunch of internet strangers take over my channel probably not good things I'm just gonna be real with you probably this is probably bad idea now I think the first thing we need is someone to actually do some research for us or someone can write our paper now I do want to be clear this video is not sponsored by Fiverr I have been sponsored by Fiverr in the past however they have no affiliation with this video whatsoever what I will system medical and nursing research being a doctor did my doctorate learn how to be a doctor on Fiverr I will write a tech article tech blog or tech review for you perfect and $5 for 350 words well I feel like with this project I'm going to have to think about it in stages right because someone has to research someone has to then write that up into a script then at that point I can send it out to like a voice-over artist or an animator extremely cool voiceover okay well if it's extremely cool no wait hold on hi I'm not really a Morgan Freeman I could have if we're gonna do five of the worst tech products we could split them up and have a different voiceover animator do each one of them okay so some of these might get a little expensive I don't want fire to make a boring video for me I want something cool I bet five those big ones around yet okay I think we have all the basic research we need now it's time to actually start sending out some of these jobs to Fiverr and see what we actually get back I'm not worried I'm sure I'll be fine I'm sure I'm not gonna be sucked into a black hole of trying to make this video for the next six months getting all this done so the first thing I did was I sent out a very simple note asking please give me five of the biggest tech failures what I got back was essentially a paper what are my five big tech fails what is the first generation pellet on it is the launch of Apple Maps actually that's a pretty solid one flammable hoverboards very reasonable the Amazon fire phone which I hate almost forgot I think actually did a video on that classic the samsung galaxy note 7 which famously exploded and that's it what is that five so it's my five tech fails chosen next step is to send it over to someone to actually write up into an article and this is why I received now this is actually pretty well done I mean just scrolling through here there's you know notes there's bullet points so now that we have our tech fails now that we have our list written let's actually get these things voiceover it's the very first thing I have to do is get Morgan Freeman to do my intro and to do one of the tech fields the next issue is what we'll actually put on screen right so normally if I'm making a video on the top 5 tech fails I'm showing you footage and photos of the product and today I'm here with the top 5 tech failures so I'm gonna have to get a little creative because I don't know if I can find enough animators to do all of this what I may need to do is I may need to find someone stock photos oh yes so I can just get someone if I get the Morgan Freeman voiceover I'll just get someone to find me a bunch of stock footage with like phones and like Apple maps what what am i doing it no what does this even gonna look like how much is this gonna be alright so it has been a couple of weeks and it is time to take a look and see what our fiber masterpiece looks like so at this point we have all of our voiceover we have all of our edited clips with all of our a roll so the main question really is just watch it and see what kind of mash these fibers made for us hey guys this is Austin just kidding here are some of the biggest tech fails the world what have we done I'm so happy right now I've been working on this video for a while and I've been very unsure of what it actually looks like am I just wasting my time and donating to a bunch of weirdos on Fiverr anyway before we watch it I actually have a couple of people who made a video to in their day to watch along with me so let's again alright three two one play hey guys this is Austin just kidding here are some of the biggest tech fails the world has had the misfortune of witnessing something got up to not seven however boys were a hot item back in 2016 Pattinson also managed to disappoint his customers the Amazon fire phone was doomed to fail from the beginning propelled by the launch of iPod followed by iPhone and iPads Apple has arguably revolutionized modern mobile computing so someone worked on this as in like to create the unique design great hardware and customer satisfaction has set the bar for its products very high however it has also brought the company and just one mistake away from public scrutiny ah okay so I see so the whole video is basically about how Austin Evans became corporate America and just outsourced to everything to cheap labor and then collects all the money designed to make traveling over shorter distance easier the board's featured complete foot control where pressurised pants were used as foot rests to control the movement popularity didn't last long after people started reporting incidents of a gadgets exploding there were a total of 99 reports and 18 injuries including burns to neck legs or arms oh oh while some exploded during recharge others simply burst into flames while people were actually right now problem turned out to be the not so high-quality rechargeable lithium-ion batteries they utilized this is like Dumbledore meets Hagrid meets Jesus meets lumberjack there were a number of reasons why Patterson bikes didn't take off in the market to begin with the bikes come with an extremely high price tag which generally starts at two thousand two hundred and forty-five dollars that's a pretty big investment for something you might not even use that often I mean I have a lot of I have a lot of thoughts turning about this peloton argument that's happening right now the indoor bikes come with a Wi-Fi enabled touchscreen tablet that streamed live and on-demand classes it also gives you the option to work out alone or compete with other participants virtually even though all the features are great it does pose a problem when you run into an issue and you have no idea how to solve it Oh something got cell phones of 2016 oh you love that I can't tell where the real set starts and ends with this guy the table seems to be real but I don't think the iMac is real customers started complaining of overheating and the phone's eventually exploding after 35 reported incidents worldwide some sue decided to recall every single one of the phones that was sold the company stopped all sales and shipments of note 7 and worked to provide refunds okay I'm into this now Oh exchanges however it still wasn't enough fooling exchanges the supposedly safe replacements also started catching fire listen to Samsung recalling all of them as well oh oh so we all dude and and mr. black Vegeta they are Fiverr employees like what what is this is almost like old footage I don't the release of iOS 6 for iPhone and iPad brought was it just the mistake the upgrade featured Apple's own version of a Maps application instead of the one that relied on Google Maps technology the step didn't pay off as expected and led to major backlash from the public some people also described it as a disaster the application was flawed to begin with the mapping technology was complex giving wrong directions and lacking turn-by-turn navigation Navstar mp4 making the overall experience lackluster as compared to Google Maps the criticism was so intense that Apple's CEO had to issue a public apology and even suggested using Google Maps as an alternative Oh leading to a 170 million dollar loss to the company the Amazon fire phone was doomed to fail from the beginning the device was referred to as forgettable and mediocre causing Amazon to drastically change its price from $200 to $0.99 just after a month of its launch now why did the phone fail to begin with it was overpriced essentially the same as an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy this was a major drawback since most of the people weren't ready to choose it over the other alternatives as it used a proprietary App Store tailor-made for the company's phones and tablets which meant that developers had to make different versions of their applications specifically for the fire phone Oh that's it that's the end I just watched the longest four-and-a-half minutes of my life so what have we learned today well yes there are certainly many channels that are very successful by basically being content farms and the problem there is that at least for our video that we made today it's not quite as cohesive as I would hope right like it doesn't really tell the story it tells a lot of individual stories but if I was going to do this again I think I would approach it a little bit more of a overarching sort of way versus just letting the internet go completely wild with things if I've learned anything from this video though is that I should probably just fire can I mean really what is he bringing to the table so how much was our fire video to create well um let's just see shall we so first of all we have our animated whiteboard explainer so the person who did the pellet on animation and including tip it was $60.50 and I did tip pretty much everyone on here next we have the stock footage commercial which was the most expensive video we got at 170 dollars Aylmer drinking coffee and reading about the hoverboard was 74 dollars oh oh and Tyrone talking about the note seven was a full hundred and eighty-two bucks the voiceover for the fire phone was fifty dollars the voiceover for Pelton was fifty six dollars Morgan Freeman's voice over was a bargain at thirty four bucks and the research was done for thirty four and the actual script itself was written for seventeen dollars which comes out to a grand total of six hundred and forty seven dollars and seventy five cents so this is what happens when I run out of ideas and I'm stuck inside my house for too long thanks for subscribing to Austin's Fiverr corner [Music] so much fun that was cut down to mystery tech but instead I do a fiber video hmm okay homeless I actually didn't realize you were gonna use this footage that's fine Oh
