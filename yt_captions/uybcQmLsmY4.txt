there are five stages of learning the code that every single person watching this video right now is eventually going to have to go through and those five stages go like this first level one you have Thomas who has not even started or he's going through his first ever coding course he knows zero programming languages he has zero skill no job and is basically still spending all his time searching things from Google like what languages should I learn or what is the best coding course for beginners I ran a poll on my channel earlier to figure out which level all of you are at and according to it 51 of the people who watch my channel are currently at this level so for all of you if you keep watching you're gonna know exactly how to break into the next level which is level 2 hello world coder at this level you're basically been learning for a good amount of time maybe going through a couple of courses you build some basic things but you're not yet at a point where you're ready to start applying for jobs and 33 of you are currently at this stage and if you're one of these people a bit later in the video I will have a very important piece of advice specifically for you because breaking out of this level is actually the hardest part at least it was for me then after this we have level three the lead code Warrior level when you have learned enough to have the confidence to actually start applying for jobs so at this point you're probably spending your days grindingly cold and getting rejected by like five companies every single day leading you the question whether going through the previous two stages was ever even worth it then we have level 4 which is the Hotshot Junior developer level which once you reach this level is probably going to be the biggest breakthrough moment of your career because at this level you have successfully fooled I mean convinced some hiring manager to actually hire you then finally we have the pro coder level where you're essentially moving up the corporate ladder maybe you are a senior developer which means you even have some actual responsibility now you make good money writing code at the pace of rewards per minute life is good five percent of you are apparently here including one person who has been working with code for two decades one please teach me how to center a dip anyway but you know what there's actually a bonus level the pro Mega hacker level that's above all of these levels which not even I have achieved obviously but honestly most people don't even try to reach because they don't even know they exist that is something we will go into at the very end so I want you to look at these levels right now and determine which is the level that you currently fall into and that is because I will next go through all of these levels in detail and tell you exactly what you should be focusing on right now to move up as fast as possible by the way if my journey is something that you would like to join and follow along with and grow together with me then I'm not gonna stop you from subscribing the channel and if you would like to be notified when I upload new videos I'm certainly not gonna stop you from hitting the Bell notification button if you want to see behind the scenes of my coding projects like gonna prevent you from following me on Instagram at internet encoder okay you get the point let's get into level one level one is Thomas and basically at this level you're still figuring out where you even want to go with your coding in the beginning spend a bit of time researching all the different areas different languages what they can do different kinds of things you would want to build and really think about your goal why are you learning the code but then once you've sort of done your research you figure out why you want to learn the code just pick a language pick a course and just stick to it at the beginning I spent way too much time just going through like a lot of different things like doing one course here and then like oh this new shiny language here let me do this course it's much better to be really good at one language or one area of programming rather than like a jack of all trades and as soon as you're able start building very simple things don't worry about building something super complicated at this point actually build confidence in your abilities to go it's going to be hard it's going to be uncomfortable but the uncomfortable things are what make you grow and I want you to remember that throughout your journey then we have stage two the hello world code and I said this was the hardest level to break through and here's why at this level you'll be learning for while you've probably done a couple of courses maybe you've even built like simple things but at this stage the biggest hurdle stopping you from getting to the point where you're actually ready to start applying for jobs is less about learning and it's more about confidence you just need to build the confidence to actually start applying and the biggest piece of advice I can give to do this is probably a big character intuitive it's just to try before you think you're ready seriously you're never going to be at a point where you feel like you're a good programmer at this stage because there is so much to learn about programming and the job of programming is not to know everything if you know enough about something to be able to do the job and to figure out the rest as you go even at my current job right now most of the time whenever I get a ticket I have no idea how to do it but it's my job to go and figure it out the experience of interviewing and the experience of working on actual project maybe you go pick up a very large project from upwork or something like that that experience is going to make you grow so much faster and the last thing you want to do is just keep on doing call is even doing more courses try to bring your skills into the real world so that is the biggest advice that I would give and these days some of the most fun projects to make at least for me are ones that utilize actual real world data especially given that I'm very interested in data science machine learning and all that kind of stuff and for that the absolute best tool I found is a bright data who have agreed to partner up with me for this video bright data is an incredible data collection tool that makes it insanely easy to collect public data from the internet they do this with the award-winning proxy networks and web scrapers but the best part and the reason I use write data is that they give you access to all kinds of ready to use data sets on things like LinkedIn data Instagram account data Amazon products and endless other things like you're saying well can't I just write my own web scraper yes and bright data can also help you with that because most of the time internet data is messy so you need to spend a long time cleaning it up and actually making it usable but bright data does all of this for you automatically all you have to do is choose a template for example Airbnb prices or Amazon products and configure it a bit and you can just access the data is it in whatever format you like like CSV or Json so go check out bright data from the link in the description make sure you stay tuned because we have a project coming up where we will be using bright data in an upcoming video on this channel and now on to the next level level number three my recommendation for this level is go take a basic course on data structures and algorithms there's two options that I really recommend number one is the algorithm specialization by Stanford University from Coursera I've done this myself this is much more like a theoretical approach if you really want to take your time and really want to learn all the fundamentals this is the course I would choose it's going to be really comprehensive if you do all the exercises it's going to give you a really good fundamental and after that then you can go into applying them by just doing a lot of lead coaches doing a lot of legal problems I know this can be boring but if you feel like you don't really even understand what data structures are and what algorithms are why do we even care about them why we made these two videos before where I explain in like the dumbest like most basic way possible or if you don't really care about are knowing all the fundamentals you can go for zero to masteries master the coding interview boot camp which is again I think this was the first data structures algorithms course that I personally did a discount code down below for 10 off because I am affiliated with them and once you get to the level where you're able to pass like medium level lead code questions you are definitely going to be having a very good chance of passing interviews now if you're applying for smaller companies here your focus should simply be on building a lot of projects specifically in the languages and in the types of technologies that you are applying for so I start up hiring for a react engineer for example because they don't have as many resources they're going to expect you to already know a lot of skills going in so that is why they will actually probably test you on your react skills on the interview or maybe they will be like a take-home coding exercise that's what I've seen happen a lot and if you do all of that you are eventually going to get to level 4 which is the level that I am the Hot Shot Junior developer level so I can pretty much just share to you what I'm focusing on myself right now and what I have been recommended by my more senior colleagues to focus on the most important thing you do is just learn as much as possible what I am told by my mentors and my senior colleagues and my company all the time is that the only thing they expect is for me to just be willing to learn you are probably still going to be learning a lot whatever language your company uses you're probably going to be told to do do like an online course only and you're gonna sort of have to work on that alongside your day-to-day work but at least if you're on a big company a company like mine they will obviously pay for all the certifications and all the training that you will need to do your job well so you're really well taken care of at least you should be so just focus on learning as possible you ask as many questions as you can possibly get and if this one thing I've learned from all my previous work experience and this job right now is the number one thing you can do as a junior is to be someone who always tries to do things on your own before you ask someone else how to do it just go fearlessly towards New Challenges because that is what they like to see the end today someone who they want to solve problems for the company right and while at the beginning you're not going to know a lot so I'm going to try your best to do anything that you're given and you can show to them that you at least gave a good attempt at some problem or some ticket that you're given and then you can say okay I tried this and this this that didn't work where could I go from here they really gonna be happy to help you and that is how You're Gonna Go Far because they want to see that you're actually actively learning from your mistakes and being willing to make mistakes to then learn from so that is my biggest advice and if you do all of this and you keep your job at some point you are going to reach level 5 which is the pro coder level at this point you've been working at your junior level job for one to two years or you've been freelancing for the same time whatever your path is if you reach this level like five percent of you are pretty much home free now you are making good money life is good and you pretty much know that you are never going to be out of a job in your life if you don't want to be because at this point recruit this every single day asking you to join their new cool company to be interviewed for their python engineer role you essentially have endless opportunity and again the reason for this is programming is such a high value skill that once you get to the point where you are an experienced programmer as in you've demonstrated that you are a good software developer and German that literally every company is now going to want to hire at this point you're probably making so much money that you can just really chill I guess and just see where you want to take your career or maybe you want to try to reach the ultimate Pro hacker coder whatever I said level if that is you then keep watching to reach level 6 you essentially need to stop working for other people and instead build your own software either your own startup or just your own software as a service and there's a lot of different things that people build their own business using their coding skills my real goal has always been to like use my coding skills to actually build something to build an actual product a business so I know that I will want to be pursuing this level and because the thing is this website called Indie hackers where you can find all kinds of people who build very simple software that they then sell as a service to other businesses other people and you can literally make like a hundred thousand dollars a month just like from a very simple software as long as it's something that solves a business problem anything worth pursuing is going to be hard but I am just really excited about challenge building new things so I know that eventually this is sort of the direction that I want to go to sort of just depends on your personality are you the type of person who's willing to take risk for potentially much higher returns or do you just prefer the stability of having a stable job and a stable income which is still going to be a very good income as a software developer really just depends on you and yes region level 6 is super hard I'm probably gonna fail like a million times before I eventually hopefully succeed but I cannot wait to fail and if there's one thing I want you to take away from this video is exactly that enjoy the process of trying not the eventual result I think you need both you need the strong Y and you need encoding to be something that you actually enjoy doing so whatever stage you're in whether you're still struggling with your first language building your first project or already building the next Facebook enjoy the journey enjoy the act of trying then failing then trying and failing again because if you don't do that then what was it all for anyway I recommend you watch this video right now I recommend you follow me on Instagram at internet encoder and I'll definitely go to the link down below and join my live stream on the 8th of December because that is when you're gonna finally ask me all the questions you have we can hang out it's gonna be super fun I will see you there and I will see you in the next video
