so i thought i'd show you one of my uh latest old computers latest old well you get the idea um it's quite a small one this time it's just down there so you sent me a picture of this and to me it looked just like a tower computer but perhaps if you stand next to it we'll get a sense of the actual scale of it let me if i just sit on it pretty large isn't it fantastic so tell us about it what is it so this is actually one of the nottingham's computer science department's old servers it's been sitting in a cupboard but it's a sun three 160 which is a sun micro systems workstation from the late 80s so it's a dust size model and rather nicely if i move the cables out the way it slides in up against the desk at exactly the right height so i i believe one of the other ones ended up its life as a coffee table for dave burlesford we're going to see if we can get it working there is a slight issue with the amount of dust inside if i switch it on you can hear the noise it makes there's one red light here i've got a serial link connecting it to it and we can start to see the self test come up on the computer here actually this computer from about 93 is probably more powerful than that although it doesn't quite have as much memory so it's testing the ram at the moment so at the moment i'm not going to do much more than this so since late 80s if you look at the top you can see the manufacturing thing says it was assembled 2nd of june 1986. 31 years old is it just its 31st birthday it's coming up to its 31st birthday so we thought we'd get it out of retirement to give it a new lease of life um it sounds like the fans are clogged with something and it won't boot past the memory test so we'll take it apart see what's working and see how it's actually fitted together is it finished yeah so while you're doing that i'm going to ask the obvious question there's a sticker on there that says sheriff what's that all about that was just the name of the machine the department at the time then liked to use uh names based off robin hood so we had sheriff we had took we had robin uh and various other machines there's a machine called marion as well the mail server was called pat and everyone in the uk will know why that is the case they look like they're kind of sliding inside out cards yep so this so the way this machine these machines worked in those days everything was on cards it's still the case in fact if you go into a submarine or something or any sort of environment like that you'll find very similar sorts of cards being used it's what's called the vme bus it was a popular thing of motorola at the time but it enables you to sort of build the system up you have a back plane at the back you see those connectors along here and you just slide the cars into there and then they can all talk over the back plane to each other so you can configure the machine exactly as you need on this one i've got the cpu card here on the left um that's probably extra memory and we'll have a look that one's just a blanking plate this one's an additional ethernet card so it's got two ethernet connectors here and if you look back at some of the network diagrams from the department at the time you'll see it was used to link two separate ethernets together i see you did a bit of work steve actually it's not what i normally do i'm normally more software but i like playing with hardware so hopefully we should be able to pull this card out and without breaking anything this is just a blanking plate by the look of it there's nothing on it this is all um sheet metal so it's as heavy as well sheet metal so you can pull the cards out and here we have oops what we got here i would say this is ram so you can see that there we are another robin hood name much much ram two so there's eight meg of ram i imagine this wasn't actually produced by sun this board it's got a clear point name on the top which i suspect is another company so you've got your board with your ram and it all connects back over the back plane by these three connectors here and these can carry the data signals and the address signals and the control signals from the cpu and the address and so you can configure the machine as you liked the difference now of course is you have multiple layers so this just seems to be a two layer pcb i've already taken photos of where all these boards went so we can put it back together in the right order we got this one out and again i think this is just more ram this is just another is it let's say four meg possibly two meg eight meg something along those lines so i don't think you can see in there we've now got the cpu card there which has got its own memory on and various of the bits and pieces so we've got an ethernet port on here some switches some lights video connected wanted to plug in a display keyboard connector there we are that's that that looks like an impressive bit of engineering so there's the the back and showing all the connections so what we've got on here first place to start is a cpu this one's here it's a 680 20 which is a motorola cpu it's the same family of cpus that were found in the atari and the amiga and it was good because it was great for running unix which is what this machine used at the time so it's a 60 020 at the time the amiga the hr is the macintosh's all six eight thousand base machines this one was a later revision and so more powerful we've also got a floating point code processor here and then this looks like a boot rom of some sort so i'll have the bios equivalent or the boot from as it was called here and you've got your network controller card there um i won't be too surprised if that's part of the network as well and then you've got lots and lots of discrete logic chips around here to do things and the occasional programmable logic array here this one's labelled how term i don't think this is related but howard built in a similar form and then here we've got ram so the cpu board's got memory on it i imagine there's what one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen i imagine it's set up as parity ram which is why i've got more than sixteen there and so on and that will give you a base amount of memory i imagine about four megabytes serial controller chip here same one as used in the macintosh and so this is basically this is enough to start the whole machine there's the graphics cards on here and well so you could build the machine completely others and i think some of the other sun machines made use of the same system how we're talking to this what we've got is a serial connection which enables us to communicate to another machine now normally in the series either use the built-in graphics or you'd have used dumb terminal i'm actually connecting to a sort of atari here and i'm just using on the screen a simple terminal program so that's not doing anything more than echoing what's shown off this computer via the serial link the most annoying thing about trying to get this working so far is that the connector you use here is the opposite to what's used on a pc or an atari so i've had to get a gender changer to actually connect things together that's been the most complicated thing so far what happened to sun sun so sun here they were started in the early 80s they started producing unix workstations based around six eight thousand so the sun one was the first and then this was a bit later on um they then developed their own cpu the spark chip and throughout the 90s if you wanted powerful sort of computers you would buy sun made a lot of things and then they produced a little program you may have heard of called java which of course became a reasonably popular operating operating system a reasonably popular virtual machine which could compile and write programs towards and then sort of about 2009-2010 they were brought out by oracle who basically bought them because solaris the operating system they developed out of unix to run these things was probably the best one for running the oracle database and so they still you can still get the descendants of this to run oracle databases but that's about it ethernet card coming out now so you can start to see um how this is sort of fitting together i think what you've got at the bottom and i'm sort of half guessing here is that this will sort of decide where in the computer's memory map the network card will be addressed and so sort of control logic on there for doing various things you've got some not gates and and gates and so on in there and then this bit here looks to be the actual network card itself in fact you can see if you look carefully it's on a separate card and it's using an intel lan controller there it looks like they used to make those out of gold that's fantastic isn't it well yes this is this is a ceramic chick package i don't know quite why it's got the gold window on the top probably just keep the light out but uh the interesting thing is that it's got a aui connector for connecting up to the ethernet it's not a sort of bnc connector or rj45 that we're used to these days you would have a big cable that would drop out the ceiling connect onto this and then inside the ceiling you would have a huge thick cable that you'd plug that onto in the original instances one last card to come out how much do you think one of these would have been back in the day oh several thousand if not tens of thousands so what have we got here this is another okay card this is interesting don't know what this one is it's got a battery on it it's battery backed um any clues what this one might be the clock well it could be a clock of some sort answers on a postcard too you get a better view now of the back plane there so these are all connected the same and if you look very carefully at the left there you'll see there's some resistor packs the red things so they'll be there to terminate the buses just like you have to terminate the network connection you want to terminate the buses to stop reflections of the signals and make sure things work as you'd expect and then we've got two more boards here let's have them out and have a look is that one of those cups so this is what we think might be a scuzzy card um xlc0 so that's probably this is probably a zylogix card actually little was another name of the machines we had like little john absolutely you can get in the robin hood naming convention here's another one so what we've got here it's another zylogix disc controller of some sort you've got the control chips in the middle and then the connectors the different sort of connector different size and then inside you can just see the back plane there and the cars we just looked at sliding and connecting to that and everything then connected together if you look here you can see this is very simple all the wires just connect all the pins together on each of these things and the capacitors just provide a bit of smoothing on the power supply sun microsystems model 160 oh back play descriptive descriptive this is where it gets interesting it's a lot lighter to move now you can have a look at the hard disks this one's got a tape drive fitted here we've got a hard disk here so we've got a ribbon cable down here we want to free and it seems that the front sort of comes off so with a bit of brute force and well intelligence but you can get the front off so we can start to see a bit more disk drive configuration drive nor drive one fujitsu so it says micropolis inside so it may well have been upgraded since then on off switch for the power fused by look of it in fact here's the power supply here eta power systems and now we can see why this isn't sliding out because there's a cable here that goes under there so you can see this is where scuzzy cable plugs in here onto the back plane there can you get that out this is what makes me a computer far success that's the expert so with that connector apart is that actually can we actually get the whole thing out yeah i think so if i stick this down here is there anything catching with that it's very snug it's against the fan assembly so i mean if you could slide towards the front then that would be good so you've got lots and lots of dust in here but uh we've got three things we've got tape drive here which could use to load the media and things i'm not sure we've got any of the media left and you've got two hard drives uh which is so common for the era these work very much like old floppy driving you had two connectors one that would control where the heads were positioned over the actual discord which would read the data across them and then you would have a controller board inside your computer what i think this machine's got is you've got two effective scuzzy controller boards here and these allow you to talk to the drives which are connected down here using scuzzy the small computer systems interface and it's a way of connecting hard drives i've got to stop you there small computers you say well i've seen bigger ones as in not huge room size ones but it's a small computer systems interface and the idea is it gives the drive some intelligence so with these sort of cards you have to physically drive them by saying move this amount in once you're there read the data decode the data and then you've got it with these you can say get me this track and this sector from this track on this cylinder on this head and you'll go and get it and then send you the data and it allows you to daisy chain lots of things together so if you look at the cable you see it's got multiple connectors on it one went into here and then the next one went into this one and so on this is a squeezy controller card which sort of translates the scuzzy from the machine to the actual hard disks so i think as we're going to go and blow the dust out of this it might make sense that while i'm getting a rather nice shirt covered i um do my bit for science and actually put my old a level lab coat on [Music] so [Music] good as you [Music] it's a dirty job but someone's got to do it so guys just put in the cpu board and the scooty board and we'll try booting up yet we haven't broken anything but i suspect there'll be some immediate work before we can get everything going again it's quite easy the cards actually slide in on rails which means we can just line them up and just push everything in get it lined up and then everything just slides into place so we've put the cpu card back in and the scuzzy card so we can access the disk i'm going to try booting up and see what happens if we get any difference in what we had before so let's apply the serial cable we'll start off in diagnostic mode again so we've got that switched and we just need some nice 240 volt hot power let's try turning on it is doing its self-test it's only found four megabytes now that's good because we only took one of the cards out it should be faster testing the ram it's still just as noisy self-test passed i'll take to boot off the scuzzy device device one zero see what happens nothing yet but there's seven possible devices so hopefully we can device not found it's not device one in the unlikely event that it does happen it works what would you expect to see no idea i've never got this far i'd like to say device not not found this is directly adding content to my normal vision the problem is the area that it has to add this content is really very narrow i think it's the equivalent of
