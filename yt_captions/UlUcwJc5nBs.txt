- I hit 8 million subscribers. When I hit 3 million subscribers I gave him 3 million pennies. When I hit 4 million subscribers I gave him 4 million cookies 5 million subscribers was
5 million pieces of popcorn 6 million subscribers
with 6 million blocks of dirt in Minecraft and $6,000. 7 million subscribers with 7 million sheets of
toilet paper and $7,000. And today is the 8 million
subscribers special. Since my city was about to get flooded we had to do something
we've already done before which is basically the
video game challenge but we're doing it with
different video games. Also, disclaimer, I couldn't fly down my actual 8 million subscriber because the hurricane was about to come. We didn't want him to get trapped. So I just grabbed a random
person off the street. He has three hours to
complete this challenge. If he does, he gets 8 million underscore, underscore, underscore. If he doesn't, he gets nothing or the hurricane might hit in the middle of filming and we might
have to call it off early. I don't know. All right, you have three hours to beat me in all these games. Some of the games don't
require you to beat me. If you do it, you get a ginormous prize. If you don't, you get nothing. And then you're gonna run away from the hurricane with nothing. First things first, it's
best outta 10 in Minecraft. Okay. Just, yeah. Just, I'm just... - Okay, just. Oh, what? - Sorry. Those sleazy
tricks won't work on me. Give me a challenge. I'm Michael Phelps. - Oh, yeah. Just little, just- - Ooh. - Okay.
