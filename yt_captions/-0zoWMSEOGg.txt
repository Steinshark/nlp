- I hit six million subscribers. When I hit five million subscribers, I gave five million pieces of popcorn. Five million was four million cookies. Three million was three million pennies. And I didn't do anything for my second or first
millionth subscriber. There is one thing my third, fourth, and fifth millionth
subscriber all had in common. They were part of the Illuminati. And also they didn't
have to earn their prize, I kinda just gave it to them. You know, I showed up, I dumped a couple million
of something on their lawn, and I kinda left. You know, I didn't really
make them earn their prize. And that changes today. You see, we built a customized
video game obstacle course that my six millionth
subscriber has to complete in under four hours. If he does not complete
it in under four hours, he does not get the six million underscore, underscore, underscore. Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em! - Oh! - Yeah.
- Yeah! - Why is this happening? Combo! Combo! - We took every game I played as a child and came up with a
challenge for each game. If he does not complete every
challenge for all 40 games, and under four hours, he
does not get the six million underscore underscore underscore. As you see, he's in a game, we're gonna hit start. He has to complete all
challenges in under four hours, or I'm sorry, you don't
get at the six million- - Right there.
- Right there. - Blow it up. Blow it up. - Shoot 'em, shoot 'em.
- Just shoot 'em! - I'm trying. Shoot 'em, shoot 'em! - 18 minutes.

It's been four hours. - Since you're a Viking

envelope. It's his envelope. - Open it. Open it. Open it. - Oh my goodness. - Ooh!
- Ooh. - I don't normally open
envelopes like this one. - Money money money.
- Look at this. - It's $6,000. 'Cause you're the six millionth
subscriber, like that. Even though you didn't
complete the challenge, you won't get the six million , but we're still gonna give you $6,000. And a signed megaphone. - You guys signed it? Aw, thank you. - You did good.
- Wow. - So now it's your chance. Is there anything you wanna plug, that I could possibly
link in the description? - Well, yeah, please
link my YouTube channel. It's CivilGuy, youtube.com/civilguy. - For those of you wondering what the six million items I was going to give my
six millionth subscriber if he finished the obstacle
course, it was this. If he finished the obstacle
course in under four hours, he was going to get this
Minecraft world download. You wanna know what's
inside of all these chests? Dirt. That's right. Six million blocks of dirt was the prize I was going to give my
six millionth subscriber, but sadly my six millionth subscriber didn't complete the
four-hour obstacle course under four hours, which means he didn't get the
six million blocks of dirt. He got $6,000, but no six
million blocks of dirt, which is such a shame. I know he really wanted these
six million blocks of dirt, but you know, rules are rules,
and he didn't finish in time. If you want the six
million blocks of dirt, comment down below, I
might give, you know, the world download to one of you guys. ♪ MrBeast oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast oh ♪
