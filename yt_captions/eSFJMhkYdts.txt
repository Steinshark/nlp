nope this is not clickbait I have officially left my job as a software engineer the thing I've been thinking about for a long time there's a lot of thoughts and a lot of reasons why I've made this decision and I know that I might sound like weird considering I'm a coding Channel I like now left my coding job but I'll explain like everything and I've organized this into like three life lessons that I learned that push me to make a decision and also talk about what is it that I am now doing instead and also I moved I live in a different country a different city now so we'll talk about all of that in this video there's gonna be slightly more like a chatty kind of video If you're looking for the kind of videos that I usually make where it's like specific advice on how you can learn the code all of that it's probably not the video for you but I think that nevertheless some of the things that I talk about some of the like realizations that I've had now having this job might be really useful for you you if you are yourself looking to maybe make the move to a career like that so yeah let's talk about it has a nice angle actually okay so I have some explaining Drew right so let's get into it but basically coding is still the thing that I love and no I did not quit to be a YouTuber in fact going forward despite of the fact that I'm not gonna have my job I'm gonna be coding more than ever and also no I did not quit because I hated my colleagues or because my boss was an idiot or anything like that I have no hard feelings so if you clicked on this video looking for drama looking for me to like bad mouth my employer that's gonna be absolutely none of that as far as Jobs go I actually really really liked the job but that is some other reasons why it was simply time for me to leave and move on to the next thing which is the thing that I'm doing now other things anyway I will explain so we're getting into the first lesson I know it's kind of funny that I've now left my job considering that still like to this day the most popular video on my channel is my video about how I got my job as a software engineer but basically what I realized is that as much as I love coding there's just something about coding from big company and coding as part of a big organization that really wasn't everything that I thought it was going to be because when you're coding for a big Corporation you're very siled into a very specific part of the business for example if you're working for YouTube you're literally like you might work for three years in one team that simply works on like YouTube display ads for example like the only thing you're working on is YouTube display ads and when you think about coding and getting into software engineering you're probably think about like oh I'm gonna work in these massive projects and I'm gonna like learn so much about like how YouTube Works behind the scenes but the reality of you being a software engineer from one of these big companies especially as a junior is that you have a very very specific role doing a very very specific thing and you might have no idea about the big picture so I just realized that for someone like me who's really interested in the big picture and like how everything works together and all of that as much as you do learn a lot I wasn't really learning the things that I'm interested in learning if that makes sense and it's the same thing about impact and value like one of the things I feel like we as humans value the most in the work that we do is like we like to create value we'd like to think that we're having an impact on the world or like creating something big that's going to benefit a lot of people but again this is another thing that I was very wrong about working for a big Corporation is that as a junior developer like the impact you're having is not actually that big like basically first of all like you're completely replaceable if I left the company like I did now literally like a few days after I had it in my notice they already had a different developer coming into our team that was like presumably going to like replace me so like you're very replaceable because the thing you're doing as a junior are basically things that almost anyone who knows how the right code could do or the value you're really creating is really minor and even the value you do create you don't really see it it you don't see the downstream impact that you're having you're going to create software the client is going to take you and they're going to go use it and then you just move on to the next project for some people working as part of a big organization doing something really big even if you're a really small part of it some people that's awesome and interesting and if that's you then great but I just realized that that really wasn't me I'd rather create something smaller but have a lot more control so that it's more interesting and learn more about the entire process also that I can feel and see the impact more like down the line and then another thing that people might say is like well you have this job that everyone wants like shouldn't you be grateful and like all of that but like really like in a way I'm doing a disservice to society by having this job that I really am not getting fulfillment from when there are so many people who would love to have the job that I have who would actually enjoy and who would get fulfillment for me and because they are really motivated about it they would probably do it better and as an algorithm more value would be created so in summary the first lesson was that coding for a corporation is not what I was meant to do but there was more to this besides the actual coding itself I just realized which is also what I've been realizing in literally every job I've done I've worked in teaching I've worked in Consulting I've worked in panicking but no matter which job I work I always felt the same thing where like it didn't really fit my personality to like have a job and to have a set schedule where someone else was telling me where I needed to be the kind of life that I always wanted is a life where I can live wherever I want I can do whatever I want at whatever hour of the day that I want if I want to go to the gym at 11AM I can do it I don't need to ask so much permission if I wanna get off to Bali for a holiday for a week I don't need to ask for someone's permission this is the entire thing that I always dreamed about but despite all of that I'm not here to say that having a job having a secure nine-to-five job you isn't a bad thing like actually for most people having a job is probably the thing that you should do at least in the beginning so actually I wouldn't recommend most people do what I'm doing right now because it's unless you're a very specific type of person having your own thing and like trying to build your own business which is what I'm trying to do right now probably isn't the right thing to do it requires you to be the type of person who can motivate yourself to do something every single day despite of how hard things might be you need to do it yourself and I'll be like for a lot of people for a lot of people's personality they need to have like like a tattoo like tell them what to do so if you're thinking about whether you should get a job or go try your own thing like the thing you really need to figure out is do you prefer security or do you prefer freedom I realized that 100 I prefer the freedom over the security if I fail the business fine it's my responsibility and my fault if I fail with a job like probably it's my fault but it might not be it might just be that the business happens to do badly maybe they let you off because the economy is doing badly I never wanted to have one single entity have this kind of power over me what I would recommend for most people is having a dog do get a job as a software developer if coding is the thing that you want to do and if you want to be an entrepreneur then on the side you can be building something like nine to five you work for a company then from five to nine you build your own app but the second lesson I learned is that I don't dream of employment people always talk about this concept of the dream job and I thought to myself and again in my previous videos I was always like and I'll have my dream job as a software developer but this is another thing where I was really wrong I don't have a dream job I have a dream life but any kind of employment is probably not going to take me there okay so obviously both of these two things that I've talked about so far were things that I was already realized like much before I already left so that the question is why did I not leave early earlier like if like after two months of my job I already realized that okay this isn't really exactly what I wanted and I already had my YouTube thing going why did I not quit earlier it was like a Blocker in my mind that was preventing me from making this decision earlier the thing that got me through that was the third lesson that I learned in my mind because I'm very risk averse and because my entire family they all like work traditional jobs and they're all very like about security for example when I moved out of Finland to study in the UK in a university my parents were like oh my God like why when you remember different country what is this what is that so I always had this background of like being secure like having as much security and despite the realizing like in my mind that I prefer the freedom over the security that still wasn't enough to like convince my stupid brain to make the move earlier because I had this idea that going out there and doing my own thing was risky what if my apps fail what if I get canceled on YouTube and then like what am I gonna to do but then there were two critical moments like two critical realizations that sort of allowed me to get through this the first was when I went on holiday I remember I went to Switzerland and I went to Italy and basically it was a week-long holiday I took time off work which is like a such a hassle to like get holidays approved I had to send like so many emails getting approved by like this partner this manager and all of that like first of all the whole process like I needed to ask this permission from all of these people just to take a holiday it was like this is not the kind of life that I'm about and then during that holiday I realized just how much mental space there's how much more mental energy I had now that I didn't have to think about work didn't have to think about my morning stand I didn't have to think about the freaking colleagues that I was slacking with all day and because I now had this contrast of having been in my job and now essentially being free for like a week I realized just how much I preferred the freedom of like just working on making my videos just working on my own projects and that was the first thing that started getting me to the point like okay I need to figure out a way where I can do this full time because I cannot have these like sort of chain on me at all times and so the second thing that finally got me over the hump was just like this one random night I remember I was walking home from the gym it was a cold like dark evening I was just walking I just randomly I just got the thought that let me just like just for the sake of argument let me just think about what would be the worst possible thing that could happen if I make the move if I leave my job and go do my own thing what's the worst possible thing that can happen and I realized as simple as this is gonna sound if everything fails I can literally just go get a job again I can like with my CV with my skills of getting interviews and with my skills in interviews like trust me I know how to get an interview to hire me if everything fails like I'm probably gonna have enough money to like survive at least for like two years so if literally within two years I never figure out a different business and I never able to start a new YouTube channel that grows and never figure out anything at the end of it I can literally just get a job very simple but for some reason my stupid mind wasn't realizing this earlier so the third lesson I realized that especially in my situation where I already have this YouTube business that is literally making more than enough money like it's making like five times what my salary was anyway but it literally made no Financial sense for me to keep having my job anyway especially in this situation taking the risk of going out there and like trying to pursue my dream life and the thing that I actually want to do really wasn't a risk at all because I always I knew that I always have the opportunity to just go back to the life that I had before if everything falls over and that was finally the thing that made me realize that damn it actually makes no sense for me to stay in the job and so here I am so essentially the things I'm doing right now is that this YouTube business that I have is like the cash flow business I have right now so I have the YouTube AdSense which I get from the ads that show about these videos like this one for example I have the affiliate so for example you you know that I talk a lot about zero to Mastery which is like this course platform like these amazing coding courses that I've myself been pretty much doing throughout my entire learning the code journey I have an affiliate relationship with them but whenever someone signed us up or my affiliate link you get a 10 discount code if you use my discount code down below go check it out a similar affiliate relationship with course Sarah again links to some popular courses down below go check them out and obviously direct sponsorships that you know Brands pay me directly to be featured in one of my videos and then I make money from it and then now I'm also selling my own courses like my python fundamentals course which you can check out down below in the description I just keep plugging everything now so all of these things are how I'm making money right now to like support my life and to keep Building Wealth and all of that and then the things that I'm mostly focused on for the future is building my own software so first thing I'm building is like a personal finance dashboard I've always wanted to have a personal finance application that really does all the things that I wanted to do so I'm building a prototype right now I'm gonna release for some of you to test at some point and then I want to build like other things there's like a bunch of ideas I have so ideally the things that are going to make me uh gazillionaire in the future are my apps and my software and so lastly where do I live right now so my entire story of where I've lived is that I'm from Finland and then I moved to University for London I was in London for three years then I went back to Finland for a gap year which also when I started this YouTube channel and then I got my job offer from London again so a little later I moved back to London for my job which is where most of the videos that you've seen on this channel are from and now I have actually moved to do Dubai in the UAE there's a bunch of reasons that I could make a whole another video on the topic of why Dubai intro amazing weather it's really safe it's really modern really good value for money like I have this insane apartment there's like so much cheaper that I would have been in London so that is where I am living right now and another thing I'm doing is I've started to make more videos on my blog channel so like I'm a second Channel that I have so if you're interested in following my life like more intimately I guess and the whole process of me coding up my startups you can subscribe to my second channel it's called the founder I am so excited for what is coming up I'll see you in the next week's upload [Music]
