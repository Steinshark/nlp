previously i did a video about singapore's attempts to maintain their native population through the use of pro-natal financial incentives and policies i also covered china's population control policies coming up to its momentous one-child policy today we're going to look at taiwan situation and their own low fertility issues ultra low natural fertility is a challenge that each of the developed east asian nations are struggling with why is this happening what policies can governments enact to reverse this trend what is it saying about people's general preferences we're going to try to grapple with this issue in today's video despite writing so much i feel like i have just only scratched the surface but hope you can enjoy but first let's talk about the patreon yes i have a patreon now ad income is always volatile but coffee always costs the same i make videos pretty far ahead of the schedule but they're queued up in youtube waiting to be released the early access tier lets you watch all those videos right now ahead of time including this one the number of videos will fluctuate but right now it's at 10 and you'll get to see new videos literally as i make and post them so head on over to the patreon page and take a look i deeply appreciate anything you'd be able to sign up for thanks and on with the show taiwan's 2018 total fertility rate is about 1.06 south korea's is 0.98 singapore is 1.14 and hong kong's 1.07 each of the four asian tigers regularly trade off the last place spot from year to year taiwan's experience of the demographic shift is relatively normal and follows that of its economic peers entering the 20th century people had large families many children died early so mortality was high new public measures introduced in the early 20s clean drinking water sewage sanitation etc caused the population mortality rate to plunge yet at the same time families stayed large and this caused a population boom but over the decades family sizes declined and there are a number of reasons for this first people got richer in 1951 gdp per capita was just 146 us dollars by 1984 it reached 3199 and as of 2018 it is 24 970. secondly women's labor participation rates and education steadily rose as that happened the societal demand for children naturally declined over the years family planning surveys taken since the 1960s have found the preferred number of children declining from 4.0 to 2.6 in 1985 and 2.0 in 2002. third but less significantly the taiwan government launched a family planning program in 1965. begun in taitung the iud insertion program appeared to have targeted women who already have had children and did not want any more this program was on a rather small scale and did not appear to have been forced there has been debate about the program's overall effectiveness but we can all agree that it accelerated the fertility trends that had already begun a decade earlier so up until now we've seen this story already many times in developing countries around the world you have a government that at first encourages family planning and population control during the years when the population is booming then they realize that the programs have done a little too well and reverse course the taiwan government made their own first moves towards a more pro-natal policy in 1992. since 1984 the net reproduction rate has been below the replacement level if the downward trend continues the population of taiwan area will reach the stage of zero population growth soon and turn into a negative growth quickly therefore the future policy should promote a reasonable growth of the population despite this declaration the taiwan government did not implement any new policies right then rather they repealed a birth subsidy for government employees the majority of the scope was focused on increasing the rates of marriage within society in general the government believed then that the limiting of family sizes was a societal net benefit at the time the total fertility rate per woman was hovering about 1.8 to 2 which was a hair below the 2.1 needed to maintain the current population size policymakers believed that more of a tweak was needed than a drastic overhaul but fertility rates continued to plunge to its current ultra-low levels has the country entered the new millennium issues relating to population aging began to gain traction in the media the government realized that it should do more to prevent an aging crisis in 2006 the taiwan government revised its policies to incorporate additional voices from taiwan's society including that of mothers and caretakers many of these measures are things that make sense and have been implemented in other countries to varying amounts of success the issue is turning a pledge into action first let's talk finances the taiwan government pledged to go further in supporting the costs of raising a child in 2002 the government shared just 24 percent of the cost of raising one preschool-aged child 35 percent for a family with two such children the support would come in the form of housing loan interest subsidies and income tax reductions contrast with japan where the government shared 52 percent of the total cost of raising a child to the age of 18 which i think is pretty staggering next child care ameliorating the time and effort burden of child care taiwan pledged to build a more comprehensive public child care system so that parents can have affordable sufficient and high quality child care while they go to work the results on that are pending making paternal and maternity leave more realistic and achievable the 2002 equal employment act mandated a maximum of two years of parental leave for workers but few outside the government sector took it private employers also rebelled the government reformed the 2002 law so that employers better know what they're expected to offer in terms of leave and then extended it to cover small businesses since small businesses employ the majority of taiwanese this is a big deal measures were also proposed to try to influence the social stigmas and difficulties around child bearing new protections were extended to smaller employers in order to get them to offer better child care services for the pregnant workers health education curriculums were reformed so that couples can better understand and plan out their families lastly measures were undertaken to explicitly encourage marriage namely to improve the societal and financial opportunities for marriage these moves are in line with similar reforms passed in japan why would policy focus on marriage i want to briefly discuss this because it confused me too at first the reason is that in east asia childbirth almost always happens within the context of marriage this is especially the case if the country culture is identified as being confusion or confucian influence very rarely do we see births out of wedlock recent statistics show that the share of non-marital births in taiwan is four percent as compared to 1.5 percent in south korea and 2 in japan europe for their part underwent the demographic transition as early as the 1970s but similar declines in european birth rates by married couples have been slightly ameliorated by births out of wedlock by cohabiting couples or single parents that has not happened in taiwan nor other parts of east asia likely due to a lack of acceptance by society so basically as a result marriage rates foretell child birth rates policy makers have taken it to be that if people get married they are likely to soon have children it's a leading indicator so rising singlehood rates in taiwan have been a real concern and yes we're taking into account cohabitation rates as well the percentage of men and women at the age of 50 who never marry have risen throughout the years again a trend across multiple asian countries and for those who do marry they're doing so at a later age the average age for a woman's first marriage in taiwan as of 2015 is 30. people have given all sorts of reasons for this their entire theses done on it but we're not going to go into that as it is out of the scope of this specific video but i found it unique enough to mention regardless the taiwanese government has been mostly hands off with regards to this issue and i don't blame them because i have no ideas either i would be remiss if i were to do a video about child bearing preferences and not mention many of the other reasons cited for why couples aren't birthing kiddos so let's quickly go through some other major factors through the context of taiwan first housing is too expensive house prices are rising everywhere in taiwan but taipei especially the cost of one house is right now many many times the average taiwanese salary and people love complaining about it it's basically a national sport by now often family contributes to the down payment but for those without well-off parents that is not possible and those houses are shoeboxes limiting the size of the household second taiwan needs to address the issue of women's labor participation rates higher participation rates mean delayed marriages and taiwan has some of the highest female labor participation rates at all ages women are more educated in earning more than ever which is great but policy should change so that women don't have to choose between family and work for this taiwan has promoted technologies to accommodate women giving birth at a later age freezing eggs health checks and the like i've started to see this trend appear in america too another issue taiwan is a confusion in society and that means women have to deal with the difficulties of the traditional patriarchal family many married men still don't shoulder their share of household chores and child care responsibilities women end up picking up the slack and end up having to do both their work and household duties as of 2006 men spend half of an hour a day on family matters as compared to women's 2.4 hours oh and then there's the parental in-laws a wife whose mother-in-law does not like her is very soon an unhappy wife furthermore many newlyweds still live with their parents though i was not able to find recent statistics the latest i have come from the year 1985 showing that 67 percent of couples live in their parents home down from 1958's 92 percent so i think that's a good trend related to all the above is the general persistent unfriendliness of taiwanese employers to pregnant women and working mothers i mentioned the government's pledge to promote new measures for working mothers they need to do a better job of applying these to small and medium-sized businesses where enforcement has been spotty another factor has to do with the worsening education arms race in taiwan it's not as bad as south korea yet but children and parents find themselves forced into increasing cycles of education credentialism the existence of cram schools where taiwanese kids are grinding their way through books late into the night has lasting effects on both parent and child we also have to mention general uncertainty about the economic situation for single taiwanese men especially economic instability is the biggest reason why they are not yet comfortable to marry and thus reproduce 41.6 percent of unmarried men and 22.6 percent of women say it is because they are in an unstable economic situation i've done a video about taiwan's persistent low-wage issues that i think you might be interested in all of this should be of no surprise to you you will find similar answers if you ask young americans and that makes sense because this is a global issue east asia's pro-nato policies have largely failed to do what they've set out to do governments have enacted creative and far-reaching policies to try to incentivize more babies some more than others but the prevalent theme remains that none of it has really worked and taiwan is no exception now you can argue that these policies still fall far short in magnitude at actually fixing the problem at hand and that's definitely a valid argument singapore for instance has arguably gone further than any other country in providing financial support but even with that families still have to share over 60 percent of the child care burden more when you count college tuition bane of any american parent furthermore in the specific case of taiwan the government has done less than japan or singapore for example in implementing pro-nato policies the bare minimum so to say but there can also be something else and bear with me here for a bit in a place like singapore or china where a governing party can simply decide things the government could announce a policy change and pivot accordingly for instance when the singapore government failed to raise its natural birth rate it began promoting immigration as the alternative but when taiwan faced a similar situation in the 1990s it had already by then transition to being a vibrant democracy that meant a public debate about the merits and drawbacks of pro-nato policies and suddenly became that when a government official started talking about aging population and demographic transition ordinary people replied back with overcrowding and better quality of life this popular discomfort has contributed to the general slowness and policy response by the taiwanese government and that makes me wonder perhaps this persistent low fertility is a sign that government policy makers and their governing populations are not aligned in their goals maybe people just don't want as much children and people in their country as governments want i'll end with this a child is a responsibility and to be forced into raising one lead to a disastrous situation for both parent and child governments implementing pro-natal policies want ever-growing populations and productive wealthy workers to tax is that what a mother or father gets up in the morning for so i'll leave you that to think about all right you guys take care of yourselves stay safe out there um if you want to support the agentometry
