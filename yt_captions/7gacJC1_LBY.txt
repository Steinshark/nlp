the modern advancements that overtook jobs that 
were essential at the time all share one thing   in common no one saw them coming imagine if you 
were in the early 1900s editing encyclopedias   you would have thought the sound of wikipedia 
or what wikipedia is is crazy and the tech   industry is no different jobs that used 
to be essential are becoming obsolete   but there is a flip side to this as rapid 
advancements continue to grow in technology   the opportunity to grow with technology 
and grow our skills with technology   exists think back to 100 years ago what were 
the most popular jobs back then well for one   farming was a big one imagine farming without 
the technology we have today it was more about   the number of people that they could actually get 
to help the number of hands i could help and when   technology came along farming and a lot of the 
jobs that went along with it left actually fun   fact for you over 100 years ago there was double 
the amount of machinists and tool makers needed   thanks to automation and increasing advancements 
in technology a lot of these jobs became obsolete   and there are so many more examples just like 
this think about the advent of renewable energy   and how many jobs that cut for miners and coal 
mine workers mass-produced fast fashion largely   overtook independent seamstresses automobiles 
replaced horse-drawn carriage and the list goes on   and it really encompasses every industry so who 
are we in the tech industry to think that we are   untouchable because we're definitely not i feel 
like i'd be doing this list injustice if i didn't   list this one first which is cyber security 
cyber security is no longer a nice to have or   a want it is a need it's an essential need for all 
companies if they are hoping to grow and survive   and cyber security the stats around it on how 
many jobs are needed that are not filled right now   if you are looking for a job look no further it 
is so in demand not only now but it will continue   to be in the future and cyber security is one 
of those things this area this whole bubble of   cyber security that whether you're an engineer 
a cyber security specialist an analyst there is   a role for you and you might be asking tiff well 
how do i get into cyber security do you have to go   back to school do i have to go back to university 
and the answer is no there are so many different   roles within cyber security that you do not need 
to go back to school for that you don't need to   learn how to code for i mean hey if you are a 
coder and you want to get into cyber security   it is a great great thing to do and there's 
a lot of courses that i'll list them here   that really help you get up and running with them 
but going back to school or doing formal learning   doesn't have to be the only way in order to get 
into cyber security and it's one of those things   that even as more jobs become automated cyber 
security will actually continue to go up and up in   demand because as things become automated the need 
for cyber security the need to prevent hacking and   predict uh hackings that are coming up will become 
more and more intimate so cyber security i would   say is probably no not probably is the safest the 
safest bet if you are someone who really wants to   get in an industry like a secure industry the way 
to go and next up is the cloud and well we kind   of are in the clouds right now i'll do a little 
screenshot we ended up going on a little bit of   a trip and i'm finishing the video or parts of 
the video with you on vacation because why not   the cloud whether it be engineering whether 
it be analysts the cloud is growing actually   i recently did a blog article on the cloud and 
companies that are adopting to the cloud it's 97   so the cloud not only is currently in demand but 
the future is going in the direction of the cloud   imagine even before we had this you know 
everyone was locked down shut down from home   the cloud was already going in that direction 
but it really accelerated the pace of it   since the lockdown happened since we have been 
at home for so many years now it feels like i   mean now where things are opening up of course but 
that really accelerated the cloud and the cloud is   going to continue based on data based on numbers 
to be so in demand and of course cloud engineers   uh analysts another great thing for clouds as well 
is developer advocates they really fit into the   cloud because there are so many roles that they 
can play as far as educating other developers   about the cloud next on the list and i'm sure 
there's no surprise here is ai and machine   learning and now you might be saying tiffel is 
that kind of a twofold though because is ai and   and ai engineers or ai experts really going to be 
in demand because the more we create ai the more   ai can create itself and itself sufficient we're 
looking way too far ahead here the reality is   now and in the future skills around ai artificial 
intelligence machine learning whether you are   an ai engineer whether you are a software 
engineer especially in ai anything like that   will continue to be more and more in demand 
excuse me i'm a little bit out of breath   we're in the mountains right now and the elevation 
it's actually like they say it makes it harder to   breathe if you're not used to it it really does 
and you know we could keep on going with this   list with cyber security ai data science coding 
in general a ton of soft skills but i wanted to   do something fun where i list a little bit of 
put you into this world where it's the future   and specific roles that pertain to the topics we 
spoke about today and really get you to visualize   what the future of jobs what the future of work 
could look like jobs in the future that don't   exist today okay well the first one that i've read 
about which i think is really interesting is an   aerospace taxi so taking people from earth to 
mars to the moon and it happens very quickly this one that really stood out to me because 
we're really not that far away in the grand   scheme of things that something like this could 
happen another one that really stood out to me   is a hologram graphic or hologram fashion designer 
and this one stood out to me because it actually   exists today as far as if you think about the 
metaverse and all the video games out there   different things like that and with holographics 
coming to be such a huge thing the reality is that   designers fashion designers in that area focusing 
on fashion in the metaverse is going to continue   to be a huge thing as major brands continue to 
break into that area another one on the list that   i can just like i have such a strong visual for 
is manager of robots so this isn't robots managing   you it's you managing robots so really what that 
is or entails anyways is the description they   gave is imagine you're going into starbucks you're 
walking into starbucks and there's a robot working   maybe it's in the form of a tablet or maybe 
it's in the form of a human however you want   to look at it but who's managing those robots 
is a human you know making sure they're doing   what they're told they're functioning accordingly 
and that to me was so interesting now will this   actually become a thing maybe i'm not certain 
but it's very fun to look ahead to the future   at jobs that do not exist today but the trends 
that they're kind of leading towards that   that they might exist i'm curious on that note 
though what are some jobs that don't exist today   that you think might exist in the future leave in 
the comments below let's have some fun with this   okay i hope you enjoyed this video 
going through what jobs and really what   sectors in tech are going to continue to be 
so in demand in the future and i really like   doing these kind of videos looking ahead based on 
data based on numbers based on the demand as to   what sectors or roles in those sectors will become 
more and more in demand because i know a lot of   you are either in tech or wanting to break into 
tech and having an understanding of the kind of   direction you can skew your career to make sure it 
stays in demand and that you stay really relevant   with your skills tech in general you're going to 
have to always be learning and evolving if you   want to stay in demand and as long as you are 
learning the right things things that we just   spoke about today areas we spoke about today you 
as a person will continue to be into math so i   really don't want this video to scare you that oh 
if i'm not in one of these sectors i won't be in   demand no just start maybe shifting your learning 
to one of these sectors is a great way to go thank you all for watching this video i hope 
you found it very helpful and valuable leave in   the comments other topics you want me to cover 
other questions you have make sure to hit that   subscribe button for more tech coding career-based 
videos and i will see you all soon thanks everyone you
