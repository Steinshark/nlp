israel is intel's biggest location outside the united states and the american giant is the country's biggest private employer intel is investing billions of dollars into bulking up its manufacturing capacity and technical prowess israel hosts one of the company's few leading edge fabs outside the united states and plays a crucial role in their new corporate strategy in this video we're going to look at how tiny israel came to be so important to the semiconductor giant but first let me talk about the asian armature newsletter if you subscribe to the channel you should also sign up to the newsletter read the full scripts to older videos and i'll add extra commentary after the fact there's also news that are exclusives you can find a link to the newsletter in the video description below or you can just go to asionometry.com as of right now you can expect a new newsletter every thursday at 1 am taiwan time i have been afraid of doing this video for a long time i am aware that the country of israel and its people are involved in some controversial issues as well as more than a few groundless conspiracy theories this video is going to focus on intel israel i'm not really going to address or discuss the country's other situations i have never been to israel and i am not being paid by them i know that some people are going to be very angry at this their feelings may be justified or not but i ask that you all be civil in the comments section let's start with a brief overview of the country's economic history the state of israel was founded in 1948 in the midst of war after the ceasefire agreements were signed in 1949 the country received nearly 600 000 immigrants this essentially doubled the country's population and strained their resources over the next 10 years the israeli economy was defined by a low exchange rate rationing and price controls the country benefited from large capital inflows due to us aid german reparations and bond sales at this point the government maintained a protectionist economic policy like many other developing countries they focus on developing a domestic textile industry capable of substituting their imports at the same time they subsidize the exports of goods like citrus fruits and cut diamonds to collect foreign currency cut diamonds remain a big part of the israeli export portfolio very slowly over time the government liberalized the economy they lifted trade protections and gradually stopped managing the currency the arab-israel conflict has deep historical roots but especially escalated in the 1960s and continues to this day though its intensity declined in the 1990s the conflict forced the israeli government to dedicate a large portion of its economic budget to defense at its height during the yom kippur war of 1973 the israeli defense budget made up 30 of the country's gnp throughout the 1980s and 1990s the government decreased its involvement in the economy they also started traditional social welfare programs like health care old age pensions and unemployment benefits the 1990s also saw the flowering of the country's high-tech industry the country's close ties to the united states allowed for its people to identify and fill gaps in the market israeli companies have ready access to american capital furthermore they have successfully adopted its venture capital model to create a mini silicon valley of small startups many have been acquisition targets for american companies looking to add interesting technologies or start operations in israel the first major american semiconductor company to set up a design center in israel was motorola in 1964. that center developed some of the company's most famous chips like the 68030 used in the macintosh 2 and next cube motorola still has a presence there to this day though it is not all that large other companies with substantial r d centers in israel include ibm google nvidia facebook and microsoft one of the major reasons why companies invest in israel has to do with its plethora of human capital their population of about 7 million people are highly educated with strengths in the life sciences math physics and computer science israel has more engineers per 10 000 employees than the united states japan and taiwan israel has 135 while america has 70 in taiwan 34. note that this statistic is self-reported by the israeli so of course take it with a grain of salt but the main point is clear lots of smart educated people this well of human capital draws from three significant demographic and economic trends the first trend goes back to the military israeli society is partly defined by its porous boundaries between the civilian and military spheres the israeli army regularly taps the civilian sector for resources and new skills all israeli youth have compulsory military service there the army tries to identify technically talented youth early and nurture their competencies up until the 1980s the israeli military supported the country's electronic sector for instance the development of the lavi fighter based on the american f-16 however domestic military budgets have declined in recent years releasing substantial amounts of skilled human capital into the labor market many commercial innovations thus have some form of military origin like the united states israel is a country of immigrants jewish people have the right to come and live in israel new citizens have generally come in waves the first wave of israeli immigration at the end of the 1940s was quite significant however the biggest and most valuable wave of israeli immigrants would be the ones coming after the collapse of the soviet union in the 1990s from 1990 to 2000 more than a million people came to israel the country's population increased by 20 percent furthermore 60 of those people were university educated and the country doubled its population of engineers and doctors 24 percent of israelis have university degrees and 12 percent of the workforce have advanced degrees israel hosts seven major universities all of them are world class research institutions the computer science department at the technion israel institute of technology is one of the largest in the world it is not enough to just make new discoveries you also have to successfully commercialize them too each university has a transfer of technology office that patents and commercializes university research stanford and mit have similar offices these universities play a big role in fostering israel's high-tech economy but they also have a much more direct role in founding intel israel in 1974 a senior researcher at intel and i'm going to butcher this poor man's name dov froman decided to return to israel to accept the professorship at the hebrew university in jerusalem he had left israel in the 1960s to get a phd in electrical engineering but long wanted to return froman is a very early intel employee and the inventor of the erasable programmable read-only memory eprom before intel became a microprocessing giant the company manufactured memory eprom was its most profitable product well into the 1980s thus the company did not want to lose him so they decided to spend about 300 000 in 1974 to open its first overseas design and development center outside the united states the center was located in haifa intel israel chose to establish in haifa mainly because of the presence of the technion-israel institute of technology haifa however was far from the country's big urban centers tel aviv and jerusalem which made recruitment a bit of a challenge later on until israel would expand to cover much of the country frohman served as intel israel's first general manager they had five engineers and started with small relatively insignificant projects this overseas design center turned out to be very successful they were quickly tasked with designing very complex chips for instance intel israel was assigned the task of implementing the design of the intel 8087 in 1980 notable for its math co-processing notably intel israel continued running even during a series of scud missile attacks during the first gulf war in 1990 some 80 to 85 percent of the employees showed up to work despite the threat of missiles admittedly the actual risk of someone getting hurt was relatively low but it helped send a message to upper management back home that the division delivered regardless of geopolitical risk intel israel's success encouraged other foreign high-tech multinational companies to follow the same model soon thereafter other senior r d managers and national semiconductors and applied materials came to israel to found r d centers there too in 1984 intel israel would expand its operations to include manufacturing in 1978 intel ceo gordon moore visited israel to tour the facilities there and returned impressed froman visited santa clara and pushed then-ceo andy grove to consider putting a semiconductor manufacturing fab in israel at the time the company's american facilities were going through some output shortages andy groves saw two presentations one on israel and the other on ireland he chose the former fab 8 situated in jerusalem was the company's first outside the united states production began in 1985. during the 1990s the jerusalem plant produced 75 of the company's super successful intel 386 microprocessors while it did well it was too small to scale up and was eventually converted into a dye preparation plant by then intel had expanded its manufacturing facilities to the southern city of kyryat got fab 28a opened in 1996 fab 28 producing chips using the 45 nanometer process opened in 2008. the latter cost 3.5 billion dollars like is so often the case in the semiconductor industry intel negotiated a 525 million dollar encouragement investment from the government to help seal the deal recently intel announced a brand new 10 billion dollar expansion to the curiat got facilities backed again as always with a healthy dose of government money the goal for fab 28 would be to produce chips using the 22 nanometer and 10 nanometer nodes that latter node is now referred to in intel marketing as intel 7. this makes intel one of the few countries in the world to host a leading edge semiconductor manufacturing node you can count them on one hand intel's fabs in ireland and the united states samsung's in korea and tsmc's fabs in taiwan in march 2017 intel announced that it would be paying 15 billion dollars to acquire the israeli company mobileye the company provides technology for self-driving cars their scene has intel's bet on the massive future benefits of autonomous vehicles despite making relatively little revenue the company has struck some interesting partnerships with various large companies like nissan volkswagen and bmw in recent years they've been trying to turn their technology into more of a platform accessible by a variety of system integrators intel recently acquired the transit web service move it for 900 million dollars they then added within it an experimental autonomous taxi service powered by mobileye then in april 2021 they announced a deal in which mobileye would provide the autonomous drivers for self-driving delivery vehicles acquisitions like that of intel and mobileye have been an underrated entry point for expanding a multinational's presence in israel few countries are so open to having some of their best acquired by foreigners today the division employs some 10 200 people in 2020 it produced some 8 billion usd for the company in over 40 years of their time there intel invested 14 billion dollars into israel and received over 40 billion dollars of exports the presence of the intel giant and others like it have contributed to a spill over effect first in the form of purchases from local firms intel self-reports that they source supplies and raw goods from some 200 israeli firms three-quarters of which are small or medium-sized and second the company trains skilled workers and managers who leave and bring their skills into the surrounding economy joining or starting small semiconductor businesses of their own however the presence of a fab or design center in a particular city is not game changing to many of its residents for kiryat gat in particular and its working class population of 50 000 many of its unemployed are former textile workers laid off in the 1990s in the 2000s when intel was building their 4 billion fab 28 one might expect massive trickle-down effects on the surrounding population but most of those billions went into capital expenses for fabrication hardware the nature of modern semiconductor manufacturing means that much of the process is automated much of its technicians are from out of town for the local residents hosting a fab has all the economic trickle-down effects of hosting an alien spaceship stole out millions of incentives to build fabs for a multitude of reasons many of them very legitimate but revitalizing the local economy should probably not be one of those reasons kiryat got still has one of the country's highest unemployment rates intel israel is not the only semiconductor manufacturer in the country tower semiconductor is a significant niche manufacturer and i thought their story interesting enough to warrant a small sidebar the company was founded in the early 1990s when it acquired a 150 millimeter wafer fabrication fab from national semiconductor they went public on the nyse in 1994 and have since then added facilities in japan and the united states in 2020 they cleared over a billion dollars in annual revenues their favs are nowhere near the leading edge but their specialization in niche products like optical transceivers and mobile radio frequency chips keeps some in business in a previous video i discussed sky water technologies in the united states they have a similar founding story and business strategy focusing on niche and specialty processes while fabulous and my conductive firms have a lot of great points about them one should not forget the manufacturing piece as well over time that has shrunken even in high-tech israel most recently micron the memory maker sold their chip-making facility to intel in 2013. the israeli government recognizing the importance of having domestically located semiconductor manufacturing facilities has been quite involved they have given tower subsidies and tax breaks and use them as a customer you want to strike a balance when it comes to inviting large multinationals into your developing country you can learn and gain a whole lot from them but there is a risk that they take advantage of what you have to offer and give little in return for instance look at the situation of intel in malaysia the country hosted one of the company's first locations outside of the united states but their semiconductor industry soon found itself caught in the middle challenged by others on cost but without enough skill to ascend the value chain the intel israel situation seems to be one where things are working out right the partnership between the two has yielded incredible benefits for both parties the key difference between intel and malaysia and intel in israel seems to have to do with the activities being offshored in the case of the former intel needed only as workers hands and fingers in the case of the latter intel was looking to tap its workers minds all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching if you
