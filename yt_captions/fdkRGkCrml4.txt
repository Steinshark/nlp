why why why is everyone obsessed with Fang is it the money the free food the bragging rights or is it the promise of success in Financial Freedom by the way that house that was just shown right there ain't no way you're affording that house on a uh on a Fang salary that is I mean look at this it even has like some person right here hanging out ain't no way that's a Fang salary okay that is like Jeffrey Epstein Island salary okay that that you don't get that you don't get that there okay this person definitely into some weird weird stuff you can just tell right away aspire to be it's become the ultimate end goal for many software Engineers even if only a handful of people ever make it there either way I wanted to find out why everyone seems to be obsessed with these Tech Giants just what was so damn uh Microsoft's not part of fang last time I checked there's no m in Fang okay okay well maybe they're they're recently okay so there is an m in Fang but it's for meta it's not for it's not from Microsoft okay and we all know it's called manga now um and that's okay so yes there is an M but it's not Microsoft special about them to start we need to rewind back to when the term Fang was first coined the AC first came about long ago in 2013 back when some of you were hopefully old enough to know what Zumi's hit Clips in Myspace were Jim Kramer a finance Jim Kramer's only success story is that he was able to say the word Fang okay like that's literally it because his invest like if you follow his Investments it's 30% year-over-year some absurd loss the inverse yeah the inverse Kramer fund is like it it's done super well it's done super super well uh by the way 69% nice nice nice negative 30% is impressive I know it's actually hard to be that bad at investing Guru coin the term Fang yes that's right it was only four letters back then Apple hadn't quite become part of the gang yet these American technology companies represented a rise to exponential Market what that's twice they've showed Microsoft she can't just keep dropping Microsoft in here because Microsoft's not a part of fang okay it's not a part of fang games by doubling their value in the previous 5 years now just to give you a picture of what that looks like here's a look into how Facebook Amazon Google and Netflix were doing back then come 2017 okay so this isn't necessarily uh this isn't what it looks like today I would just like to let you know that um Netflix stock over the last five years has had a little bit different of a ride okay okay like look it just it's not quite the same we've kind of fallen off it's it's it was literally so over but we're so back like we're coming back okay we're we're we've caught back up to 2020 June 2020 times okay Co yeah people thought Netflix was going to live forever during Co people will just sign up indefinitely as if they're permanently locked in we can finally add Apple to the mix as well nowadays however more representative of some of the most prestigious tech companies to work for especially as a software engineer their stereotype is I would I would agree with that whoever works at a Fang company is obviously not only good at coding but probably sexy great communicating uh you know probably is is probably has like more than an eight Charisma on balder's gate you know like all all the things you know what I'm talking about probably I'm just saying probably amazing compensation packages great work life balance and great benefits okay I don't have a compensation package problem okay I'm not trying to compensate for anything okay everything's fine please we don't need to make we don't need to make kind of make those jokes so what's the catch oh you just have to go through the dreaded semi-broken interview process shrunken down to the size of nickels and Dro to the bottom of a blender what do you do you take her flat on your back you just lay back enjoy that grinding data structure by the way that actually is such a good answer if I were to ask a a stupid ass question such as you were a nickel in a blender how would you get out and they said just wait for it to burn out I'd be like like that answer is so good that answer is perfect it's literally a perfect answer uh it's incredible it's incredible that movie isn't half bad the movie really isn't half bad uh ask stupid questions get stupid answers yeah I don't do stupid questions I haven't had a stupid brain teaser question since I uh since I worked at web filings which is now known as worka but they asked me how many waterwing what state has the most water Wing sales per capita and I said what's a water Wing they said oh water wings those little things that they put on their arms and I immediately said ah easy uh the most water Wing sales per capita of any state is clearly Utah they are Mormons and they have a lot of children boom goes the dynamite boom goes the dynamite said that in an interview said that in an interview gave my reasoning bam got hired I will say that I did get hired and algorithms for the next 6 months of your life compete against hundreds of thousands of applicants in order to even get your resume looked at in the first place how'd it go uh not well all right [Music] then it's no secret by the way um if you want your resume to be to be looked at right the thing is is you can't just do what everyone else does that's something that I noticed a lot of people do is they're like okay to get hired I got to just grind leak code I'm going to say I've answered 142 leak code questions uh I'm going to make a portfolio page here's my portfolio page right and they just do each one of those things along the way and they do do the exact same thing that every last other person does stop doing that right like I think what TJ did is way way better he picked the thing he really really likes on the internets and he started committing to it he is a core maintainer of neovim that carries 10 times more Authority than I just got done finishing for 7 leak code problems right it just is not the same you throw a little core maintainer on some very popular like 50,000 star repo you got some you got some you got some credibility that other people just simply don't have le code's good to do learn the handshake right you know they're about to ask you some like okay now you got a bunch of islands sitting in the ocean how many islands do you have I need you to count them you got to know how to do that stupid ass question okay you gotu but at the exact same time guess what how do you stand out that getting into Fang is really difficult it most people never even end up getting past the resum√© screening process let alone actually Landing a job there can we just can we just back up for a quick second I got to see that I got to see that resume again Ask the resume look at that photo smelling what appears to be flowers giving me that High School side look you know what I'm talking about oh hey yeah this is my resume right like I mean that is that's some serious that's that's that's some serious some serious slay right there okay screening process let alone actually Landing a job there her multi monitor set up okay that okay true true in factual by the way this setup right here is pissing me off it's three monitors with with the same image on all three of them I don't like that also left to right that's I I mean I've I've actually never seen a left or right so that's cool never seen that but awesome but nonetheless there's something about this that's making me angry okay actually Landing a job there oh it's get it's merge why do people still pursue Fang Against All Odds every year there are thousands of software engineering roles around the world that go unfilled yet the competition for getting into these top tech companies has become even fiercer the first reason may be obvious but Fang is known for giving huge financial packages to their employees their packages are I hear that helps I hear people tend to like money do you like money I like money we should hang out like that that's like literally a line off of Idiocracy of course everyone wants a huge package okay everyone wishes they had a huge package okay typically broken but hey by the way huge packages they're not uniform at Fang I'll tell you that much down into a base salary sign on B bonus an annual bonus I have never got a sign on bonus most I've gotten one annual bonus in my entire lifetime who here gets all these annual Bon eyes I I've never got a sign on bonus or an annual bonus what is this I want that annual boners got them about are the benefits the compensation package is really important but if you're not getting good Healthcare great maternity or paternity leave or even the ability to get your education paid for you may end up spending most of your compens Netflix has a terrible terrible medical uh uh benefits uh it's designed for single people it's not designed for people with family I pay $1,000 per paycheck pre-tax for medical it is honestly like the worst place for medical like sinks dude America moment oh no no no no that's not an America moment don't worry you pay just as much in your taxes wherever you're from that's the America thing we don't pay any money for for medical okay they're tough guy I'm sure you pay no money for medical it just is magically free somehow yeah it's called taxes okay you just pay a different way station package on those things anyways and Fang is notorious for outbidding its competitors when it comes to these benefits right large pools of talent who don't live around the big cities and aren't willing to move there there are of people in the US um and in Canada and ultimately around the world who I think we and other companies that besides for the fact that Mark Zuckerberg delivers messages like he is actually struggling to breathe while you know he's like the meme where where where he's drowning and someone high fives the person drowning that's like Mark Zuckerberg communicating he he actually seems like he's about to die at any moment go in this direction we'll be able to access well I decided to do some sleuthing to find out that first I wanted to compare compensation packages while browsing through levels.fyi I was able to get a more holistic view of some of the biggest tech companies and their Netflix mention level FYI for those of you who don't know is sort of a real time way of tracking offers for each company in each location for each level real employees enter in this information so it's seen as the closest source of Truth when it comes to comparing salary you know what the good news is is this is all self uh reported numbers and so you know for a fact that people definitely don't lie I mean that's the nice part is people definitely don't lie about salaries ever right like totally a normal thing to do is to never lie ever uh to be completely honest now if we look at Facebook or meta we can see that the average compensation package for an entry-level software engineer is $185,000 that's a whopping sum of money but let's look a little bit closer the base salary seems to be $122,000 a l the stock is 20 stock is kind of confusing because it totally depends on your refreshes and all this uh it can actually be these can be very deceptive so if you work at Facebook your first year could be good right you get all this stuff but you don't get any of this money for the whole waiting for you first aest and then not only that if the next year you don't get another stock grant for another four-year vesting window you effectively lost like 30% of your salary and not only that but when it vests the moment it vests the actual shares you get get taxed on the vest in right2 is pretty good well the problem is 122 most these people are living in cities where 120 is like not great right it's it's $120,000 in San Francisco you're not living a great life okay yeah you're not in The Tender Loin but it's still quite tender where you're at you know what I mean it it a it ain't it ain't it it ain't great being at that right America moment no this exists in Japan and other places too any large city is very expensive it ain't homeless this is facts it's not pod life this is facts uh this this is facts London London's tremendously expensive Tokyo blah blah blah blah blah any large city is expensive anytime you Center a bu of people around a certain area not in Latin America baby yeah I I don't I'm not I'm not uh I don't understand Latin America so I don't I don't really understand any place to tell you the truth I live in I live in rural ass South Dakota you think I understand what other people do okay I lived in the the Bay Area for six years you think I understand I don't understand  is $20,000 the sideon bonus usually goes away after the first or second year and the stock usually sticks around for four years on a schedule so you'll still want to perform well in order to get raises that will eventually make up for the loss of the bonuses not only that but all of these recent salaries are either in California Seattle or New York this greatly skews the data because it's based on cost of living this is a great graph by the way this is a great graph uh yeah I mean we're not as cheap as Wyoming granted but we're still not New York or any of these places right this stuff is all crazy in here right I live right there I lived right in the butthole of California rip Colorado living yeah Colorado sucks dude Colorado sucks AK is very expensive Alaska's super expensive because to get anything up there is really really hard you got to remember that there's like a whole ass mountain range just a whole ass mountain range up there right that you have to go through there's this place called Canada I know I thought it was fake too it turns out it's real and it exists for like a thousand miles before you hit can before you hit Alaska it's crazy it's crazy there's just so much Canada up there it just keeps happening birds are also fake yeah I know we already talked about we already talked about that if a studio apartment costs $1,200 in the midwest it may end up costing $3,000 in the Bay Area this actually that's actually a pretty fair uh assessment a 12 well it's not very fair uh a studio apartment in say Rapid City South Dakota would be you're probably looking at like $600 to $800 maybe even $500 to $700 in the in San Francisco that same exact same apartment will be probably closer to $4,000 cost of living it's it's just different have studioart are all going to be relatively expensive compared to other parts of the country now don't get me wrong these are huge salaries is that your car on the L yeah Jag yeah yeah yeah make a lot of money yeah I do I right for myself how how much money you make I don't know 70,000 last month I'm serious yeah it's just that the sole number doesn't always tell the whole picture now let's contrast these salaries with someone living in the South there's not a ton of data here but it looks like $130,000 is the estimation this salary is way better than getting $185,000 in one of the more expensive cities that's a good point it's a good point become Florida man that's all you got to do all you got to do is become Florida man once you become Florida man you get lower cost of living your salary is not as as much lower and boom now you're loving it okay Florida man become Florida man uh just don't become South Dakota man okay I don't want any I don't want to see a single one of y'all move to South Dakota okay get the hell out of here go to Florida go to Idaho for all I care just stay out of stay out of South Dakota go to Wyoming okay Wyoming needs you because these places are over 25 to 40% more expensive you end up getting a bigger Bank for5 similarly if you're looking for companies in other parts of the country that are still performing well places such as Accenture us B Target American Express just to name a few a the interview process isn't as crazy and B the salaries are pretty comparable in their relative areas when it comes to the benefits don't tell them about Ohio first off um uh Ohio procs uh proximity map right first off you should we're all in danger of Ohio okay do you see this do you see that like you're in Ohio like danger zone I mean I live I I don't even live in the illusion of safety I still have enough time to hug my wife before Ohio You're Not Safe in Montana it's just the illusion of safety everybody knows this okay ain't nothing good about Ohio don't trust it not going to trust it I mean I do like this general advice she's giving Which is that you you don't have to work at Fang to make good money there's this illusion that somehow Fang you make all the money and other places you don't that's not necessarily true and also the inverse of it is also true which is just because you work at Fang doesn't mean you're going to work crazy hours and if you work somewhere else you may actually work crazier hours than Fang the hardest job I've ever had as far as hours went was not a Fang job it was actually uh a startup going into IPO phase right like that was the worst job I've had to do as far as hours went I was working like 80 hours a week constantly like that's really that's really hard harder to find concrete data here it really does depend on each company and how much they value their employees I would look at the type type of healthcare including concentration of in network providers in your area RSA account options and deductibles 401K investment options number of by the way 401K never exceed you know this is not Financial advice but me personally I've never exceed the amount of employer match because 401K is just like not a really it's not a great investment it's not it's I mean it's it's not like a huge W the background music is love I know the background music probably need to chill out that background music um I think this video would be a lot better without background music honestly the match is a w you dou your money spending money for at home office maternity leave and sabatical all of these are important when it comes to calculating your total compensation package so it's a big W for up peons no it it's it's not a big W it's never going to be a big w a Big W would be that you save up and try to get yourself a nice rental uh that's much much much better and that will be better in 20 years Roth IRA significantly better uh ston Market you can pretty much do better if you have a self-directed 401k it's a little bit better right then you get a self-direct but then you got to be a good investor and let's just face it most of you are going to invest like Jim Kramer you're going to be a negative3 okay you're going to be a negative 30% you're going to be Jim Kramer of your life and you're going to hate yourself for it moving on to the second reason which is working with amazing technology every day these tech companies this is such a fallacy but I'm going to I'm going to let her cook and then I'm going to just destroy it all to be in the news when it comes to using the most groundbreaking technology first it was Amazon's cloud services and meta's metaverse and then it was Google's immersive View using advances in 3D mapping machine learning we fusing billions of aial and street level images to create a new High Fidelity representation of a place these breakthrough Technologies are coming together to power a new experience in maps called immersive view it allows you to explore a place like never before there's no doubt uh so I'm going to ruin this now um so working with amazing technology here's the reality of working at any Fang company they've been around for 20 plus years most of the things you're going to be working on the 99% of people they will just simply be working on non-green field projects they'll be working on existing and mainten uh maintenance and new features on an old application okay that's the reality is what does tvi codebase look like we adopted react in 2015 2016 somewhere right in there that means we have class components we have class components with unsafe operations we have higher components tons of higher order components use ref use memo forward ref all that crap everywhere we also have functional components we have hooks we have lots of use effects now we don't have use effects we have all of them all over the place because that is what it looks like maintaining an application longer than you know 30 minutes when people tell you how great something is you got to remember that the reality of larger companies that been around for a long time is going to be an amalgamation of all the ideas that have ever been tried throughout web Technologies for the last 15 years and it's just going to be an emotional burden to go through that and it's a continuous practice of trying to upgrade what was into what will be it is a unique experience so do you get to work with awesome technology not always sometimes you do there are times where you get to kind of like create something that's cool but the reality is that's not uh always a real thing you know what I mean that a lot of these tech companies house some of the most interesting projects and use the coolest technology so is all of this hype even true well it's definitely true that these companies have to work at a tremendous scale compared to other companies so in that sense they are more efficient about solving problems take into you're you work in a 30-year-old Java code base Java's not 30 years old dog Java got Java was released in what 1996 when was Java uh created 1995 boom it's only 29 years old so suck it okay I'm I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt okay it's not even 29 it's technically like 28 and a half okay uh almost 30 just sorry sorry I just mythbusted that one so hard okay I you know I'm sorry I you know I work at also a sucky one yeah guess what Get Wrecked son um anyways consideration heavy load lots of traffic as well as storing and sorting a huge amount of data this is not always an easy as we do have a limited amount of computing resources to actually deal with all of these transactions they need to learn to take a creative approach to solving these larger [Applause] problems what just got so loud get blow away okay calm down therefore it only seems natural that these companies would reinvest into obtaining the best technology as it directly affects their profit margins investing in new technology takes time and money and sometimes these smaller companies can't afford to pay employees to work on R&D for the sake of innovation you know I've actually had the most unique and cool things I've ever worked on have not been at Fang companies they've actually been at smaller companies and the reason why that happens is that smaller companies are attempting to uh they're attempting to make something new and so you're actually working on something new usually you're working on something that's different yeah sure you're not going to work on react right you're not going to build spelt you're not going to build solid that's something that a big company is going to do or someone that's just staying up all night programming by themselves are going to do you're not going to work on some super cool open- Source thing but you're definitely going to work on way more the chance of unique technology per square inch is way larger in a smaller company than it is in a bigger company for sure absolutely because you got this whole age problem you have what are you trying to innovate on right it's just different you know it's just different uh small startups is where I did the most new cool projects in Elixir yeah yeah however because these companies are also creating a lot of the new tech they're also confined to using their own Tech to hit the bottom line for example it would make more sense for Amazon employees to use AWS versus gcp or Azure isn't that right Hey where's chel tastic is that what happens over at twitch you guys use an AWS technology at twitch of course you are okay we all know what happens Amazon bought you took your delicious video algorithm turned it into a service and you know what they're going to do with that they're going to sell it they're going to sell it to kick okay they're selling it to kick.com competitor kick is currently paying Amazon probably more than they make from twitch to have an experience like twitch okay like we already know what's going on here okay the financials have been thought through here okay this is not some crazy experience they know they know for a fact they're like ah man how are we going to ever make money and not have to worry about advertising or moderation or anything oh I got an idea let's just sell video as a service regardless of if the ladder was a better option if Amazon doesn't even use its own product why would others follow suit because of this people at Google may be confined to using angular even if reative imagine hey man I'm GNA go work at Google I'm G to go work on an amazing project hey so we're going to need you to make a small upgrade to one of our Legacy projects it is and happens to be angular 1.6 and we're going to need you to bring it into modernity is that a problem it should be but before you do anything we want you to write a technical artifact about how you how one would go about doing it then we want you to start going about doing it to take a quick break write another technical artifact on how you are planning to accomplish each individual hurdle and then at the end I would like you to actually document the project because before we didn't document it and now it's your responsibility to document this heap of trash fire or people at Microsoft may only use C in the net what framework rather than exploring Java or cotlin so in a way it's a cycle of Independence that ends up severing the sharability of tech between companies and at the end of the day one company can't make the best solutions for everything so it need I really actually liked that last uh image right there this is we talk about this quite a bit that we have I think all large companies have this problem which is reinvent the wheel syndrome right okay C is not the best make the best solutions for everything that's one problem about working a larger company you will end up having you have literally a product that's like something that exists in open source it's just not as good and locked into um and locked into your infrastructure so you're like yeah we also have Docker but it's not as good Docker it's like not Docker okay it's like kind of you know you know it's like the same thing right like it's it can be very painful not be created by other companies looking at Target a retail company they acted very much so like a tech company they did have some in-house products such as their cicd process but they also had the freedom to be language agnostic between each team they chose rust on problem each team had to tackle they weren't confined to the language they most recently created or the framework that they had patented mostly because they never actually created those things in the first place that's that I mean I would say that if you if if you don't have that problem obviously you're going to choose cobal the world's greatest programming language of all time uh that's probably what Target uses right now I mean it's been around since you know the 60s obviously obviously it has a lot of uh it has a great standard Library it's been welld developed and maintained it's probably one of the best out there another problem with this perception is that a lot of the groundbreaking projects that make it the news are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to available work at these companies the sheer reality is that Google was specifically hire PhD candidates that have spent their entire lives researching human computer interaction when it comes to creating lifelike service robots that interact with people at a checkout lane they won't be looking Nothing by the way look at that chicken neck you could if you're wondering what a chicken neck is it's when your ear exceeds your shoulders and you keep on lining it they call that chicken necking okay this man is chicken necking on his multi thousand laptop just get an effing monitor okay get a setup what is this chicken chicken man to the selftaught or bachelor degree engineer that's not chicken necking you most likely be working on you still have the same image on three things we got to work on this okay you can't have all these monitors you can't be you can't do this you can't have all these monitors just to have the same thing on three different sides okay we need you to pick this up okay changing the interactivity of a website add already existing repo that lives deep within the company now don't get me wrong the Engineering Process is still really fun but know different than working for a midsize or unicorn company in fact because of okay I thought this said weap okay I thought it said weap I I didn't realize it said we work okay um I I wasn't going to say anything but that's what I saw because it said flip cart here and there's also a p and my dyslexia put it all together and I got weap and I thought that was pretty inappropriate I didn't realize that that was like the 14th largest company I should have known better that if it was called weap it'd probably be number one beating out ant Financial in Uber of less resources being available at these smaller companies it's actually more likely that you'd get more responsibility quickly at these other companies so it's really up to you whether or not you want to be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond what happened if you're a small fish in a small pond just saying I always thought I was going to be a small fish in a small pond instead I'm just a small fish in a bigger Pond now it's the same thing just the pond keeps lastly perception humans really care what other people think of us it doesn't matter how much weting to describe some tell think about what we're trying to describe here what am I trying to describe with this image okay this is like the one piece when the guy was dancing around with the sword naked you're just trying to figure out what the hell is this image trying to do because then it just makes no sense any further like the rest of his character changes completely it doesn't matter how much we convince ourselves that we don't care some innate biological level it does make us feel better when people think highly of us it gives us a sense of selfworth and this is hard toin people to change it's a human trait rather than a physical goal it just takes time and practice to let go of others opinions and form your own and choose what's best for yourself I'm not trying to persuade you not to work for Fang rather to be more holistic when choosing a company my biggest issue with this acronym is the fact that it's a Hal truth Fang used to represent exponential market growth for American tech companies but the acronym still hasn't changed since then market growth changes all the time which means we need to adjust our view of what Prestige even means facts Netflix clearly fallen off by the stock we've already talked about this we've already looked at the stock but let's just look at it one more time okay by the way if you're wondering trash Dev started on this day okay trash Dev started October 29th 2021 look at what happened to Netflix stock afterwards Netflix has completely fallen off since trash dev has been hired you can tell right away it was Netflix's big mistake is hiring trash Dev uh what are we going to we're we're still trying to recover from hiring him it's absolutely awful if you don't know who trash Dev is then uh obviously you're more trash than anybody else okay you shouldn't admit that out loud if you don't know who trash Dev is apparently my autocomplete left me he was here earlier I I mean I'm telling the truth he really was in this case for example Netflix by the way this your alone Netflix is at an all-time low okay this feels a little unfair I feel like you're targeting me um again trash Dev right here everybody trash Dev right there all right pre-at pre-at triggered triggered it no longer fits this definition oh so you're saying we're out of fang you won't I know for a fact you will not take the N Out of fang Try It Make My Day make it go for it go for it go for it give it a shot companies like square and Microsoft have been doing pretty well for themselves not only that but there are so many fintech and unicorn companies out there that have a much higher rate of return if they end up going public there are plenty of software engineer that end up getting rich from accepting oh my goodness because even if if you try to say well we don't do Fang anymore and we changed it to manga well guess what drop the end from that one you got Maga you got Maga or that other word that I'm not allowed to say and guess what I don't think it's going to work well for either of those two abbreviations okay you're not winning any of these arguments so good luck good luck guy drop Netflix I Dare You stock in a private company only to be bought out or go public later and make a killing eventually Cramer publicly announced his new version of the acronym Fang to Mama meta Amazon Apple Microsoft and alphabet this may stick around for a while until it changes once again I'm out I'm out they did drop okay well I didn't see that one coming okay I didn't see that one coming okay dang it got to go work at meta now now however you won't I want to be able to get in that sweet mama don't see anyone referring to the top tech companies as mama bang is an acronym that is here to stay for whatever reason although the meaning has been diluted over time that baby still represents the same level of wealth that brought people into this industry years ago at the end of the day regardless of how true these factors may be they measure quantifiable results that look good on Des yeah hell yeah that's this is actually how I how I plan my projects is I draw a 3D Furniture representation of what I'm about to okay it's not a dress desk okay I realize that it's not a desk paper it's amazing to have a fan company on your resume or tell wait do you guys actually put photos on your resum√©s I have never put a photo on my resume I need to get a sweet high school photo with me doing that I need to do that I need to do this no stop saying no we're all doing it okay we're all in it together okay every chel tastic you're in it with me we're all taking photos high school style and we're going to get this done at family dinner parties that you're a software engineer in big Tech but what we don't always measure is we're in this wild frenzy towards obtaining a job is how well we fit into the Team Dynamics if there's a range of opportunities to learn and take on are there more responsibilities is there a good work life balance there's no use working at one of these companies just to get burnt out within the next 3 years that doesn't end up being sustainable in the long run working in the software engineering industry I would argue that uh working in a Fan Company you probably have less chance of burnout and I would argue that uh working at a smaller company you probably have more chances of burnout I really think that work life balance is probably worse in a lot of these other companies than it is in Fang if you wish to climb the ladder at Fang of course you got to play by the game which means that you have to be the hardest worker which means yeah you're probably going to go for Burnout you're probably going to have to work super ultra ridiculously hard you're going to have to work like 90 hours a week if you wish to be the the tippity of the top uh because the competition's internal competition and only the top what half% are going to keep on Rising you're going to have to live in Ohio it's like terrible but uh the reality is for those that don't want to live in Ohio for those that don't want to be a part of that they're going to just they don't you don't have to do that right that is not a requirement isn't just about coding it's also a feeling of being needed much like any other job if you're a valuable contributor to your team and have a good relationship with your teammates boost your motivation and curiosity even more because nothing makes you feel more valued than when you work at a job and everyone's friends and everything's going great and then they just fire your friend and they're just like well he didn't cut it nothing like a nice small company to fire your friend and now your family is broken and now I'm interviewing for other families all of a sudden I have lots of family potentials it's like all of a sudden everybody wants to be a family member with me okay I don't really get that how many families doesn't want every day just some food for thought hopefully when it comes time to make the big decision and jump to a company you'll make one that's right for you you mean c it okay first off don't call CID you cannot you cannot possibly I don't know if I'm even saying CID correctly but Ohio is CAD completely completely Fair um okay so I actually there's actually a lot of things I really liked about this video I was really genuinely surprised there's a lot of things I genuinely liked about this video which I really enjoyed the fact that uh talked about that that Fang isn't the end all and it's probably not even the best honestly I don't think Fang represents anything special these days uh there was a time I think that Fang was really really special and that time probably died out by 2015 uh you know it was it was a genuinely super hard thing to get into it was super super competitive uh it was super super all the fun stuff I mean even representing money it's no longer that's not even true anymore right there's plenty of there's plenty of companies now these midsize larger siiz companies that are hiring Tech workers for pretty much the same thing you just get more in stalks right you get more ownership you get more say so is it true I don't know if it's true anymore like I I don't really buy any of that and so I I do think that that's a really great Point as far as the technology goes you'll probably work on the worst and most boring technology at a Fang company if you join one uh I think that you're going to find a lot of things that are going to be boring and not awesome Fang companies can I think the thing is is that at a Fang company you have the chance for higher pay way easier right you have a you uh you have a much higher chance for pay is paying with Equity even paying though of course it just depends on the company uh would you take a bunch of stock in a publicly traded company yeah why not it's the same thing you're getting money it's just in the form of stock if you work at a company in which you inherently don't think is going to go up why the hell are you working at a company in which you inherently don't think is going to go up work at a company in which you believe that the future is bright and then get stons in it so that your money multiplies you don't get some stupid ass stock that you never believe in right it would make no sense don't believe in don't work at a company you absolutely don't believe in unless if you absolutely have to have a job right that like that makes no sense right so they can sell it from under you that is literally not how the stock market Works what are you saying who's selling your stock out of underneath you okay if you don't understand how the stock the stock market works that's okay you don't have to understand you don't have to do that all right I want startup stocks yeah startup stocks are really great if if you think the stock the stock market's going to make it uh that's I mean that's your real chance to build a lot of wealth but you got to remember that any startup has like one in 1000th chance to make it to like round B and if you're going to make it to round B you still have like another one in thousandth chance to make it into like an IPO where you can actually sell your stons right or to be bought by a company it's like like such a small chance so working in a startup great are you going to become rich working in a startup right like most people just lose all their money at a start at a startup invest in Bitcoin yeah you could just invest in Bitcoin clearly make all of your money because we all know that the future is going to be clearly Bitcoin okay I'm going to go to the coffee shop I'm going to pay bam and we're going to wait for the transaction to be verified IED okay and it's going to be great then they're going to give me my coffee some percentage of an hour later it's going to be beautiful uh anyways invest in yourself um pay you got a huddle I know who pays who who buys coffee look at that guy that's like a gasm face if I've ever seen it uh anyways I liked it I lik the video I actually did like the video I I like the video I think it was well done I think it was well done and I think that it it hit on a lot of good points uh that people don't necessarily think through especially young especially younger Engineers they really like to just imagine this like this just incredible place that exists and then every everywhere else is shitty when it's probably more the inverse Fang companies are large probably filled with process and harder to move in younger smaller companies startups you can move really fast and do a lot of cool stuff that's probably that's probably the reality okay hey the name is the fanga Jen
