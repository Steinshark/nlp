ladies and gentlemen welcome to the final game of the World Chess Championship 20 23. it's yanyupomichi of Russia zingler and of China it's game 14 out of a possible 14 games in the classical section and whoever wins this game becomes the world champion replacing Magnus Carlson six and a half for both players dingley run has white I got nothing else to say buckle up here we go ding throughout this match has played either D4 or C4 and he has avoided main lines while this game and whoever has played white in this match has had the upper hand except for one game ding does in fact play the move Pawn to D4 Yan responds the same way he has responded now for two World Championship matches and after D4 Knight F6 C4 E6 ding plays Knight C3 this is the second time in this match that he has played Knight C3 allowing a nimso Indian the last time he played the Nim so it was very very wild line uh this is also the third time in this match this specific move order was chosen uh you'll remember that that in in one of the early games Jan played D4 and uh and then taking played D5 on on move three so we have a nym so we have the move E3 we have castles and in the last game that they played where ding played a nimso Indian which is one of the most complex openings in chess in this position he played the move A3 and some time later he played 92 Knight here and played Rook A2 and that was the day of the massive prep League that was the day that it was discovered the two Anonymous accounts had been training together on both major chess websites and seemingly that was ding's account all right uh while this time ding still plays a sideline on move 5 but not a bad move at all he plays Bishop D2 now the idea of Bishop D2 is that you don't ever have to take the pawn the Knight with a pawn you don't ever have to damage your pawns and instead you will always be able to do this which in and of itself is an advantage black plays the move D5 a very principled response and now ding is like excuse me take my knight and Jana's like no because that's why you put your Bishop there now I'm gonna go back all right now you may ask yourself why would he move a piece two times why doesn't he go forward well if you don't have a good reason don't trade a bishop for a knight in this case black no longer has a good reason because he's not damaging anybody's pawns and black is able to afford playing these two moves because white developed in a pretty weird way the bishop on D2 now doesn't really fulfill its Journey kind of like in the house of the Dragon right you gotta you know The Descendant is trying to go here and evolve well this person is not going anywhere so now the bishop is just sort of stuck so Knight F3 anion plays C5 uh the best friend of the d-pawn is the C Pawn and uh as you can see in Queen spawn positions we have a cube very quickly the cube it gets completely obliterated Pawn takes Bishop takes and takes takes and Knight bd7 and black will probably try to develop this bishop out this way uh and uh we have Rook D1 centralizing The Rook now you'll notice the ding is down a lot on the clock uh that's kind of weird I don't know why he spent 13 minutes on this move I think he's sort of just trying to improvise I mean it's still the opening and it's a relatively innocuous position so don't really know why again like I I am a little bit perplexed why that is happening but uh you know such as life Rook Z1 and now Jan for the second time in this game goes Bishop E7 so Jan has made 11 moves and four of them have been with his Bishop Bishop B4 Bishop E7 Bishop back out to C5 Bishop E7 like a slinky you know wow or is that a slingshot all right whatever both they're fun slinkies are the things you used to put on the stairs I'm a 1995 kid all right that's what I did in my childhood in and out of watching like Dragon Tales or whatever uh Knight G5 here is a very aggressive move and in this position ding decides I don't want to go you know quietly into that good night and instead I'm gonna play the move Knight to G5 and I want to Checkmate my opponent because that decides the game now probably he's not going to play Queen H7 some of you might play that move he won't play that move but the real question about Knight G5 is what the heck are you gonna do about the move H6 like I've just done a few chess lessons with Frank you don't know who Frank is uh learn who Frank is he's a rapidly uh growing chess Prodigy and I've I told Frank to stop making these random Night Moves when they can be attacked well well well well ding plays H4 ding plays what is known as a fish hook fish bait whatever you want to call it fishing pole point is black has castled white hasn't and if you take this you lose I mean you just lose you you don't move your knight and get mated in one move but the pressure here is too strong on on the file it's actually a very very useful idea Knight G5 H6 uh for beginners and intermediates I mean this is basically like game over I mean once you play H4 the other person will just malfunction but Jana's 27.95 um and uh he plays the move Queen C7 now of course he did spend some time Queen C7 actually is the best response basically ignoring this like a crazy person on a New York City subway uh and queen here hits the bishop and basically just continues to develop and ask questions to White's position now dink here spends a little bit of time and by a little bit of time I mean 22 minutes uh and he it's not that he spent 22 minutes uh realizing his Bishop was hanging the bishop move has massive consequences and by going to E2 I mean he's basically completely taking his eye off this Pawn because you understand he could have also went to B3 but probably he did not like something over here and I mean he can sacrifice his right to Castle but uh black has to trade a few pieces and then at some point he will be able to take this Knight so Bishop B2 and uh Jana's much better he's up 40 minutes on the clock with black this is nuts I mean ding was supposed to be the one playing for a win not supposed to but he's white all right he's playing with the white pieces white has had massive success in this match and it seems like the pressure is simply getting to him now here the best move was B6 apparently uh and then uh you're trying to get the bishop out and if something like Rook C1 the best move was Queen B8 I feel like if you play B6 Queen B8 they gotta they gotta scan you or something I don't even understand this stuff yam plays Rook d8 bringing a rook to the to the center the board absolutely nothing wrong with this move and now Rook C1 and now Knight f8 all right Knight f8 you know what they say Knight f8 never mate nobody's ever getting mated on the H7 square and by the way now taking on G5 could very well be a threat for instance before uh take take uh you have backup so you can move the other night so we have Knight E4 Knight takes E4 Knight E4 and a trade and there looks to be an end in sight all right this setup did not work by ding and we're headed for a draw and if this game ends in a draw it's going to be 7-7 and then we're gonna take a break and tomorrow we are going to play tie breaks and a classical world championship match will be decided by speed chess just like everybody wanted um I'm joking but at the same time you do need a way to break a tie in 19 I believe it was 84 karpov Kasparov went three months I don't think we won a match that goes three months I mean I would make tremendous ad revenue on it but um yeah that match was first to six wins and nobody won six games it was deleted basically the match was interrupted so somebody has to break the tie and it looks like that's where we're headed Bishop D7 why am I saying that well the eval says it so that must be true uh they have two Rogues they have Knight Bishop Bishop they have the exact same material they have the exact same pawns a b e f g h they I mean it's gonna you know and then here's something weird happens ding plays Bishop B4 now there is nothing really weird about that move it's just the bishop trade but he's damaging his own pawns I mean he did not have to do that he could have played Bishop C3 and Bishop C6 and Bishop F3 and I don't know Knight here Rook C1 brought it but clearly ding was disturbed by the fact that he thinks black is probably getting active too quickly Knight G6 Knight G6 not Knight G5 so he goes here and Jan grimaced when he saw this move he sat down and was like what take take and Bishop C6 and Jan is better Jana's better and he's up 27 minutes this is really bad this is really really bad and it gets worse it gets worse Knight C5 played by dingley Ren in this position sacrificing a pawn just giving it up completely could he have done anything else he could have played passively could have went here Knight G6 he could have tried to get this kind of an end game you know 95 attacks the Pawn King E2 instead ding is just unraveling I mean he's sacrificing a pawn in an otherwise balanced end game-ish position this is wild Rook to G1 and in this position Jan needs to choose between these two moves it's more accurate to go here why because after the move B5 he comes back and after the move E4 he doesn't move his Bishop anywhere he plays B6 a very important you take the bishop they take take and it's actually black who emerges up a pawn with white having three massive Pawn Islands You Can Count this as a double Island if you want Knight E6 is coming in black is playing for a win you put Magnus here with black he wins 99 games out of 100 and that 100th game I don't know he fell asleep at the board I mean this is a very very bad end game so Jana has to find the right retreat of his Bishop he has to go Bishop C6 inducing B5 and then this young doesn't in fact look at how much time Jan spent 58 minutes on the clock he doesn't notice the subtle difference and the difference with this move order is after E4 ain't nobody going B6 because this Pawn is not on B5 so after take take I don't have a pawn here I can just do this that's that's there's a massive difference but he has an hour on the clock the nerves are in the stratosphere what's beyond that I don't even know some something I just make chess videos and if you study the layers of the animal I had to learn that in school then I forgot just like everything else Bishop C6 though now there is no B6 this trick does not work and Jan's Bishop is booted out of the position now Jana's still doing fine uh and ding collects the pawn he gave the pawn he gets it back uh and now Jan does something absolutely fascinating so in this position black can play Rook D7 attacking the Knight but Jan plays this inducing the move Rook C4 offering a trade and simultaneously defending the pawn and then he goes here what the heck is the difference this is how chess Grand Masters think this position is the right way to do this why because if you do this with the white Rook two squares back then after the move Knight to C5 and Rook to C7 there is a pin and The Rook is way way further back right so the Rook for white is way further back but the Knight can still be supported okay that's number one but the the craziest detail here is the fact that if the Knight goes out this way black will mobilize and come here that's the threat and there is Rook G4 protecting that however if black plays the move Rook D4 first then after this this nobody can go here because Knight G6 Rook G4 there is a fork by inducing white to play The Rook forward you have now removed the option to bring the Rook to G4 this is some this is some giga brain stuff all right that is why Jan played Rook to D4 first so that his opponent plays a rook move and then he attacks the Knight and now the Knight can go here so in this position ding plays this instead incredible all right Rook C7 ding drops back with the rook and now he's enabled the movement of his Knight and now disaster strikes Rook C8 played by Jan ding defenses Knight in this position ding had a miracle defensive move by the way he could have put the Knight back on B7 he could have gotten out of danger by using the fact that that Rook is hanging against Jan and then after Rook C3 bc3 white cause King D2 and suddenly is going to quickly win that pawn back he doesn't see that he plays here Knight D7 oh God dingly Ren is at his biggest disadvantage of the game so far Rook to G3 what ding had to do in this position was bring his King trade the pieces and play Rook B1 and defend his Pawn and he's down upon but he's got activity and he's kind of okay will he hold this I don't know instead dingoes for G7 Jan can play it cool here he could just play G6 he doesn't even need to allow Rook G7 but instead young plays this take take ding's idea is to get this but the black king is just walking to E7 this is a massive massive oversight Bishop D3 played by ding not a bad move rook d8 and now ding has a choice how can he defend this he's gotta probably do it with the King okay now King D2 is a little bit terrifying because you're walking into a pin so obviously ding as a human is like I'm not gonna do that I'm probably gonna go King E2 instead and just so you understand defending like this is probably also possible but ding plays King E2 and essentially loses the game stockfish doesn't even realize because it's on a low depth but after the move Rook C3 black is winning black is winning why is black winning in this position because of the threat of taking the bishop for example if the Rook comes back black wins Rook D3 takes Bishop B5 game over you can defend the Rook but I'm gonna go take take take take this is a winning end game three pawns four pawns my king runs over here you go win this Pawn I win the rest of the pawns not only do I win the game I win the world championship this is nuts Rook C3 and Yankee is winning if we let stockfish run a little bit more you're gonna see it's like minus three the game is over so check King E7 and ding plays here the game is a Jan's gotta play Rook B3 he cannot Rush with this if he rushes with that I do this this is not winning we have the same amount of Pawns Rook B3 is the winning idea Rook B4 Rook B2 a lot of pressure Bishop B5 Jan's Advantage here is minus three According to some of the most powerful computers the computer will realize it and the idea is essentially Rook h8 Rook D4 white can't move a piece white is gonna have to give up the pawn on B5 completely and white is probably going to lose this is nuts this is absolutely nuts it's over 21 minutes on the clock and in this position delivers the most fatal blow of the world championship match and he plays he played E5 he played Pawn to E5 he did not play Rook B3 and Rook D4 he didn't play any of that he went E5 and all of a sudden dingley ran counters with B6 all right this is incredible B6 is a clearance sacrifice it's a sacrifice where you utilize the square a piece used to stand on for a tactic and the idea of the move Pawn to B6 mind you that is the only defensive resource left in this position Pawn to B6 giving up the pawn to sacrifice from the square that you just cleared you give it up rook C3 buckle down let's go rook and three pawns all symmetrical efh versus rook and 4 that's the only Pawn black is still pushing for a win but ding thinks he can hold this position can he though can he hold this position or is Jan going to convert this King D7 White's defensive idea black what does black one push the pawn put the Rook behind the pawn push the pawn White's Rook gets stuck here that that that's winning okay so for example A5 if you wait too long look what happens black is completely winning why is black completely winning because this Rook is hydraulic pressing this Rook if you will and if white walks over to win this Pawn like say let's say King C4 look King before oh wow you won this Pawn yay now they feast so that's essentially the winning idea what is ding gonna do with the King coming he's gonna play Rook F3 he's gonna bother the pawn on F7 black is gonna have to defend the pawn okay and now white is going to play Rook C3 trying to infiltrate and he does King F6 Rook C6 the king hides from checks now Rook here so defending the pawn from the back side not allowing black to hydraulic press so black comes down and also defends the pawn from the opposite side but this is not an advantage now next phase of the game black is gonna try to bring the king over here get rid of The Rook promote the pawn okay here we go King G3 Pawn to H5 moving the pawn out of the way and Yan is pushing the pawn forward closer and closer look at ding's time 22 minutes spent on one king move all right Rook A5 F6 that pawn is now two squares away from queening of course stockfish thinks this is a draw of course it's easy to sit here and and Sarah didn't go oh duh let me turn this off real quick you're all so clever I'm so clever every commentator is so clever it's just the draw so defend the position Rook A6 King F7 black is bringing the king and let it be known you might be confused why was this not taken because rookie won Pawn to A2 you could take my Rook I make a queen you could stop my Pawn I'm still making the queen this is winning all right this is probably winning probably winning why did I say the word probably this is completely winning sometimes my mouth moves faster than my brain all right King E2 King E7 Rook A1 King F7 Rook A2 why did I pause here look at things time five minutes up to 19. Why move 60. this is it this is the final phase of the final game of the World Chess Championship 2014. win this end game now ding gets 30 seconds every time he makes a move but he gets no more bonus time King F3 there he goes King D7 he's making a run for it a calculated Pawn sacrifice to deflect The Rook Rook A6 now Rook B3 White's King is forced back King C7 is on the verge of winning this end game dingley run has one move and one move only what am I talking about well if ding hangs out on the a file King B7 Rook here I'm coming King C6 you can well all right so what king B5 so what the black king is gonna walk right here and escort the pawn okay well well uh fine I mean I'll just bring my king king F1 and I'll run over yup all right let's say you do that King C6 all right I'm bringing my king too they're too slow you don't understand you could bring your king congrats who's gonna guard the pawns all that's easy who's gonna guard the pawns the king is still coming in white is on the verge of being completely lost and dingly ren plays the most clutch move of his entire chess career F4 completely and totally sacrificing upon in order to create a past Pawn of his own just the existence of his Pawn now threatens everything in the black position because black does not have the luxury anymore of running the king forward he still tries King C6 check is given King to B5 Rook to A7 now in this position if Jan makes a run for it so does white if he plays rookie 3 E7 King to B3 oh wait the black king made it but the black king now has to hide in front of his own Pawn that's the point and this is a draw dingley ran four song this position and if King A1 white has the miracle defense Rook B3 sacrificing The Rook to promote the pawn and this my friends is just to draw all the pawns will fall dingly Ren sacrifices his F Pawn to create a pass Pawn of his own not to push it but to constantly threaten like a lifted hand the hand of a fury like if you mess with me I'm coming down with this pawn and Jan tries to move forward he tries many many different ways can he find a way King E7 back rookie three it doesn't matter dingly Ren has found the defensive mechanism to Pro to save this game because now there is an orb around the black king it makes no difference because King G2 King can't go anywhere there it is the pawns are traded Rook takes F4 and in this position game 14 was agreed to withdraw a 90 move six and a half hour Affair nothing to choose between them seven for Yani promise seven for dingly ran and tomorrow we play tie breaks to determine the next World chess champion how do the tie breaks work they play four games of 25-minute Chess a best of four if that is tied two to two they play five plus three second Blitz if that's a tie that goes on a second time and if that's a tie they play three plus two just like on chess.com until there is a winner there is no Armageddon there is no Armageddon they play a Blitz game until the end I will see you all tomorrow when we will Crown a new world champion of Chess now get out of here
