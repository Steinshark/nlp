hi and welcome to this week's meeting C plus plus block rule highlight and in this week I've chosen the article from Raymond Chen from the old new thing uh on why is there make unique and why not just overload the unique pointer Constructor okay and this is rather an interesting and detailed article on going through mostly the last point the other points are just you know have a counterpart to make shared and get rid of you those are things you probably already knew but this argument I just overlooked The Constructor seems to be pretty good why is it not the case and he goes into detail here um perfect wonderful blog post um you learn a lot about C plus plus and API design in this blog post and then I looked up make unique for this uh presentation because you know this in order to know what what make unique was about again and um what you know just how it isn't the standard everybody knows it but what again is make unique and I was kind of surprised to see make unique for overwrite on this page I was like what um and so it turns out when you Google that you find that this exists for uh make shared 2 and actually also for allocate shared and it is something which allows you to to default initialize the newly constructed heat memory and for simpler types like an INT or float this means that you are able to allocate uninitialized memory in a shared pointer make shared and make unique and allocate shared will basically do a zeroing of the memory and there are situations where this is an overhead and then C plus plus we you know don't like when we have to pay for something which we didn't need so uh this four overwrite um extension was added to the standard and this is something which by the way Raymond doesn't mention in his book it's just something I found out when I looked at the my Clinique page which is I think rather interesting about the actual blog post I'll make unique and while they're how to you know do an overload on the unique pointer Constructor to achieve something similar um is an interesting read which you probably should read up on which brings me to the other highlights of this week um the cute Blog has posted another article on importing to webassembly then Nvidia had a blog post on using one of their libraries for screen transformations on Runner groom continues a series about patterns and this week it's a bridge pattern and um there have been some news about sponsorships and of course it's now four weeks until meeting C plus plus 2022 so if you want to come to the conference either on site or online get your tickets in October that would really help with the planning for the company and uh kdab had a really interesting article on uh debugging tools also sea lion and super Peak on mosquitoes are and then there's you know catch us two new versions which you might want to look at if you use sketch and that's pretty much it um so there's actually some interesting videos if you click on the click on the Block rule I certainly want to probably make a screenshot and to get the videos also into this but I haven't done that yet and so uh this week that's it thank you for listening see you next week
