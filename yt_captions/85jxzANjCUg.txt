ladies and gentlemen life is full of mysteries for example we always wonder what's at the bottom of the ocean they say something like 80 to 90% oceans haven't even been explored some people wonder will a team from Buffalo New York ever win a championship in any sport but for me everybody wonders will I become a Grandmaster or not and you see on this Channel I have taken you through a very long and up and down Journey but today I am sharing with you a depressing frustrating terrible performance that I had in a tournament that I played today so you're going to get to learn from these games and also laugh at me because it's only fair I make so much content making fun of low ELO chess well today you get to look at me like the circus animal that's all I have to say here we go this all began when I joined the title Tuesday tournament on chez.com this is my first game my first game 2400 rated opponent plays Knight to F3 I played G6 I went for a modern defense my opponent went D4 transposing to a Queens Pawn opening with the two pawns and then I played my typical stuff and at this point it's a it's a major decision for white is white going to try to take as much Central space as possible at the risk of destabilizing their Position will they play more solidly will they play a Catalan setup my opponent went E4 I really like when people play like this against me cuz I go here and now your Pawn can't defend the other Pawn many of my opponents like to jump forward but I just get the Knight into the D4 square right now I'm threatening to take and to take or I am threatening to just take because of the pin on the Knight many of my opponents Play Bishop B3 in this position which this person did and then I win E5 now I'm going to be honest the way my opponent played in this game I had actually never seen before uh generally everybody in this position plays D5 after D5 I put my knight here and then we get into a long complicated game my opponent played no way I'd never seen they took on E5 and then I took and I thought well that's easy I'm just going to plant my knight here I thought you know we're going to trade they might play Knight to B5 and you know then I'll just defend myself and life will be good but no no no no they played Queen A4 and I realized like wait a minute I'm going to be under a lot of pressure here with the bishop and with the rook and yeah it's kind of an annoying position it's kind of an annoying position then they found this nice move H4 I didn't even even begin to see that move you see I was very simply like well the bishop can't go there well after this it can and I'm going to Castle directly into the attack which is what I did and you know my my opponent started attacking my king I already had a very very unpleasant position from the open opening but I stayed confident I stayed confident because I'm really handsome and I'm pretty good at chess and I'm 300 points higher rated than this person for a reason probably so I thought okay you know they're trying to attack me some of you may be wondering if that's a free Pawn well it it is but it comes with a price tag of doubling your pawns and potentially just creating a line of attack here and just in general when it's quite clear your opponent has way more pieces in the game which you know they do every single one of my opponent's pieces is participating in in some form of the game so I'm pretty stuck here so I said you know what let's go night to D4 let's block The Rook let's block the bishop and and my opponent played probably the best way which is to trade off some pieces yeah and I was like well I kind of have to trade if I don't trade I'm going to lose my knight and then I'm going to lose my queen and uh if I don't take this it's just going to live there which is unpleasant my opponent is a move away from opening up the position so I thought okay let's let's play like this let's trade the the queen because the side that is defending in chess should probably go for trades and I thought all right well now I have an attack on the center I also have a pass Pawn right which is protected life is good my opponent took took and played King here and that's when I realized ah I I'm not actually threatening to take the pawn because this Pawn right Bishop E6 however I found a way to sacrifice a rook which you know is just about all I'm good for in chess so I took with a very simple idea to play Bishop B6 and sacrifice the rook and win the pawn and I thought Bishop two pawns is five Rook is five easy except I'm a and I actually just lost the game it would have been better for me to take with a pawn which I wouldn't have done in a million years because I thought it was bad to split my pawns I was like why would I leave this Pawn's friend well you know they've got another friend but none of this was even necessary I didn't have to do this whatsoever I could have just like tried to bring my king or brought the Rook up and over none of this was necessary but I did it and you know this is just losing cuz my opponent could go E7 which somehow both of us missed cuz we thought King F7 and that's it but Rook H7 and white is winning cuz I can't protect E8 and G7 yeah so that's how I lost the first game but my opponent didn't punish me they played King G2 and suddenly I was able to run back and Def but now I'm still losing but both of us miss it and what ends up happening is we get to the following position where my opponent has blocked my Pawn I have three extra pawns but my king is very weak so there's a lot of counter play on the horizon uh I lose this Pawn but then I'm going to go win this Pawn now I thought well I'm better you know I've got 24 seconds again I'm 300 points higher rated I'm very handsome and uh I mean I have three pass pawns I have three connected passers so all I got to do is get my king over there and push these pawns all right what I shouldn't do is lose this Pawn and allow this Pawn to promote that's one one thing I should not do so I'm winning but as you know you're watching this video for a reason at this point I have a total mental malfunction and in this position I spent half my time and I trade the Rooks you really shouldn't trade the Rooks in a rook end game if you've only got one and they have two even if you have three pass pawns because it's actually shockingly difficult to move them and uh yeah well my opponent you know started attacking my pawns and then went after that one and here I panicked I have two seconds so I started you know I I started throwing the game but but then I regained my composure and now my opponent's close to queening and now the move Bishop B2 is winning so I can't push but I can Shield I can protect my my you know Bishop B2 and I and I enable this and I win the game and then I went King D7 okay so now it's back to equal King C4 then here I I push my opponent's king back and played B4 I have three connected pass pawns look how strong they are my opponent you know can't can't do anything I'm just going to walk my king over there okay easy all right easy I just got to be careful little bit careful and I was not careful at all and now the pawns on F7 and now I'm losing Rook a eight it's probably a A2 and my opponent throws the game because Pawn to C3 and I lose on time so I had two seconds and in this position I needed to find C3 just pushing as many pawns as I can my opponent obviously can do this but then I go here and they can't simultaneously stop me from queening and enable the promotion instead of all of that I just choose I just chose to lose on time so I had a you know a a a better end game with three connected pass pawns against somebody 300 points low rated than me and I lost I lost like a complete idiot wonderful okay we are off to a good start congratulations to my opponent now we are moving on through the event I managed to win one of the games uh but this is against a 2490 okay I opponent in place E4 I played a French and uh I got to one of my favorite positions uh this is one of my favorite lines where you take and you you double your pawns like this and then what you try to do is you try to Castle Queen side I've played this so so so much and then you have the open file here so Knight to F3 Knight to C6 and I'm simultaneously ready to go like this but I'm also ready to strike in the center if necessary my opponent plays C3 it's just a solid move nothing special and now I strike in the center again I can play B6 or E5 I chose to attack the center and right away my opponent made a terrible decision I was very critical of this decision I was trying to explain it you cannot trade a bishop for a knight for no reason like you have to be able to explain yourself for example if in this position you say well it's to damage my opponent's structure and to destabilize their Center that's a reason my opponent took the Knight and I could take with the pawn but I went like this and white is worse in nine moves like taking here is just not a good move because if Pawn takes E5 you're not winning my Pawn I can always take on G2 oops I can always take on G2 and plus I have this open file and all of those are light Square weaknesses look they're on light squares right so I was very critical of this decision-making by my opponent I'm already just much better with black and I thought okay this is going to be a relatively straightforward game I'm just going to put my Bishop on G4 I'm going to Castle and I'm going to just win like my opponent already cannot Castle because they're trying to defend themselves so I play this completely winning position and 11 moves I thought okay nice we're getting back into title Tuesday good stuff opponent plays D5 natural move because you want to avoid E4 you want to avoid the pressure right so now I play a move where my queen keeps an eye on everything Queen B5 keeping an eye on this keeping an eye on the diagonal and keeping an eye on the pawn and opponent plays H3 and very simple combination I can take the Knight they cannot take because of the Rook if they take like this this yes they have eyes on this but I'm getting in like I'm threatening everything that's what I did take take take Rook C1 and this is under attack but I decided you know what my opponent is never castling they move both Rooks so they can't Castle so let me Castle to rub it in their face then I will take that that that that whatever opponent went here and now I thought this was a clever move I kind of like Bishop C5 deflecting the bishop away some of you may be wondering why my opponent did not take on F6 probably cuz they would remove the defender of the D5 Pawn but Queen F6 is a totally reasonable move and so I played Bishop C5 I traded and I went up two pawns 18 moves two pawns up my opponent did something smart right they they walked the king out of danger to G2 right and life is good so this is the position and they played King G2 because the king will now go to the corner now when you are two pawns up in an end game you you have options okay you can try to eat as much as you can I would not recommend this move because you open up the lines for your opponent right and my king is there and I I wouldn't recommend that I would recommend trading the Queens just bring the queen back defend try to trade Queens if your opponent doesn't trade Queens with you use your queen as an attacking mechanism play H5 H4 play F5 F4 right get in on the second rank with your Rooks instead of all of that I blundered the most important Pawn in my position just a one mover just a one mover I went from completely winning to not only down only to not only up one Pawn I blundered a pawn and my king I blundered my king that's it I'm completely busted the computer is already saying sack the rook and force a draw the computer is literally already saying sacrifice your rook and just make a draw Queen G5 King H2 just make a draw Queen F4 King G2 but I I mean I I saw Rook G3 but I thought it just didn't work I mean I I thought I was like either winning or losing I didn't see that there was a draw plus I was like a I'm going to double and I'm going to I'm going to survive and you know you can see here that if I take a this Pawn which for whatever reason I didn't take cuz I was so rattled I spent a full minute after that just being like why did I how did I it's literally just a direct Arrow you got to be careful when you Castle queenside this is a lesson for like people 2,000 points lower rated than me and he took and now I'm just completely busted C4 we get into this crazy Rook end game now I'm back to okay but I have three seconds now my opponent starts playing super weird here starts playing Super passively and I take over the game again and my opponent decides okay this is actually very instructive my opponent has a moment here where they can go active double the Rooks active or passive passive would lose the game just so you understand you can't double your Rooks into defending that is a complete waste of Rooks cuz what's going to happen is I'm going to overwhelm you slowly like you're you can't move whereas my Rooks will permanently pressure you and then you're going to get split up and then you're going to have a bunch of weaknesses and then I'm going to go on to win the game so it's very instructive that my opponent gave up the pawn and just went with the rook and then we get into a crazy scramble and I take pawns and all the pawns are falling but I'm not winning I'm if anything I'm losing I blundered my pawn and now my opponent brings the Rooks around and that's it a perfect setup and they just push they trade F3 the game is over I I lost on time but okay I had like two seconds anyway this is just the pin I cannot play E3 because they take my rook and they easily get back I lost another game to 2400 oh my God and this one was even worse than the first one cuz this one was just you know it was a crushing attack from the opening I just got a completely winning and then they couldn't take the pawn here I guess because of this and mentally I just tuned that out I just for just forgot that there was any difference and wild just a one mover all right terrific we roll right along this was the next game right after losing this game in this game you might be very surprised I am playing against myself I am playing myself that is a profile photo of me I don't know why Dena Dena bellink is a uh is a is a chess content creator she's a title player uh plays a lot of tournaments makes a lot of content I have no idea why her profile photo is me super weird Behavior but that's besides the point um I don't know I I don't know I was very confused by this this was my old profile photo now I upgraded to this professional headshot anyway I was very excited for this game because Dena is a caroon player and as we all know caroan is the best opening in the world but only when I play it when other people play it easy money D4 D5 and I just made a video about the alien Gambit obviously I got to play the freaking alien Gambit so go to play the alien Gambit Dina plays Bishop F5 so you can't quite get an alien Gambit but I'm determined now if black plays H6 and I sacrifice technically technically this kind of takes the fun out of the opening but you know we'll probably figure out something and maybe I don't know it's obviously not good but Dina doesn't do any of that she just plays in the most solid way she never plays H6 so I never get to sacrifice on F7 and you know she just plays like this and then the devil on my shoulder was like you can sacrifice on F7 now now of course with white you can play like Rook E1 and have a microscopically better position but I played the alien Gambit to play the freaking alien Gambit now this is not exactly the alien Gambit I get a check I force the king to the corner I take so I have two pawns but the difference when you play the alien Gambit is you have a bishop and frequently more pieces than that you have the Rook uh this is not exactly the alien Gambit and that's because black is able to get all the pieces out so at this point I know that I'm you know I'm obviously in a little bit of a tough situation however I you know I I decide okay I'm going to get my pawns out going to get the bishop out going to play here that's what I'm going to do my first move is already a blunder apparently what I needed to do here is I needed to play energetically if you sacrifice a piece you have to play Fast not like speed-wise you you you need to control the pace of the game so this move is not possible because of a fork on C7 so Bishop D2 would have probably forced her to play here and then I would play here with different ideas and that would have actually been interesting but I didn't develop a piece I mean I just brought a pawn to the center thinking I'm going to Anchor my my knight on E6 but it's too slow and now now she plays this move and now she's getting rid of my knight and if I'm just a full piece down it I mean it's not going to go very well so I played the alien Gambit but I uh uh she has five pieces in the game so this is a really really really horrible handling of a Gambit really bad she consolidates very nicely and uh she's just winning and now I'm like uh-oh I'm up a minute but I'm not so sure I'm going to be able to hold this one she plays Bishop D6 I defend my knight but uh she goes Queen D7 and like at this point I realized I'm going to lose like I should have played something better I I mean okay I didn't get my alien game but I probably should have played a different opening it's kind of what happens when you met when you you know there's that there's the the the meme um F AO fafo you know fudge around and find out there you go we don't curse here I've never said a curse word in my life Queen A5 led to a strong consolidation on her part and uh in this position I I it started to sink in that um I just have one less night than my opponent whereas the other two games you know this was a balanced game it was a 10 end game it was a horrendous decision in an end game and then I lost on time in a panic uh this one was a was a completely ridiculous blunder this was pure arrogance and uh disrespect and it completely backfired and I mean she just simplifies the position brings her King out again to bring the Rook cuz the king the king needed to get out of the danger early but now that she just removed all of my pieces yeah I'm not going to be able to win this position and um I I just nice nice move attacks my Rook I either have to take and give up the file or uh or I I don't even know and you know I'm completely lost and I have 9 seconds versus a minute now to my credit somehow I didn't completely loose and I went here and then you know we we actually got into a little bit of a scramble like I almost made a comeback I have two pawns for a knight which is not that horrible she went here and I actually thought I might save the game now I did something extremely idiotic here because I have 4 seconds when you are playing an end game you don't want to overextend your pawns you need to bring your king like this is stuff you teach beginners and I went here which is so stupid oh my God I cannot even stress how dumb that is your pawns need to go together you cannot create holes in your position this creates massive light squired weaknesses just bring the king I was you know I was moments away from my king getting stuck on the last Rank and here we're sort of Frozen she can't move her Rook I can't move my Rook I should have just went King F3 but she now now that's it now black is probably just going to convert this uh and she's able to play King F5 whereas if I had just kept my king on F3 and Pawn on H3 I would have been able to play G4 so for instance King F3 King F5 H3 H5 like this is getting closer and closer to a draw cu the more pawns I trade the better it is obviously I could have taken you know I could have taken on G7 there uh if H5 was played but that's my point anyway uh I'm stupid and this is just all part of the video and uh yeah Dena does a nice job here for what whatever reason I decided The Rook didn't wasn't good there anymore playing chest like you know uh like a donkey kicked me in the head great job by her and that's it and um my idiot King is getting swarmed this is very well done uh she brings in the king she brings in the Knight and uh I tried to go for stalemate I thought maybe there was a stalemate somewhere but there is no stalemate and uh she converts and she won and uh that was a horrible treatment of the alien Gambit that was the Gotham version of it which is don't play this even if the computer says it's okay you don't have enough pieces don't do it and the last game that I have for you this was uh I think right after this was um I started the title Tuesday one out of four and down about 45 rating points uh this was a game against the Ukrainian feda Master just like the first game we got you know I played the modern but then there was no C4 like in the in the first game my opponent played D4 C4 in the second game my opponent played regular King's Pawn and I I really like the modern because you know white tends to Castle Queen side and I play like this so I anticipate H5 I'm ready to kind of poke out and not allow the opening of the position and then I play Rook C8 and I play C5 and this is the way you attack right so in this game that's exactly what I did I played Rook C8 I played the the Thematic idea of the opening my opponent went here and uh black is already better so again from the opening in every one of these games uh I was com I wasn't super comfortable in the first game but you know chess is not only about the opening uh you I can't just play like de Pawn takes and try to win it's it's not so simple but I played this and then I went here and um already the computer is saying play B4 just go attack if CB you take CD and you win uh material if AB then you take and then you play Queen A5 it's actually extremely difficult to defend the king so I should have just kept attacking instead I plopped my knight onto the G4 square with the idea to take on E3 and in this position I uh we simplified opponent went D5 idea of D5 is to get me to take or to push at which point F5 opens up and that is you know you got a certain squares in your mind have to illuminate deluminate that's not a real word but I'm a chess YouTuber so I'm allowed to invent words like a moment ago both my pawns control that square you got to realize every time you move a pawn you you win something right you win the dark squares you lose the light squares so on this move I was like okay I can't let the Knight come to F5 none of my opponent's pieces have any forward Mobility which is why I have the advantage so in this position I played C4 I traded the Queens uh and uh I just went King up and here black is better black is better for two reasons black has the bishop pair and a better set of minor pieces so Knights and Bishops for black are advantageous black controls will control the entire f file which will be very annoying for white uh black also has kind of the forward momentum like if one side is going to push pawns into the other person's side it's black black has more space uh so those are all the ideas but I have a weakness which my opponent you know begins loading up on and at this point I sort of struggled I mean I have a 1 minute and 20 second time advantage and I'm nearly I'm 350 points higher rated so I'm a massive favorite I have a one and a half minute time Advantage but you're watching this video for a reason and the reason is sometimes it's it's not all rainbows and butterflies like sometimes your brain just doesn't work sometimes your opponents play quite well um what do I do well I couldn't play G4 anytime you want to push a pawn to attack a knight you got to realize the Knight could zigzag around the pawn and now black is just much worse cuz the Knight is getting there so can't do that okay what if I play A5 B4 maybe that would have been a good idea A5 B4 uh the point is that if I play B4 right away I I do just lose a pawn so I got to kind of like time it the right way I I I didn't know what would to do so I played Rook F7 my opponent went here to try to bring the Knight to G4 and I decided okay I'm going to attack the center cuz I think that's the right thing to do it it wasn't it completely was not the right thing to do and now white is better so I have a like a position here that's visually and practically probably better for white uh for black on paper but I have no idea how I was supposed to push the advantage here maybe it would have been worth like stalling maybe I should have played I don't know I like I I cannot understand it maybe the right game plan was Bishop C6 like let's say Knight H2 Bishop C6 Knight G4 like maybe Rook you know Rook D7 Rook B8 this was the way I should have played Rook D7 and then Rook B8 and try to play for B4 I have no idea I I actually have no idea I did my best and it my best was completely wrong Knight E4 my opponent defends everything and now what 10 seconds though I was like my opponent's got 10 seconds of course I have to be better so I'm like I'm going to trade pieces and win how how am I going to trade pieces and win I play A5 Knight G4 how am I going to trade pieces and win I'm worse and then in this position I did something unforgivable what I should do here is I should put a rook on the B file or defile to defend my bishop and then play B4 like if I'm trying to play this my put it has three seconds I mean it's really hard to play chess when you have three seconds you know you just saw that in in the first game that I played you're going to panic you want to do something I went B4 I have 55 seconds on the clock so not only am I making Panic decisions when I have low time I'm making Panic decisions with my opponents have low time horrible day of decision-making horrible this is an idiotic move who am I trying to attack with my king why is my king trying to attack the king that doesn't even make sense and let's not forget my king is defending my Bishop so now I have to go backwards and now I go from equal to worse to completely lost completely lost I'm gonna lose this Pawn I'm gonna lose this pawn and worse I'm going to get mated like I'm going to find myself mated my opponent has two seconds on the clock two SEC two seconds and I throw the game King D5 Knight D3 it's discovered check and it's even worse than that it is now mate my Rook is hanging my Bishop is hanging luckily the chess gods look down and went Gotham might throw his computer out the window if his opponent plays Rook takes D6 which leads to Checkmate after here here here King D2 and now basically any knight move no literally any night move by the way that's mate that's mate that's mate that's mate that's mate you can't eat your own Rook but Knight F4 every move is made I get ladder made it in the center of the that is crazy but here my opponent took my rook and instead and now is just completely winning but also panics allows my king to run into the position and now it's anybody's game now I eat my opponent's pawns now they take my Pawn we start pushing it's a scramble it's a crazy game and uh I I mean I can't win cuz I can't really promote H6 apparently I was winning here if I played rookie six check deflecting The Rook but it's probably still a draw believe it or not but uh yeah we uh end up trading and we shuffle a bit and then we trade it so I I made a comeback in this event I um I did end up winning some games in a row but then I lost the last game of the event to a 2800 so all in all a completely horrible tournament uh and the point of today's video is just to show you that sometimes it's okay and your brain doesn't function and I am still miles and miles and miles away from being a Grandmaster and I make Panic decisions when I have low time I make Panic decisions when o my opponents have low time I miss so many of my resources a 2700 rated Blitz player should not have this type of performance but that's life and sometimes it happens sometimes no amount of coffee this is my second large coffee of the day the first one didn't do anything it didn't you know I could take a ice bath I don't know but sometimes it's just not your day that's all I have for you today get out of here
