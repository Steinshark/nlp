the looming demise of the 10x developer all right why an era of enthusiasts programmers is coming to an end that's that you know I'm not gonna lie to you that this is this already I I feel myself annoyed by this article and I haven't even read it so let's find out Justin Searles are you rustling my jimmies right now do you know I used to work at Sears Justin okay you're only one L away from the place I used to work at uh I've recently been telling anyone who will listen that I'm excited to be on the precipice of using sorbet to write type checked edition of mocktail that has a potential to unlock productivity workflows never before possible in a ruby somewhere in the distance I think I just heard dhh scream somewhere out there did you guys hear that [Music] that's what I assume his voice sounds like until he's on the stream that's that's gonna be his impersonation dhh okay so if you want that changed at any point you gotta jump in okay uh you gotta Arc you gotta tell me why types are amazing I'll let you do it for free I'll let you do it for free and I'll listen and only ask great questions I'm not there yet I don't want to say it's been a quagmire but I'm over 150 commits in and there's a lot left to button up before release it's been a real challenge learning sorbet at all takes a good chunk of time to be sure I've also hit a number of 30 edge cases and Elusive bugs along the way both in the type system itself and that the type system exposed in my code oh the mirror hurts can we all be okay can we all agree when you have to look in the mirror and be like hey what I've just created is definitionally wrong hurts a little bit right it hurts emotionally we've all been there we've all been there and like usually I'm trying to do something that's never quite done before so I'm constantly oscillating between feelings of nervous excitement and fear that I'm attempting The Impossible but that's what makes it fun is the attempting of the impossible right I mean unless if it's like trying like an arch user trying to get a date or something like that that's not fun right that that's never been a fun time you know what I mean because that's just that's that's mathematically impossible that's a different kind though it's been made far more possible thanks to generous assistance of these people thank you very these people very very much Beyond this any specifics I might share about my current Quest are so banal as to not be worth your time if you somehow find the interesting please email me okay give me an email if you want to hear more about sorbet okay Assad Bay uh so I might feel less alone in this world that said oh that's kind of sad sounding uh that said there is something generally interesting here that programmers don't often talk about and that's the deeper question why do I keep doing this to myself anyone anyone want to toss anyone want to toss a little answer up here anyone anyone want to want to give it a shot go ahead go ahead give it a shot give it a shot tell me why money it's fun powerful question money eight equals dick I love pain masochism definitely not insanity because Dad didn't love me damn is Dad out for the cigarettes dude wait hold on did you just get 410 by your dad is that what it is your dad.zip is it 410 yeah you got four tens didn't you Rift man feels bad sadism yeah I know yeah it hurts I don't know Insomniac with a side of ADHD yeah yeah yeah I run arts for the ladies wait you run from the ladies with Arch I must have misread that it went by too quick all right anyways let's keep on going oh dang it what makes me special I'm an Enthusiast programmer I stumble on a problem like this one and I stay up late every night until I find the solution I wake up early each morning with new ideas of things to try I don't take enough breaks but when I do they're technically designed to exploit my brains asynchronous processor to generate solutions for whatever I'm currently stuck on I irresponsibly defer responsibilities from one area of my life uh from areas of my life oh yeah this is just called um this is called lack of self-control I'm not I don't mean this in a demeaning way I too used to do the exact same thing I would forego some of my relational duties to my beautiful wife uh you know not like cleaning up as well as I could um all those things around the house that I could have done a lot better job I would I would forego those responsibilities in favor of working on problems I used to do the exact same thing it's almost like I don't want to call like OCD or some actual named disorder but it's just definitely a life perspective problem I think we all suffer from it as programmers eventually I realized that I I'm only at the 20 Mark and that a pattern is repeating where a month or more of my life is about to disappear from the calendar towards the end I find myself rushing to find The Mazes exit because my desires to unlock the puzzles final secret starts to be overtaken by the shame of all other balls I'm dropping it's excruciating as I approach the inflection point as intense as any overbearing manager Do or Die deadlines were ever or ever were except in this case the pressure I feel is entirely self-imposed I I resonate with this pretty hard I used to do this constantly to myself dropping balls can be excruciating thanks for the content I appreciate your thoughtful and incisive words okay very beautiful very very beautiful um and then at some uneventful moment at 4 pm on a Saturday it's done sometimes people care about what I made usually they don't often even I don't I give myself enough time to clear my inbox tidy the house and shave then I move on to the next uh sisyphean is that how you say that sisyphian uh I keep in my head the guy's name is not syphilis what is the guy's name what's the guy's name that has to push the boulder up every day it's not just it's not syphilis what what Sisyphus syphilis is way different Sisyphus did you guys ever watch is is it you're correct it's not bad is it called was the show called Sisyphus what was the show called it was a recent K drama slash Sci-Fi show about time travel on Netflix it was very good syphilis I love syphilis wait Sisyphus wait what am I oh gosh see this all right this this this like I can't make it small screened again I can't do it again let's see this is how I let's see this describes how I live my life since I was 13 years old with a few exceptions and let me tell you it's very difficult to juggle a healthy personal life and a sustainable work life when you're simultaneously engulfed in an endless series of side quests to to will every creative curiosity into existence when I was a consultant at Crow there was one year I built a client for nearly 2100 hours which averages out to more than 40 hours per week uh of the year with zero days off and that's not counting travel time or the half dozen hours of weekly administrative work that wasn't considered billable nevertheless I found time in my nights and weekends that year to build an app with Apple's buggy most undocumented initial iPhone SDK the app was a native client to V uh V bulletin web forms allowing users to browse threads and compose replies despite knowing nothing about any of the underlying technology I obsessively polish the app to Perfection did I make time to sleep I don't remember the whole Year's a blur sounds slightly unhealthy you know I'm gonna say something here and it's gonna be real okay I'm about to I'm I'm about to drop I'm about to drop reality on a lot of people okay are we okay with this it's gonna be a hot ass take I hope you're ready okay it's gonna be offensive this my friends was me too this was absolutely me I would do the exact same things to the detriment of a lot of things I did it to the detriment of my wife due to the detriment of a lot a lot of stuff but I can I I believe I can confidently say the thing that changed me was having kids you have to have something more important in your life that truly makes you step back and change how you think about things I think kids are one of the greatest things that can ever be done in one's life if possible enjoy that privilege it's incredible it'll change who you are absolutely kids are a life changer absolutely there you go that's my hot take because I know today apparently something that's as old as time is now considered hot takes people are gonna be like well actually there's gonna be like 9 000 well actually he's a pendant to this uh also that Apple could reject my app because users might post swear words or dirty pictures oh well on to the next thing I don't know what word best describes my behavior above without inflecting significant value judgment perfectionist obsessive passionate completionist whatever we call this compulsion it's hardly an unalloyed good and it comes with its share of downsize absolutely nevertheless it's one of the number of idiosyncrasies and character flaws I've decided to lean into and find Productive outlets for rather than attempting to repress or rewire again like you gotta have something more valuable right in life it it you don't have to rewire you can still be who you are that's the thing is I feel like sometimes people do this thing and I you know I do it too it's just like it's either a or b and I'm like terrible at this it's either a or b but sometimes there's still like half they're still like mostly alphabet left you know what I mean there's still a huge amount of other options that are out there right uh being able to time box your compulsions is a great way to start you still get all of your creative Outlets but you learn how to have some self-control that's uncomfortable right there's this whole notion in life I think where I think where a lot of this comes from is this idea of either finding significance or finding comfort and like it's okay to be uncomfortable right it's okay not to accomplish everything you wish to accomplish like it's okay good hard work while the work is available to be done good and hard go for it wow but sometimes take a step back it's okay it's okay to feel terrible about it and to just practice self-control over your mind I ruminate endlessly under stress so I rest back some control by manufacturing stress responses over things I'm building to trick my brain into ruminating on work that's useful to me this post overrides the unhelpful irrational worries that surround me every day and unlocks a second shift where I can accomplish almost as much away from my keyboard as in front of it I am terrible listener and struggle with auditory processing especially in groups and Loud environments one reason I talk so much is that I always felt safer to drive the conversation than risk mishearing and offending someone uh parsing to me this is kind of a sad state of the world like we just gotta why do we live in a world that people get so hurt over things like we gotta try to like it's okay it's okay parsing other sentences often feel like I'm filling in the blanks to make sense of them yeah I mean this sounds this sounds difficult I like playing a game of Mad Libs over the years I've redirected this into the source of creativity and humor most of my puns and wordplay are happy accents as I fill the gaps in my own listening uh comprehensions some of my most creative ideas are things I swear I hear heard someone say when it turns out they're actually talking about something else I'm really bad learner disinterested distractible and disagreeable I've never enjoyed learning and generally avoid it especially learning for its own sake at the slightest discomfort when struggling to understand something I'll grasp for any distraction that might help me a momentary Escape I feel like I feel like this this feels like modern world stuff where we have all the right words to describe what's happening to ourselves yet we feel like we're a victim of our circumstances who here with ADHD doesn't feel this way Real Talk who here with just a good strong ADHD does not feel this way of course I feel this way like I felt this way every single day of my life right but it's my choice not to give in to this you know what I mean it's like I have to like I remember being in college and hating it I would sit there for hours just loathing my existence and I just had to be like I have to listen because you have two Wills right this is just this is lower will versus higher will to a t lower will is do the thing you feel like hire Wills do the thing you know you should do right this is just this is it in a perfect little nutshell right here and I remember being so upset and so sick and so pissed off and so just like uncomfortable and just wanting to escape the reality of learning about Earth Science in college but I had to like I had to get through it I had to it was my last shot and I did not at all want to lose this right and so I just had I just I just said that's it I can't do it because I had to work as a dishwasher to go back to school and I worked and I worked and I worked to the point where I'd like I had wrist pain because like just squeezing the dish thing and I just sat there and thought my life is about to be this where I just am in pain and I hate it I have to be able to do the right thing I have to succeed I must do it and that was super hard I wanted to escape man uh when I do manage to get to action I inevitably find myself disagreeing with the premise or subversively trying to prove the author's wrong the upshot is that once I actually do learn something uh I know I know it cold I mean I have uh scoured every nook and climbed out of every Pitfall professionally this apparent weakness has turned out to be a superpower learning everything the hard way has made me a natural consultant and Mentor absolutely because I've already explored all the wrong paths absolutely that's I mean exploring the wrong paths is how you learn that's why I've always said like I hate tutorials because tutorials are always like here's the 10 right steps to make to build an app and then you go like this and you get through your app and you're like wow I did it I built an app I'm gonna build another one step one wow why is it wrong I don't understand why it's wrong oh this sucks step two oh that sucks too I can't even do step one and I'm stuck on step how do I do step two right and you just fall apart because you didn't do all the wrong things right that's what the author did the author spent days upon days doing the wrong thing to get to the right thing and instead you are just looking at the right thing and going wow I have no idea how to build anything because this is ideal in my life sucks and my life is non-ideal right you don't learn doing the right thing you learn doing the right thing after you know the wrong thing right like if you know any programming language and it comes out with a new feature that solves something that's really bothered you you instantly know why that new feature is incredible but if you've never learned the language and you look at a new feature and you go oh why would you use this I guess I use this now you just kind of use it like a golden Hammer and you don't really know why you're using it and you would inevitably start developing all these anti-patterns because you never learned the thing it was meant to solve I have to know let's see I often know someone is stuck before they do understand what threw them off course and show them how to get back on track the reason I landed on this topic today is not that any of the above makes me special it's actually like uh that contradictions like these whatever their Origins uh are so typical among programmers born before 1990 that they're entirely mundane yeah well welcome to being a programmer before 1990 uh the aberrant aberrant the aberrant generation of programmers squint and everything I just said about about myself could have been described a character from Big Bang Theory or Silicon Valley I'm at peace with the fact on my best days I'm an over PL uh played abrasive character Trope come to life for decades we've Associated a slew of mostly negative traits like these with programmers as if the linkage is inherent and inevitable maybe uh I've always I mean to be super great at something in some sense you have to have negative traits right I've always thought that stereotype was arbitrary nobody can learn programming and let's see anybody can learn programming and be great at it but now I'm starting to think uh it's a product of our times as well interesting it's an interesting hypothesis I'm not sure if it's a product of times as much as it's a product of like personality trait right some of us just want to keep pushing we can't help it there's some internal fight that's in there uh that is to say I've come to believe the era typified by Enthusiast programmers uh autodidactive obsessive and anti-social is drawing to a close why do I think that because there was a specific generational moment that attracted a bunch of people like me into software industry it occurred during the brief window between home computers becoming widely available and they're becoming sealed airtight by platform holders this is an it's an interesting hypothesis I'm actually very curious about this uh for a fleeting moment computers were simultaneously accessible and screwable during uh a necessary but temporary temporary stage in the the maturation of Information Technology okay I actually don't know what that means uh before they were rendered in irreducibly complex as consumer devices merely using a computer required figuring out a lot about how it worked absolutely and coming of age with an understanding how computers work made programming them far more approachable and thanks to a comic coincidence and marketing teams of companies like Radio Shack Society unwittingly handed a generation of Social Mobile uh to the boys of upper middle class families in the U.S who felt a more comfortable let's see who felt more comfortable at home with their computers uh than outside engaging socially with their peers I was definitely one of those awkward anxious kids and a whole lot of programmers I've met along the way were too do you guys all feel transparent right now how many of you guys feel transparent right through me but one reason to believe that programmers don't have to be like this is that programmers weren't always like this I remember asking a computer science professor in 2003 about our school's gender disparity we only had one single woman in my classes and she later switched Majors hey same story here uh he recounted that before 1990 and the Advent of hacker and gamer subcultures my college touted robust majorities and women in computer science nationally women's enrollment in CS doubled uh in a decade uh before dropping precipitously yeah they say that after after one of the big crashes one of those Society crashes uh what was it the 86 economic downturn that before that it was much different than after that it was only people you know the money the industry everything left and crashed and then it became only Enthusiast if you will that's what I've heard that's what my teacher said because he said the exact same thing uh and one reason to believe programmers won't always be this way is that there's plenty of evidence that the next generation of professional programmers is no longer dominated by enthusiasts people becoming software developers today looked markedly different than those who became before now I don't I just don't agree with the statement at all there's plenty of people becoming programmers today that are enthusiasts it's just that their starting point looks different right I got to start before the internet was available in my city right that's just a different feel playing Windows 3.1 free ski mahjong tiles having to Dos my way into things it's just a different world old sadly I wish I could say I'm referring to the success of movements to increase representation from traditionally marginalized group attack is still dramatically over indexed in white dudes who enjoy affluent upbringings uh I'm definitely not this person um I'm just in fact a lot of people I know aren't this person um that's because I mean there could only be a small majority a minority that's affluent I'm just pointing to all the money uh sloshing around here uh it capitulated programming from a firmly middle class job that appeals to people who really love computers to a comfortably upper middle class professional that attracted anyone who wants to secure their financial future ask anyone who switched careers in the last decade how many times someone suggested they learn to code countless people entering the Indus industry simply because programming is relatively secure while paying professional I mean like a reach here this I I don't know if any of this can be true because now we're starting to get into like now you're just trying to make hypothesis out of stuff now I don't know now now we're starting to get into the weird weird Zone where I I don't uh intergenerational conflict is brewing I'm not sure if anyone has ever said okay Boomer to my parents but I can imagine it wouldn't feel awesome to hear I've been called Boomer plenty of times uh nor do I know whether anyone will coin the term uh to dismiss My Generation but I have faith that there's enough societal exasperation out there for someone to on Tick Tock to come up with something Snappy a lot of people in my professional cohorts still see themselves as social outcasts who grew up in front of a CRT in their parents basement but I suspect the Next Generation sees a homogeneous monolith of 40-somethings wearing hoodies and sandals with socks that lucked their way into capturing control of the software engineering industry just as it settled into the state of economic maturity sit with this distinction for a while and you might start to see that the old hat programmers as belonging to an Enthusiast generation yes he like I don't know I really don't agree with this initial premise right the thing is is like I can think of plenty of people who are in their 20s who are in their teens Nexel who's in their teens right that completely break this mold all the people that I see that are trying to create content or engaging with the community or any of these things are fundamentally different than he is he is making it out to be I feel like this thing had a I feel like this this block had a really great start right like I totally got this but yeah it feels like selection bias it feels like everybody that I know which are usually if you're not like into the whole social scene it's going to be probably made up of whoever's just physically around you or who's at the same job as you uh and you can kind of draw conclusions that maybe aren't correct I've locked my way into programming those statements are contradictory yeah those statements are contradictory I know he also said things like I am bad at learning yet he also learned the entirety the entire annoying SDK of the iPhone one to make the first application right like uh there's there's definitely some some things there I don't really like uh stay with this distinction for a while you might start to see that the old hat programmers belonging to the Enthusiast generation one that due to its unique initial circumstances is unlikely to be replicated disagree uh once I introduce the word generation to my thinking it became easier to make sense of many contentions unresolved issues in Tech that flared up over the past decade looking at them through the lens of intergenerational conflict I I mean I think this is this is starting to feel like one of those things where if you think long enough you can derive any solution uh sometimes it's not that people are aren't clever enough sometimes people are too clever and just like any discussion of generations it's important to caveat that there are no firm boundary lines uh that exceptions are plentiful and that many observations will be isolated to a single Locale and culture the US in this case maybe Canada a the only thing that's bucketing people in the generations can do for us is providing a new way to look at how population may be changing thanks to big enough time step see I mean there's it yeah this is this is what it is um all right I remember we'll keep going for a little bit but if it's too much just thought masturbation I might I might we might have to call it a passion I remember about eight years ago people got passionate about the word passion this rubbed me the wrong way at first then again everything does I remember thinking Banning the word passion will just lead to people pick other others like self-driven highly motivated ambitious I remember asking are we supposed to screen out candidates uh for whom programming is a hobby outside of work what I don't remember was pondering whether this was and an indication that the times were changing I think this is an indication that people wanted to be for me when I see this when I see people say these kind of things when I see this I don't think that this is the times of changing I think this is people who want to justify their inability to really excel at programming right they want to be considered the upper echelon of programming but they don't want to put in the time or effort you want to be an Olympian but you don't want to get off your couch that's how I look at it personally in the sense that I think you got to push pretty hard and I don't have a problem with someone that says they're passion I don't have a problem with someone that wants to work outside of work I don't want I don't want to tell people how to live their life right you live it how you want to live it and if I want to hire someone that's super great I want to find the person that wants to work and do things that's actually obsessed with something that can do it right that's the person I want to work with because they take me necessarily to the next level along with me taking them to the next level because we both have different experiences and we're both trying to get to the next rung right I don't know I have this hard time where people just like this is it for me this is such such a lame take right you know it's a lame take uh when I encountered the industry my salary was lower than it would have been if I had gone into accounting or become an actuary or a major in civil engineering same here uh myself and most the people around me did uh uh did get into software because we were passionate about it reading tweets and think pieces that suggesting passion was a four-letter word like uh felt like the personal affront so I responsibly defend uh So I responded defensively reasonable what I wasn't thinking about was that it must have felt like for everyone who entered the industry expecting their job to be a job but found themselves managed by people from my generation who didn't leave uh them room to have a life outside of work I mean again some of these are choices some of these are just work environments they're hard maybe everyone else on the team worked over time without being asked maybe talking too much or taking too much supposedly unlimited time off would foreclose any chance for a promotion maybe building a rapport at lunch requiring holding evolved opinions on emacs versus Vim or mechanical key switches or whatever was the front page of Hacker News that sounded pretty much like a miserable existence especially if programming isn't what gets you out of bed in the morning again for me this has just always been a hard take which is whenever you have an industry that has an infinite skill Gap do you know what I mean an infinite skill Gap meaning at any point of the day you can open up the internet and start learning to get your job better right like it's just it's infinite forever there's literally never some sort of like ceiling where you're like I never have to learn a thing again right it's a really weird place to be in because in some sense you have to kind of be this person to be able to keep up with just the movement of the industry every single year new things are coming out people are saying this is the way to do things like it wasn't that long ago that Docker didn't exist right it wasn't that long ago it's only recent memory that Docker became a thing so it's like what do you got to do here you know it's it's impossible to know this uh now obviously just working your life away for a single job you should be careful about that you gotta set your boundaries you got to know how to say no you got to know how to do the right thing and some jobs you can't do that and if you find yourself in one of those jobs and you feel like you don't have to be in one of those jobs it's not one of these things where I know there's places on Earth where it's harder to have a job that's more life balanced well I mean I don't know how to speak to that but at least where I'm at it's about finding the right job and if you have a job it's easier to get a job so you know there's things you can do a Docker created March 2020 uh 2013. I know that's recent memory that's a decade TCP was created in what uh 74. it's only recently starting to go out of fashion right it's like there's really long life to good Tech but there's a whole bunch of little short ones that happen where people are trying to find the right thing you were born after Docker was made yeah right get the hell out of here craftsmanship this brings me to another contentious word to mind craftsmanship it's origin as I witnessed it was a reaction to the watering down of technical aspects of the agile software movement in the late 2000s in favor of more lucrative soft skills training and consultant services in case you've missed it most craftsmanship memes could be summed up as a slow code movement there was a lot of talk about measuring twice and cutting once establishing apprenticeship programs to train new programmers and millions of ways to leverage automated tests for the purpose uh other than testing things this sounds awful I don't want any of whatever they just said other than it's fun to Mentor people that's fun like at your job it's fun I was active participant in this community speaking at conferences several times and putting my name on the manifesto and generally exhorting anyone who would listen to please make their software less terrible I mean that's always good but looking back the craftsmanship movement wasn't only about rekindling the tremendous engineering insights of agile methods like extreme programming it also let's see it was also a response to the rapid influx of generation of programmers who didn't care about code quality the same way we did I just again this statement is just so hard to make like this is like the okay Zoomer right this is the OK Zoomer version of ok Boomer you know what I mean like you can't just say that there are so many great Zoomer programmers out there right there's so many out there that that truly take what they do and take it to the Max and be really good about it I feel equally frustrated in One Direction as the other way right oh my goodness all right I don't like where this article is going so I'm going to call it I'm going to call it a day I do not think there's a demise of the tedx programmer uh I don't think 10x programmers exist in in any sort of real fashion the only 10x programmers that exist are the ones that make your job 10x harder that require 10x more people the people that always adopt the brand newest most Cutting Edge technology at all points just to do it and then what do they end up having they just create a mess they create all this you know this this just massive Tech debt as things move and it's just terribly terribly hard or the other version of 10x developer where they use nothing from the outside and they develop everything in-house so you have only bespoke solutions for every single thing you have and it's just a nightmare to work with both are terrible enjoy your life you don't have to be a 10x shoot for a 2X right learn to type fast learn your language to a t be amazing at it investigate new technologies weigh their goods and bads take what you can use what is good and solid and just enjoy life a little bit and you know build things that make you happy you don't always have to build things that are going to be a product you don't even have to always build something that's going to be completed just enjoy it for a moment enjoy your life for a moment enjoy the things you're making take satisfaction in what you're building you don't have to find your meaning in what you're building it's that simple the name is the primogen
