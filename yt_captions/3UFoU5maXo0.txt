almost everyone you ask has an opinion about china's one child policy whether was the right thing to do whether it was cruel and needless whether it saved china from having to feed 400 million mouths whether it set up china for future failure as one of the world's fastest aging countries the policy is well covered in the literature the wikipedia article is voluminous and well researched i really suggest that you go read it in another video we looked at measures taken by a country to help raise the birth rate we saw how challenging it was for tiny singapore barely 5 million large to have more babies today we're going to look at the opposite situation but first i want to talk to you a little bit about the asianometry newsletter getting tired of me saying the same thing i'm saying the same thing over and over again i want to plug another post from the newsletter i went back and looked at the time when the chinese government just stopped approving video games no warning no real thing that anyone can do about it zip nada dilch it was a year without new mobile video games check out the post for that in the asian nomatry newsletter coming up soon you can find the link to the newsletter in the video description below or you can just go to agenometry.com subscribe and i'll try to make it worth your while you can expect a new newsletter every four days at one am taiwan time much thanks the general narrative on the one child policy is that the birth rate in china was high and out of control until the policies announcement in 1979 three years after death of mao to tong mao to don encouraged people to give birth and reproduce and it pins the one child policy on successor deng xiaoping and his circle of cadres it is a pretty compelling narrative and definitely reflected the impression i had of china's birth rates prior to starting on the research for this video with that being said i would characterize this narrative as a simplification the chinese communist party had long been interested in birth and population policy basically from when it assumed power the party sought to address issues in china's already massive population people looking to confirm the general narrative on china's reproductive policy prior to 1979 being out of control often point to remarks made by mao mao's most cited comments on the population come in 1949. dean anderson u.s secretary of state under truman had said that china's overpopulation led to the revolution mao mift said in response it is a very good thing that china has a big population even if china's population multiplies many times she is fully capable of finding a solution the solution is production the absurd argument of western bourgeois economists like malthus that increases in food cannot keep pace with increases in population was thoroughly refuted in theory by marxist long ago people looked at the statement out of its context and took to believe that it means that mao was all for the babies looking at it within context however it feels more like of a communist response to a western criticism than a weighted declaration of policy yes mao has made contradictory comments on population and its control but he likes to make contradictory comments in general i would say that this is in line with his character charismatic but cagey he's mao zedong he says whatever he wants as the 1950s dragged on in china struggled economically mao looked at reducing china's fertility rate as a way to address persistent poverty in the country in 1957 he addressed the eighth central committee of the chinese communist party of course birth control is still necessary and i am not for encouraging more births it would be too late to wait until our population size reaches 800 million it's not okay to have human reproduction in a state of total anarchy we need birth planning of course a year later in 1958 he launched the great leap forward and set any population control policies aside for another day the great leap forward caused the famine that killed millions of people but after it ended china's fertility in the urban and rural areas rebounded and more the birth rate soared to a total fertility rate of 6 to 7.5 we had a baby boom mao apparently refocused on population control making a few public comments on the matter in 1960 mal met with world war ii general montgomery and told him we are working to control our population growth end quote in 1965 he told the minister of health quote you need to include birth control when you launch rural health programs end quote more telling amount of tongues thinking though was the implementation of new vastly stricter population policies that came into being while he was still very much in charge in 1971 the chinese government decided to shift gears and get very serious on the country's burgeoning population 1971 saw a marked shift in the government's mood with regards to population control they debuted a policy called later longer fewer in shanghai later as in having women getting married later in their lives longer as in couples wait longer between having children at least four years fewer as in less children two for urban families three for rural ones where previously these vote policies were voluntary now they have become much more mandatory to enforce them the state birth planning commission extended its authority into each village and neighborhood they kept records on women's birth and gave factories quotas on how many births those areas were allowed women who got pregnant without permission would see both themselves and their family members harassed for an abortion once they hit the quota then they were pressured to get sterilized or have an iud inserted throughout the 1970s abortions and iud insertions skyrocketed from 1971 to 1973 iuds doubled to 13 million induced abortions went up to 5.9 million of 30 female sterilizations were also up over 70 percent from 1971 numbers these rates would continue throughout the 70s right before the one child policy and when judged on its goals the new policy was quite successful total fertility collapsed from 5.8 in 1970 to just 2.7 by 1978. for a poor agrarian society such a low birth rate can be said to be unusual my economic demography class taught that economic growth and education of women tend to lead to societies with declining growth rates was this the case in the birth rate decline in the 70s likely not as china's economy was stagnant through the 1970s the cultural revolution likely had something to do with that so it's likely more the new chorus of policy all this happened just before the one child policy was ever announced in the first decade and a half after the launch of the one child policy 1979-1995 the decline was from 2.8 to 1.8 on an absolute number of births we would probably say that the 70s were more successful in suppressing births than the 1980s when the one child policy was actually in effect so why launch it deng xiaoping ascended to power after mao's death in 1976. dung has been consistent in his support of population control policies throughout his entire career with his ascension the chinese government moved towards economic reform and a gradual opening up the party central began thinking of ways to connect with the rest of the world and generate wealth so to pull its titanic population out of poverty in 1979 dung met with japanese prime minister ohira masayoshi and told him that he intended to quadruple gdp per capita by the end of the century china by the end of the 70s was marching towards the 1 billion person mark dung and the party saw the sheer size of that number likely has an impediment to achieving its economic goals those were indeed ambitious goals dung and the party intended for economic reforms to do the majority of the heavy lifting but you can also see where the party thought the future one child policy could help less children in the next generation means more wealth can be concentrated it means less kids to have to make rich the historical records at the time are not clear about who actually first came up with the numerical goal of one child per family chan mu hua head of the national family commission at the time most likely had the biggest hand in pushing for it within the party but she probably did so with strong support from dung and hua guo fung however came about the government was encouraging the one child family limit in 1978 before making it into a full-on policy a year later in 1979 after the policy announcement a circle of scientists led by aerospace engineer song jhan promoted a bevy of neo-malthusian theories to help encourage the policies uptake song had attended the seventh world congress of the international federation of automatic control in helsinki finland and was convinced by their population control theories he brought them back to china to help boost the one child policy song john's work had gained a lot of publicity amongst the party with his population projections he presented data that china's ideal population was around 700 million two-thirds of the contemporary one billion number his work gained acceptance amongst high-level cadres including the powerful chenyun and helped convince the party at large that a one-child policy was the only way to avert malthusian disaster while it is sometimes mentioned and accepted without dispute that song john and his coven of scientists quote hijacked the population policy process the party was already deeply involved in population policy at the time and was pondering the one child limit even before song came into the picture like i said earlier china's one child policy was just one of a bevy of population control policies being executed around the world at the time india bangladesh and indonesia had their own too india's was particularly vicious china's policy of coercive birth control went further than all of them in 1983 for example china performed 14.4 million abortions 20.7 million sterilizations and 17.8 million iud insertions that is a high number but for all the nasty headlines the thing is that the one child policy's long-term effect was relatively small here's why much of the reproductive birth rate declines had already been absorbed a decade earlier there was less fat to cut implementation was also spotty for nearly 30 of the 36 years the policy existed from 1979 half of all parents in china were allowed a second child and today china's birth rates are in line with that of her confucian north asian neighbors taiwan hong kong south korea and singapore all of whom are in the same place today without needing a one-child policy of their own it is like as if the policy hardly mattered in the grand scheme of the country's development and we should reflect on that all right that's all i have for today subscribe and like the video if you liked it and um take care of yourselves out there see
