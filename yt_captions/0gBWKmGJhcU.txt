let's talk about my process when learning 
a new programming language but specifically   learning a new programming language fast i think 
it's something that as software engineers that we   really need to find that balance of both learning 
new things fast as we're always learning and   always growing and the demands for our skills keep 
on changing which is exciting but also let's be   honest it's kind of exhausting that mixed with 
not only doing it fast but having the quality   i'm going to share with you my process of 
learning a new programming language in five days   now the reason i chose five days for this video 
is specifically because a lot of times if i'm on   boarding for a new project at work i need to get 
familiar with that code base that language really   quickly and there are some tips and tricks that 
i've learned tips and tricks so cliche but such   an easy tips and tricks that i've learned along 
the way that truly helped me and i have seen using   these and utilizing these make my learning process 
not only faster but less stressful before we get   into it though make sure to hit that subscribe 
button for more tech and coding related videos   leave in the comments down below other topics you 
want me to cover ask your questions to me this is   why i'm here i want to share my experience 
my insight my wins but most importantly my   failures and what i've learned from them so leave 
in the comments okay let's just jump right in   the first thing i do when i'm learning 
any new programming language well i was   going to say start with the core key 
concepts and the fundamentals which   isn't the first thing but i would say even before 
that get it running on your computer get the   environment running find a uh ide that really 
works for you with this find what language what   ide is recommended for the programming language 
and just get it up and running that's my first   thing second thing with that in the first 
tip i would say is go to the documentation   that is i would say tied into that because too 
often when we are learning something new we as   developers like to do it the hard way meaning 
documentation for whatever reason is something we   detest i guess until it's absolutely needed i 
feel like we always go to stack overflow but   when you are learning something new specifically 
a new programming language go to the documentation   different languages will have different uh 
varying levels of documentation but for example   with python they have great documentation 
and it literally tells you where to start   the second thing i like to do is to really focus 
on building habits for learning and what i mean by   that is if i need to learn something new in a very 
short amount of time i like to have a plan going   into it and i think it does a few things one 
thing it really does is hold me accountable it   i know that every day at this time i am going 
to be learning this new programming language   let's face it the older we get the less time we 
seem to have to learn new things and that's really   unfortunate but it's just with bills and career 
and family and just life it's hard to find time   to focus on learning something new because when 
you are spending that time learning something new   it's hard to get your mind in the right place of   the right framework i guess you could say 
oftentimes we sit down and okay i'm gonna   learn something new today and then our mind is 
somewhere else and we don't get anything done   so i like to build habits that i do just around 
learning actually you know what let me rather than   be talking about habits i do let me just show you 
let's go come on we're literally going we're going   okay the first thing i like to do when i am 
learning something new and need to get into   what is the word that that routine those habits is 
get out of the house for me going to my co-working   space sitting down somewhere where there's no 
distractions is the biggest piece of advice i   can give you when you are learning something 
new especially if you need to learn it fast   obviously if you don't have a co-working 
space i'm not saying you need that but   coffee shop wherever go to the park if 
it's nice out but somewhere where you   are out of your house and you can totally focus okay so that's kind of what i do on day one but 
really throughout my entire week of learning   something new is to get in that habit have that 
rhythm routine whether it be an hour or two and   making it out of my calendar knowing 
exactly what time i'm going to be going   and it sounds pretty rigid but otherwise i am 
so not someone who is disciplined so i need that   that laid out for me okay so let's move 
on to day two so we have our habits we   know we need to learn the fundamentals we 
downloaded you know the id required for   the programming language on our computer maybe we 
did hello world what's next well for me looking   at day two what that would look like is after i've 
learned the fundamentals and really have a strong   understanding or even maybe not a strong but a 
solid understanding of the fundamentals i would   move on to taking a tutorial now i know there's 
this thing called tutorial tutorial hell where   it's you get stuck on a tutorial or sorry you 
keep on doing different tutorial after tutorial   and that's something you need to be aware of but 
i do think having a tutorial when you're first   learning something new is such a great way to 
really ramp up on something new in a quick amount   of time now for me when i'm choosing a tutorial 
i usually end up doing a udemy or youtube class   usually because they've just been reliable and i 
always go based on what other people are saying   in the comments if it's based on a youtube video 
if it's on udemy i'll do both the comments but   also too when it was created when it was updated 
and the reviews what does it have for reviews okay so now we have taken a tutorial we have 
the fundamentals down what comes next really   for me it's adding on to the tutorial whether it 
be challenging myself to do a new feature or yeah   really just a new feature depending on how big or 
small it is but i think it's a great way to add   on to something that you've already built and not 
feel like your next step is starting from scratch i'm just taking a break from doing some work 
and i wanted to finish off the the last few   days what it would look like when learning a new 
programming language so we have taken a tutorial   we've learned the fundamentals we have our 
habits and our routines what's next and we've   also built upon the tutorial via the next 
thing i would do on the following day is to   build something on your own and for me i typically 
we'll build something on my own that's actually   pretty similar to the tutorial i have taken and 
maybe for some people they want to kind of more   branch out and do something different but i like 
to kind of stay that that path or that course of   action because i know i'm familiar with it i just 
really reinforced my learning so next up i will   build something on my own kind of similar to the 
tutorial i took and even then if i need help or i   get stuck i can always refer back to the tutorial 
it's a good way to really reinforce your learnings us to our last day our fifth and final day and 
the best thing for me that really helps reinforce   again my learnings is to talk about it and i'm 
sure all of you are familiar with the rubber   ducky method but honestly i know it's overused but 
it's so true that if you actually speak out loud   of what you are learning whether it's to a rubber 
ducky or maybe it's just to a wall or whatever it   is whatever your choice is uh to your mom whomever 
it's a really great way to see where there are   gaps still in your learning and where you need 
to go now after these five days are done you're   obviously not going to be a professional in this 
programming language but you definitely have a   solid base of able to kind of of starting to take 
off and for me this is really what i do anytime i   am starting a new project or any kind of thing new 
so okay we covered the five days i gotta get back   to work i'm procrastinating it's a saturday here 
and i'm working on build space building a little   nft game which is pretty cool or learning to build 
it so speaking of learning i gotta get back to it okay we are we are back from our little journey uh 
and i hope i gave you a good insight as to kind of   just what i like to do to really focus on learning 
something new but i wanted to sit down with you   and and continue with some other things that i do 
okay by this point we've gone through really what   each day of learning will look like and break 
broken it down of what it should entail and how   to really get the most out of your learnings but 
i want to end by saying something that took me   a long time to get grasp this is something they 
don't teach you in school they don't teach you   lots of people don't ever learn this which is you 
know more than you think you do by this point of   your learnings with something especially new 
programming language you're probably sitting   there going i still have so much to learn and 
yes you do i know that feeling but also look   back on those last few days this is so important 
look back on those last few days and realize just   how far you've come how much you have learned that 
motivation that fuel of recognizing just how far   you've come should just push you forward to keep 
on going and it really provides a snowball effect   we always look at how far we have to go but we 
really need to look at just how far we have come   and i know that sounds pretty obvious or like yes 
tiffany of course but i really hope you take those   words that i shared with you about reflecting on 
how far you have come and put them into action and   and really do that as well because for me 
that's the main motivator as to why i am able to   pick up new things quickly and whether it 
be programming languages frameworks anything   is because i can see just in such a short amount 
of time how capable we are to learn so much and   that's really exciting and pretty cool so really 
don't doubt yourself build up that confidence that   these are the skills you have were able to do 
in such a short amount of time and utilize that   to keep on going okay i hope you enjoyed this 
video of how i would learn a new programming   language or do learn a new programming language 
in five days or less and listen if this is your   first programming language you're learning i'm not 
trying to set unrealistic standards here by saying   you need to learn in five days but rather having 
an understanding and sharing with you my process   to learn something new and just how capable we 
as humans are to learn so much in such a short   amount of time with a little bit of different 
tricks and tactics to help us out make sure to   hit that subscribe button for more tech and coding
