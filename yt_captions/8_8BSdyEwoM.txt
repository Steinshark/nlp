big chess boom in December and January and I was doing all sorts of other things and I neglected guess the ELO but also too many episodes does get a little bit stale no your favorite series that you might watch is 20 seasons in it's okay to take a little break but now we are back and we are better than ever and we are not going anywhere buckle up fasten your seat belts and welcome back to guess the ELO first game Rue Lopez F6 we welcome back this wonderful series and we have the move F6 now I will know very quickly the next few moves if black was actually trying to play the move F5 and go for the yanish or the schliemann or if black played the move F6 because black is 500. okay Bishop takes Knight okay now you take like this good castles Bishop G4 okay don't take don't go there either I'll do that either I mean what what why okay fine wow D4 is a good move still I don't know was it okay this is a sure sign of three digits all right this is like well if I move my Bishop there maybe they won't see The Rook is hanging oh my God oh my God all right Queen takes Queen nice you're good you got this now you're gonna see that it you might no we didn't see it he didn't see all right 95 any Rook move is good yup yo that Bishop went there there there there there there there there it might as well just keep going just keep it dude oh almost damn okay now the Rook is open all right now that's not really under attack but at this level it's under attack not anymore long Castle good move wow oh my God oh my God Knight didn't it oh oh yeah yeah well my why why does the arrow stay why does the arrow stay chess.com why what what is what's that but I mean seriously why is it still there did you see that all right Rook C4 okay yeah the pawns just go you gotta you gotta Play Bishop D6 before he gets smooshed oh God oh God all right you're just down to Bishop just moved that's just the Free Pawn Rook takes F4 okay can I I just have a quick question very cool question not not a thought-provoking question what is the plan with the pawns going up the board are you gonna bribe the the the people at the toll booth what what is the idea are you just gonna pay your opponent not to take the pawns or what is that the plan yeah because White's just gonna come here all right and now what and now what you can't push upon through a pawn all right he's he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna Queen isn't he I mean let's let this is this is Castillo of course he's gonna quit he's gonna Quinn King oh God move the bishop please oh my God oh my God oh no he's gonna win all the pawns oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God all the pawns are gone oh my God oh my god oh he's just oh my just he's gonna be that's it are you kidding me why just B2 the game is over I mean come on okay no just all right there you go nice ah and he's gonna get two queens yeah nice and don't stalemate don't stalemate don't stalemate don't stalemate whoa what the heck not even Queen F5 okay like 600 right we got there in the end it was messy but it was gotta be 600. between six and seven hundred 640 versus I think black is better than white actually I'm not sure because black did some really dumb things in this game no disrespect Gotham sub but it's guess the ELO I mean you you signed up to be disrespected no guys come on I mean white did play A Rue Lopez and there were some good moments in the game and there go the arrows again look at it look just what is happening oh my god um all right uh no I'm gonna say like mid to high 600 that that's that's ain't no way it's any higher than that just ain't no way there's no way not possible all right and survey says we are going over to the other tab survey says wow 900 versus 885. that's crazy sorry there was a little bit of a lag there 900 versus 885. really for real but I felt and it's not even time trouble how much time was spent on F6 13th wait this was like he thought about this move why is it what oh my I mean I'm I don't know how I feel about that I don't know I feel about that I'm not gonna lie I don't know guys guys I don't know I'm gonna be honest I'm a little shook 900. yikes all right we're going we're going back that's what we're doing all right okay that that was ah game was very scatterbrained very scatterbrained wow also if you're 900 playing Rue Lopez I don't even know what to tell you I mean you I feel like but some people swear by it you know like I like I I'm of the opinion play whatever you want but if you're 900 playing The Rue Lopez you're just you're crazy I mean there's so many openings you don't even need to play the stuff I recommend don't play the Vienna don't play but play the Italian the Italian Target's a weak Pawn near the opponent's king it just feels like the plans are much more natural but whatever whatever you play whatever you want I don't care I don't care E4 I don't care Sicilian nice that's not what you're supposed to play but whatever oh god oh this is high level stuff take oh my God this is very high level stuff very high level stuff here you're not supposed to play uh B4 against D6 okay oh my God Bishop G4 okay immediately white is fine that's just the Free Pawn actually you can just take Knight E5 it's free it just takes if takes takes if takes takes and if takes takes easy 95. 90 Jesus night look at this Knight D4 is the over complicating of Knight E5 isn't that funny you have absolutely no need you have no need to what he hung the bishop but does he see that okay that was so strange Bishop B2 okay Queen B6 so the best move here is very tough in this position if if white finds Bishop D7 this is at least like 16 1500 I think but then the bishop is hanging right nice the queen no longer defends the Knight so now the King has to take very nice inclusion and if you also find Queen G4 and then taking the D oh wow oh wow oh wow oh wow oh wow Knight C3 not even taking on G7 taking on G7 is too much because suddenly your pieces are completely stuck oh my God night see-through oh my God oh rugby one Rook ab1 what you can take that that's the best move Bishop takes A7 is the top you cheating or what 2200 Rook B1 I would play okay Bishop B6 only works if this because Fork but if this you just lost short-lived like damn you a genius bro oh no he only calculated this oh now you're just down a bishop all right tough you were brilliant while it lasted F5 it's still a very hard position for black to play okay it's it's very what what hey net what did you cheat and then throw in a few moves of your own what was oh Rook C1 oh my God Rook C1 oh my God it's not checkers just because you can take something doesn't mean you should you absolute bozos oh my gosh okay black is still doing well because there's a million pieces yeah oh don't no you can't trade Rooks if you're playing with white no you can't try you got no pieces left just okay don't lose all your pawns and don't blunder any pieces oh oh no there's gotta be a win somewhere rookie three Rook D okay don't blunder a fork just don't blunder it don't blunder what come on what why you had all your pieces you had all your pieces you you why where did they all go oh my God oh my God he didn't even play Queen C5 oh my God what is he doing oh God oh God oh my God oh my God oh my God what was this game what was this game I mean I don't have a huge amount of information I got like a decent opening Knight D7 is such a weird move I think anyone with a high rating I think anybody above 1600 should play Knight C6 can we agree on that I mean Knight D7 is a crazy move why would you play Knight D7 instead of Knight C6 if this if if this group of players is above 1800 I'm gonna be really mad because this is a crazy move and then this is just a little too fancy this is a really high level I mean Bishop D7 but then but then what the heck was this and what I mean what the heck was this what was night that I mean come on right like what are we even looking at what is Knight D5 I mean come on what oh I'm gonna say like High 1400 I I'm gonna say like 14 1500 I think that's what I think wait yeah I'm gonna say like 1400. 1400. because uh oh my God no way a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand found this this this and this a thousand a thousand a thousand one thousand not two thousand one thousand a thousand one thousand like one with some numbers after it found that Bishop D7 Queen G4 I mean that's completely insane that is extremely impressive I mean that's I that's crazy I I I don't know I really I don't know what I was expecting honestly I I I I after I saw the opening I I just assumed High rating wow that's completely crazy oh my goodness that's nuts well played that was unbelievable that game was uh unpredictable in one word F3 move three wow F3 move three E4 okay normal okay this is all like normal this has all been played many times oh take take and what don't you have like Knight D5 what the heck G5 who are these people who are you guys what oh Knight C7 no but this is not this is your game all right don't tell me your rating what is uh what oh did this person play F3 because maybe they prepared here to play Knight F3 that's funny I mean that's a play F3 not Knight F3 uh because you're not you're not supposed to play F3 here that's not there's no night so you're not actually threatening any advance that's very funny but okay yeah white uh sacrificed the bishop to go here and win The Rook but that's not a good deal that's not a good deal because you're gonna lose your knight and you're just much worse you play F3 against King's Indian oh but this is not a good deal this is not good uh you play F3 against King's Indian but you don't exactly know what you're doing I mean Bishop F2 back and slow play it Don't Force It you gotta go here maybe H4 long Castle this doesn't work almost almost all the time almost all of the time this is not a good decision okay it's just not good now what did you do how did you play after B5 now just crushing for black just B5 yep uh Knight C5 is just winning yup take on C4 Bishop f8 probably okay yup yup oh don't take the Rook cause then you lose C8 yep okay you're you're kind of figuring it out if I was black here I would play Knight D4 or Bishop C5 Knight D4 yup Bishop C5 ah don't trade on your opponent's terms don't trade on your opponent's terms a bishop and a knight significantly lose their value together when it's an end game if it's just like a rook is it ain't gonna work so if white is able to trade the rook and then use the two on one white is going to be playing for a win so Rook C1 okay ah you lost you lost you lost you got tunnel vision you anticipated Bishop D4 and you forgot about Bishop A3 yeah yeah that's the game yeah that's nice check all right so now white is much better so bishop and Knight are better than a rook the more pieces there are on the board in this case The Rook is very fast so the pawns will go there The Rook will go there and you'll try to break through and that's the only plan that white has if black had no a pawn and white had no pawns this position is completely hopeless for white well I guess white is up a Pawn on the on the H file but it like white has no chance to win all right so what did you do B4 nice A4 Knight okay you should probably play A5 but I like B5 no problem there might be Bishop C3 all right yup uh Rook C2 yup oh my God he's doing it exactly as I would do it oh my God Rook F7 how do you get through can you play Rook takes A7 can you play Rook takes A7 first you went here oh my god do you have Rook takes B6 and Rook A7 oh oh oh oh oh God oh God oh God oh we can't stop oh oh and this is why a knight is trash because look how slow it is oh he oh Lord Oh Lord he gonna make it ow he's gonna make it oh my goodness and black resigns some guy in chat said why do you sound so flabbergasted after each move your type of content appeals to Zoomers who need a dopamine fix and they like loud yelling I'm a sophisticated viewer and I would like to only partake in the consumption of content by content creators such as Daniel nariditsky International Master Eric Rosen and power play chess Grand Master Daniel King at times also chess Network you need to calm down Gotham why do you yell after every single move instead of just departing and not consuming the content I'm going to critique it I will write about it in my new publication chess streamers weekly oh yeah okay anyway um what is the ELO of this game okay we got a guy who plays the F3 system against the king's Indian defense noses opening to about move seven or eight gets a worse position but fights puts up a good fight plays a lot of logical moves then blunder is in one happens guy misses it and then wins a really nice end game I'm gonna say like high 1300 I'm getting good 1300 vibes from this game if you're over that I'm gonna be very upset because your your opening is not good enough I would say I would say you need to really improve your opening let's see there's no way 1700 I am going to be so mad if it's 1700 if you're 1700 you need to be crushing King's Indian it's a very common opening all right I'm gonna pop over here survey says no at nearly 1800 but your position was so bad after 10 moves no dude come on dude no man oh you gotta go CSU Dynasty brother you gotta you gotta tighten up that repertoire I mean I mean come on what are you you're 1780 you're worse on like the eighth move of the game I mean man what what 10 moves no guys this is not good guys you know what they should tell you this should tell you that openings mean nothing you can get to 1800 guys come on you can't see the frame what can you not see what it's too small just it's okay just believe me it says 1800 I promise I wouldn't lie to you I wouldn't lie wow all right CSU you changed your opening because of this game play Four pawns attack four pawns attack is fun you just put four pawns forward and then you attack or play trimpowski do you know how demoralizing it is to study in a hundred hours of King's Indian Theory and then just get hit with a trombowski whatever you don't have to listen to me don't make me do that whole Spiel again E3 D5 oh Queen E2 oh this is gonna be a good game all right I'm gonna go I'm gonna go through this one pretty quickly G6 Queen B5 okay Queen B3 okay no children uh I need you to stop developing your queen so early in the game because if you develop your queen so early children You're Gonna Lose the queen of Chloe Knight C3 Bishop G7 Knight takes D5 okay tremendous losing the knight in one move okay castles all right me six fine okay we're just not gonna Castle we forgot about that oh Bishop is trapped oh brutal block the pin and take the Knight wow yep okay double attack on the queen oh wow wow wow do you think black saw this I'm getting the sense that black is like 1800 and white is like 600. I think I'm getting the sense that black is playing his friend like I think the guy playing with black the gal playing with black is playing their friend and trying to teach them chess that's that's the vibe I'm getting I'm not getting an equal this is a real game that's crazy you guys are equal in strength Knight E4 okay so again another example of don't trade two pieces for a rook in this case you're plus eight because you're up like nine points of material um okay rookie eight okay okay I'm waiting for one of you to have diarrhea two brilliant moves what three brilliant moves what is this what is this garbage what is this were you what is this mittens against this 800 I don't know what what did you submit what the hell is going on here are you the same rating or not I'm telling you this it seems like uh this is like a game where a person is teaching their friend how to play chess or something really Nemo played this that's disrespectful I mean unless you meant she was playing Black so what do I judge this off of do I judge this off of the person playing white or the person playing Black I'm gonna say 500. gotta be 500 right I mean the guy with white played like somebody some decent moves gotta be like 500 right I mean I don't play some some logical looking moves I don't know I'm come on what is this we need two queen B5 what what are we even looking at no way right okay if they're the same level then 500 if they're not then black is like 1800 and white is like 300 or something I don't know I I really have no idea so let's go here and 1500. 1500 really that was a real game that was a real game by a real person that was at the time this game was played were you guys lower it looks like you guys were 900 at the time this game was played ah I see fascinating stuff fascinating all right I don't know what's going on anymore hmm okay oh it's time for our last game of the day Gotham sub with the white pieces okay well Dutch London Dutch Knight C3 okay Queenie ate to unpin yourself and play E5 okay Knight D5 is winning but you're not gonna play that obviously what what is that what you played Knight D5 now Knight E7 or that well I thought that white was gonna take the pawn with the Knight black literally pre-move 97 King h8 and then white went right here and black played it anyway and then white takes the Rook what the hell is this what the heck is that What Now The Rook can just move out of the way oh my God I hate I hate all of you move the bishop out move it out or else black is gonna go here and you can't guard your okay folks I have a question is it better to save your knight or your Bishop in this case if you move your knight your Bishop gets taken if you move your Bishop your knight gets taken let's just forget for a second that you have Bishop charles.com you guys are killing me really I listen I don't know who codes this nonsense but I just removed all the arrows and there they are again I mean like come on so Bishop takes Pawn is a good move but you got to save the bishop like even if you don't play that you got you gotta get out and you gotta you gotta there's a tactic here it's why the computer says it's like bad the computer wants to like trap the I can't even make moves I can't even can't even make moves the reason why it's minus one is because the computer finds some way to trap this bishop but if you're going to save one or the other you got to save the bishop don't save the Knight okay white save neither white just played Queen A4 so um but normally you you get the the best movies to get the bishop out of the position all right Queen A4 pug POG I love this move C5 is a high level move wow and now you're just gonna push on the queen side right oh that's scary that's a great move wow completely F3 F3 oh yeah oh yeah make that weakness baby all right now what black needs to do here is find a way to get the queen to the H3 Square that's what black has to do now you can't go Queen F5 because you're gonna get taken but what you can do is you can play Bishop F5 all right so you got to be a little bit patient here you got light squared weaknesses near the king slowly but surely you'll make progress and you'll okay all right yep okay okay terrific 1100 1100 lines 1100 23.50 23.50 okay okay all right okay okay
