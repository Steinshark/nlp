hey this is Gary with the pragmatic engineer and today I'm gonna talk about some of my confessions as a hiring manager I've been a hiring manager for about five years at Skyscanner later at Uber I also know a lot of I gotta pause this for a quick second because I've never understood how to say this man's name and he just said it hey this is gargoy with the pragmat gallery Mike am I close Tech engineer and today I'm gonna talk about some of my confessions as a hiring manager I've been a hiring manager for about five years at Skyscanner later at Uber I also know a lot of other hiring managers who I talk with and I want to give a bit of perspective from the other side and also someone is he Irish is that what I'm detecting what's this accent there is a little bit of an accent Hungarian fellow potato eater Georgian protoss okay you guys it's some kind of European I don't know he has this there's something in there advice that you might find useful when applying this one is like this can be from the likes of did he just throw in two audio tracks just then sorry I got super confused there you might find useful when applying next one is that big tag this can be from the likes of uber Lyft all the way to Google Facebook and other big tech companies first your experience with the recruiter themselves it might not fully be indicative with the experience with the company now this is an interesting one and I've been talking with hiring managers some the experience with the cruder is not indicative of the experience at the company I'm gonna go yes no personally on this this little this little item which is yes you gotta still remember that your company produced this recruiter right your company said hey that's a great idea recruiter go do that right like that you gotta remember that that did happen at some point at some point they said that meets R Bar check mark right and so hmm that's all I have to say is hmm you know little little sus I'm not too sure if I agree with this but we'll keep going keep hiring managers who disagree with us and they say that they think the recruitment experience will be representative of the company which I some would agree with companies who care about employee well-being typically invest a lot in their hiring processes so they will measure satisfaction of candidates going through the loop they'll want to try to filter out recruiters who are not doing that great so for example if you're asked to rate what the process was like and you're getting reach outs for feed back that probably means that that company cares about their employees and also their candidates can you ever get good information from somebody who gets rejected how is your process of being said no to great I felt cared for every step of the way specifically the part with my resume and the garbage it's just like do you really want that the rejection made me feel better about myself completely I felt like we were family it's like family all over again you just left for the cigarettes this time instead of Dad and companies who do this definitely include the likes of Google Facebook and some other companies as well all right all right I will go one two five we also start to do reach out at least in my area to see what candidates thought about the process now at the same time Recruitment and Engineering are two separate functions they also report differently recruitment reports into HR yeah HR side of world and Engineering reports into the CTO or engineering you're gonna check with the recruiter for a lot of time during the process the injury manager and the interviewers they're gonna have a dotted line with the recruiter they're gonna talk every now and then it doesn't follow up all the time or it's not as responsive it might not mean that a company is like that now what will be indicative of the culture is the interviewers so the interviewers engineers themselves if they come across as not friendly or rude or on the positive side if they come across as As Nice people curious accommodating that will be a lot more indicative of what you can expect at the company so I would say pay a lot more attention to the engineers and the interviewers and the hiring managers you talk with on the process than the recruiters I also want to be fair that companies also will select out engineers in which you know you know what I mean like uh not every engineer is is designed to work in the interviewing space okay some of them are some of them are just regular twitch Chatters is what what I'm trying to say right now is that some of them are your standard twitch Chatters not necessarily useful during an interview process but still we could still appreciate them for who they are you know what I mean art users it might have also gone the other way you might have had a really positive experience with a recruiter someone was really attentive you might have had a really good feeling maybe they just made you feel really comfortable and feeling good about this place and when you start the team might just be different again the recruiter doesn't work on the engineering team they work with the recruiting team and their goal is to try to help candidates as best as they can and there's another problem there's some of these bigger companies that just spread out interviewing like wildly like take Google for instance Google will they they just have a hiring Committee of people that go and they they rate you on the most ridiculous things ever possible and so if you don't write down perfect code on the Whiteboard if it doesn't execute they're dinging you they have to they have this like super hey we'll never be biased process so therefore we have all these really stupid metrics in which we measure you and at the end of the day you like don't really meet the people on your team you don't even know what you're getting yourself into so you can't really even gauge like Google by their interviewing which I think is a huge kind of blind spot for them and it makes it really hard to want to accept a job there because you just don't even know what you're gonna get you know what I mean you don't even know if it's going to be great or bad or good you don't even know another thing that few people notice after you've gone to the resume screening and you're talking with the recruiter and you're going to the phone screen interview the recruiter will be on your side they're going to be one of your biggest Advocates I've seen this multiple times now this makes a lot of sense if you understand how recruiting Works a recruiter is given numbers to hit they're told hey I want you to hire this many people in this quarter it could be 10 people 20 people here's the seats I want you to fill and every time someone is hired it's an achievement as an NGO you should feature recruiters hire people so whenever someone's in the funnel and they think this person has a chance which is what imagine you had a jira bug that comes in and when you're halfway through it your teammates just throw your computer out the window that's being a recruiter by the way it's just like your everything's going good you think you got somebody great and then they just have to leave and it's just like you got to restart that feature over and over again every single day the true Sisyphus of life is the recruiter feels bad hashtag I can't imagine it why they had them go through the resume screen they're not just rooting for them they want to help them now the way you can take advantage of this is ask the recruiter for advice for support for insights you can be honest with them on where you think you need help and you can ask them for Preparation resources you can ask them for advice on where do people usually struggle in the process have you seen areas where you think it might make sense to focus on areas where the company is a bit more tough you can you can also even you can remember you can even tell them like hey I don't do very great on whiteboard interviews but I'm really good at take home so if you give me a take home I can also really show you how good I am right I think it's good to always be like upfront about where you think your weaknesses are let people know I I think it's a I think it's a good move you know what I mean I do think it's a really good move awesome about the process the recruiter will tell you as much about the process as they know because it's in their interest for you to do well I know some recruiters who I work with at Uber who actually coached some of the candidates so they told them hey you should study this you should look into this they also quizzed a couple of questions preparing them for the phone screen because if you do well as a candidate it does make the recruiter look good this is a similar misconception as sometimes people think their managers might be out there to get them maybe they're giving them poor performance views because they don't like them as a manager if people do well on your team and people get promoted it makes you look really good same thing with big Tech with the recruiter if you're doing big Tech big guns big alcohol they're out there look good and they're going to be one of your biggest allies throughout the process I've been on debriefs where the panel was a bit of a maybe and the recruiter injected themselves and they start to advocate for this person I'm gonna say that for 80 of the time the recruiter will be your biggest Ally throughout the process do you think there's something wrong with the recruiter being a advocate for the position because if their performance is judged by how many people get hired wouldn't that mean they have in some sense a corrupt incentive to be on your side just a thought you know just kind of like a little uh you know a little thought experiment do you do you want that opinion swaying anything I think it's a little it's a little uh it's a little tricky this is the downsides of freelance recruiting yeah absolutely I could see that do engineers have an incentive to agree on more features no they don't if as far as I can tell every engineer if you ask them what they want to do they want to refactor every engineer as time as the as as time goes to zero they're trying to refactor something but they have to first build out this feature really quickly then they're going to refactor this is the last feature before they refactor well yeah Greenfield is just refactoring from your brain to the computer that's why you like it so much okay that's why you like it so much is that you get to actually just refactor your thoughts into code it's the greatest thing ever but then you learn what everybody else learns which is that when you refactor from your brain to code you write shitty apps so then you have to refactor the shitty application you just woke up damn that's late for you aren't you on Central time zone too dang dang the other 20 is when you connect with someone on the interview it could be the hiring manager it could be another interviewer who really feel this connection they feel you've done really well and they will fight for you but that happens a lot more rare than the recruiter sticking the neck out for you all right the next topic is how to prepare for the big Tech interview and what kind of mindset should you go by the way this is you know like he was just talking about someone that's not the recruiter sticking their neck out for you you know what a really simple way to help increase your ability to have somebody to stick out their neck for you at the last 10 minutes of the interview I want you to think back on the interview you just had and ask questions that are more personalized to the person you know like because we've all we've all had the person be like all right um I would just like you to tell me what does your day look like right you're like okay yeah yeah okay here we go this is what I'm doing this is what I'm doing that's what I'm doing okay I would also like to wonder how our features just decided hey okay this is [Applause] hey you're back in the office did you teleport me can you not do that I don't like this I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it Karen [Music] anyways come up with something that's like a little bit more you know thoughtful so what I usually like to do is during the very beginning hey how are you oh what team are you on you're on this team okay I try to put like little little things in my head so at the end of the interview when it comes down to it I get a few minutes I ask specifically about that team right you create a little bit of Rapport you know what I'm talking about make the engineer feel like you're kind of excited about what they do right inflate the ego a little bit if you need to right oh wow that sounds really hard how long have you been doing that for right you know what everybody everybody feels good when you say nice things okay you do I do we all do you know that's a fact of life I'm just saying use some of those things to your advantage it will be a good move okay I'm just saying try it out both there with so first on Preparation I mean these days I don't think there's any excuse for you to not prepare on what you should be expecting on the on-site glue for any big Tech and it will be pretty similar it'll be coding you're going to be given exercises with data structures or algorithms I'm talking to journalists software Engineers if you're interviewing for something specialist for like web or mobile these are all great something a bit more domain specific but for the most part even at Big Tech even when we were hiring for mobile or web at Uber we would ask the journalists questions in the phone screen and I got this interview at Uber and the guys like tell me the running time of this algorithm and I'm like oh the algorithm is this and he's just like haha incorrect property lookup and JavaScript is log n so I was like then it's N squared log n and he's like damn it how'd you know I kid you not that actually happened it was the it was like the worst experience I've ever had my entire lifetime to prepare you should probably get something like cracking the coding interview I've had multiple versions of this Foundation great book everything from data structures go to this video companies will not go too crazy into algorithms even though a lot of preparation focuses on that I would focus more on just coding data structure solving simpler problems it's always a question on how much should you look into I I probably made it until the the third of it it's got a lot of maths in it it's got good content but I would not recommend this I have not used any of this Advanced knowledge either on my job or on the interview so you know if you want to spend a bunch of money just get it but I recommend grocking algorithms over these two and also content-wise you'll be better off and if you're more senior you should probably give this some things like system design the best book I can recommend is the system design interview and Insider's Guide and there's a bunch of online resources and so on that you can look into obviously cover to the main Basics make sure that you're comfortable with the language of your choice at Big Tech you typically can choose whatever language you want to use so just make sure you know that language pretty well with The Primitives what it supports and what it doesn't support it's just practice practice coding practice whiteboard designing you know me personally this is something that makes me sad is that we've went from whiteboarding you know with just our more digital age into online code editors and I've seen more people fail questions in online code editors than I do on whiteboards and the reason why is that an online code editor tells you if you're wrong tells you if you've done the thing incorrectly tells you all the places you've messed up whereas a whiteboard both I the interviewer and you the interviewee just might simply miss a spot or we might assume too much we might do stuff and I find that you kind of skip some of the smaller details and I tend to get around to answers much quicker on a whiteboard than I do on a program because once you're on a program people want to refactor they want to make it look nicer like there's all these weird tendencies that end up popping up because you're on an editor versus being on a whiteboard it's it's weird it's just a weird experience I at least personally have observed I'm not sure if it's Universal but it's definitely something That's Unique see but the thing is you don't need Auto pop-up on a whiteboard because you just go uh I don't know what the apiso read file I'm like okay good now if you're at Google obviously that doesn't work at Google Google wants you to write perfect code on the Whiteboard Google's stupid though Google's been largely stupid we've all known that um so barring Google every other place goes yeah you're good you're good we get it read file we got it right it just gives you the theme it's totally starting to get out of style but some places just do it so just look up for a specific company the preparation advice and there are some articles that will complain about how much you need to prepare for these interviews I personally think you prepare once and that knowledge sticks for you for a long time and by the way you can start preparing early you don't need to wait until you are gonna go to interview for one of these big companies the earlier you start the better obviously having an interview lined up is a great motivator but if you start inching away and knowing your your data structures your hash Maps your hash tables your sax cues some of the basic sorting algorithms Etc you'll have less preparation to do when you decide to interview the next thing is mindset the mindset that I've seen work really well both for me and for candidates who by the way that's a really good piece of advice if you know how to do a breadth first search a depth first search you know how to write binary binary search and you know what a linked list and a stack are good for you pretty much can pass 95 of interviews and that other five percent is either going to be obtuse algorithm in which is very unfair they asked or it's going to be maximum subarray that's pretty much every single interview is maximum subarray at some point and you just gotta you just gotta know that algorithm or just know how to remember it contribute it's true it's always dynamic programming it's always don't even focus about the outcome a lot of people go into interviews and they're focused on doing well and they're really focused on am I going to make it am I going to make it through this interview but if you turn this around and you go into this interview kind of feeling a bit like an underdog feeling like well I I have so much to learn and I have the opportunity to talk to these smart people who are working at this company and I'm going to learn something I don't know what it is but I'm going to go in there with an open mind and I'm just going to learn first of all you're going to get a lot more out of it because even if you get a rejection you never expect it to go through or at least you didn't really care about what the outcome was and you'll definitely take something away so even if you can't finish the interview or you get stuck instead of you know being stressed out you're gonna ask the interviewer like that's interesting so I think I'm stuck here but do you have any ideas on where I could go or do you have any ideas on what I might have missed and so this is super good advice um I love the idea of being less nervous during interview I don't really get nervous during interviews uh there's times where you know it happens I think it happens to everybody no matter how many times you've done it but I typically don't get nervous and the reason why is that I go into that interview knowing that I know all my basic stuff I'm competent enough and that every problem breaks down to one of those I just simply need to hear the problem and walk through it and I'll probably be successful long as I just take a step back and just walk through the things I already know but the thing that's really hard specifically what he's saying is he's just like well you know just go in there without the expectation you know that's very easy phrase to say when you already have a job you know it's a really hard phrase to say that person that's been doing one year of boot camp followed by another six months of just learning all by themselves who's still living in their mother's basement they're 30 years old and they just really want to get something going with their life and they have to put all this pressure on this one chance they finally got after 400 applications being sent out yeah it's extremely easy to just way way way overshooted you know what I mean and so I don't want I don't like to trivialize it as simple as just don't worry about it but if you can just remember like you know all the pieces go through each one of the pieces you know what I mean why is he talking about me oh I know a lot of you guys feel that way right because I hear it all the time you can't tell someone don't worry because there's always someone in a position that's very disadvantaged and you want and they don't get that same luxury of don't worry about it you know what I mean yeah it's very hard yeah dude I get it soda with lime like it is very very hard anyone that tells you that simple one-dimensional don't worry about it you'll be just fine I feel like they've just simply lost a little bit of touch with what it feels like to really struggle and I remember turning a conversation into more of a curious one it also it just changes the Dynamics you're going to ask a lot more questions from interviewers which as interviewers we love questions so what am I interviewing I love when people treat it as a collaborative exercise there's this preconceptions people's head that you go there to interview they give you a question you need to spit out the perfect solution we actually do want to do something right here I find that I stutter an absurd amount and I also find myself talking in 3x the speed during an interview you know you know whether you love the guy or hate the guy go watch an interview with Elon Musk I learned something from watching an interview with him which is when someone asks them a question he does not answer immediately there's no expectation you have to answer immediately take a second think about what you're going to say if you find that you go too fast in and you goof up take a second no one cares if you take a second you can even say uh yeah and he stutters and too yeah everyone does so it's not a huge deal but if you take a second you will stutter less if you think about the path you want to travel ahead of time even if you don't think about every last word you want to say just the path you want to take I want to talk about a b and c all right here we go right and another thing is this is just like a lesson from a father if you're thinking say you're thinking right when someone asks you a question go okay hold on let me think about that right it gives them the identity it lets them know you're thinking you're not just like blanking out in your pants you're thinking think through your steps come up with a two-step plan and then go yeah hey I'm cooking hold on I'm cooking bro right yeah Zoomers Zoomers you say you're cooking I forgot about that I'm not a Zoomer yet well that gives me as an interviewer to signal that you can solve the thing somehow maybe you just knew the question by the way but it doesn't give me anything on teamwork if I could choose between someone who just did this they stay quiet for I don't know five minutes and then spit out the perfect solution or someone who talks with me throughout the process they tell me what they're thinking they ask me some questions they confirm that the assumption is correct I'm gonna get a lot more signal from that person and and I'll say well this person not only solved it but they did a good team or good communication which is really important at Big Tech at Big Tech you're gonna work with so much with people communication is starting to be one of the signals that is a key signal that people are collecting basically people who are not good at communication will have a harder time getting an offer even if they're good at coding so that that's a hard one uh because I have this thing which is if something's very simple to you I don't really expect you to talk a lot so if somebody's like ah yeah I could do this pretty quick I don't expect them to do it if they're like yeah I got this and they just start going I go the broken cook it right like it's fine it's fine go run do it to me it doesn't that doesn't matter because if something simple I don't want you to talk to me right I don't need to have a fireside chat every single time you get a new problem right but if you on the places you're not sure about I like it but if you do that and you go completely quiet and then you completely screw it up then yes then it's on you and you've made a huge mistake right that's where you've made the the worst mistake which is you didn't communicate you put a bunch of crap on the screen and you absolutely uh made the interviewer have no idea what you're thinking and where you're at and so that so either you got to be able to nail it or you better start asking questions right you can't just be going in there trying to do some shrimp fried rice and end with just an egg broken on the floor right that would be bad it's Bad News Bears so just take this mindset and don't just do it for the interview do it even before and after when you talk with the recruiter tell them that you're super excited I have worked with the senior that's not communicative uh the thing is is that if I ask you to go build a service and you know how to go build the service I don't need to know about it right I need you to come and go like this hey here's the contract that I've decided I'll go okay that's a good contract or I'll say hey I don't like that contract let's change it up right I want you to design things right like I think that that's the most healthy team you can be on is when each engineer has autonomy but decisions are still made at some point together because if you feel like you have no ownership like right like imagine I'm your senior engineer and you're over there and you need to build up a service and I go like this you need to build up a service you need to do this you need to use this you need to use this why aren't you using that like here's your exact API I want you to make you need to do all these things I think you would find it's like kind of annoying and you'd find that you don't have much creative juices in the thing but if I say hey can you go design that system and then go build it I think you'd be pretty excited right I think you'd actually yeah literally hired copilot I think you'd love the freedom now even if you totally train wreck it you learn more you think about API API design is such like an underrated skill like people who can design an API to last for two years they are geniuses right they are P I can't even wrap my head around how good they are right and so like I want to see that and so I I love trying to give people the freedom to hang themselves as opposed to the freedom where no problems could possibly ever happen right and who cares if you mess up you messed up let's go back to the drawing board let's fix it now obviously if I do that 20 times with you and you never stop messing up maybe we gotta skip we got a skill issue right we got a skill issue and it's also scalable it's highly scalable right you get people that can do their own things fast you're excited to get feedback you know there's things that you could get better at and you'll see where this goes but do it on the interview as well so when you introduce yourself you know you can just tell that you're excited to be here you're excited to learn something new and to solve problems together with the interviewer when you're doing the problems don't think about them being stuffed think about this is an interesting problem that I didn't come across and this is so interesting I wish I knew how to solve it let me work with the interviewers to see what I can do when you finished and you got the solution don't just stop there and say like oh I'm done say I wonder if there's any edge cases I didn't cover when people ask you how you would productionize the code you tell them how you do it and then you turn it on sale but don't do this your place what other things do you do do you have Canary tests for example remember earlier when I talked about doing the thing ask personalized questions what does your day look like just be careful ask personalized questions think about them for two seconds people make connections if you talk to them right no one makes a connection with you if you're asked like a PR statement about how does your company do something right it doesn't feel very good but if you ask how do you do it how do you do you people feel more connected wanting to learn some something and you're going to learn a bunch of stuff about how the company Works how those Engineers work and you're going to make a lot better impression as a hiring manager and it's not just myself with most high reminders we love curious people when you go into big Tech you're not going to know half the stuff because the internal systems are different you've never seen them unless you've worked on them if you did a few years ago they've changed already you need to be curious and a fast learner and those are the type of people are more likely to get offers as well so just going with this mindset focus on learning and not the outcome in the worst case you go to a couple of interviews you learn a bunch of stuff yes you get rejections but you learn a bunch of stuff and then you get an offer at a place where you just knew everything by that time you've just learned it on the way with interviews the next advice is pay attention and be fully present there's a lot by the way interviewing is a skill so yeah interview a little technique I have is if you can get interview uh you know you're a little bit into your career so you get a little bit easier time getting interviews go interview at a couple places you don't like or you don't care if you get the job before you go and do the interviews at the place you want to get it even if you're even if you've been doing it for a long time like right now if I I were to go and I wanted to get a job at stream Berry right I'm very excited about getting a job at streamberry I'd probably go to uh I'd probably go to base fluke first and go talk to Bass Fook and be like all right I'm gonna do this interview you know get back into it go through the process feel all good about it then go to stream Berry and try to get that interview you know what I mean advice videos from people who have cleared interviews at Amazon Google Facebook all these places and they're going to tell you to beat the behavioral interview with the hiring manager that's me I'm the hiring manager so let's play this out hey I'm girl guy I'm a hiring manager at this company I'll talk about myself about my background and I read your CV I see your experience would you mind just briefly summarizing your experience and talk about what motivates you looking ahead now at this point a lot of people just flip and they realize okay intro time and they do it in their intro the stuff that they often have practiced they didn't pay attention that I asked them to talk briefly about their background and talk about their motivation what they're excited about what they're motivated about and this happens a lot of the time not just with this specific question but I might ask them to tell me a situation where they disagreed with someone who was more senior some people just start to reach into those examples that they have written down in their head and they start to recite an example that is closest to that now the people that I really get so to be completely fair this is also the advice everyone has been given which is to practice all these things and so it's kind of like you know as someone who interviews you gotta like totally realize that the person no matter how much they don't care they care and because they care they're just going to like try to be the most polished version of themselves you'll never meet it's like a first date you never meet the real person on the first date right whoever they whoever the first whoever that first date is it ain't whoever you're you're gonna have a second date with if you get one right it's a very different person and so it's kind of like you know do you expect someone to be super Community I mean that's a very special skill to have to be able to communicate and be friendly to somebody who you don't know and you know I have a hard time thinking that's necessarily a great skill to always try to hire for because you kind of only you know it's just such a narrow Gap attention to and I think these are the people I'd like to work with are the people who are focused on me they're not focused on trying to understand the question perfectly with the star method having the situation the actions the outcome they're actually listening to what I'm asking them and they're having a conversation and we will often go back and forth and reflect back on on previous things so I do this all the time where I'm this guy clearly does not hire Arch users you can see right away focus on what that person is saying and I reflect on what they're saying or what they said before for example in their introduction they might have mentioned that they had this project where they stepped up to app tested a project where there was none and a lot later in the interview I might refer back to that saying oh so you mentioned that you had a test at that point can we talk a bit more about that especially in the context of let's say mentorship did you Mentor anyone to to add some more tests or how did it impact your team and that's the same thing that I kind of expect from people but I rarely get is someone having a focused conversations especially true with the hiring manager or behavioral interview being present understanding the question clarifying it if it's not clear it sounds like you pretty much are asking for a different like what I'm hearing here is that there's this other other form of communication people often do which is like the three question deep uh style so instead of having the star thing when someone at you know whenever you're having like a conversation you try to do three questions deep you say something you hear what they say and then you follow up on top of that with something deeper and keep getting them to talk I find personally the more you can make your interviewer talk the better you are and so a lot of my goals is to kind of like flip the script on them and try to hear more about what they do and what they have to say because you know ultimately at the end of the day you you even heard it straight from this guy right here which he said I want to hear them you know talk about me I want them to talk to me I want to you know people want they like it I'm just saying just I see this also common I ask a question and people misunderstand it or they don't know exactly what I'm asking and they start to answer something they just take one of their Temple dancers and it's it's completely clear this gives me a signal that you're not a good communicator it's more important for you to not to lose face than clarify something a good example I would say that you're not I mean the thing I don't like about this is you're just not really considering the human element the nervousness when you have Supreme confidence when you're in the position of when you're in the power position it's easy to see these things when you're in the position really really needing a job like that's it's just such a different position to be in trouble of this can be a question that I often ask is I ask people if they have a mentor or if they're mentoring other people and mentoring means different things for different people now some people the people who pay attention they will often clarify would be saying what do you mean under venturing and then we have a conversation about mentoring I don't think people that are paying attention say that I think people just simply have definitions and they go by definitions this goes with all words you hear no one really thinks about the words like right when was the last time you heard someone say terrific and you're like now hold on there you just said terrific but it has two definitions do you mean pertaining to Terror or do you mean something that's good sorry in this Con like I couldn't tell is the movie bad or is it good I can't tell right like I couldn't tell because you used a word that has two separate meanings to it that we all know about right like no one does that nobody does that yeah Jordan Peterson mode right I know that was a very short that was a very Jordan petery type petery petery type answer right well you know see when you when can I do a Jordan Peterson I don't think I can do an accent by Jordan Peterson but dang it in my head because once I can hear the voice in my head then I can do the accent and then they're gonna know that's the problem some people just straight up jump in and they talk about some other thing for example I might have asked about if they Mentor someone but they misunderstood or they don't know and they're answering about how they had a mentor or the other way around these are awkward things but it shows that you're either your present okay Chad's just wilding out there wash your dicks you you you see when you're you I can't do it but I know there's a lot of this I think I think in my head he does this thing if I'm not mistaken uh anyways I can't do it I can't do it or you don't understand what I'm saying or your hesitant to ask and most importantly you're not someone who is really having a conversation so next time you're gonna have a hiring manager interview a behavioral interview and even the normal interview make sure to want to have this conversation and the mindset of being curious and wanting to learn really really helps if you go into the mindset if I want to do well and I want to impress you're going to be afraid to clarify going with the mindset what I want to learn well you should probably clarify to make sure we're talking about the same thing and also you're gonna ask questions again tell that to somebody who really needs a job tell that to somebody who has a kid and doesn't have a job for the last six months go ahead tell that advice oh yeah don't go in there thinking you're gonna do well and you want the job don't don't go don't do that that's stupid right good luck on telling somebody that answer again again if I could do the inverse you know advice it would simply be you you've gone through so many things and you just simply have to give honest answers you don't need to sound great you don't care if you sound bad try to be as honest as possible because that will work 99 out of 100 more than a super polished answer or a completely like uh like unprepared trying to sound good but you don't know the answer so therefore you're gonna make up something on the spot to be able to be just just be honest honestly it's so much better and it'll make you a little bit more relieved too because you don't have to be the most polished person right there's no polished person at a job and if you're working at a place that expects only polished people it's gonna be a pretty rough job I see very rarely and every time there's a huge bonus on the hiring manager interview is people asking questions of me not just at the end but during the interview so for example all right well tell me how to do testing this is the third time he's he's mentioned talking to him your current company do you have automated tests unit test integration test end-to-end tests what is your thoughts on testing and then they'll answer what we'll talk through and then they turn around and ask me so by the way can you tell me how do you do testing what is your take on testing me as a hiring manager rarely anyone does it and the people who do it shows they're curious and they're unafraid to have a conversation in any setting it's not just unafraid they're actually curious to do it so just do this be fully present worry less about how you'll be perceived and have the conversation with the interviewer the hiring manager the design interviewer the coding interviewer Etc the next inside is I I wish I had some water right now I don't have water and I'm just jonesing for it interviews are a two-way street you are probably feeling that you're being interviewed but you should also interview the company so you should not be afraid at the end of every interview you should ask questions you should imagine what if you're getting an offer do you want to work here and there's no better place to talk than with the engineers or with the hiring manager and I think you should ask honestly questions that you care about for example when I worked at Uber in 2017 and we had this terrible press some of the best candidates they stop straight on they ask is the culture as rotten as it seems and what do you think why are you still here if the culture is like this I actually do like that I like when people say I heard Netflix fires fast is this true right they got a little bit of girth to him you know ask those questions that maybe make you a little bit more uncomfortable I like that I like it hey bisco and I thought that was fair questions I was honest they asked what they wanted to know and you know would you want to work in a place where you're unsure about certain things so you can't ask hard questions obviously to do it with good language and some of the professional skills but you should ask about the things that are important to you if diversity is important ask about that if work light balance is important ask about that as well figure out what is important for you learning having budgets to go to conferences people sharing knowledge etc etc figure out what is important for you you know you'd love to work out and reverse interview the company at the end of each interview now one of the last points is these interviews will feel really exhausting especially if it's in a setting where you are you actually go on site right now it's covet so it's probably gonna be virtual interviews and they likely will not be one after the other you know these interviews don't fully represent what it's like working at these companies but they can represent some of the more crunch times so there will be days especially if you're in a more senior position where you will have even two of these interviews a day multiple meetings you'll have to get your code in there you're on call there's now now an alert so I remember that my both my Uber and Facebook interviews are really exhausting and somebody some of my Uber Days Later were also similarly exhausting to what I felt at the interviews not all of them not the majority of them but some of them so just know that big Tech often has a higher Pace especially when you are on call which is pretty common at these places also when you have deadlines it's not true anywhere so when I talked about this topic with other hiring managers and people working at companies some people are saying they don't think the stress of the interview represents the stress of the day today especially people from Google said this I've heard some people from certain Amazon teams say the same thing so maybe it's not true but I would prepare that big Tech pays well and it's exciting and you're working on big things but it can be stressful I I agree with that um that's why it's a very good thing to learn how to say no learn how to uh fight for your own sanity I think a lot of people especially when they're new they just want to impress somebody so they go and every time they're given a task they go and work for 16 hours straight and they get it done and then they send it to you and then you critique it they feel horrible because it wasn't great but again they just spend 16 hours power coding and just you know ejaculated out an answer and then you finally go through that cycle and they solved it really quick and then you're like okay okay that was really really good you're obviously very very fast you did that in such a short time here's another thing they do it again they do another super high super high paced whatever it's called and they just do it over and over and over again to themselves where they develop this this perception of them that they're super fast but they're not necessarily super fast they're just working in an unbelievable amount of hours so make sure you always you know you don't need to kill yourself to do something understand the culture you're in but you gotta also you also if your first job ever you know if it's your first job ever and you're trying to get somewhere you know there is something to be said about working more and working hard you know what I mean you really got to you want to be able to you want to be able to learn as much as you can when you're first starting out especially when it comes to everything uh involving working at a company so you kind of have to you got to balance that and you know people will always bring a burnout one big thing about burnout is that you can't I I mean I personally find this works and I've had enough people say something similar that I think it's really good make time to investigate and build things that you're just interested in and I find that what that does is it just helps burn out kind of subside you know it really it really is it really helps you kind of avoid a lot of those things because you're doing things that still interest you because at your job let's just face it I like to Garden I don't want to go do hardscaping for other people right those are two very different things even though you could be doing the exact same thing the exact same thing physically you could still be setting down the exact same little concrete path whatever you're doing but doing it for yourself versus doing it for someone else generates very different feelings and so it's like it's the same thing with programming take the time to do things for yourself the things you want to build the things you want to do and it will kind of refresh the entire the entire thing because then you don't just have this one hole you keep going into where it kind of feels meaningless sometimes it's more often stressful sometimes it's just every now and then spikes and finally I start my last Insight some people think after they get a rejection oh I just wasted a bunch of time with this interview I prepared so much I went to this on site I it's just time wasted it's not time wasted you always gain experience yeah I've had some failed interviews that I'll I'll talk about on this channel if there's interest where I didn't get an offer and I got the expertise that I needed to get that offer for the next job Uber's a great example I would have not gotten into Uber if I would have not interviewed at so many places before and I got experience every single time even when I got an offer and also when I didn't get an offer I would think of every interview as an opportunity to get experience it's a great experience to have you talk with smart people now if you don't get any interviews the option is for you to pay for mock interviews which will be not the same thing you're not going to get real feedback people will try but they'll do the best it'll cost a bunch of money I think it costs 150 to three you know you can always just have a friend I'm not gonna lie to you getting a mock interview is not hard if you have friends especially friends and software because guess what they'll probably want to mock interview too especially when you're first starting out if you're in college your senior year you know how easy it is to do mock interviews it's like as easy as it gets every last person wants a job every last person's looking for a job go like do the thing 300 per interview something like that so just think about that whenever you're going to an interview you could be paying to do a mock interview if you didn't get the specific interview just going with this mines but Noob interviewer isn't helpful feedback sure but it is very helpful for you to formulate your thoughts and try to talk to somebody right uh what our friends is Linux my friend yes but I mean I really think about it if you haven't even practiced the art of talking through a problem to somebody else being on a whiteboard like you have to go through that emotions first it's gonna feel kind of funny you're gonna feel funny right you go in front of your friend on a whiteboard you're gonna feel some level of nervousness you're going to feel a little bit of kind of out of placement good feel that now so you don't feel that small part in an interview or you'll feel less of that in an interview you'll be more prepared for the feeling it always feels funny the first time said you're going to learn a lot in fact there's a song about it it feels like the first time okay the very first time more you're gonna see how the interviews work and best of luck if you have questions on big second interviews just feel free to pop them in the comments I'll either try to answer what I can or I might make some videos on these if you enjoyed this content please hit the like button and subscribe to the channel I'm posting on software engineering and Engineering Management topics please follow along if you enjoyed this thanks a great video I think there's a lot of great things beside the like I said the only thing I think that was not done well there was just the mentality of the person coming in I think is not the right mentality I think that that only works for people that already have a uh secure position and so just something to think about the name is the primogen
