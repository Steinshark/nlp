in today's lesson we're going to be building a sentiment analysis bot so what it does is analyze the text that we insert and it's going to be able to return to us whether it is positive negative or neutral and this can be really good if you want to automate something that is interacting with some humans because if they write something negative you might be able to respond in a certain way if they write something positive about it you might be able to respond in a different way so you can start capturing the tone of what they are typing and respond accordingly so it's a level up on your chatbot scripts but to demonstrate this we can say what a lovely day and that's going to give us a positive rating so we're going to get a smile a smiley face back we can also type in something such as I hate you and we're going to get a negative score because it is obviously a negative text now we can type in something such as the dog walked in the park something that has nothing to do with anything it's going to have a neutral point of view so it's going to return to us that random I don't actually don't know what they call it that's neutral face but again you can say I love your hats or something and you'll get a positive score back so as you can see depending on what we insert it's going to give us a sentiment analysis rating so that's what we will be building in this script and the very first thing you have to do is open up the terminal and type in PIP install text blob and text blob is going to take care of all the dirty work for us but once you have that installed we can type in from text blob import text blob and then from data classes we're going to import data class because I want to have a data class for my data then we're going to create that data class and we're going to call this class mood and it's going to have two attributes an emoji of type string and a sentiment of type float next we want to create a function that gets the mood based on the input string so here we can type in Dev get underscore mood and we're going to take an input text of type string I'm going to use the asterisk to make sure that the next parameter has to be defined by keyword so threshold of type floats and that's going to return to us a mood so the first thing we want to do inside here is get the sentiment so it's going to be a sentiment of type float which is going to equal a text blob with an input text and it's going to get the dot sentiment dot polarity next we need to define the thresholds so we're going to have a friendly threshold which is going to be a float and that's just going to equal the threshold and then we need to have a hostile threshold which is going to be the same thing except we're going to have a negative sign in front of threshold so the threshold tells us how sensitive our chatbot should be if we Define a threshold of 0.3 for example it's going to say anything below 0.3 is going to be considered neutral so we're not going to just say that just because it has a very small positive score it's going to necessarily be a positive rating we want to make sure that the score is either positive enough or negative enough to actually result in being either positive or negative because saying something such as I'm walking in good shoes can be seen as a positive sentence when we actually want that to be registered as neutral now to determine what we should return we're going to use if sentiment is more than or equal to Friendly threshold then we're going to return the mood class with a smiley and the sentiment score so we can see exactly what the sentiment score is alif the sentiment is less than or equal to the Hostile threshold we're going to return the mood with an angry face and the sentiment else we just want to return the mood with a neutral face and the sentiment score which should either be under 0.3 or above negative 0.3 so he will type in return mode and that will cover what we have to return to get the sentiment now all that's left for us to do is to create the if name is equal to Main Check and just to Loop through it so that we can actually play with this as we test it so while true we're going to get the text of type string which is going to equal inputs with the text and whatever the user inserts is going to be the text that it will evaluate then we want to get the mood and for that we're going to type in mood of type mood it's going to equal get mode we're going to insert the text that we input and we're going to Define a threshold the higher the threshold the harder it's going to be to either get a positive reaction or a negative reaction so if you want your Bots to be super sensitive set this to a low threshold if you want it to be not so sensitive set it to something higher I found 0.3 to work just fine for this example then all that's left to do is to print the mood dot emoji and the mood dot sentiment based on the input of the text and just like that we can run this script and it's going to ask us to insert some text although I'm not happy this doesn't have a space so I'll add a space there we run the script and this time when I type in something such as I love to eat potatoes it's going to give us a happy rating otherwise if I say I am walking it's neither negative nor positive so you will get a neutral rating then we can also say I hate Ai and we'll get a negative rating because that has some negative features but we can try to type in something a bit more complex I'm feeling good today but it's also the worst day of my life and the bot might feel quite ambivalent about that because I mean it is quite confusing you said you're feeling good today but it's also a very bad day so again you can put this threshold a bit lower to register this as a negative feeling because it is slightly more negative than it is positive text blob has this formula to judge how positive certain keywords are and how negative certain keywords are so based on this sentence over here it managed to understand that this is slightly more negative than it is positive and of course the last one is going to be remembered to subscribe and that's also neutral which is perfectly fine subscribe if you enjoy Python and these kind of videos otherwise just continue surfing the internet and having fun but anyways guys that actually covers everything I wanted to share regarding this sentiment analysis bot it was very simple to code do let me know what you think about it in the comment section down below and whether you want me to create another tutorial similar to this one but as always thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
