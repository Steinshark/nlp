ADA ADA Byron as she initially was ADA Lovelace's she became what was so special about her in terms of her education genealogy if you like her genetics what was so special about her that enabled her to do what she did well this is not strictly computer science but it's a good story it does have some marginal relevance to all of this ADA's parents were George Gordon Byron he was born in 1788 I'll put the first name of his wife in quotes actually she was christened I think as an Isabella but she actually liked to run the two together and he lied them into Annabella so that's why I put the quotes around Annabella boom Milbank they got married in 1815 and you can work it out I mean that would mean that byron was 27 she was actually 23 and very shortly after getting married they had a daughter and Byron chose the name ADA for her you know sort to the point poetical ADA Byron born 10th of December 1815 she was the only legitimate daughter of these two now I can only apologize again and say I have to say something about particularly her father because it explains so much about Ada and how she was educated the way she was Lord Byron was unbelievable he was the Victorian bad boy par excellence George Gordon Byron was like an amalgam of Hunter as Thompson you know Sean Penn Charlie Sheen Keith Richards maybe all of the bad boys and it had there been a gang of them a Rat Pack he would have been the leader most definitely indeed hey one of his many many girlfriends for George Byron was a lady called Lady Caroline Lam some of the oldest of my audience will have seen the movie starring Sarah miles and famously Lady Caroline characterized him as being mad bad and dangerous to know he writes like a housemaid on the verge of the vapors mean to like Lord Byron was famous at Cambridge for keeping a pet bear in his rooms and when he later declared himself to be a poet and he was a very good one he went off to Italy to see his political friends and had them visit him people like Shelley and Keats and stuff like that Shelley recounts that when he found Byron by the sea in lodgings the staircase was occupied by six pet peacocks it was this kind of excess it was sex drugs and rock and roll except no rock and roll in those days so his sex drugs and poetry if he doesn't rolls-royce it would have been in a swimming poison oh yes yes yes yes because he was like that and because he left his wife immediately five weeks after ADA was born and they'd only been married earlier that year that Annabella Milbank thought he was the devil incarnate had no time for him and was worried stiff that daughter ADA might grow up in the image of her father so to try and head off trouble at the pass it was decreed that ADA's education could cover things like nonfiction English literature geography botany mathematics physics chemistry nothing that involved the emotions the thing that was absolutely bound in her education was poetry that's inflamed at the passions she might start taking after her father and then heaven knows what what happened so ADA unusually for a woman of breeding in early Victorian era had a very rational scientific upbringing she had mathematics tutors and later on actually in wanting to become an even better mathematician she did ask what she not only took up with Babbage as we'll find out but she also asked for recommendations for other tutors and one of them is a person I think I have men non-computer father already or guess just de Morgan who came up with the rules of the logical algebra later known as boolean algebra so she had de Morgan of de Morgan's rules fames has one of our Massachusetts she was serious about becoming ever more devoted to mathematics think about it 1815 she was a society lady she lived with her mother and a large proportion of living with a mum during the year would be in London in rented lodgings yes her mother was reasonably well-off she was a minor league sort of IRS in her own right they could afford that okay but young ladies are breeding really up until about 1970 in the society circuit had had a ceremony almost of what was called coming out what it meant is you were in debutantes you were a young lady in society who hadn't been formally introduced so the people who mattered in societies so you had coming-out balls in fashionable London and these were attended by the Queen because of course by the time you by the queen or the king when you had 17 on to 1815 1832 was ADA's coming-out ball where she met the predecessor to Queen Victoria whose King William before I think about time but anyway as part of this coming out she met at one of the events a certain Charles Babbage and Charles Babbage invited Ada and her mother Annabella to come and visit him at his house meet his wife and to be shown this miracle of mechanical engineering and mathematics so only Park constructed but we're just waiting more funds difference engine mark to and ADA was completely captivated by this she thought it was wonderful and she and Babbage became shall we say firm friends corresponding very very regularly they kept in touch but in order to explain how it all came down in the end to this analytical engine he goes roughly as follows in the early 1830s Haeju still only 19 corresponding a lot with Babbage about his Difference Engine mark to ask for recommendations for maths tutors and so late 1830s was occupied by the factors in about 1835 I think ADA met another gentleman from high society called William King Merrigan they fell for each other whirlwind romance mid-1830s so the late 1830s you can imagine was spent on William Kings Somerset estates in the process of being domestic and having three children and fortunately for ADA very unusual in the Victorian era they did all survive and she herself did not die in childbirth minor miracle in those days but by early 1840s she'd had her three children of course they were well enough off they'd be looked after by governesses nursemaid and so on she decided that she would like to get back into mathematics and it was at this late stage that Babbage without actually formally publishing his anywhere had come up with the idea of the analytical engine keep it in the CPU or if you Babbage of course would have been the first programmer in a sense of his analytical engine he'd have come up with the design and even had some paper exercises about with that design will this actually work but don't forget the analytical engine was not built has not been built and will cause huge problems in being built however the spec could be obtained and it was very very impressive indeed so why didn't Babbage publicize this more why did Ada and others have to find out almost by knowing him personally the answer is Babbage was thin-skinned think back to my story in earlier videos about Newton and Gauss they were thin-skinned couldn't stand criticism couldn't stand the unwashed criticizing their great thoughts but like Newton he hated publishing if you published then the great unwashed would start telling the B oceans I think it was called by Gauss same thing with back he was so thin-skinned he could not take criticism and worst of all he stopped giving lectures because people misunderstood him and worse still he got heckled so it was no use asking Babbage to give a lecture to the Royal Institution or something in London about his analytical engine not gonna do that however he was invited to go to Italy and I think he was probably a member of the Italian equivalent of the Royal Society so he went over by invitation in the late 1830s to give a talk on his analytical engine a person there called - eg menabrea an engineer with a good maths background who later became Italian Prime Minister actually took copious notes and wrote up a paper published in a French journalist an Italian one amazingly well ada got to hear about this and got hold of a copy of it and decided that she could rework it as translator add a lot to it doing letter and explained it to an English audience so this is where the whole issue comes of Ada as computer programmer yes she really really did understand every nuance of Babbage's design she had to in explaining how this program worked in no doubt writing programs of her own and I think what all 'some presses me about ada when you read her copious notes at the end of this paper beware it's in Victorian English it is heavy going she and Babbage and the rest the Victorians would never use six words where 36 would do all sorts of subjunctive clauses always hard work be warned so anyway in part of our endnotes in this she lets her imagination run free and she says to people you know have you thought could this wonderful engine of Babbage's compose music really is good lateral thinking because Sean and I have stood there at Bletchley Park or sat there in front of my computer here at Nottingham when we the Ackermann function and jokingly said to ourselves who is thinking when the result in command and somehow that's not too difficult to thought to have when the thing is aleck tronic and humming away but to have the thought of this crashing great analytical engine being driven by steam going bang crash bang bang - think of that as a thinking machine I think does require a big leap of imagination so yes she had glimpses of the future there's no question about it she really did even more so if you think that it's actually just on paper at this stage oh yes she's seen some cogs from other things he's done yes later on after her sort of tragic death Babbage when he wrote his own autobiography referred back constantly to what he called his enchantress of number ie Ada herself and this this wonderful paper Oh another lovely babby story I love this one she consulted him while she was writing this paper and he thought it was wonderful but came up with a great idea which you can guess wouldn't it be a good idea my dear if as well as this paper I were to write an anonymous preface to it and flame the establishment and the ground givers for not giving me enough to actually build it and she knew him well enough by this time she adroitly avoided doing that I mean Babbage his idea that so long as it was anonymous nobody would guess who wrote it and just unbelievable anyway that's how it all ended because the trouble was and the really tragic thing for ADA was as the eighteen forties wore on her health got worse and worse and worse it's now believed that she actually died of cervical cancer I think she didn't actually die till 1852 by that time her mother had moved in with her and her husband William king of levelers on their summer sets of state but a week or two before ADA died of rupture ins began all over again because she she called William King her husband apparently according to her Stephen Wolfram log and I believe this is researched well and told William King something that made him very very upset this has not been recorded what it is she insisted that when she died and she knew death was inevitable as she did not want to be buried on the William King Earl of Lovelace estate in Somerset she wanted to be buried next to her father and this if you like is where the local bait comes in for us here in Nottingham her father George Gordon Lord Byron when he wasn't being mad bad and dangerous to know had also actually inherited from a very distant byron cousin the whole of the new state obviously now Houston Abbey is a stately home just north of us here Byron loved inheriting this lord of the manor stride around sword in hand you know order the workers what to do next be a man of what was country state and my learning and reading as well only trouble was virtually bankrupt they could only afford to run the newsstand estate what little money Byron had was spent on sex drugs peacocks and poetry you know so it never really got off the ground and I think fairly shortly thereafter maybe even before Byron died in 1828 the estate was sold and all left the Byron family completely but you said Abbey was there and it brought with it of course the rights of the family grave Byron himself was buried in Hucknall parish church and ADA said an upset her husband and her mum mightily I want to be buried next to my father in a parish church fortunately due to our friends and colleagues in physics and sixty symbols we're able to refer across because they paid and visit to a terminus August tomb in Cutler parish church and have done a video on it and up there on the wall is the clock commemorating Ada Lovelace vertical she's not buried up there she's down here in the family vault or actually this is just the entrance to the family vault at the funeral a it was a small affair but really telling was her mother did not attend I think probably furious at her daughter's wish to be buried next to the hated husband Lord Byron Babbage was appointed executor of aid as well but he didn't attend either read into that what you will but I think one can certainly say that in the past in a despatched she was a troubled soul in many ways there were probably going Zhaan her various sorts that we can only speculate about and yet there's no doubt about it I I don't want to underplay or overplay ADA but she was important she really was she she got it in a sense about software and what software could do and I think she sort of could transcend the unbelievable limitations of the hardware that would have been limited even had it ever been built and could see beyond that she could see beyond that to a future of computing for its own sake if you like that local link has been very important to us as part of the bicentenary celebrations of Ada you know December 2015 everybody labels everything the Ada Lovelace supported the Ada Lovelace thing our excuse for doing this we've labeled our first year lab as the Ada Lovelace computing laboratory is that there is this local connection I don't know that she ever visited Newsted I wish you probably live in London most of us are life with her mom and I bet you her mother if there be any talk of a trip to news they would have vetoed it because it might um you know taking you too dear to that man or something like that but yes that is our local connection
