[Music] oh [Music] all right what's up guys i'm kid bhd here and this is it this is our first look an actual hands-on with the new samsung galaxy fold so ever since it was unveiled a couple weeks ago i've been just sort of fascinated by this phone like samsung never let anyone touch it they'd never showed it to anyone they only had very specific demo footage for a while it kind of felt like a myth but now suddenly i'm actually holding one so the basic concept in case you forgot galaxy fold has one smaller outer screen and one large folding inner screen in a single device for 1 980 bucks this is my very first impressions of the final phone that people paying this money will actually get so right off the bat this phone is chunky so we kind of saw it coming with other folding phones like the royal flex pi and even the huawei mate x but it kind of has basically the feel of two small samsung phones put back to back next to each other with a hinge in between and it doesn't go all the way completely flat against each other when it's closed like a sandwich instead they create this little angle like a small triangle and then the phone's shaped like this folded up is just really tall and narrow so it's got this like candy bar sort of feel and it's pretty heavy as well now the screen on the front as you might remember is a 4.6 inch cover display very tall and then when you flip it open you get a 7.3 inch oled display that's nearly exactly 4x3 so pretty wide now i know a main question a lot of people have about this is probably about the crease down in the middle where it folds so to be perfectly clear yes you can see the crease especially when you're just a little bit off axis or if you have a light wallpaper and yes you can even feel it when you run your finger over it so it's not this perfectly precisely flat uninterrupted glass feel but honestly it gets pretty close like when you're looking at it straight on you can easily forget about it and it's again much better than that royale flex pie i saw it see yes although i guess that wasn't a very high bar to clear and also i gotta say the actual closing and unfolding movement of opening and closing it is extremely satisfying i wish i brought my mic to this hands-on so you could actually hear the thunk sound that it makes when it closes but there's some strong magnets in either half of the phone that open and close and connect it it's so strong you could actually like pick up paper clips with the phone but that opening and closing that funk it makes i kind of love that and the hinge it just sort of snaps open to a full 180 degree flat position and everywhere in between those two positions is pretty fluid to whatever angle you want but it definitely feels like its springs are trying to pull itself closed but yeah opening and closing the phone is definitely a two-handed operation i tried it with one hand and of course i really really didn't want to drop it and i couldn't do it so it's definitely going to be a two-handed process i'm sure that's what we mostly expected and actually that process can get kind of tricky sometimes with the interesting button layout so there's a power button on the side of the phone where you'd probably expect it there's also the volume rocker and also a separate fingerprint reader for unlocking that doubles as a bixby button so it's actually incredibly easy to accidentally trigger bixby whether you're unlocking the phone or just trying to fold it or unfold it i guess that's classic samsung okay a few other things i did notice one samsung did technically just make a phone with a notch and no headphone jack kind of sad i guess but it actually does come with their new galaxy buds their wireless headphones so that's cool and the notch on the inside screen which holds two cameras and a bunch of other sensors actually has this lip to it that's sort of raised up from the rest of the screen but the notification pull down actually doesn't work from that side when you're unfolded anyway so i guess it's not a big deal that the lip is there but you definitely still get it cutting into things like videos and games or really anything that's full screen and then speaking of cameras this phone actually has six total camera sensors so there's the 10 megapixel selfie camera on the front when it's closed then you open it up and you get that notch which has an identical 10 megapixel selfie camera with an additional depth sensor like the galaxy s10 plus and then on the back yes in a camera bump on this already pretty thick phone you have the standard the ultra wide and the telephoto cameras just like the galaxy s10 had so you'll never be at a shortage of cameras and lenses here and you can see just looking at the phone samsung had to do a lot of creative things just to get the fold to work like a normal phone there's some special adhesive in the display and of course the folding plastic that actually folds on the front they also split the battery into two parts one in each half of the phone and it's all connected through this very special hinge design but they still did manage to get high-end specs in there you got your snapdragon 855 12 gigs of ram your 512 gigs of storage not expandable and then you have your stereo speakers you still have reverse wireless charging and the combined battery is huge it's 4 380 milliamp hours so it's really equipped to actually work and get work done now there are two main features to take advantage of the fact that it folds continuity and multi-window so the continuity is interesting but it does make sense so you do have totally separate wallpaper and home screen layouts on both the front and the back screens they're independent of each other but with supported apps which are mostly samsung google apps right now you can open them on the small screen then unfold the phone and they will continue where you left off on the big screen and it actually works pretty quickly and surprisingly well much faster than that one time on stage that we first saw the demo so i opened the play store scrolled down a little bit then unfolded the phone and the play store was open and even scroll down a bit where i left off that is dope another good application for it was google maps which we've seen the demos of on stage but i tried it i opened up google maps and i clicked on this business listing and then when i unfolded the phone that listing was open where i left off just much bigger so i gotta play with this more i think it also works with youtube videos and some other apps i'm gonna test that a lot that should be really interesting but that other feature i mentioned is multi-window and i guess as you'd expect with a huge screen on the inside and 12 gigs of ram and everything you can easily have multiple apps open at once you just have to swipe in from the right side and all the supporting apps will show up and you can have two apps side by side and you can adjust the size of the window the border between them and everything and that's that's about as far as i would typically go but you can keep opening and keep bringing in apps and adding floating windows and even more up to a total of eight apps open at once and you can have most of them in these sort of floating multi windows now i don't know a kind of person is doing that much multitasking on a little seven inch screen that person probably needs a full size tablet anyway but it's cool that they'll let you go crazy and won't limit you up to eight apps so overall i'm coming away from that initial hands-on pretty impressed like it's always scary when a company announces something but then doesn't let you touch it and they don't want you to like ever use it until it's about to come out so i was a bit nervous about actually being a complete finished feeling product but it does feel pretty good now if i nitpick even a little bit of course i'm gonna find all sorts of stuff that's not ideal you know the outside screen being the main one it's so small and has so much bezel and hearing 4.6 inches doesn't sound that small but i found it actually even difficult to type on with the keyboard open on the small screen and then there's the notch stuff being a little bit weird and the slightly incomplete not quite fold is kind of weird the price is super high you know there's all that stuff but you know what at the end of the day even if you never use the screen on the front you still get a big screen that folds in half and fits in your pocket that's the part that feels like the future and the big screen is of course a better camera viewfinder a better web browser a better video washing experience and all of that is super cool it's a step in the right direction and this is definitely going to be one of those phones people actually want to get in the stores and play with and open close and see for themselves if they're into it but there will also be much more video coverage coming including a full review on this channel so if you want to be subscribed so you'll be the first to see that definitely do that below also this is the last day to get in on this merch drop so if you want any of the new stuff it'll be i think open until the end of today so within a couple hours of this video dropping make sure you get in on the merch as well but that's pretty much it that's my first impressions of the galaxy fold definitely let me know in the comments what other stuff you want to know about it because if you haven't already noticed that box right there that's the galaxy fold and i'm going to be getting into it for the full review and of course more coverage to come so let me know what you guys want to see but until then what do you think would you get a galaxy fold for your full-time phone thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
