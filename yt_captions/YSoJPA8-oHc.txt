- By clicking on this video you just made someone one 10th of a penny. Here's what I mean. I put four of my friends
in different circles. And whoever's the last one
to step out of their circle wins $1,000 for every 1
million views on this video. Only one of you is getting $1,000 per million views for
the rest of your life. - Fine, I'll do it.
- Get out. - What if you touch the red line? - [MrBeast] So here, this is okay. - Okay.
- This is okay. But if it goes like that, out. - Right now, I'm in.
- Yeah. Move it outside the
circle for demonstration. - Right here? (laughs) - [MrBeast] The challenge has started. What if Tareq wins and you just- - Tareq's not winning. Come on! - Now in case you're wondering, whoever wins this challenge
will be paid for life. So if seven years from now, this video gets another million views they'll get another thousand dollars. This is very serious. Maybe you should stop eating
so nice to each other. - We get in each other's heads and then we're gonna betray each other. - Tareq needs to get out first. - Tareq has to go first.
- Okay. So you're waiting for them to get out and then you'll start- - Absolutely. - One of you guys, including them, is walking away with $1,000 for every million views on this video. - Hi, me in the future, you won. - You know, he's gonna feel so dumb when he watches that as a loser. Come on.
- Yeah, Karl is. - It's me and Tyler in the circle here. Who's gonna leave first? - Either me or Chris. - Even though we're in the same circle, I wish you the best of luck,
'cause you're going against me. - This is a wall of balloons. When they pop a balloon,
they get a pro or con. They could win a bed or they
could have to shave an eyebrow. Depends on which ones they pop. Pop a balloon. - Darts! - Each balloon has a note. Chris, you just got a kite. - Yay, I got a kite. - It's inside. Why are you happy? - We can just run around in
the circle and make it fly. - Here's your "Toy Story 4" kite. Karl, pop a balloon. - Ooh! - Here we go, giant beanbag chair. - Bro, yes! Yes!
- Yes, yeah! - Yeah, it's definitely not
second yellow. Don't do that! - Oh my gosh, this is huge. Enjoy your beanbag. I'll see guys later. - Bye.
- What's up? This is the life. - Surprisingly, they're
having a lot of fun. That doesn't make sense. - Every time you watch this video, that's one 10th of a penny
going to whoever wins. Probably gonna be one of us.
- One of us. - Share the video. Watch it. Tell your dog, whoever you have to tell. - You go ahead and pop one.
Stay in the middle, Tareq. - Oh, did I get it? - [Man] Nice throw. - You've got an RC car. - Oh, yes please. - Here's your RC car. - Thank you so much, Jimmy. - Okay, we have a trade proposition. If you drive over and
give us the Mario kart, we'll give you our beanbag chair. Yeah, the second I see the Mario kart, I'll have Jimmy it walk over-
- With the beanbag chair. - All right, sounds like a deal. - [MrBeast] You want me
to guide you to the room? - Please.
- All right, come on out. (engine revving) (explosion) (engine revving)
(upbeat music) All right, there you go.
You're in front of the room. - Yeah, I can hear you. And also, we have your kart, you idiot! - Yeah! Let's go!
- Woo! We're keeping the beanbag chair! - [Tareq] Are you keeping that Mario kart? - Oh, we're not keeping it. - Okay, come on. (rousing music) This is war, Tareq! - War! - All right, guys, can
I put out your fire? All right. If you don't mind.
- Yes, go ahead, yeah. (rock music)
(coughing) - [Karl] Oh, this is really bad. This is the price of being dumb. Their plans backfired. - That's what you guys
get for burning my Mario! They really burnt my Mario kart. Put the camera on it,
it went down the hall and they burned it. - [Man] You can't breathe in that room. - But you can breathe in this one. Why would they set it on fire? - I'm mad. Karl's trying to sabotage me. (upbeat music) How long have we been here
if it's past midnight? - Six hours.
- Dang. - Still in the circle, going strong. Any tips you would give
anybody staying in a circle? - Don't get out. If you're not me, then get out. Tareq, get out. - We had to get a pee bucket and we wanted to make it feel like home. And here we go. - Get that pee in (laughs). (upbeat music) - Guys, it's getting pretty late. - I have no concept of time right now. - Before bedtime, you guys are
gonna pop two more balloons. - All right.
- Yeet! - Okay, I'll pop that one.
- Karl, pop one. - Karl, you got a blanket.
- Yay! - And Chris, you got mannequin. - Okay? Okay.
- I'll take it. - Karl, here's your blanket. Chris, here you go. You guys are gonna pop two more balloons. - I would love a bed.
- Please. - Nintendo Switch. - Yeah.
- No way. Yes! - Here is your Nintendo Switch. - It's dead (laughs). - I forgot to charge it. - What's wrong with you? - There you go. Let's see.
- Got one. - Tyler, I'll let you read it. - And inflated...
- Oh my God. Yes. - Inflatable bed. - With your lung. - I'm cutting off lights.
You guys can go to bed. There you go. This is
what you're sleeping with. - So you watching this video
can control me or Tareq, or those other two guys
- So much control. - in that room,
- So much. - You can control their entire life. - Just tell everyone about it. This is the first time we've
ever done a video like this, so let's see where it goes. - First time we've ever laid on an air mattress together, Tareq. - Yeah, you're very close to me. (upbeat music) You can't sleep with them down the hall making all that noise.
- Well, yeah you can't. I'm afraid I'm gonna fall off the bed. - Should I give 'em a good old yeehaw? - [Chris] Yeah, give it the yeehaw. - Yeahaw! Yeehaw! - [Narrator] Two hours later. - We're trying. - Oh crap! Okay.
- Oh God! - [Chris] Oh crap. Oh, the bed's on fire! - Oh no. Oh, fire. - Give us water. Hurry, shut up! - Shut up, please go. - [Man] Got him! Ha! - So this is what I wake up
to in the middle of the night. Chris and Karl started a fire. I don't know what happened. It's gonna be a very long night. - We're never sleeping, baby! (siren blaring)
(metal can crunching) - No sleep! (gentle music) - [MrBeast] Good morning.
It's almost been a day. You're gonna survive a whole week in this? - Look, as long as we
got this air mattress. - This is my first time waking
up in a Mr. Beast challenge. This is maybe the hardest thing ever. - Good morning, gentlemen.
Here's your breakfast. Karl picked breakfast
for the entire squad. Here you go. - [Karl] And today's course is... - [MrBeast] What do you think you got? - Oh, look at that. It's a single grape. - [MrBeast] Okay. Karl, why did you do this? - [Karl] 'Cause we're fine dining, baby. - How do you like your grape? - That's a pretty good grape. - All right, I'm gonna
go feed the other guys. Hello, gentlemen. Here's your breakfast. - What did Karl get us? - A grape. - Bruh.
- You get to pick lunch, so if you're hungry
just pick a good lunch. - Hey Karl, what happened to pancakes? - I figured this was a better substitute. - Oh, thank you. - No worries, we're just staying healthy. (upbeat music) - So we're approaching 24
hours in this challenge. Still feeling pretty strong. Gotta get this dub, man. - We got some good sleep last night. This is gonna go far, I think.
- Yep, bye. - Every hour I'm gonna lay a strip of tape and block off your circle. And whenever someone gets
out, we go back to normal. I'm gonna cut it by a third in an hour. And then another third. Now I'm gonna go until someone gets out. - It's ours.
- Hey, Chan-Chan. - Chandler came by. He
sat this challenge out. Karl, you're Chandler's
filler. How do you feel? - Good enough. - They're almost 24 hours in. Do you think you'd still be in? - No. - They literally set the
fire alarm last night. - We used this arm contraption. (MrBeast gasps) I didn't. I promise I didn't. Look, look, please look. Please look. I promise. - It's there.
- It's there. - I promise. I'm not kidding. - Dude, I'm here for three seconds. I'm sorry.
- Chandler! Get outta here, Chandler! (laughter) I have some footage I
need some opinions on. I cut their circle by a third. - Okay.
- Okay. (gasping) - Let's see what you think about this. - What is that? He's out. He's out.
- Bro, whoa! He's so out. - [Karl] No, I'm not! - He's out.
- He's out. - I don't even have to show you. - If it happened, it happened. - The line disappears
when someone gets out. - [Chris] Thanks. - I want to bestow upon you a little gift. How about my can of beans? I'm gonna go home. Bye, guys. Karl, what happened? - I lost, that's what
happened, Tareq! Bye! (upbeat music) - This video of a baby
biting another baby's finger has 875 million views. And I would argue what we're doing is better than a baby
biting a baby's fingers, which means this video should
get over 875 million views and thus resulting in the winner getting over $870,000 for winning. Now I'm not saying that's gonna happen, but I am saying this is
way more entertaining than a baby biting a baby. - How many challenges have you been in? - Everyone that's ever happened except for probably five of them. - And how many do you think you won? - Enough. - Did you just say enough? - No, I said not enough. - Oh, I don't know, man. We heard enough. (upbeat music) - I'd be lying if I didn't say
I was getting a little bored. I wanna take all the winnings from this and give it to my parents. I'm not quitting this
challenge no matter what. - Second time in a last
to leave challenge. Another circle video.
Trying to get another win. I gotta get my mom some money. She just lost her job.
Pandemic has been rough. But if I win, I'm able to help her out. (gentle music) - [Tyler] Can't you literally just wait til tomorrow morning? - Smells gonna stay in here all
night. You know this, right? - [Tyler] I can't help it. (gentle music) - This is day three in the
circle. I'm still feeling strong. I'm just bored of sitting in this circle. - We are now on day number three and there are still three people left. People need to get out and
it's about to get a lot harder. Me and Karl are gonna connect
the circles with tape. So technically, they can go to each other's
circle without leaving. We laid one strip, now it's
time for the second one. - Oh, it's not easier. - Let's do it. All right, Chris, things
are about to get fun. - [Chris] What does that little pathway? - [MrBeast] Don't step out or you lose. - I'm allowed to step in this hallway? - [MrBeast] Yep. I haven't seen the
outside world in so long. - Chris, I haven't seen you in days, bro. - This pathway is connected to his circle. Chris, come on in their circle real quick. You've got five minutes and
then I'm lifting up that bridge. I don't care what circle you're in. You can go to the other circle.
You can stay in this circle. You have five minutes. - Let's see what his circle looks like. - I do want to go to his circle. You don't even get it, dude. I feel so good walking
anywhere but that circle. I wanna follow Chris. So if Tareq wants to stick around we can all be at the same place. - Yeah, why don't you guys
all just stay together? They're all chatting in the circle. I say we just pull the
tape up and trap 'em. - Okay.
- Karl's gonna give you a... All right, you're stuck. Sorry. - I don't think that was five minutes. I was actually gonna sabotage him and go, can I still make the jump? - Nope. Sorry. This isn't the only thing I'm
gonna do to make it difficult. Two of you aren't gonna win. One of you might as well get out. - Hey, I got something to show you guys. Can you come to my room? Oh, get mooned! Get mooned! (upbeat music) - So you guys all just kinda
chilling this bed together? - Yeah, you gonna take our bed? - Might have to, it looks kind of comfy. Thank you for the bed. We're
cutting the circle and thirds. Okay, these are the new parameters. Does anyone have a problem with them? - I have a little problem with
the way you said parameter. - Is this harder?
- Way harder. It's harder but I
managed to get the middle so I can sprawl out. - All three of you sardines still have small circles. Bye. It's insane that they've
literally spent days in these circles. Do 'em a favor and watch
this video a few times. Whoever wins deserves the extra money. Tareq, duck. Cut your circle in half. Which side do you want? - Wait, I'll be doing
this one. So I'll stay. My semi-circle got cut in half. - Your semi, semi-circle. - Oh, man, he's going through these. - Here you go.
- Thank you. - Here you go. - Oh yes, a mini fridge full of drinks. - Pillow.
- Here's your pillow. Here's your heavy fridge. - You don't understand how
happy that just made me. - The wall of balloons is leaving. You're not getting anything. What are your guys' thoughts on this? I'm just gonna nap through it. - How much worse could it get? (laughter) - These guys are dooking it out, so make sure to watch
this video multiple times so whoever wins gets lots
of money, am I right? - Please.
- Please watch the video and share it and like it
and comment and subscribe. I'm gonna leave you guys alone. All three cameras are on.
We're monitoring them. Have fun. This is going way too long. Next time I go in there, I'm gonna have to make it hard on them. (upbeat music) You're approaching day
four. I need someone out. I'll be right back. Karl, you cut Chris's circle
off wherever you want. - This is parallel to your toe. - I think we should yoink Tyler the same. Tyler's circle is now that. There you go. (upbeat music) - [Tareq] You might get sick
if you shotgun this Bang. - Oh!
- Oh my gosh! That was a headshot! - I'm getting tired of getting peed on! Getting tired of getting Banged on! This is it! - Chris, whether or not
that was intentional, you did spray Tareq. Give me the tape. Smaller. - No, smaller-
- Smaller. - You are crazy. Thank you, Jimmy. Love you! - They'll give up eventually. (dramatic music) - We have the heat set to 92. We're doing it. Trying
to make it harder for us. - We've been in this for 57 hours. - Oh my gosh, it is so hot in here. What am I gonna do with you guys? - We're making it harder on ourselves. - Yeah, but someone's gotta
get out. What do I do? - Smaller circles. - We're all standing.
- All right, there we go. - [Tyler] My legs are wobbly right now. - This might be confusing,
but that's his new circle. That's his new circle. And that's Tareq's new circle. It is now much harder, guys. - My feet hurt. I just
wanted to put that out there. - Knees are hurting, my arms
are weak. Mom's spaghetti. (upbeat music) - [Tareq] That feels amazing by the way. - Is it harder now? - Slimy. - [Tyler] Hope you understand
how much better this feels. - [Karl] So you have
to stand on eggshells. (mimics sneezing) - Ooh!
- Ew! (dramatic music) - Ooh!
- Oh! - [Karl] I think he's out. - [Chris] Why'd you push me? - [Karl] I didn't push you. - If Karl pushed him, that's
sabotaging, Chris is in. But if Karl didn't push
him, then Chris is out. You can't put your hands on the ground. Let's review the tape. Did you push him? - I don't think so. - Oh yeah, there is no push.
- You didn't even touch him. The only contact is
Chris slapping your hand. - He didn't. He did not push him. - Karl didn't even touch you, Chris. - I've cost you a lot of money, thank you for costing me money. - You've cost Karl well
over $200,000 in challenges. So it's only fair if
takes a hundred grand. - Sorry, mom. I love you. It sucks that I got out that way, but mom, there's gonna
be other challenges. I promise you. It's coming for you. - Final two. Me, Tareq. This was our plan the whole time. But it shouldn't have taken
four days 'cause I'm tired. I'm really tired. - [Crowd] Yay! - knees' looking little
bit wobbly, need some tape? - This feels weird.
- Yeah. (upbeat music) Bye. - Wait, Chandler. - [Tyler] He didn't wait. - Don't let their hard work go to waste. Please watch this video a bunch of times. - [Tareq] So we're still
isolated in those little boxes. It's crazy to think that we
had this entire circle open and then it got cut into three
until we got to this level. It's crazy. This all happened within the last day. We used to have our own room, Tyler. - Boys, boys, boys, it's been a while. Come on. Get out. - We might be a little delusional, but we're not-
- Little? - Last offer I'm gonna make, $5,000. You have 10 seconds. Nine.
- Go for it. - Eight. - $5,000 in cash.
- I gotta go for it. - [Tareq] I'm going 500 hours. - (gasps) Oh my, wait! I was expecting Tareq to get out. - Wait, is this real? Am I hallucinating? What just happened? - Five grand is way more
than I ever was expecting 'cause it should have been zero. I should have been out way earlier. - To the people watching, every time they watch
this video, you get money. Every single time. I'm paying Tareq until the day he dies. - That's insane. That's literally
like winning the lottery. Guys, please keep sharing this video. Share it to-
- Why do you want them to share the video, so
you make more money? - Sure. Yes. I'm not getting the money,
it's gonna go to my parents 'cause my parents literally
sacrificed everything they had to give me the life that I have now. I want to hug Tyler. - [MrBeast] Every single time
someone watches this video, Tareq gets one 10th of a penny. Do your park, guys. He sat in
a circle for 72 entire hours. I think he deserves it. (explosion)
