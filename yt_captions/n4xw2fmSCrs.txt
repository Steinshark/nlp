[Music] this video is in partnership with Best Buy all right what's up I'm Kim BHD here and we're in that wrapping up 2021 phase as you already know did that first rewind video which was all about the biggest most influential Tech of all of 2021 and videos like that are way more varied and off the wall just because there's a lot of different Tech that has an impact on the year but not all that stuff's relatable or stuff that you can get your hands on right now so this video this video is specifically for stuff that you can get right now this is for this is the top 10 gadgets that you can actually get your hands on that came out in the last 365 days and with partnering with Best Buy on this video you already guessed it every single one of the items on this list you can go to a store right now or go to bestbuy.com and pick up for yourself but also the benefit of Best Buy having physical stores is you can actually go to a store and see some of these things in person for yourself which a little underrated so I've had the opportunity to stay ahead of the curve with a lot of this Tech this year from from Best Buy and yeah getting to see some of it in person before you buy it makes a big difference you'll see what I mean in a second so sit back relax maybe open another tab because all this stuff is linked down below if you want to check it out right away and let's get into it so number 10. number 10 is the Beats fit Pro okay so these came out during the second half of the Year pretty late and I didn't even get to review them but they are my favorite Beats headphones ever for a couple of reasons one they're the best sounding beats ever by a lot but two it's the design that actually stays locked in your ear so wing tips major key and so because of the Great Sound and great fit these pretty much instantly became my favorite workout headphones so if you're in need of a pair like that I'd say look no further they also have a decently small case and a solid battery life and of course they're sweat resistant for that workout stuff and if you can you can go to a Best Buy and see the different colors in person plus you can check out pretty much any other headphones they have at all so that can help you pick your favorite so number nine is the Samsung Galaxy Z fold three so I was kind of torn between putting this or the flip 3 on this list but the point is there are some of the most interesting phones that came out this year yes of course we got the candy bar phones getting better and having bigger batteries and better cameras and all that's great but these phones do a lot different obviously the hidden selfie camera behind the display folding in half and they're just more complete and capable than ever so the flip 3 just made the whole folding phone as a daily driver thing way more attainable for many people with the price tag right in line with other phones people buy all the time it's worth checking out in person in a store if you can just to see how much that crease may or may not bother you or whether or not you even notice it or care about it but Pro tip when you're actually using these phones both the crease and the hidden selfie camera I noticed really kind of disappear to the eye as you focus on the actual content on the phone so you get a much bigger screen as a result either way really looking forward to these continuing to get better alright so number eight and I could have gone kind of anywhere with this because this was a really good year for cameras but I'm gonna go with the Sony Alpha One one of their flagships this is an expensive one but it did a lot of things right and I really like this camera so this is the full frame mirrorless camera it's stuffed to the gills with features high resolution High frame rate high shutter speed lots of auto focus points great color science and that's just for photos Sony's also been crushing the mirrorless video game for the past few years at a bunch of different price brackets and this one slots in basically right at the top of their lineup it's so good I honestly look forward to shooting videos with it we've shot videos including the setup Tour on the studio Channel with it and also the Tesla Model Y review on the main Channel which was shot entirely on the A1 with that full frame sensor we've got plenty of glass for it the autofocus was great it was just a great year for cameras so it's hard to pick just one but the A1 was a beast alright so number seven the Galaxy S21 Ultra from Samsung again so this may seem like okay now this is a little bit more of a boring option compared to the fold and the flip that were here before but the fold in the flip made this list for me because they're influential and really interesting phones this makes a list just because it's their best phone and honestly I think it's one of the best phones Samsung has made in a long time miles better than the s20 ultra of course huge Improvement great battery world-class display great performance and really great cameras and honestly I really like this design not just because it's matte black of course but the whole thing the intentional leaning into the camera bump the weight the materials everything about this build I really like now it's also a huge phone so if you're trying to actually get one I'd say check it out in person just to make sure it's not dramatically different from what you're expecting but yeah huge thumbs up for me on what often doesn't get talked about enough this early in the year Flagship so number six I am giving to the Nintendo switch OLED the new one they kind of nailed it so obviously the original switch was very popular just as a portable handheld gaming console and we've seen some others now jump into this same form factor the same space but the switch OLED is just an all-around better version of the switch we already knew and loved much smaller bezels better display of course it's in the name deeper blacks and a much brighter punchier look to it and it's much better with that full width kickstand so it's kind of the ideal refresh and I've had plenty of fun flights with the original switch so can't really go wrong with the new Switch here switch OLED is great all right number five this one might be kind of out of left field but I believe in it a lot apples air tags so this is one of the most influential products of the entire year mainly because it shined a huge Spotlight on this industry and we got to see how all of the competitors already in it would react mainly tile we got to see how tile would react I am somehow always surprised by how many people suddenly have intense and deep thoughts and care a lot about a product category as soon as Apple enters it even if it was pretty chill before but the Apple effect is real and they have pulled a lot of other companies into their orbit too so not only can you find your keys anytime you lose them with a keychain for air tags but now other companies are making air tags compatible wallets and air tags backpack sleeves and air tags clamps for anything and everything you might lose of any size to find with Apple's fine my network it's great it's very handy and it was a pretty important product of the year and while we're at it number four the iPhone 13 series but if I can be more specific I want to shine a spotlight on the iPhone 13 mini for a second so tiny flagships are a Dying Breed they have been for a while we've known this already and so Apple comes out with their entire iPhone 13 lineup again this year they've got an iPhone 13 an iPhone 13 Pro a pro Max and a mini and they did the mini phone right they did it the correct way which is that all of the phones and the whole lineup more or less have the same specs so the only difference between them is screen size and battery size so the iPhone 13 mini has the exact same super powerful chip as all the bigger phones it has the same massive new primary camera sensor as all the bigger phones with improved stabilization and it actually has a physically larger battery than the 12 mini which struggled a bit with that last year so if there were ever a good time to get a mini phone I think it's now considering all the rumors that there might not be another one next year and of course you can head into Best Buy and check out the Mini's size for yourself you can literally hold it up next to your current phone for comparison to see how compact it really is but shout out to the mini Flagship smartphone alright so number three this is a really fun one this is the DJI fpv drone this thing is incredible so as I broke down in my review video this thing is basically combining all the best of two very different drone worlds which is the cinematography tools and recreational drones that DJI already kind of dominates and the DIY first person view racing drones that you might catch on TV or on a local park sometimes and the result combining them is this incredibly fun high performance droning experience with a decently high quality camera and a pair of goggles wirelessly connected I've literally never had more fun with a drone than with this one it can go 90 plus miles an hour in sport mode but you sort of slowly work your way up to that and you can unlock more and more levels of manual control to get there and don't worry it comes with a bunch of extra propellers too in case you get too close to some trees or Take a Tumble or two I've done that too we've all done it but I love this drone alright so number two is Google's pixel 6 series and mainly the smaller less expensive pixel 6 which I think is a great phone and a great deal so this was Google's first time designing the chip inside so there's a tensor chip powering this phone they're clearly focused a lot still on the cameras which are quite good too especially on a phone of this price and I think it has some room for a little higher ceiling with some software updates but really this phone is all about having the most convenient Google features Google Assistant answering phone calls and waiting on hold for you and working on the background it's great it's one of the reasons I choose to use a pixel so often as my main phone all that phone for 5.99 in the pixel 6. now I do personally daily the more expensive 6 Pro not a whole ton of difference really between them but if you want to test your eye to see if you noticed a slightly higher refresh rate or the slightly higher resolution display that's worth a shot so then last but not least number one is the new Macbook Pros the new M1 Pro and M1 1 Pro Max 14 inch and 16 inch MacBook Pros these things have been incredible now same deal there have been a lot of really good laptops all over the map this year but these made the biggest splash of course because of the incredible performance and efficiency all that comes with the new Apple silicon that went into these machines and the way it applied specifically to my own workflow I loved it these have been great so you can check out my entire review video if you want all the benchmarks and details of my real world experiences with these laptops but bottom line it makes a fantastic only computer for a lot of different creatives professionals Etc I've edited videos on the 16-inch M1 Max a lot of my colleagues and friends are loving the 14 inch M1 Pro just as much the notch is kind of like a kind of like the crease in the Samsung folding phones like when you're actually using the device it fades away to the eye and becomes a non-factor even if it is a head scratcher why it's there in the first place but the displays themselves are world class with high dynamic range High brightness High refresh rate and high resolution the speakers are Best in Class the battery life is top of the class and it has all the ports I mean what more could you really ask for so there you have it 10 gadgets that came out during the last 365 days that are really influential or really good turns out it was a pretty good year after all also I want to toss in because I was doing my research for this video and I realized it didn't come out this year but the Quest 2 the VR headset if you're in the market for one it's still honestly still the best like portable VR experience Standalone that you can get right now so I'm going to just toss that in there also didn't come out this year but Sony's wh-1000xm4 noise canceling headphones if you don't have or haven't tried one of the over ear pairs from Sony yet really good so I'm just gonna include those at the end but that's a little extra and thanks again to Best Buy for partnering on this video you already know they have all the best tech available all year round so whether it's
