ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the World Chess Championship 2023 contested by yanya bomnishi of Russia and dingly ren of China we have had a back and forth Affair if you are re-tuning in to the Recaps welcome back if you're brand new you have joined at the right time it's game number eight it's four for yawn and three for ding Jan just won the last game neither player has been able to win two games in a row folks buckle up because not only was this game absolutely insane today we had one of the most dramatic twists of a World Chess Championship ever when I say ever that is not an exaggeration and I will walk you through every step of the way this is a drama unlike any I have ever seen the Chess World really is like an oasis of content so ding has the white pieces and he begins the game with D4 okay ding has played D4 he's played C4 every time he's played the move d4 he has gone for uh a different line he went for a Lund and he went for this he went for that so we're gonna need to get to a round move 12 for me to tell you about the drama it's important I mean you can always skip to move 12 but we need to do a little bit of build up first Ian responds Knight F6 which is the principled move and now ding plays C4 E6 in game two you will remember ding did this he played this kind of edgy a little bit offbeat H3 he didn't get a whole lot it was a game but he actually lost that game so he will probably never play the move H3 again let alone even think about it it's very interesting that he plays Knight C3 nepo played Knight C3 against ding earlier in the match and ding played the move D5 but Jan plays Bishop to B4 this is the nimso Indian this is like ultra high stakes poker white plays an ultra Cutting Edge line black plays the ultra Cutting Edge response let's see what happens all right the nimso Indian is one of the most theoretically explored openings in chess ding plays E3 white by the way has like no less than I don't know five seven options on this move E3 is the Rubenstein very flexible move temporarily blocking in this bishop but Bishop will come here in some cases it might even go out that way uh and then after castles not Bishop D3 not Knight F3 not Knight E2 but an interesting sideline A3 so trying to play the the A3 variation but with E3 because if you think about it white could have played A3 and then went like this and not committed this Pawn but then black doesn't have to Castle so this leads to a very kind of different approach black has already canceled and now BC now black here can play D5 C5 D6 what what what uh Yan does is he plays D6 and he wants to build up on the dark squares because he just traded off his dark Square Bishop so far so good right no drama yet you just wait ding here does not develop his bishop or his Knight in a traditional way he plays Knight E2 that's a really weird move what is Knight E2 like to the I mean it's got to be some sort of prep he's not thinking right Yan principle playing C5 and it's very common uh in nimso Indians especially when white has doubled C pawns to play a move like C5 because it stops the pawns from ever moving forward this trade never benefits white because these pawns are sitting ducks the Knight can go to A5 the Knight can go to B6 the Knight can go to E4 the bishop can go to A6 which is why the pawn on C5 is very nice white plays Knight G3 two Night Moves for what why is the Knight there the Knight is there so that you can play E4 which you cannot play with a knight on F3 so that you can move your F Pawn which you cannot do with an identif3 so your queen can move out to join an attack which you cannot do with an iron F3 and that's it this is a very fascinating idea and on move number nine dingly ran Uncorked a move that afterwards he called a cannonball of preparation a cannonball of preparation Rook A2 a move that has Almost Never Happened almost never a couple of people have played this move there's a grand master formerly from Armenia now living in the U.S his name is he's won a few games with 4K too Fabiano caruana was talking about this move on Twitter Grandmasters were talking about this move so Rook A2 is kind of like the best kept secret of the grand Masters what the hell is that move if you played that move you should be smacked Rook A2 is essentially a fascinatingly complex idea where white does not commit any pieces and essentially is gonna bring the Rook behind one of their forces and join some sort of attack it's a cryptic little idea and essentially black now has to do something so look at Jan plays B6 okay very interesting now here's this E4 idea and now pins the Knight to the queen nepo attacks it ding gives up the bishop oh my goodness what is going on Pawn to H4 folks it's move 12. it is time for the big reveal at this moment somebody was following this game live and they were inputting the moves and they were looking and they discovered something absolutely insane somebody discovered that this game had actually happened before what white sacrificing a bishop like this how does that make any sense who where how could this game have possibly happened ladies and gentlemen it turns out this game once was played on leeches this was one this one's happened in a leeches game between two accounts and not only that these two accounts were created a month ago and these two accounts also played a game in the exact same opening played in game two of the World Chess Championship people followed that further and discovered that there were two chess.com accounts linked to training games this one was renamed this one used to have the same name as this one so no way could this have been ding in his training partner they have this exact position and in the training game black played rookie 8 and did not take the bait did not take the bishop but in Jan's game Yan after spending seven minutes did take the bishop because it wasn't the training game of 10 minute chess this is absolutely I don't even know what to say I mean there are so many layers here um and as probably the person with the biggest megaphone the biggest voice like for the Chess World because listen I'm I'm talking about the swell of you this is absolutely nuts um essentially a world championship Challenger was playing some Anonymous games online against his training partners because they couldn't meet face to face report is in Hungary Romania ding is in China I don't know if it even is a report and now some of the lines that they were gonna maybe play in the match are out there now the thing is the colors don't exactly match up in the training game but we need to talk about this I'm not even going to talk about the game yet this is crazy this T well the thing is ding's team was also asked about this afterwards like ding was asked about this at the uh press conference by Mike Klein from chess.com and by the way I'm just gonna say I feel like some of you have been giving my client a little bit of a hard time okay first like all press conferences and all sports get criticized chess press conferences are like a different I mean these players get asked what they do on their rest day and the players are like we rest you know what I mean it's it's tough and I think my client does a good job all right and my client asked the question he addressed the elephant in the room nobody else did by the way nobody else did and I don't know if that's good or bad personally I feel like it's better they know don't you agree I feel like it's better if everyone's playing on an equal playing field and I have no idea if team nepo knew or not right nobody knows did they know that this game existed now I mean now they do now they do um they were asked about it uh afterwards um this is uh this this is shocking uh prep leap leaks have happened in the past they have uh Fabiano caruana in his match against Magnus Carlson 2018 before you guys were following uh they posted a hype video for Fabiano and they leaked some of his notes and then he had to decline it uh deny it and what was going on and then in the last World Championship Match there was some file being studied online so this has happened before and this is nuts but this game is we're not done with this game so you might think oh uh Jan I mean he's gonna you know he's falling into all this prep I I maybe he knew it was coming I don't think so look at his time look at Young's time management okay H takes G5 and now young gives back the Knight like this and I mean Jana's I mean he's down time right like uh and Jan said after the game that after the move Pawn to E5 he was completely on his own so the players are now completely on their own ding spends 14 minutes here so I don't think anyone's in any prep anymore ding is sacrificing a pawn he's doing that in order to move Black's d-pawn out of the center by the way can we just address how ridiculous White's position is but it turns out this move Rook to A2 is an absolute Cannon like Rook on A2 defends everything is ready to rotate over to join an attack so many storylines are unfolding at this world championship the chess is nuts now the storyline of the prep is insane no no one's even uh what the hell is going on now look at dingly run in this game down a game marches the pawn forward to D6 puts the knight in the center and now plays Queen D3 folks this Rook might actually very well be joining the forces also Queen to H3 Queen H7 Queen h8 is literally made this is insanity but ding is down time again he's on 38 38 minutes to uh to 76 Yan plays King G7 ending attacking with Pawn to G4 and very very soon we really might see this Rook playing a pivotal role in this game how the hell is 9 Rook A2 Theory chess is so sick you can damage your own Pawns in the opening you can make two night moves and then you can play Rook A2 and somehow that turns into a beautiful coordinated attacking game where you have sacrificed the pawn to bully around your opponent's pieces now here Jana has to find the best move Jan is lost in this position unless he finds the best move because if he plays something like Knight to H6 white plays G5 white plays F4 and uh this shows the entire idea this is absolutely nuts the move Rook A2 being able to join on H2 to attack on H7 this is sick this is absolutely sick how is this possible Rook A2 to H2 you cleared the whole second rank it's like Tetris I mean really it's like Tetris how on Earth is this possible but young plays Bishop B7 a really nice idea pinning the Knights of the Rook so that after Pawn takes F5 you can play EF5 and white is actually not in time so after Bishop B7 ding things and plays Rook H3 unpinning his Rook not only on pinning his Rook maintaining the idea of double stacking on the H file Rook H3 is a sickening move now Jan has to find only moves from this point forward to not lose he has to play a bunch of defensive moves correctly he plays Knight to H4 now ding plays Pawn to G5 notice Jan spent nearly 20 he did spent 20 minutes on Knight H4 G5 cutting the circulation between Queen and Knight now the Knight can return the other best move here is to play Rook to h8 okay now Rook h8 is considered the top computer move but Queen G3 is really really scary to deal with at which point you could promptly lose the game so rather than playing Rook to h8 at this point Jan goes for what is called a concrete solution removes the knight from the board entirely and doesn't play Rook to h8 but rather plays Knight to F5 with the idea of stopping White's whole plan here with Queen takes D6 and if you arrive on H2 uh I strike back down the center and I escape to E7 just in time oh my goodness so night at five but look at the eval well ladies and gentlemen it turns out the ding is not gonna go here ding is going to play Rook to D2 the hero of the prep has arrived on the board and white is completely winning leaked preparation or not ding is completely ripped this stuff matches four to three both guys Landing blow after blow coming back prep has apparently been exposed on the did team nepo even know about this now everybody knows about this but nobody wants to talk about it because the Chess World is super weird like that Rook to D2 and dingly ren Against All Odds Against crushing defeat in the final game in the last round is winning it's about to be four to four I mean this is Sensational stuff Yan plays Rook to h8 ding trades and in this position the winning move is the hero Rook to slide to H3 and threaten this and this that's what ding has to find but ding is making sure he doesn't get low on time so instead of playing the top move he plays the second move which is D7 he's still winning he's still winning but he slips up a little bit here okay he slips up a little bit he should have played Rook D3 Rook H3 taking his time but he doesn't want to repeat the errors of the past so Rook to d8 now he takes with check now here he does something strategic he repeats moves a couple times why does he do that to get closer to move 40. remember at move 40 they gain an extra hour that's classical chess so in this position they were on move 27 Now by repeating moves a couple times they're on move 31 okay it's not it's not a draw by repetition because they took a pawn right there was a pawn here last time and then the queen went like this and now Queen to C7 in this position Yan needs to play passively he needs to defend passively with Queen f8 instead does one of the most cold-blooded things I've ever seen Queen H4 he sacrifices the entire Rook on d8 a defensive Rook sacrifice a rare really really rare Rook sacrifice where you give up The Rook completely and you play Queen E4 and you are looking for a draw however this is a bluff Queen H4 is a bluff why it turns out after queen d8 queen E4 rookie two queen B1 King D2 Queen B2 check here check here white is winning by sacrificing The Rock King to E4 and if Queen C2 there are no more checks I have never seen something like this the brave King needs to walk into the center of the board like this Queen takes D3 and there is Queen F6 double queen and the king is safe this is sickening this is what on Earth even is this queen to E4 the king walks out I mean this is this is what dingly Wren now has to find with the move Queen H4 on the board does ding see queen d8 queen E4 rookie two and this entire unbelievable sequence no the bluff Works absolutely devastating clutching it oh my goodness oh my goodness he has saved the game how on Earth how on Earth did he do this that's what Bluffs were only supposed to work in poker no look how little time ding spent you see ding was cognizant of the fact that he has 24 minutes to make nine moves and he did not want to repeat game number seven but there's a great saying in chess you have to play the current game you cannot play the previous one now of course you have to learn from games as well yes but King to D1 and suddenly Jan is back in control he has saved the game he's a pawn down but he's doing fine ding plays Bishop G2 and now in this position Yan can officially close the game out with this move because after the night sack there is this and after Queen E5 check black can play F6 win this Pawn on D4 even Rook D4 and queen and Bishop versus queen is a draw but Queen and Bishop versus queen and three extra pawns is uh definitely a draw um but John misses it I mean folks this is this is on this is insanity Bishop to E4 Yan does not sacrifice his Knight and dingley ren is completely winning again I mean I don't even know what to say I don't my heart can't handle this match my heart cannot handle this match Queen takes a seven and dingley ren is completely winning again why is he winning he's winning because in the long run this Pawn is a massive massive Thorn and let's say black plays Knight G4 as he does in the game white needs to go here and this Pawn will never die and ding needs to take all these pawns and push of course black has counter play of course of course of course there is some checks but after King B3 you're safe and if black tries to get in here and try to mate you it ain't working I got I got too many things I can go for and black just doesn't have sufficient counter Play Bishop E4 Knight H6 and dingly renz just got a guard his pawn and eat ding plays Bishop F3 however and he attacks the Knight on G4 and after Knight F6 white is still able to play Bishop C6 but Knight takes F2 and ding is no longer better remember how a couple of moves ago I showed you the idea to sacrifice the Knight to win the d-pawn well Knight takes F2 Rook takes F2 and Jan builds a gigantic Pawn Fortress completely repelling White's Bishop and he's going to win this Pawn and now he is not worse cerebral night sacrifice for defensive purposes and there's nothing here if ding plays Bishop G2 I got news for you he might lose that's not an exaggeration like if if these pawns start going King E5 was an inaccuracy if these pawns start going okay and The Rook stops the pawn black might win which is why ding proceeds to trade Queens and gives back the bishop and the players agree to a draw on move 45. oh my God folks dingly Ren Uncorked an unbelievable opening idea Rook A2 played almost never but top Grandmasters do know this move as seen on the Twitter buzz and it turns out that this position sacking the bishop for a monstrous initiative has happened before in what are suspected to be accounts relevant to this match Jan responds brilliantly before ding completely takes over the game with a roaring initiative and still gets a winning position but then proceeds to slip up because he's trying to play faster because the match has taught him that playing slowly might backfire he misses one opportunity to win but gets another one granted to him an unbelievable Bluff by Yan sacking The Rook does not go punished and then one final moment and Bishop F3 allows a defensive night sacrifice to build up a pawn wall trade queens and force a draw in game 8 of the World Chess Championship the to watch I've never seen something like this there is a story every damn day it's four and a half three and a half so many things are happening at the same time I'll see you for game number nine J just go go go get some fresh air get out of here
