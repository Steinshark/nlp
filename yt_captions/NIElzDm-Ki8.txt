- [Linus] Took me a
while to find that bug. But yeah, that, that was, that was BS. That was BS right there. That was crap. Game development is
notorious for long hours, job instability and early burnout. So when Gigabyte reached
out to sponsor this video featuring their AERO 16
and AERO 17 Creator laptops we thought, "Hey, these
things are super powerful. Why don't we try them out as a game development workstation?" I mean, how hard could it really be? - [Plouffe] It's really hard. Seriously. - Fun fact. This guy actually came to us from the game development industry. So all right Plouffe, what did you manage to make in the 12 hours that I
budgeted for this project? I mean, it's pretty much drag
and drop these days, right? - Sort of actually, I
mean, in some ways, yes, it's a lot easier than 20 years ago. Instead of creating an
engine from scratch, you can purchase - or depending on your business model and
revenue, even freely use - a number of development kits like Unreal Engine, GameMaker Studio or Unity like we've got here today. They graciously lent us a Pro
license to make this video. - Yep. That's a pretty normal
thing that happens a lot. - Okay. - Suck it haters. - Anyway, that's the game, that's it. - Yeah. Enough of- enough. I know better than to
think that's the game. Oh God. Oh my, what is this? (Plouffe laughs) Oh my goodness. - [Plouffe] So when I
went to make this guy, the actual sprite like it
didn't work for some reason. So I had to use a different sprite for the jumping and falling animations so it would actually show up. Otherwise you'd be invisible
while you were in the air. - [Linus] Ah cool. That would, oh- - [Plouffe] Hell yeah. - [Linus] So as you guys can see it's a simple 2D platformer. Even though Plouffe has
game development experience it's mostly in level design and art. So rather than trying to,
scratch build something he chose a really excellent tutorial from Coding in Flow that you guys could actually also follow along with. We're gonna have that link down below. Now that I know that
you're a level designer I actually have much, much higher- - [Plouffe] Expectations. - [Linus] Yeah. What's
funny about this is that- - [Plouffe] Please don't. Please don't have high expectations. I made it in like 12 hours. - [Linus] The thing is that,
like, now that I know that someone else did all the
animation and programming- - [Plouffe] Sure. - [Linus] And that your background
actually is level design. No, I do have high expectations. I mean, I really feel like that saw was placed very poorly for- - [Plouffe] What? - [Linus] For level flow. - [Plouffe] Oh sure. Yeah. This is level one and this
should be a lot easier. (Linus laughs) - [Linus] Okay. - Considering the time invested it is kind of impressive though. So we used free assets from the Unity Asset Store. Namely Pixel Adventure 1 by Pixel Frog, FREE Casual Game SFX by Dustyroom and Casual Game BGM #5 by B.G.M. And there's some pretty
cool details in here. - Yeah. Everything's animated. The saws are actually rotating. They're not animated to rotate. So they're physically like
rotating in that space. One of the problems with that is that it's got the bounds box on it or your collision box. So if the collision box
isn't perfectly square it'll kill you a little differently based on where the saw is. It's fully animated,
there's background music. I added like an actual start screen. There's a end screen for
when you get to the end. See there's the checker
flag, you're a winner. And if this was actually built out the quit button should
actually close the game. Right it doesn't do
anything because we're just in Unity and it's called Jump for Joy. It's the best game ever. It's not. - [Linus] I mean this is really cool. So whether it's an indie, AAA, or project that lies somewhere in between you can use these types of templates as a base to start from,
and then slowly add maps, unique gameplay mechanics,
hazards, and enemies and bring your creation to life. I mean, it is really cool when you think about how someone with absolutely zero
experience could come in and create something like this though. - [Plouffe] Yeah. It, it might take them a few more hours. A few tutorials in, I was actually starting to
move forward a little bit on my own 'cause I - [Linus] 'Cause you
remembered how to do it? - [Plouffe] I remembered how to do it. Yeah. Not, not so much the coding aspect of it because I was never a programmer. I didn't do well in all
my programming classes but I can follow a script, and I know when to look for missing things that should be there. - [Linus] Tell me something though. How does the sponsor fit into all this? - [Plouffe] So developer kits and engines, they have become a bit
more robust over the years but you still need assets and you need code to tell
those assets what to do. So you write your own
code in Visual Studio for C, and then for smaller
games or light scripts it doesn't take a lot
out of processing power. A general rule is that
outside of specific roles like audio design and, you
know, high poly model creation you only need a bit more
performance to develop the game than your recommended specs to run it. And the main reason you
even need that extra bit is that the optimization happens at the end. - [Linus] Which would
be why so many games end up being left poorly optimized because that's when you ran outta money. I mean, what percentage of the
game development process is that tidying everything up optimization? - It's the 80/20 rule, right? 80% of your work is happening
at the end of the project. - [Linus] So then what we
showed here today - no offense - could have been done on
a pretty basic laptop. - [Plouffe] Yeah. - [Linus] But with either the
AERO 16 or the AERO 17, I mean would you say we've got
enough grunt to deal with AAA game development like a God of War or Horizon level game? I mean, they've got a
Core i9, RTX 3080 Ti level mobile GPU DDR5, desktop
class performance, right? - [Plouffe] Yeah. I mean, obviously we didn't have the assets on hand to load up a project like that. But from my past experience, other than waiting longer when making
major changes or compiling code or building the project,
the experience isn't that different compared
to a high end desktop. - [Linus] Obviously the biggest benefit of using a laptop for
our project like this is the portability and built-in battery. I mean, last Friday we actually
lost power to our building. - [Plouffe] I had to leave.
My apartment still had power so I basically saved the project, packed the laptop up and headed home. Luckily it wasn't raining, but if you got caught in
the rain with a laptop make sure to get subscribed for our upcoming video
about laptop repair. - [Linus] Yeah. That one's
gonna be really good. Colin's working on that. We've got a bunch of different laptops and we're gonna like
simulate horrible situations and see how bad it is to repair them. Now, I don't know what your deal is here. Maybe you just wanna flex a little bit but you said I'm supposed to
try your student project next. - [Plouffe] Oh yeah, sure. So if we have time - not to flex - - [Linus] Let's do it,
let's do it. I wanna try it. - [Plouffe] All right, all right. All right, it's great. - [Linus] Heroes of Space, here we go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wow. I'm getting like a very
Captain Keen kind of vibe. - [Plouffe] Yeah. We were
going for like Metal Slug meets like Captain Keen or something similar. There's a weird bug where
his- what's going on there? Oh my God. Okay. That bug's
not supposed to happen. - [Linus] What? Keep going. That- - [Plouffe] So those are the
projectiles and I don't know- but I don't know why
they're getting stuck. It worked fine at home. Oh my God. Okay. Something's messed up. Maybe it's the aspect ratio or something. - [Linus] Oh, whoa. I just gotta go right up to him. I mean what's the point of
the gun, if you have to- - [Plouffe] It's broken. - [Linus] Sword gun. I
mean he did work on Gears. - [Plouffe] It's broken. I've worked on real games. This, this one is a real game. It's just also super broken. - [Linus] Did I die? Am I stuck here? - [Plouffe] No, I think you're stuck. Can you shoot 'em? Can you
shoot 'em and kill 'em? - [Linus] Nope. - [Plouffe] You're just
slowly taking damage. - [Linus] Oh. - [Plouffe] Nice. - [Linus] Are- are they supposed
to be shooting at me too? - [Plouffe] Yeah. Yeah. All the projectiles are
just broken right now. - [Linus] Oh. - [Plouffe] I don't know why. Normally they shoot at you and stuff. It worked when I played
it, I was like, oh sweet. Everything works still. - [Linus] And it's like 3D and everything. - [Plouffe] Yeah. So we- - [Linus] Ow. - [Plouffe] Yeah, these guys drop bombs and they're a little hard to shoot when your projectiles
don't work properly. - [Linus] Okay. Let's
try loading it back up. I wanna see it working properly. - [Plouffe] Yeah, sure. Okay. Now just shoot and see if everything- Hey, see? I knew it would work. - [Linus] Wow. It's got
like recoil and everything. - [Plouffe] Yeah, yeah.
It's got screen shake. We worked a lot to actually get that stuff to feel really good. There's a whole video by
I think Verbia [Vlambeer] or something where they talk about like how screen
shake and just knock-back makes a game feel a lot better. - [Linus] How much fun
would it be to play a game sitting right next to one
of the lead developers so that you can criticize them
in-person when things suck. - [Plouffe] Like a bomb falls on top. - [Linus] It would be exactly this fun. And it's great. Final level. Ah, is there a boss? - [Plouffe] There's a
boss. Yeah. There's a boss. (both cheer) That's pretty much it. I don't think we really
had an end screen anyway. - [Linus] So a lot of your
stuff wouldn't really benefit from like color-calibrated
4K OLED display. - [Plouffe] No. - [Linus] But 16:10 aspect ratio. Ability to hook up up to
three additional displays. Like there's no way you'd
work on a single monitor and do development. - [Plouffe] No, no
there's too much you need. - [Linus] So you got
two Thunderbolt 4 ports, one HDMI port with the
included adapter ma-jiggy. It is sort of a bummer for like a more
professional-oriented machine that you have to have an adapter
for ethernet, USB type A, got a DisplayPort and an HDMI on it. But at least they include
it and it's compact. So you know, you don't have to like run out and buy extra stuff. So then, final question,
going back to the first game. Was making that game easy? - [Plouffe] God. No. Oh, you meant the first game. - [Linus] Yeah. - [Plouffe] Oh, I thought
you meant this one. - [Linus] No. - [Plouffe] Oh. Yeah, the
first game was a lot easier. - [Linus] So if you don't
mind using pre-made assets and following tutorials,
making a game can be easy but not only will that
barely get you out the door anytime something does go wrong due to a missed tutorial
step or a typo in your code, you're gonna have a much
harder time troubleshooting. So for Plouffe, obviously having enough
experience to build something like the second game we looked at today, it's gonna help a fair bit. But if you don't know anything about C#, you might not know to look
for a missing semicolon or misplaced bracket, let
alone something more complex. So if you've never used
Unity or another program common issues that people
might fix every day could seem as mysterious
as our product lineup. Just what will come next at
lttstore.com? Screwdriver? Ah, no, no, probably other things. But in the meantime, you can check out our sweatpants. Big thanks to Gigabyte
for sponsoring this video so that we could pay
Plouffe to develop games. Once again, this time using
the AERO 16 Creator laptop - not your best work - on
top of the great specs we talked about earlier it's also just got solid construction with a CNC'd aluminum body. It comes with Windows Hello and Microsoft Azure AI and Wi-Fi 6E to to make sure you've always got the
best wireless connection whenever you're not using the included wired Ethernet connection when you're downloading or
uploading huge asset files. So you can check it out
at the link down below. Thanks for watching. Are you a developer looking
for something to take to and from work or are you thinking about making indie games
in your spare time? Let us know in the comments
and if you like this video make sure to check out our
tour of Monolith Productions from a few years ago to see
what a real studio looks like. Hint, it has a
lot of people who look kind of like this in it, but
more, more neck on the beard. - [Plouffe] Oh, whoa, whoa.
