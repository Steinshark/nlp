there is a gaping hole in my family room wall and a matching tv size budget burning a hole in my wallet why haven't i spent the budget to fill the hole well because i've fallen into the same trap i'm always warning you guys about in my search for the perfect tv we already reviewed two of the hottest sets on the market samsung's s95b qd oled and lg's g2w oled but i couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger because i knew there was something better around the corner fortunately the corner is this one this is it for a whopping thousand dollars more the a95k from sony features the best of all worlds at least on paper a qd oled panel sony's outstanding image processing dolby vision and a special cooling layer to push it beyond the performance of its south korean competitors will this be the one that ends up in my family room i really hope so because it's getting harder and harder to convince my sponsors to keep buying me new tvs sponsors like grid studio using the art of knolling grid studio's art frames show off the art hidden inside technology learn how you could win your own frame at the end of this video between our last two contenders the lg g2 and samsung s95b i'm leaning toward the s95b and it's all about samsung's qd oled panel technology it is super bright color accurate out of the box has top-notch viewing angles and we suspect that it won't suffer from permanent image retention or burn in to nearly the same degree as earlier oleds yes the lack of polarization does mean that in a brightly lit room it doesn't look as inky black as lg's w oled but when you've got two scenes side by side that aren't super dark it just plain wins or at least it did let's take a look at our newcomer for 4 grand for a 65 inch this better blow me away there's a good chance it will it's you know we're still using cutie oled panels and just like with the samsung but it's got an extra twist like lg's g2 it's got that big thermal layer on the back so it should dissipate heat a bit better but they're not using it the way you might think lg seems to be using the thermal dissipation layer to boost brightness without cooking their oleds sony seems to be more focused on reducing image retention because it's not any brighter than the vanilla samsung version yeah there's more though compared to samsung it has dolby vision to go along with its dolby atmos and its bravia which means this or something else from sony's lineup is the only way you'll get dolby vision in your ps5 on my ps5 or ps5 your ps5 can't say i'm a fan of this kind of ecosystem walled gardening and also i don't have a playstation 5. yeah well anyway it has hdr 10 and hlg but not hdr 10 plus why can't they just have all of them yeah i mean i guess it's a lot of work but that's another swing and a miss to me i thought you said i was going to like this thing you are you are double vision's pretty good the good news is i'm expecting those supported hdr modes to look really good on here and we measured around 960 nits in hdr with full field white hitting about 210 nits but the big thing is almost 320 nits in sdr really yeah which is really good for an oled wow okay this already looks great with the studio lights in my eyes i know and as long as the g2 isn't that right there yeah it still looks black it still looks black like it's you know it's a pretty minor difference it's a funny thing because the issue with the black bars on an ips is that they glow yeah so in the night they bother you because they're glowing they're distracting from the immersion in the content but on these tvs they only look gray they don't actually emit light they just have kind of a gray look compared to the inky blacks of a wo lead yeah and the fire looks so good like even his pant leg there it looks like his legs are actually on fire like they are they filmed it on fire probably with like a fire resistant pants or whatever but but without over juicing anything yeah no it doesn't look cartoonish all the grass looks as green as it should and it's like the yellow patches there like it looks like you're staring at an actual field i hate the term it looks like i'm looking through a window but like that's as close as it's gonna get i think we haven't talked about reflections that was a big advantage on the samsung compared to the lg and it's pretty solid here when it's full black i can see myself yeah but otherwise like even here it's kind of dark and i can kind of see us a little bit but it's not that distracting and we are lit by studio lighting right now this is totally unfair yeah this is an unfair situation and when we look at the numbers that makes sense sony boasts nearly 90 coverage of the bt 2020 color space and straight out of the box we got a delta e average of 1.85 in sdr technically that is a slight loss to the s95b but that's only after using samsung's onboard calibration and a difference of 0.16 is an insignificant price to pay for our 75 nits of extra brightness as for hdr we measured both imax enhanced and cinema modes and ladies and gentlemen we figured out where most of that thousand extra dollars is going sony's processing not ltcstore.com where they could have picked up a sweet man hoodie or a swag even after using samsung's calibration app the a95k crushes the s95b in hdr without luminance errors we are getting a delta e average of 3.6 with a max of 6.5 like it's not even close the sony also handles reds significantly better skin tones look so natural like that looks like a fire lit face it doesn't look like a yellow light on a face and while some of the other colors are slightly more accurate on the samsung that lower maximum deviation is more important here it wasn't easy getting to this state though while we didn't dig into the 10-point white balance and color adjustment on the bravia we did have to tinker with some of the other settings and it comes with some trade-offs to get the most color accurate image in both sdr and hdr you can't use the same settings in both modes we found that the best results in hdr were with gradation preferred hdr tone mapping advanced contrast enhancer set to medium and live color set to high conversely sdr wants ace and live color off if you keep the sdr settings you end up with less accuracy and more luminance errors in hdr when you keep the hdr settings color accuracy plummets in hdr and i just wish we didn't have to make this trade-off though realistically an average delta ef4 is still really good for the average viewer so what i would probably do is leave it dialed in for hdr and then take that hit in sdr of course we need more than just great color performance what about the features it runs it up to 4k 120hz refresh rate we will talk about gaming shortly integrates with every relevant voice assistant through the mic in the remote and has sony's cool behind the screen speakers these can either be used as better than average integrated sound or this is really cool as a stealthy center channel in a surround config like the one we set up in this sponsored video on the a9ht speakers it's even got a freaking webcam this wow that's kind of weird looking this definitely merits a closer look those flashes are so crisp yeah and fast normally i don't care about pixel response time while i'm consuming passive entertainment sure right like when i'm gaming when i'm controlling the action i do but wow it's on and off yeah yeah and so there's this difference between the display not being fast and there being kind of an after effect to a bright flash like that and your eyes being what causes the the after effect of seeing something bright yeah but this is just boop and then it's gone that's cool do you like the remote you've only used it for like 20 seconds i haven't had any complaints right because it just feels correct look at that it has buttons you need like a dedicated input button oh dedicated bravia core button i certainly plan to use that i don't think it has like disney plus no it does it does netflix but why would i want those if i have braviacore i could watch such wonderful movies as spiderman and other more different spiderman [Laughter] it just makes the atmosphere so much more immersive the glitter on the light fury and it's glitter it's not just a white spot you know what i mean yeah yeah look at it look at them yeah yeah sparkle that's over and you can only do that with individually lit pixels just now you said we got 100 megabit in one of the other files but is the tv actually limited to 100 megabits i tried speed test and i got 100 megabit up and down yeah put gigabit controllers on these things you guys they cost nothing and here this feels like sun behind clouds yes it looks like an overcast gray sky yeah i just love this scene in hdr man the thing is hdr is not about a brighter image or even making out more details in the dark parts of the scene it's about light and materials and them behaving on screen in a way that's like what we'd expect in the real world it's about immersion it's about having a high dynamic range yes thank you it is kind of right in the name finally it's time to talk gaming we gamed on all three displays with an rtx 3080ti and a core i9 12 900k we're gonna have our tvs and our test bench parts listed below by the way if you want to check them out surprise surprise because they're all oled they're all freaking great actually panel latency testing was done using a new tool from our friend andrew over at tech team gb speaking of tests we just went around trying to find out who's the fastest typer at lmg and you can only check that video out on floatplane so go get subscribed andrew developed the os rtt or open source response time tool it's a device that is similar to nvidia's ldap but it's open source obviously and it runs its own unreal engine 4 program in the background to simulate flashes and light changes we got pretty similar results from each display with the lg and the sony hitting about 8.4 milliseconds going from zero to 153 so black is zero and 153 is gray and the samsung marginally beat them at 7.9 milliseconds in the same test putting all three of them in the upper echelon of living room gaming displays now while the g2 is the only one with proper nvidia g-sync compatibility all three displays have variable refresh rate and automatic low latency mode so i'm not expecting that to be a big differentiating factor now to dive deeper into qdo led versus w oled and whether or not it has the same lightning fast pixel response time we've ordered a new sensor for our oscilloscope so make sure to get subscribed for all the labs content that we have in store but to the eye all three of them are definitely fine which leads us to the conclusion despite the higher price tag i think i'm gonna go with the sony bravia a95k it might not get quite as bright as the samsung and hdr but it's sturdier our s95b has actually started to warp just from unboxing and re-boxing it a few times and we're not the only ones seeing the problem it's more color accurate in hdr brighter in sdr and dolby vision is just too good to pass up even if we think sony's being kind of butt heads about dolby vision the thing though is that my budget isn't exactly limited i actually bought two of the three tvs rather than wait for review units so that i could get an answer quicker and get my family room built out so it's important to give a more grounded perspective for almost anyone else saving a thousand dollars is a no-brainer for the still very outstanding picture that you're gonna get from either the lg g2 or samsung s95b really i think the main takeaway here is that if you've got the budget for a flagship tv it is pretty tough to pick the wrong one for a change and if you don't mind waiting a year or two there are going to be some amazing home viewing experiences available at just wild prices as the competition heats up here just like my segways heating up
