is one of china's big tigers the prize of xi jinping's anti-corruption drive it's oyeon kang showed that even being a member of the polo bureau standing committee did not protect you from prosecution then shu's fall showed that the goal is the same even for china's powerful military the people's liberation army is the world's largest army and probably its second most powerful the party controls it through the central military commission chaired by china's most senior generals and party members corruption in the chinese military is a largely unexplored topic basically a state secret charging sri for what he did is characteristic of xi jinping's style shaking up the status quo in this video let us let june 1943 in what is now the aoning province shir tai ho joined the pla at the age of 20. having graduated from a well-respected military feeder academy he rose quickly through the ranks on the basis of having a formal education deng xiaoping wanted to reform the pla after many years of turmoil during the cultural revolution and he sought out school people to reform and bring fresh perspectives in 1990 shrew became a political commissar in the chinese military with the rank of major general on paper being a commercial meant keeping the fighting forces in line with political ideology such responsibilities gave the political department immense power over promotions and personnel recommendations without third party oversight a senior political position is thus unsurprisingly ripe for corruption two years later shu found himself promoted to assistant director of the pla's general political department he had been the beneficiary of a high-level purge of the military initiated by zhang jamin in the wake of the tan anmen square incident in 1999 shu was made a full general and he entered china's central military commission he retired as vice chairman of the cmc in 2013 making him one of the most powerful people in china it's likely that he's been involved in the promotion of many senior ranking military officers over the past two decades shortly after his retirement things began to unravel for him in a bad way he was diagnosed with terminal bladder cancer then the party's anti-corruption body the ccdi began to investigate him and fellow vice chairman guopo for a cash for ranks corruption scandal so let's talk a little bit about that the military considers any information regarding its possible corruption estate secret thus we don't have much concrete evidence on the pervasiveness of the cash-for-rank scheme within the pla or how it works most of what we know is generally based on rumors and what the military chooses to share the idea of cash for ranks is simple if you want to get promoted into a certain position you need to deliver a bribe the bribe is not available to everyone you must have the right connections or guangxi but is largely required uniform officers end up selling these positions because the pla used to offer little financial security in terms of retirement so veterans stayed in their jobs for as long as possible shutting down the pathway forward for people lower down in the hierarchy in some ways such bribery helps reinforce the social networks that already exist within the military the scheme is thought to have originated has simple rewards from a recently promoted officer to his patron a genuine thank you the purchase of a rank though uh as the scheme developed would eventually become so costly for the buyer that they would often turn around and begin monetizing their investment by reselling down the line and it was not enough they would give a small percentage kickback up to the original seller so in some ways the cash for rank scandal starting taking on aspects of a huge multi-level marketing scheme it soon began to undermine the people's confidence in its own military as is the ccti style these main guys in this case xin guo their subordinates are rolled up first before they themselves are taken down one notable such underling is general logistics department deputy gu junshan taken into isolation and held without release or accusation after 2012. general logistics handled the procurement of supplies and the management of the army's massive land holdings it would purchase public land at below market prices and to kick back fees from land developers trying to bid on a particular development for instance diao thai number seven is a cluster of high-end luxury apartments in the heart of beijing homes there cost some 46 000 usd per square meter the land underneath these homes was requisitioned by the army in the name of scientific research and guess who ended up with it goo had gotten this plum logistics position largely because of shu he is alleged to have given shu's daughter a 3.2 million dollar cash card at a party as part of his compensating kickbacks shu also apparently had protected gu from prior anti-corruption investigations and removals from power shu's former position as a secretary on the pla's branch of the anti-corruption force is especially helped with this the ccdi detained general shu in december 2013 for investigation they also arrested his wife daughter mistress and personal secretary all of them would be convicted the investigation began in march 2014 and in october of that same year shu was expelled from the military and the party shru's investigation and expulsion from the party is muddled a bit by national security concerns and his terminal cancer diagnosis officials raided his home and reportedly found over a ton of jewelry jade stones and cash in his basement but you don't have the same amount of detail that you get with the doyon khan trial china's propaganda organs excarated the man calling him a two-faced demon and a national thief but sure would be spared truly onerous punishment by the government as it seems like he would soon be dead anyway indeed he died march 2015 in the hospital from his cancer shrew's partner in crime received a life sentence gurjunshan the corrupt logistics officer received the death sentence with the two-year reprieve in 2015 and it seems like he's still alive too based on the latest internet searches in the two years after shu's arrest some 30 high-level pla officers were investigated and removed many of these people were political commissaries and members of the logistics department it makes sense since these officers were best positioned to profit from their rank the party regularly cites sri tai ho alongside zoyong kang has one of the big tigers in the anti-corruption drive it's proof to the public that no rank or position is powerful enough to provide full immunity from anti-corruption shu's journey is not as dramatic as doyon kang who had a spectacular rise to power and a spectacular fall as well but the government has also hidden away many of the details such to avoid disclosing military secrets the pla considers any analysis of possible corruption within its ranks by a third party as a hostile intrusive action i suppose no army wants to have its dirty laundry aired out over five years have passed in school and shoes arrest and removal and the anti-corruption drive continues to this day though state-owned media does not appear to trumpet each arrest as much it has been shown to reduce certain types of corruption such as cronyism within the party's provincial ranks i suppose the same could be said as well with the pla's ranks as well but we don't know the reality remains opaque to everyone looking in alright everyone have a good evening take care of yourselves bye
