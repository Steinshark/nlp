okay so in the lead up to Huawei's next generation mate flagship welcome to the pinnacle of the current gen inside this box is the huawei mate 20x 5g which is a souped-up version of the huawei mate 20x which in itself is already kind of like the ultimate version of the huawei mate 20 and you might not think it by looking at the specs alone but this is such a category defying device that using it doesn't actually feel like using a phone at all and it's actually faster than any Huawei mobile out there right now let me explain inside the box as well as the phone one of the first things you're going to notice is a clear plastic case you get a USBC cable you get USBC earphones and instead of these standard 20 2.5 watt charger on the mate 20 X on the 5g version you get a 40 watt supercharger and that is great but something that's going to grab your attention far more than that other shared dimensions of the device you might remember the day when a 5.3 inch screen was considered humongous at a time when most phones were closer to 4 inches while picking this phone up for the first time reminded me of that exact same feeling in an age where most smartphone screens are hovering around these 6 to 6 and 1/2 inch size this is a 7 point 2 inch panel and that difference is actually even more than it sounds in terms of raw screen area you're actually getting about 30% more display than even the plus-sized variants of other flagships it's a 1080p OLED display would support for high contrast HDR 10 content and this combination of quality and size literally makes people double take when they see it in public and to make one thing clear this thing is fantastic for gaming is running the same Kirin 980 chip and eight gigs of ram as the 2019 P 30 Pro it's got GPU turbo on the software front which can stabilize frame rates and the 1080p resolution here is a good balance between being sharp enough and not being too demanding on the chip also the mate 20x has one of the most advanced cooling systems on a smart phone period it's got a vapor chamber which you've probably heard of quite a few phones have that they're now also a graphene film on top of that you might have actually heard of graphene already it is the thinnest material known to it is about 200 times stronger than steel but more importantly for this use case it is incredibly conductive which means it can take heat from the chip in the phone and transport it away very quickly they call this these super cool technology now one thing that the standard mate 20x did incredibly was speakers like most flagship smartphones you got a powerful bottom firing speaker down here but then turning the device around you'd get another one on top on this 5g version here you don't quite get to full speakers and there's no headphone jack on this version either as some extra room had to be used for that 5g that said this phone does still use the earpiece to create a dual speaker setup that still loud and clear and remember you're also getting USB C earphones in the box so you don't need a dongle to use them anyways what I found more interesting is that whilst using the mate 20x 5g it wasn't just a case that everything felt bigger than with other phones this thing has finally crossed another line you have to kind of commit to using it with both hands but what that means is when you're forced into that you start using the phone in a slightly different way or at least that's what I experienced there is so much space here that you could be playing a YouTube video whilst having a full screens worth of Twitter feed left it doesn't feel cramped at all whilst yes phone screens are getting larger every single year and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before seven point two inches becomes conventional that doesn't change the fact that right now there is nothing else like this add into this mix VM pen which comes separately and doesn't fit inside the phone but benefits from having the actual dimensions of a pen you're used to using it's got impressive sensitivity we're talking 4096 levels of pressure which is as good as its fiercest competition you get an action button which is your primary way of triggering things such as going straight into the Notes app with one tap or to take custom screenshots in any shape useful for sending that perfect meme without any distractions plus of course you can use it to draw and I don't need to tell you that this is up there with the best phones to be doing that on see yeah I could talk about form factor for another four minutes but essentially if you're in the market for a large screen phone then this not only offers the screen size that you might want but also helps you take advantage of it quite well anyways the other differentiator here is that instead of just using the here in 980 chip the mate 20 X 5g combines this with their new belong 5000 chip which handles communications it's a multimode chip supporting 2g 3G 4G and 5g in a single unit which reduces the latency and the power consumption when switching between those modes and that's more important than it sounds because 5g is still an evolving standard there's going to be a lot of this switching happening you're not gonna get 5g coverage everywhere I say that but 5g is improving and she spent a good part of last week in London testing 5g networks and when it works it is incredible I tried downloading a whole load of smaller 50 megabyte applications and that download is happening so quickly that I didn't even see a progress bar aside from this I do like the huawei has used a rare fingerprint scanner because on a phone of this size I reckon having one on the front would need a bit of a finger dance to get to the body has an IP 5 3 rating for mild splash and water resistance and a strong 4,200 million power battery which will mean you're still looking at a full day's use even with the huge display and 5g always active on the back you've actually got the same camera system as the mate 20 pro last year so that's a primary 40 megapixel sensor a 3 x telephoto camera as well as an ultra wide I wouldn't call this the number one camera system in the world anymore in fact you've got hallways p30 Pro which is their current camera flagship but this still has almost all of the same features you still get all that fun stuff like portrait mode video and AI color but also something I became a massive fan of after using the p30 Pro star trails mode the camera capture time is also pretty amazing here and finally the phone supports Huawei nm cards on top of the 256 gigs of inbuilt storage these things are about 45% smaller than a standard microSD and by being the exact shape of a nano SIM you can fit one into your second slot on this dual SIM tray the phone is running Android P is going to be getting the Android q update as well as all other updates as normal so to sum up this feels like a smart first step into 5g the belong chip allows seamless switching into 4G or 3G if needed and the massive screen and loud speakers let you really enjoy whatever content you're consuming whether that's a show that's being streamed on your 5g network or just a game being played natively the mate 20x 5g has actually just come to the UK now so if you're from here I'm gonna drop some info in the description below as to where's the best place to buy it thanks for watching guys and I will catch you in the next one [Music] you
