two years ago when we built our first most average gaming PC the GTX 1060 is the most pop for gamers finally all of that has changed that's right the great price raising has taken its toll and for the first time that I can remember the average gaming rig has actually gotten worse and since game developers are always going to Target the lowest common denominator for their low graphic settings does this mean that game realism could actually take a step back to find out we're going to be building a new most average gaming PC because gpus aren't the only thing that's changed in the last two years for instance we've got a completely new sponsor it's you green ugreen is taking your charging to the next level with their new 100 watt charger it's a four in one charger that has three USBC ports and a USB a port while still fitting in the palm of your hand get yours today using the link down below to make a proper comparison we started by reassembling our last unexceptional winner and we re-ran all of our benchmarks driver updates can make a big difference over such a long period of time and then we poured over the latest team Hardware survey along with the Amazon bestsellers list to fill in the gaps for items like power supply case and Storage so without further ado build it with our motherboard the b660mg from MSI and I know what you're thinking really I 12th gen chip Yes actually but I don't want to talk about that yet we chose this board because the top selling v660 on Amazon right now is a hundred and ten dollar gigabyte board that we don't have but we do have this similarly priced guy from MSI with pretty much the same features and no matter which one of them you end up with it's enough to make you question why anybody needs a 500 motherboard it doesn't have some of the latest bells and whistles no support for front USB type c and it only has two memory slots which can make upgrading less economical but it's got two gen 4 m.2 slots support for two and a half gig Lan and of course an upgrade path to the latest 13th gen CPUs with that out of the way now we can talk about the CPU the problem with the steam Hardware survey is that it doesn't report specific model numbers only the brand average base clock frequency average core count and an indicator for how many people have hyper threading or smt on that note eighty percent of You by the way have hyper writing now meaning that two threads per core is now overwhelmingly the norm the average core count has also gone up moving us from quad cores into the hexacore class but wait the average base clock is now just 2.3 to 2.7 gigahertz uh I mean even if intel didn't still have two-thirds of the market amd's recent chips pretty much all the way in at around 3.6 gigahertz base our suspicion is that this is due to a couple of converging Trends first of all older CPUs that have low IPC but extremely high clock speeds have really reached the end of their useful gaming lifespan and are likely being retired on mass the second is that we know that laptops are a growing segment particularly in gaming and they tend to have high boost clocks but very low base clocks we were able to find some Modern desktop chips that closely fit the build though and we settled on the core i5 12 400 since it doesn't have have any efficiency cores only performance course it should be fairly representative of either a current gen Intel or AMD gaming experience and it also happens to be a great bang for the buck choice at its last gen discounted price for CPU cooling the hyper 212 lineup of heat sinks from Cooler Master must be mentioned due to its obvious popularity however some other great value options have hit the market in recent years so it's not really the Clear Choice that it once was as for our build well rcpu comes with a stock cooler and since it can't be overclocked due to restrictions on the motherboard chipset and CPU we're going to go ahead and use that which also makes our installation a little bit simpler storage was a tough one I think I'm going to fire an email over to valve and ask them if maybe in the future they can split it out by interface so that we can see the share of nvme versus SATA drives that could become a really important data point down the road depending on how direct storage plays out for now though the hardware survey doesn't give us much in the way of granularity with only one terabyte Plus for guidance then we aired on the side of plus given that so many modern games will occupy 50 gigs or more of storage and we felt that with the popularity not to mention affordability of m.2 nvme drives it made sense to go for the not the best but far from the worst Samsung 970 Evo plus two terabyte if Amazon reviews are anything to go by you guys are on the same page here it's only PCI Express gen 3 which might not be as f word as a Gen 4 Drive Monster X storage hits the scene for real if it does but this thing has over 44 000 reviews maintaining a Solid 5 star rating and the best part is that if you don't need two terabytes for 165 dollars the one terabyte version is only 90 bucks that's incredibly affordable for this kind of performance though it is still over double of what a retro polar fleece us from lttstore.com and this is this is much less comfortable to wear like how cool is it that affordable motherboards are coming with simple tool-less SSD installation mechanisms now love to see it now for memory ah it hasn't really changed most of you are still rocking 16 gigs which is good but one thing did change we went with ddr4 rather than DDR3 this time around we settled on a middle of the road kit from Corsair a two by eight gig 3200 Mega transfer per second cl-16 kit all three top spots on Amazon are variants of this Vengeance lpx kit with 72 000 reviews no RGB just straight performance is what the people want so that's what we're going to give them moving on to the case what can I say this thing is still on top despite the new variants that massively improve on its performance at over 30 000 reviews it eclipses every other case in the top 10 list right now I mean it's almost never the worst choice to just pick what's popular and the h510 is no exception it's got good looks a user-friendly layout and it's fairly priced I just think that a savvier shopper would venture the Box and maybe grab the flow variant in hopes that it will better handle future GPU upgrades as we continue to March towards the industry goal of creating gaming processors that double as space heaters this is the kind of thing I'm talking about with quality of life features there's a little nubbing on the center motherboard standoff that allows you to just rest the motherboard there I'm not saying I recommend doing this I'm just saying that um you could by the way the Keen item you might have noticed that I am missing an i o Shield someone put this board back in inventory without it it doesn't affect performance but it could affect the amount of Emi that's coming out of the back of the case not that the sheeple shopping approach is always the best I'm about to contradict a lot of what I just said please do not just buy the most reviewed power supply on Amazon the thermal takes I will almost lean not light on fire we actually really included its little brother in our entry-tier holiday shopping guide but we only did that because we were trying to fit in a very aggressive budget we would never actually recommend that you skimp on power supply so we're going to put a couple of better Options under the video that don't cost much more for the purposes of this build though majority rules so we grabbed a close enough equivalent off our Shelf complete with ketchup and mustard cables and no 80 plus efficiency badge whatsoever now let's talk about the big change the GPU it costs anywhere from 170 all the way up to 250 dollars for a 1650 brand new it wasn't very good when it launched and it's not very good right now but with a new 3050 which would be the closest current gen equivalent going for at least three hundred dollars it's easy to see why over the last few years especially but even now most people have opted for the save about option and gone for one of these it's got only a 128 bit bus four gigs of gddr5 memory that is two gigs fewer than our 1060 from our last most average gaming PC and a booth clock speed of up to 1665 megahertz the problem with this card and the reason that I would not recommend picking one up even if your budget constrained is that you can get a used 3050 for about the same price off of eBay or Facebook Marketplace if you have one of these guys though don't feel bad about it because I'm about to game on it and I think our Benchmark results might surprise you or maybe it won't surprise you since we already said that game developers tend to Target the hardware that's out there and a whopping six percent of gamers are using this GPU oh moving on to what we're going to connect it to we've got this the scepter 24 inch 75 Hertz does it even have a model name the point is it's not actually the most popular monitor this 21.5 inch 1080p beast from Acer but it is the silver medalist and both of them have the same Core specs 1080p resolution a slightly higher than standard 75 Hertz refresh rate which makes a huge difference over 60 by the way and a very attractive price point on that note the wired version of the g502 from Logitech might seem like a bit of an odd choice on the most average gaming PC given that it's priced at 80 dollars but there's a method to this madness nobody actually pays eighty dollars for it it's currently 34 on sale which is a whole lot of bang for the buck and if the 50 plus thousand reviews are anything to go by almost always on sale don't buy it for 80. for keyboard realistically anything is probably fine like I would take a good mouse and a six dollar keyboard over the opposite eight days of the week so I grabbed this s101-3 from Red Dragon uh its membrane it's super popular and it'll get the job done if you just need a keyboard though this actually comes as part of a keyboard mouse combo there are a lot of options out there around this price point or you could just see if your aunt and uncle uh really need that one that's sitting there collecting dust and just use that almost complete absence of RGB just as nature intended it the first thing you'll probably notice now that we're fired up other than that hey it worked is that despite us being able to install Windows 11 we're still on Windows 10 just like 65 percent of you out there the top five games on Steam right now are CS go Dota 2 lost ark Warzone 2 and Pub G naturally we benchmarked all of them and honestly I mean look at this we've got 220 230 FPS in CS go all of them run pretty okay on either system but whether it's the fewer CPU cores or the outdated DDR3 memory our previous system simply didn't keep up quite as well in our two Battle Royale titles we noticed more hitching and our one percent lows were much well lower which results in a noticeably degraded experience particularly in intense firefights in Dota 2 we got about 150 FPS with Lost Art hovering around 60 meaning that either of these systems the most popular from now or two years ago is going to be perfectly fine with the most popular titles and we did all of our testing at very high details so if you want more FPS you can just turn down the settings and you should be good to go for another year or two at least all for the reasonable price of 735 dollars which could fairly easily be cut down if you went for like a second hand case or something like that it's still a fair bit more than a console but it's also a fair bit more useful than a console since you can do so much more on PC like emulating older games browsing the web chatting on Discord Etc but unlike a console our computer isn't even sort of 4K ready Halo infinite defaulted to low so obviously if we're going to want strong frame rates we're going to have to expect to turn details down a little bit but whether it's Halo infinite or whether it's other AAA titles at 1080p we found that everything was very playable and with no odd bugs to speak of so if you target for your Hardware what pretty much everyone else is running game studios are sure to at least consider your system as they develop their upcoming titles the bar does look like it's about to jump up by the way with the RTX 3060 gunning for the top spot but that's another story for another day just like this
