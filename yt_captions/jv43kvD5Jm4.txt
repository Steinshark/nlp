ladies and gentlemen welcome back to Norway chess 2023 classical and Armageddon style chess tournament where every single game is worth three points and the Armageddon is one or one and a half uh we're halfway through the tournament and also thank you for dealing with my various uh camera settings and you know moving is always a pain so I'm still figuring out all that good stuff uh today we said goodbye to Hikaru and uh that's what we are going to start with said goodbye to Hikaru in a unique fashion as always I've got some Hikaru games I've got a Carlson game for you I've got an update on the standings I've got an update on the world rankings here we go today it's Hikaru versus firuja feruja is currently battling for world number two and he is currently battling for number one in this tournament it is Hikaru furuja they are number two and number three trailing only Fabiano caruana and their classical game of chess begins with E4 Hikaru plays the Sicilian Defense okay that's wild um why is it wild well he's playing for a win he caught us playing for a win with black hecaro thinks that ferrugia is a volatile individual uh and thinks that he has good winning chances and um Hikaru plays E5 man like Hikaru doesn't play anything else except D5 now one of the reasons he played E5 is because furuja does not play the Spanish Arusha is an Italian connoisseur feruja loves the Italian loves it and Hikaru I suppose just wasn't in the mood and decided I'm gonna play combative chess I'm not in the mood for e45 I'm going to play Knight C6 and against feruja's rosalimo Sicilian I'm going to play G6 now I imagine that Hikaru had something prepared here he probably had either the Kalashnikov or the svenikov Sicilian prepared uh I really do not think that Hikaru was going to play The Accelerated dragon but I don't know uh so Oliver plays Bishop B5 and Hikaru plays G6 this is the main line now white has the option to take here and do various things with these two pawns uh or Castle uh and uh and ferrugia castles and this is a modern approach you delay the capture on C60 card does this and now black has the option to take really with either Pawn Hikaru does this black also could take like this and then try to play E5 and it's just a different thing but he does this opening up the B file potential to play you know D5 if he wants a D6 E5 if he wants it or just do nothing uh farouza plays rookie one Hikaru plays a massive sideline which is Queen C7 and farusha plays Knight A3 uh Queen C7 is not the most popular move uh generally black is playing some e5s here uh or black is playing Knight F6 and putting the knight in the center like this this is a very very very very very flexible move uh it's you know in many ways white can even do E5 now and prevent the move Knight F6 uh but farouza plays the move Knight A3 almost instantly so clearly he knows what he's doing and Hikaru plays Knight H6 which has never been played before uh or at least it's taken us to extremely unique territory already which is why ferrugia spends 26 minutes to push upon one square and they wonder why classical chess is difficult to put on television like folks I'm sorry okay I am going to go on a mini rant right now imagine you are at a sports bar you know nothing about sports but you are hanging out with a couple of your friends and they are watching the television you are drinking beer or juice if for some reason you're 12 years old and at a sports bar your friends are able to explain any sport to you on screen with the maybe the exception of baseball very quickly how on Earth do you sit staring at a screen for 26 minutes and a guy pushes the pawn one square like this is unmarketable I'm sorry it's very difficult to Market this unless you already have climbed some degree of the mountain that is the chess learning curve I'm just saying anyway the move C3 is designed to blunt the bishop and play the move d4 while every spend 26 minutes I have absolutely no idea I am unqualified to answer that question um he might have calculated C3 D3 D4 H3 any all any and all sorts of these moves Hikaru just castles and for user plays H3 okay he clearly played these moves quickly that is the setup that he chooses and now Hikaru plays F6 this is ridiculous I mean this is just utterly ridiculous that you can play chess like this and he is just going to play Knight F7 and also in many ways he is going to fight for the center so farouza now plays D4 very principled move Hikaru takes on D4 clearly in his preparation and plays D5 um everything that Hikaru has done so far is obviously in his prep Knight H6 is in his prep the very natural C3 H3 Hikaru is playing according to plan plays D5 uh and now feruja plays Bishop D2 after five minutes of thought and now Hikaru spends 17 minutes um obviously after D5 you have this in your notes after D5 you have this in your notes um you have maybe one of these two queen moves in your notes I don't know Bishop takes H6 uh but Bishop D2 is played Bishop D2 is a very multi-purpose move first of all you have ideas of moving the bishop in that direction second of all you have ideas of playing Rook C1 third of all you have ideas are playing Queen C1 pressuring this and this and that is why hikoro spends a bit of time in place Queen B7 which the computer was not fully liking but it also didn't hate black also can play Bishop E6 Rook B8 and Knight F7 I mean all of those moves have various ideas Bishop B6 is re-strengthening the center Knight F7 obviously rerouting uh black should not take on e4 because this exchange leaves black with a pretty bad Pawn on C6 but probably still manageable uh but Hikaru plays Queen B7 and then does this and this and it's a web I mean it's a very messy position look how much time Farooq has spent Perugia spent 26 minutes pushing this and then he spent another 28 minutes on another Pawn push this man spent 26 plus 28 equals 54 minutes of this game pushing two Pawns I don't understand how you're supposed to Market this to mass audience but okay whatever luckily I'm not the one you know doing this now we have this position very imbalanced black has two Bishops but one of them is kind of a bozo uh now the bishop can route this way the Knight can also Jump In This Way black has pressure here ferrugia now begins a very interesting positional game um he puts the bishop out there he plays A3 and now wouldn't it be wonderful if he could get a knight to C5 yep he now takes the Knight this is very sharp stuff and plays rookie 2 with this idea and also 91 Knight D3 understands that normally a bishop for a knight is a bad trade but this is a close position and in a close position he's going to reroute his pieces and have a very nice bind he is going to play Knight D3 put a knight on C5 Knight H2 put an item G4 and he's going to be happy and his position is very pleasant Hikaru does not have a lot of play but he has a very decent position very resilient position and it is fairuzik who is Dancing with his Knights and making good progress you know he plays H4 it's like looking like he's improving his position and then he plays Knight C5 and offers a drop game over draw agreed and he takes Hikaru to the Armageddon um okay here we go boys now kikaru plays E5 friendly reminder 10 minutes for white seven minutes for black one extra bonus second on the 41st move of the game if black makes a draw black wins and then black gets one and a half points in the standings whoever wins the Armageddon gets one and a half points this time for Hikaru plays into ferruges Italian now the reason Hikaru is playing into ferrush's Italian is that in a rapid time control format like 10 minutes versus 7 in Armageddon first of all the nerves are higher second of all black can make a draw completely at leisure uh and Hikaru just trusts his instincts because he's a number one or number two ranked rapid player in the world it's him and Magnus D3 and ferrugia plays this approach which is very provocative allowing black to play the move G5 antiocharo plays King G7 and Hikaru goes Knight back he does not because now he has H5 and G4 and H4 and also the F Pawn Hikaru gets a massive attack going with his kingside pawns toward furuja's very unhappy Bishop on the G3 Square H4 G4 now the Knight has to go he car plays F5 look at this I mean it's an avalanche Pawn to F4 and the next move is simply winning EF now Hikaru can play Bishop takes a five but instead of that he does this and here white can maybe even sacrifice the Knight and create an attack but furuja instead plays F6 giving up the pawn like this and enters this position as he tries to blow up the center of the board look at the time farusha was given three extra minutes at the beginning of this game and it is down to eight seconds Hikaru has equaled the playing field folks you have to understand something if you are given three extra minutes you need to make use of it of course Fairuza knows that I am not in any way shape or form claiming to be a better chess player than alireza all I'm saying is now kikaru is on equal terms against the guy and he has a draw in his back pocket if 67 of a chess game means a win for another side that's very bad so farouja now has to take massive risk he has sacrificed the pawn and in a moment you are going to see him sacrifice his Rook Rook takes E5 D takes E5 Rook takes F6 Queen takes Queen Bishop Rook take it look at this ferocious axes Rook for a bishop a knight and a bishop and we have this who's better two Rooks or two Bishops in a knight traditional brain will tell you two Rooks traditional brain would be right especially if the turoks can coordinate and start beating up the weaknesses so f3g fgf C5 ikaro has now traded down into deep enough of a position that here's the problem folks Ken white win this is not a question of who is better this is a question of can white when the answer to this question as time is ticking down for both players and Hikaru now has a two and a half minute time advantage no white definitely cannot win Hikaru sacrifices like this white is left with nearly no pieces remaining and farouza just resigns because Hikaru is going to push these pawns and even if Hikaru does not win what Hikaru will not do is lose Hikaru wins an Armageddon against firogi Hikaru has won every single matchup that he has played except against Magnus you're gonna be kind of tough to beat if you do that speaking of Magnus he was in his own battle against the Norwegian number two uh aryantari has had a tough time our antari is always up against it at this tournament he is a very good player he's not a 28-53 rated player he's also not a 2750 rated player he's a 2650 rated player Ari antari is exceptional but the ceiling in chess is absurd but it's always interesting to see Magnus also plays a sicilian uh tari plays the bishop B5 check Sicilian and this kind of becomes a dragon so much like uh I talked about the accelerated Dragon this is the moroxy setup uh with uh E4 F3 G2 and C4 B3 potentially and it's a setup that is very cancerous for black it is very difficult for Magnus to beat his opponent in a position that looks like this look how solid white is just very difficult I mean it's listen this is like you know driving your car into a brick wall and saying I made a dent in the wall yeah but what about your car right not saying I've ever done that and I don't condone that at all now Magnus plays H5 all right Magnus looking to try to expand a little bit on the king side and be a little bit provocative E6 atario plays H3 and now Magnus plays this move D5 um and one of two things will happen uh when black plays D5 why will panic and lose all his pieces because as the board is opening up there's going to be Crossfire among all the pieces uh or number two white is going to trade all the pieces and make a draw CD Ed 95 95 Rook C1 Rook C1 Bishop D5 Bishop takes A6 orientare is a pawn up Queen E7 the bishop comes back because it did not want to get taken okay tari's Pawn up look at that well no he's not so all the pieces got traded it was a massive sequence of moves that players are both left with B fgh pawns and the exact same material however one trade can make or break a game so for example if white plays Bishop takes Knight in this position uh White is uh probably immediately going to be worse in the long run immediately in the long run that was terrible English uh but there's just absolutely no need to rush like that tari plays Bishop C3 and Magnus plays Knight E6 and again we are at a moment where potentially we can have some trades but this one would be bad for white because you cannot take back the bishop Queen E3 96. and now the bishops come off the board and it looks like we are headed for either a draw or a Magnus win why are we headed for a Magnus win because the evaluation Bar says so and also because Magnus is very good at squeezing water out of stone in positions that otherwise just don't look squeezable alright King H7 Rook D5 centralizing Queen C7 pitting the bishop to The Rook to the queen rather d8 now if Bishop takes E6 is played in this position there is Rook D1 check deflecting The Rook from the defense of the queen which would be very tragic uh uh Bishop off on Deck Magnus doesn't trade Queens Rook D2 infiltrating there we go there's the Magnus we know here is the Magnus that is going to crush another 2650 rated opponent in a position he has no business winning tari pushes his Pawn to B5 tari has pawns extended deep into the position that are barely being held on to and his entire row of pieces is reduced to nothingness aren't we all on the back rank Rook C2 he's just going to play on tari's nerves Bishop C4 now it's a heavy piece end game Queen G5 Magnus has a minute he plays King G7 Queen D6 is looking for his opportunity and now Rook B4 all right Rook B4 Magnus also could have played Queen F4 in this position which would have secured him upon but I suppose he was not fully convinced that this was winning he plays Rook before and he's infiltrating closer and in this position uh he had a winning chance which was Rook F4 which is utterly ridiculous and the idea is Queen D4 the idea is to meet some Rook C6 with Queen D4 defending the pawn cutting the king's escape and Rook H4 this was one of magnus's missed ideas Rook F4 was not Queen D4 um but that one was a little bit dank and now tari goes for the king and in this position Magnus has a winning idea of Queen A1 the point of Queen A1 is the team of the rook and the Queen after something like Queen F2 the king runs out there's Queen E5 check and apparently the one you know the the king is just in some serious trouble here on the G3 Square black is barely not winning this position and it requires this incredible defensive resource F5 and still why does it go uh going to be down upon but Magnus misses a win for the second time and now tari's King Runs Out and I think there was one more moment here that it was scary but look at look at look at this King G4 and when it's all said and done it's a queen end game and there's nothing and Magnus is unable to win another classical game of chess folks this is big we have now played six out of nine rounds Magnus has not won a game in classical chess I don't know the last time that this has happened I mean like I feel like now is is almost like uh every single time that that Magnus hits a record of uh like a like no it's not a low light but I mean it's just it's surprising we're just kind of like what's going on you know but they have to play Armageddon and uh we just saw Hikaru defend an Italian in an Armageddon let's see how Magnus defends on Armageddon A3 H3 he takes he puts his Knight in the center he now wants to play B5 D5 and all this good stuff there it is Pawn on D5 very solid right rook d8 and now tari has to start attacking Magnus Bishop C5 he puts the Knight on F5 tari is going for mate Magnus says okay you want to come in your knight wants to come in all right fantastic come in let's go come into my position Knight H6 come on Knight H6 look at that look alive but if you play Knight F5 I'm just gonna go King at King and back well tari is here Atari barked now he's got a bite Queen G4 Bishop takes Atari drops out with the Knight takes like this if you take I'm gonna take there you go I'm gonna take on each wait wasn't that just a free night yes that was just a free night there would have been pressure here here and here and Ariana here has nearly four minutes up on the clock he can take this Knight for sure now obviously he probably thought about F4 looking quite good the computer finds Pawn takes Pawn takes D4 and is just completely on you know unafraid of the position uh butari is a human and he thought that after this he would have two hanging things that he could capture which is why he did that Magnus immediately jumps in and the Knight has arrived the night is pressuring everything in the position Queen H4 Roo G8 Magnus blocks against the attack boom Knight drops back Rook D6 Rook H6 orientari has a trapped Queen E5 Rook H6 and it is an obliteration Rook takes G2 but before you play Rook takes G2 you have to take the queen our antari resigns Magnus wins again in the arm again so outstanding folks Before you depart this recap I would like to give you an update about Fabiano caruana Fabiano Corona in this game had the black pieces versus and he played the Berlin Fabiano caruana is the leader of Norway chess we have to cover his games yesterday he overpressed a bit and he lost Bishop C5 DC this is called an ante Berlin Bobby plays Bishop E6 plays Bishop around to H5 it's a F6 this is the position very closed eight pawns each what now Fabiano also continues rotating his Knight he still will refuse to commit his King and now he plays G5 and Fabi brings the fight to knows you're back eight pawns each the utmost of closed positions not your back plays Knight to E2 it's still completely unclear what's going on I feel like these pieces are just playing twister you ever play that game Bishop F7 okay but now this is a very clear indication of hostilities by Fabiano Fabiano is trying to win this game Fabiano caruana is trying to extend his lead in the tournament and Fabiano caruana is trying to retake number two in the world and watch Hikaru away from that spot take take not only is the position closed all eight pawns are standing on their home squares like on their home ranks A4 H4 A5 B5 keeping that sign closed A6 now both sides have been thwarted Bishop doesn't see any Targets now we have the following position now D4 very tense moment what is going to happen is the pawn going to take the pawn is the pawn gonna take the pawn is the pun gonna push is the pawn gonna take is the punk gonna take is the punk gonna push what is gonna happen Fabi says you make the decision this is the point going what do you want to eat for dinner you want Thai you want Mexican you want uh Pizza in this response saying you choose I don't care now faced with the decision of Thai pizza and Mexican food or the counter option of I don't care you choose white responds I don't care you choose now black has the option of Thai Pizza forgot the other one Thai Pizza what did I say oh my God live streamer brain maybe I'll remember it by the end I said Thai pizza oh my God this is so frustrating I feel like you're gonna just be yelling at me at home all right we're just gonna move on and I'm gonna watch the replay and then I'm gonna remember King f8 King G7 this is ridiculous this is the it's like a staring contest nobody's moving Queen F2 the entire game is just going on Queen C7 now that sees that so you probably have to go B4 nope now B4 bro this is staring at that which is staring at that which is staring at that which is staring at that which is staring at that this is ridiculous nobody I mean the the tension of the pawns is killing me finally Queen E7 now it's back to the tension it's back to the maneuvering not your back takes Fabi takes pressure here again all close positions Pawn breaks Pawn breaks and maneuvering pair of Rooks has been traded what's gonna happen in the long run here can the bishop get to these pawns can this bishop get to these pawns probably this is a draw but we're gonna oh not your back is counter-attacking he's attacking on this side but this could soften up these pawns Bishop B6 and Knight F7 H4 oh poking prodding Queen h8 H5 the pawn is snuck through but it's still equal is looking for some sort of Rook H1 Queen H6 King F2 he's bringing his King but not Fabiano rips up in the position again Bishop E3 the queen goes back to h8 Pawn takes G4 you can take it but probably rotates the queen infiltrating on C2 and giving the bishop a little bit of backup to the G4 Pawn he takes and now the bishop plays Bishop H3 simultaneously creating an opening for two pieces on the G4 Square the king slides out of the way now infiltrates the queen and he takes only four is the position disintegrating or is Fabiano's King in danger on the H7 Square Knight to E3 Knight takes H6 played now Rook G1 and bringing the Rook back is the right decision but instead but can't resist he takes on C4 but now King G7 deflecting the King backwards Queen H6 and the Knight comes back when the dust settles it's Fabiano caruana up two ponds and it is Fabiano caruana marching the pawns forward F3 check white resigns in view of Quinta F4 Bobby just one with black not only did Fabi just win with black Fabiano caruana leads with 13 and a half up two and a half points on Hikaru who is up two and a half points on alireza it is the Fabi and kikaru show in Norway and I don't even think they've played each other but to be honest they might have played each other and I just forgot uh but I don't even think they've played each other because I already forgot what I said there Hikaru is now no longer world number two he's down to world number three very close race with alireza Norway chess is heating up and Magnus Carlson tied for sixth and seventh place out of ten shocking half a point out of eighth what's gonna happen in the next few rounds we better find out get out of here
