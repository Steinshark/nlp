if you don't know a marathon is 26 miles and today with no prior training we're going to attempt it with the world's largest pair of shoes you want to compare them wow look at the difference there yeah they already do so the marathon has started i don't like this i don't either feel free to pass us you're doing the whole marathon like that wow we technically haven't even passed the start line yet we're actually negative into the race what happened to trailer we haven't even got through the start line and he's quit and it has officially begun there it is we did it everybody's already passed us or being left behind look slow and steady wins the race a marathon is one of the hardest feats any human could attempt space travel i said one this is 26 miles which is a lot people trained for these for like a long time i got four hours of sleep and i ate a hot dog each of these shoes weighs five pounds that's 10 pounds in total that's my child on my feet now you know what your wife has to carry all day how far are we eighth of a mile eighth of a mile take it what happened to chandler these shoes suck they hurt my ankles my feet 26 miles doing this i'm miserable buddy what took so long my shoes don't fit they're size 40. i don't know if chad was cut out for the size 40 marathon some men can't handle the size 40. i think she's the final person now we are officially in last place yeah and it's us every time i think he quits he comes back he threw his shoes does that mean you're done i think he survived half a mile he made it a lot farther than we thought and we're proud of them can you uh not throw your shoes and quit on me no promises okay we're already so far behind that we have to go on the sidewalk because they're about to open up the first part of the road aka we're going too slow now find that beat there it is one of our friends is running the marathon normally this guy carl i'm gonna call him and see how far ahead he is hey what's up how's everything going for you how do your shoes that don't weigh 10 pounds feel i didn't even remember i hate you bye just talked to jimmy i'm going to go ahead and do the marathon on my own with regular boys shoes and see how much faster i can get to the finish line than them we're going to do this 100 reel so in between each cut we're going to try our best to time lapse everything we're not like normal youtubers who just fake stuff time lapse [Music] we have crossed one mile out of 26. we're gonna take a quick break all right i need help since chandler quit we called in help from our friend tyler from this video we need you to put on his shoes and join us do you have multiple days free it's going to take days yeah maybe help me up it's hard to stand up oh this feels weird how's it going what's up so you're going
