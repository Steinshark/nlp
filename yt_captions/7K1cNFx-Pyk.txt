all right hey give up sooner by boot. deev by the way if you don't know this is technically sponsored it's sponsored by me because I am now writing courses for boot dodev boot dodev prime boot. prime support me support yourself become a better developer snap that was a great that was a great ad read by the way okay Lane wrote this for me to read because he was like yo yo this is your chance let's do this what's the link boot. dprime boot. deprime all right as a develop let's see as a developer how many times each day do you look at something or do you look something up online I'm not talking about simple piece of syntax I'm talking about things that are a bit harder to find for example is there a good way to compile C to web assembly and run it in a browser without needing to modify code itself can the stripe UI export promotion code redemptions as a CSV is there a good tool for hot module reloading in go is it socially acceptable to go out in public in South Dakota with blue hair okay I lost a bet and I have blue hair and I live in South Dakota this article has been personally written to offend me I did not know that this was a thing Lane gosh dang Lane coming at me like that while work dude that's it's not socially acceptable for those that are wondering while working as a team lead a few years ago I remember asking Jeffy a developer on my team is there a way to get sqlc to use pointers for gullible columns instead of SQL do null types Jeffy went heads down for much longer than I would have expected after more than a full day of research he came back no there isn't a way I found something that seemed promising but it doesn't work I think I should Fork the project and add it ourselves I know this is shots fired by the way interesting interesting now hold up I'd hold up hold up I've got some questions first you're telling me that you found what we want in an API of a well-known open source project but it's broken and no one else knows what that it is broken but you you are confident there aren't any skill issues involved there's a lot of I would assume there's skill issues involved second you're telling me that you recommend course of action is for your your team of four to Fork a project with many thousands of lines of code and maintain our own version at infinitum by the way love the ad infinite that's one of my favorite phrases of all time uh all for a little quality of life Improvement Zoom it out a little bit so we can just see this and do you think a little typ safe squeal is supposed to make me happy it's not also Prince The Princess Bride is just like it's one of the best movies of all time all right no Jeffy no he you call you call that a mustache sir uh what was what was jeffy's problem counterintuitively I believe jeffy's problem was that he didn't know when to give up I don't mean on the task as a whole I mean on each individual path he uh he was taking to find the answer here's a chart Jeffy solution Jeffy was too attached to his initial searching methods maybe he was too attracted to one page from the docs uh to his initial search query or to Google as a search me mechanism altogether Jeffy found a local maximum and became stuck he should have bailed so much sooner and tried looking elsewhere dude this is a this is an amazing advice by the way this is advice I need to hear even regularly like learning when to slow down and rethink dude it's so easy to fall into this if you're if if you're building things actively you fall into this continuously local Ma is the best metaphor I've heard yeah if I don't find good evidence that the answer I'm looking for exists in the place I'm searching I'm bailing Pronto that doesn't mean I'm 100% certain it doesn't exist but you usually don't have to read an entire stack Overflow thread to know whether or not it relates to your problem fair fair J Jeffy I'm honestly amazed at how some developers take so long to look stuff up now in their defense if you're even an efficient Searcher you can still get stuck in a quagmire a local Maxima uh if you're not careful you can find yourself reading on and on about a topic that seems like exactly what you're looking for only for it to skim over the details that you actually need bummer oh man oh man I'm a big fan of using AI as a replacement for some uh of my wouldbe Google searches but chat GPT is the ultimate Quagmire that is the ultimate local maximum it's the worst kind of Quagmire because at every step it confidently reassures you that it doesn't fact no the answer when you insist that it's wrong it confidently continues to provide information that it sounds correct but it isn't it is that is a qu that that is a quagmire I love the term Quagmire by the way I love I love this uh if you use chat GPT or chat jippy sorry sorry my bad on that one uh for programming assistant uh you need to develop a strong sense of when chat jippy is making stuff up in short you need to know when to bail read the friendly manual sometimes we talk about Googling things a skill onto itself and it kind of is but similar to chat GPT it's less about formulating the most pristine search query it's more about knowing when to give up on a goose chase does the sep indicate that your original search query was a good one no bail does the first page uh you visit have directly relevant title or first paragraph no bail after spending another minute on the page are you convinced the answer is somewhere below no bail it is likely that the answer can be found more easily in the docs the user manual or gasp the code itself yes bail I actually do like looking at code as a means to understand what's happening I actually do like this I think it's a really good way to kind of understand some things uh reading the manual uh perusing the official docs and digging through the source code usually takes longer than skimming an on-topic article or t tutorial but SEO spammed articles often coales into an entire sea of local Maxima they tease you by scratching the surface of what you're looking for but if you but if your issue isn't the most common one you can waste hours trudging through garbage sometimes taking the time to go deep into the topic is the fastest only way to find answers to a more esoteric questions damn damn Lane this is a good article Lane this is a good article lane lane this is a good article hey retire in progress thanks for the raid yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you are you doing good back to Jeffy I don't want to leave you hanging on this story as it turned out the documentation for sqlc was complete but it was tricky to understand how to use pointers for nullable columns if you landed on the wrong page there are a lot of configuration options for sqlc and it it is easy to get lost I cloned the repo grip for pointer found the code that parched the configuration option it was clear after a few minutes of reading the source that we just needed to do three things specify the go type we want string instead of string null string set nullable to True set pointer to true here's the code sometimes you got to read the friendly manual sometimes you got to suck it up and GP The Code by the way sqlc is awesome and if you like a go you should be aware of it I've been using sqlx um this is great though sometimes you got to suck it up and grip the code this is great this is great advice right here this I don't even know how to descri this this whole article is just one great piece of advice through and through by the way this is why I love boot. deev okay if you're wondering where the love comes from hopefully you understand okay the name not biased at all I'm not biased at all I'm just say I'm not biased okay my name is not the bias aen okay it's clearly objective love for boot doev and and it just happens to to to align with you getting better at backend development than me getting paid for that okay so just saying that's real # add # suck it # boot dodev SL prime a j
