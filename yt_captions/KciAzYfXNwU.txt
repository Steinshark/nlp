On August 14, 2003, a cascading failure of 
the power grid plunged more than 50 million   people into darkness in the northeast US 
and Canada. It was the most significant   power outage ever in North America, with an 
economic impact north of ten billion dollars.   Calamities like this don’t happen in a bubble, and 
there were many human factors, political aspects,   and organizational issues that contributed to the 
blackout. But, this is an engineering channel,   and a bilateral task force of energy experts 
from the US and Canada produced this in-depth   240-page report on all of the technical causes of 
the event that I’ll try to summarize here. Even   though this is kind of an older story, and many of 
the tough lessons have already been learned, it’s   still a nice case study to explore a few of the 
more complicated and nuanced aspects of operating   the electric grid, essentially one of the 
world’s largest machines. I’m Grady, and this is   Practical Engineering. In today’s episode, we’re 
talking about the Northeast Blackout of 2003. Nearly every aspect of modern society 
depends on a reliable supply of electricity,   and maintaining this reliability is an enormous 
technical challenge. I have a whole series of   videos on the basics of the power grid 
if you want to keep learning after this,   but I’ll summarize a few things here. And 
just a note before we get too much further,   when I say “the grid” in this video, I’m really 
talking about the Eastern Interconnection   that serves the eastern two-thirds of the 
continental US plus most of eastern Canada. There are two big considerations to keep in mind 
concerning the management of the power grid. One:   supply and demand must be kept in balance 
in real-time. Storage of bulk electricity   is nearly non-existent, so generation has to 
be ramped up or down to follow the changes in   electricity demands. Two: In general, you can’t 
control the flow of electric current on the grid.   It flows freely along all available paths, 
depending on relatively simple physical laws.   When a power provider agrees to send electricity 
to a power buyer, it simply increases the amount   of generation while the buyer decreases their 
own production or increases their usage.   This changes the flow of power along all the 
transmission lines that connect the two. Each   change in generation and demand has effects on the 
entire system, some of which can be unanticipated. Finally, we should summarize how the 
grid is managed. Each individual grid   is an interconnected network of power generators, 
transmission operators, retail energy providers,   and consumers. All these separate entities need 
guidance and control to keep things running   smoothly. Things have changed somewhat 
since 2003, but at the time, the North   American Electric Reliability Council (or NERC) 
oversaw ten regional reliability councils who   operated the grid to keep generation and demands 
in balance, monitored flows over transmission   lines to keep them from overloading, prepared 
for emergencies, and made long-term plans to   ensure that bulk power infrastructure would keep 
up with growth and changes across North America.   In addition to the regional councils, there were 
smaller reliability coordinators who performed   the day-to-day grid management and oversaw 
each control area within their boundaries. August 14th was a warm summer day that started out 
fairly ordinarily in the northeastern US. However,   even before any major outages began, conditions 
on the electric grid, especially in northern   Ohio and eastern Michigan were slowly degrading. 
Temperatures weren’t unusual, but they were high,   leading to an increase in electrical 
demands from air conditioning. In addition,   several generators in the area weren’t available 
due to forced outages. Again, not unusual. The   Midwest Independent System Operator (or MISO), the 
area’s reliability coordinator, took all this into   account in their forecasts and determined that 
the system was in the green and could be operated   safely. But, three relatively innocuous events set 
the stage for what would follow that afternoon. The first was a series of transmission 
line outages outside of MISO’s area.   Reliability coordinators receive lots 
of real-time data about the voltages,   frequencies, and phase angles at key locations 
on the grid. There’s a lot that raw data can   tell you, but there’s also a lot of things it 
can’t. Measurements have errors, uncertainties,   and aren’t always perfectly synchronized with each 
other. So, grid managers often use a tool called   a state estimator to process all the real-time 
measurements from instruments across the grid   and convert them into the likely state of the 
electrical network at a single point in time,   with all the voltages, current flows, and 
phase angles at each connection point. That   state estimation is then used to feed displays 
and make important decisions about the grid. But, on August 14th, MISO’s state estimator 
was having some problems. More specifically,   it couldn’t converge on a solution. 
The state estimator was saying,   “Sorry. All the data that you’re feeding me 
just isn't making sense. I can’t find a state   that matches all the inputs.” And the reason 
it was saying this is that twice that day,   a transmission line outside MISO’s area had 
tripped offline, and the state estimator   didn’t have an automatic link to that information. 
Instead it had to be entered manually,   and it took a bunch of phone calls and 
troubleshooting to realize this in both   cases. So, starting around noon, MISO’s 
state estimator was effectively offline. Here’s why that matters: The state estimator feeds 
into another tool called a Real-Time Contingency   Analysis or RTCA that takes the estimated 
state and does a variety of “what ifs.”   What would happen if this generator tripped? 
What would happen if this transmission line went   offline? What would happen if the load increased 
over here? Contingency analysis is critical   because you have to stay ahead of the game when 
operating the grid. NERC guidelines require   that each control area manage its network to avoid 
cascading outages. That means you have to be okay,   even during the most severe single contingency, 
for example, the loss of a single transmission   line or generator unit. Things on the grid are 
always changing, and you don’t always know what   the most severe contingency would be. So, the 
main way to ensure that you’re operating within   the guidelines at any point in time is to run 
simulations of those contingencies to make sure   the grid would survive. And MISO’s RTCA tool, 
which was usually run after every major change   in grid conditions (sometimes several times per 
day), was offline on August 14th up until around   2 minutes before the start of the cascade. That 
means they couldn’t see their vulnerability to   outages, and they couldn’t issue warnings to their 
control area operators, including FirstEnergy,   the operator of a control area in northern 
Ohio including Toledo, Akron, and Cleveland. That afternoon, FirstEnergy was struggling to 
maintain adequate voltage within their area. All   those air conditioners use induction motors that 
spin a magnetic field using coils of wire inside.   Inductive loads do a funny thing to the power on 
the grid. Some of the electricity used to create   the magnetic field isn’t actually consumed, 
but just stored momentarily and then returned   to the grid each time the current switches 
direction (that’s 120 times per second in the   US). This causes the current to lag behind the 
voltage, reducing its ability to perform work.   It also reduces the efficiency of all the 
conductors and equipment powering the grid   because more electricity has to be supplied than 
is actually being used. This concept is kind of   deep in the weeds of electrical engineering, 
but we normally simplify things by dividing   bulk power into two parts: real power (measured 
in Watts) and reactive power (measured in var).   On hot summer days, grid operators need more 
reactive power to balance the increased inductive   loads on the system caused by millions of 
air conditioners running simultaneously. Real power can travel long distances on 
transmission lines, but it’s not economical to   import reactive power from far away because 
transmission lines have their own inductance that   consumes the reactive power as it travels along 
them. With only a few running generators within   the Cleveland area, FirstEnergy was importing a 
lot of real power from other areas to the south,   but voltages were still getting low on their part 
of the grid because there wasn’t enough reactive   power to go around. Capacitor banks are often used 
to help bring current and voltage back into sync,   providing reactive power. However, at least 
four of FirstEnergy’s capacitor banks were   out of service on the 14th. Another option 
is to over-excite the generators at nearby   power plants so that they create more reactive 
power, and that’s just what FirstEnergy did. At the Eastlake coal-fired plant on Lake Erie, 
operators pushed the number 5 unit to its limit,   trying to get as much reactive 
power as they could. Unfortunately,   they pushed it a little too hard. 
At around 1:30 in the afternoon,   its internal protection circuit tripped and 
the unit was kicked offline - the second key   event preceding the blackout. Without this 
critical generator, the Cleveland area would   have to import even more power from the rest 
of the grid, putting strain on transmission   lines and giving operators less flexibility 
to keep voltage within reasonable levels. Finally, at around 2:15, FirstEnergy’s control 
room started experiencing a series of computer   failures. The first thing to go was the alarm 
system designed to notify operators when equipment   had problems. This probably doesn’t need to be 
said, but alarms are important in grid operations.   People in the control room don’t just sit and 
watch the voltage and current levels as they move   up and down over the course of a day. Their 
entire workflow is based on alarms that show   up as on-screen or printed notifications so 
they can respond. All the data was coming in,   but the system designed to get an operator’s 
attention was stuck in an infinite loop. The   FirstEnergy operators were essentially driving on 
a long country highway with their fuel gauge stuck   on “full,” not realizing they were nearly out of 
gas. With MISO’s state estimator out of service,   Eastlake 5 offline, and FirstEnergy’s 
control room computers failing,   the grid in northern Ohio was operating on the 
bleeding edge of the reliability standards,   leaving it vulnerable to further contingencies. 
And the afternoon was just getting started. I’ll show the next events on this map of the 
highest voltage transmission network around   Cleveland and Akron. These are only the 345 kV 
lines, but there are lower voltage transmission   lines in the area as well. Transmission lines heat 
up as they carry more current due to resistive   losses, and that is exacerbated on still, hot 
days when there’s no wind to cool them off. As   they heat up, they expand in length and sag lower 
to the ground between each tower. At around 3:00,   as the temperatures rose and the power demands 
of Cleveland did too, the Harding-Chamberlin   transmission line (a key asset for importing power 
to the area) sagged into a tree limb, creating a   short-circuit. The relays monitoring current 
on the line recognized the fault immediately   and tripped it offline. Operators in the 
FirstEnergy control room had no idea it happened.   They started getting phone calls from customers 
and power plants saying voltages were low,   but they discounted the information because 
it couldn’t be corroborated on their end.   By this time their IT staff knew about 
the computer issues, but they hadn’t   communicated them to the operators, who 
had no clue their alarm system was down. With the loss of Harding-Chamberlin, the remaining 
transmission lines into the Cleveland area   took up the slack. The current on one line, the 
Hanna-Juniper, jumped from around 70% up to 88%   of its rated capacity, and it was heating 
up. About half an hour after the first fault,   the Hanna-Juniper line sagged into a tree, 
short circuited, and tripped offline as well.   The FirstEnergy IT staff were troubleshooting 
the computer issues, but still hadn’t notified   the control room operators. The staff at MISO, 
the reliability coordinator, with their state   estimator issues, were also behind on realizing 
the occurrence and consequences of these outages. FirstEnergy operators were now getting phone 
call after phone call, asking about the situation   while being figuratively in the dark. Call 
transcripts from that day tell a scary story. “[The meter on the main transformer] is bouncing 
around pretty good. I’ve got it relay tripped up   here…so I know something ain't right,” said 
one operator at a nearby nuclear power plant. A little later he called back: “I’m 
still getting a lot of voltage spikes   and swings on the generator… I don’t know 
how much longer we’re going to survive.” A minute later he calls again: “It’s 
not looking good… We aint going to   be here much longer and you’re 
going to have a bigger problem.” An operator in the FirstEnergy 
control room replied: “Nothing   seems to be updating on the computers. I 
think we’ve got something seriously sick.” With two key transmission lines out of service, 
a major portion of the electricity powering the   Cleveland area had to find a new path into 
the city. Some of it was pushed onto the less   efficient 138 kV system, but much of it was 
being carried by the Star-South Canton line   which was now carrying more than its rated 
capacity. At 3:40, a short ten minutes after   losing Hanna-Juniper, the Star-South Canton line 
tripped offline when it too sagged into a tree   and short-circuited. It was actually the third 
time that day the line had tripped, but it was   equipped with circuit breakers called reclosers 
that would energize the line automatically if the   fault had cleared. But, the third time was the 
charm, and Star-South Canton tripped and locked   out. Of course, FirstEnergy didn’t know about the 
first two trips because they didn’t see an alarm,   and they didn’t know about this one either. They 
had started sending crews out to substations to   get boots on the ground and try to get a handle on 
the situation, but at that point, it was too late. With Star-South Canton offline, flows in the lower 
capacity 138 kV lines into Cleveland increased   significantly. It didn’t take long before they too 
started tripping offline one after another. Over   the next half hour, sixteen 138 kV transmission 
lines faulted, all from sagging low enough to   contact something below the line. At this point, 
voltages had dropped low enough that some of the   load in northern Ohio had been disconnected, but 
not all of it. The last remaining 345 kV line into   Cleveland from the south came from the Sammis 
Power Plant. The sudden changes in current flow   through the system now had this line operating 
at 120% of its rated capacity. Seeing such an   abnormal and sudden rise in current, the relays 
on the Star-Sammis line assumed that a fault had   occurred and tripped the last remaining major 
link to the Cleveland area offline at 4:05 PM,   only an hour after the first incident. After 
that, the rest of the system unraveled. With no remaining connections to 
the Cleveland area from the south,   bulk power coursing through the grid tried 
to find a new path into this urban center.  First overloads progressed northward into 
Michigan, tripping lines and further separating   areas of the grid. Then the area was cut off to 
the east. With no way to reach Cleveland, Toledo,   or Detroit from the south, west, or north, a 
massive power surge flowed east into Pennsylvania,   New York, and then Ontario in a counter-clockwise 
path around Lake Erie, creating a major reversal   of power flow in the grid. All along the way, 
relays meant to protect equipment from damage saw   these unusual changes in power flows as faults and 
tripped transmission lines and generators offline Relays are sophisticated instruments 
that monitor the grid for faults   and trigger circuit breakers when one is 
detected. Most relaying systems are built   with levels of redundancy so that lines 
will still be isolated during a fault,   even if one or more relays malfunction. 
One type of redundancy is remote backup,   where separate relays have overlapping zones 
of protection. If the closest relay to the   fault (called Zone 1) doesn’t trip, the next 
closest relay will see the fault in its Zone   2 and activate the breakers. Many relays have a 
Zone 3 that monitors even farther along the line. When you have a limited set of information, it 
can be pretty hard to know whether a piece of   equipment is experiencing a fault and should be 
disconnected from the grid to avoid further damage   or just experiencing an unusual set of 
circumstances that protection engineers may   not have anticipated. That’s especially true 
when the fault is far away from where you’re   taking measurements. The vast majority of lines 
that went offline in the cascade were tripped by   Zone 3 relays. That means the Zone 1 and 2 relays, 
for the most part, saw the changes in current and   voltage on the lines and didn’t trip because 
they didn’t fall outside of what was considered   normal. However, the Zone 3 relays - being less 
able to discriminate between faults and unusual   but non-damaging conditions - shut them down. 
Once the dominos started falling in the Ohio area,   it took only about 3 minutes for a 
massive swath of transmission lines,   generators, and transformers to trip offline. 
Everything happened so fast that operators had   no opportunity to implement interventions 
that could have mitigated the cascade. Eventually enough lines tripped that the outage 
area became an electrical island separated from   the rest of the Eastern Interconnection. But, 
since generation wasn’t balanced with demands,   the frequency of power within the island was 
completely unstable, and the whole area quickly   collapsed. In addition to all of the transmission 
lines, at least 265 power plants with more than   508 generating units shut down. When it was 
all over, much of the northeastern United   States and the Canadian province of Ontario were 
completely in the dark. Since there were very few   actual faults during the cascade, reenergizing 
happened relatively quickly in most places.   Large portions of the affected area had 
power back on before the end of the day.   Only a few places in New York and Toronto 
took more than a day to have power restored,   but still the impacts were tremendous. 
More than 50 million people were affected.   Water systems lost pressure forcing boil-water 
notices. Cell service was interrupted. All the   traffic lights were down. It’s estimated that 
the blackout contributed to nearly 100 deaths. Three trees and a computer bug caused a major 
part of North America to completely grind to   a halt. If that’s not a good example 
of the complexity of the power grid,   I don’t know what is. If you asked anyone 
working in the power industry on August 13,   whether the entire northeast US and Canada 
would suffer a catastrophic loss of service   the next day, they would have said no way. 
People understood the fragility of the grid,   and there were even experts sounding alarms about 
the impacts of deregulation and the vulnerability   of transmission networks, but this was not some 
big storm. It wasn’t even a peak summer day.   It was just a series of minor contingencies that 
all lined up just right to create a catastrophe. Today’s power grid is quite different than 
it was in 2003. The bilateral report made   46 recommendations about how to improve operations 
and infrastructure to prevent a similar tragedy in   the future, many of which have been implemented 
over the past nearly 20 years. But, it doesn’t   mean there aren’t challenges and fragilities in 
our power infrastructure today. Current trends   include more extreme weather, changes in the 
energy portfolio as we move toward more variable   sources of generation like wind and solar, growing 
electrical demands, and increasing communications   between loads, generators, and grid controllers. 
Just a year ago, Texas saw a major outage related   to extreme weather and the strong nexus between 
natural gas and electricity. I have a video on   that event if you want to take a look after this. 
I think the 2003 blackout highlights the intricacy   and interconnectedness of this critical resource 
we depend on, and I hope it helps you appreciate   the engineering behind it. Thank you for 
watching and let me know what you think.
