ladies and gentlemen it is over it's over we have a champion and we have two more players added to the candidates tournament which will happen in 2024 in Toronto in Canada the candidates tournament will Crown who will be the next Challenger to the World Chess Championship against ding Len going into today's Final Round of action we have three people at the top hikaro Nakamura vidit GTI and Andrea seeno and only the next three people in line can knock them down and those people are Vincent kimer we've got Anish giri and we've got Alexander prka and arjin ERI this is the final round of action at the fiday Grand Swiss 2023 and after it I will tell you every everybody that made it who else can make it who else can't make it and if you've been wondering why Magnus Carlson is not playing in this tournament it's because he doesn't want to that that that's the whole reason so that's all that's all I've got for you today the final round of the grand Swiss 2023 begins right now Arjun arayi playing against hiar Kamura Arjun has seven points hikaro has 7 and a half Arjun has to win that's the only way he's going to make it in he plays E4 and Hikaru who normally is an E4 E5 player and will frequently play the Berlin or frequently play the Italian plays the Sicilian Defense this man is playing with the black pieces he is half a point away in first and he's not looking to kill the game this is giga Chad Behavior also that was my Discord I apologize for some reason it was not on streamer mode and that is normally activated when I am doing these recordings so you probably all thought it was your Discord it was my Discord I do apologize I'm actually making the thumbnail for this video right now so shout out to Jojo the thumbnail man um Knight F3 Knight C6 and Hikaru plays the kalashnik of Sicilian which by the way have the coolest name in all of Chess like you're playing a Kalashnikov that's pretty cool kalashnik of Sicilian is kind of like a sveshnikov which is this but it immediately looks to attack the Knight so this and this are not yet committed and after Knight to B5 hikaro plays D6 otherwise the Knight would have gone there now here normally white plays Knight C3 and then after A6 there's a very very high chance that the position transposes to a sveshnikov after Knight to F6 and then white can play like Bishop to G5 B5 Knight D5 and now we are just in a sveshnikov however arjin Eric iy plays this move which is a move that I have literally never seen and it is almost never played and it looks really stupid be but the idea is actually pretty straightforward um it it's just it's just the same position so like Knight 1 A3 and then this move order is the same thing if the Knight went there so I I've just never seen that particular move order but you know most people just play Knight C3 uh but uh you get the exact same position uh regardless it's the exact same position it's just a different Knight going to a square anyway uh instead of playing Knight F6 hikaro plays Bishop E6 so this is not a sveshnikov this is a Kalashnikov and hikaro is delaying the development of this Knight and he is going to develop his Queen side first with B5 and Rook C8 every gu see plays Knight C4 hikaro plays Knight F6 now and the difference is that this is already here that's a very very big difference very big difference uh normally white plays Knight D5 this Knight is hanging out on A3 for a while now Arjun plays A4 A4 stops hikaro from playing B5 so he plays Rook C8 and uh arjent plays Bishop G5 trying to remove the knight from the defense of the D5 Square which arjin would like to plant something on and hikaro plays Knight B4 you will notice that Arjun spending all this time A4 is a massive commitment that is a huge commitment and now Karo controls the B4 Square so he is going to put his Knight there and that is going to fight for that square and that is also going to open up the pressure by the rug and that is also going to pressure the Knight of the Pawn on C2 so arjin clearly not in the most comfortable situation and down 26 minutes on the clock early meanwhile hikaro just doing his thing Bishop E7 developing the Bishops Bishop to E2 arjin now down 37 minutes on the clock hikaro plays Knight G4 he's not even thinking he is not even thinking and at this point this was described by the commentators as the best Kalashnikov Sicilian Defense in human history which is a crazy thing so basically this move is so committal so early that generally white is able to exploit the D5 square and the pawn on D6 if played the best way right but like the best way generally in chess black is still able to equalize but that is generally the consensus now um you know uh this is uh not what happened in this game in this game Hikaru dropped both of his Knights out this got a brilliant move it really shouldn't but the idea of Knight to G4 is that if you take the Knight black goes here and then black just gets the bishop black gets the F5 black has good attacking chances instead of that uh no actually this is exactly what happens uh I thought um they they they could have entered this also like this bishop E7 and then Knight takes E3 it would have been a vug you take the queen I take your queen and if this white ends up with these goofy doubled pawns speaking of goofy doubled pawns Bishop takes Queen G4 Queen F6 hearo defends himself Arjun now down nearly one entire hour on the clock I think hikaro at this point was seen pacing outside uh because he was you know brimming with confidence hikaro castles and and Arjun now has to spend you know some time here to figure out how he's just not going to be worse so Hikaru undeveloped the queen and you know Karo at this point could consider Knight C6 and putting the Knight here can also try to put the queen on H6 to pressure the the the the Knight and try to play Rook F4 and Knight D4 but I mean look at hikaru's position he controls the only real open file that matter the pawn on D6 is weak and probably should be defended but you don't even have to defend it like you can take this is mate so that's not going to work right put the Knight on D4 now he goes back to E7 arjent plays Queen E2 now the Knight goes back to C6 and he puts it on D4 and I mean black position is just incredible like he he is arjin now has to trade and he car just does the very simple and straightforward Bishop takes he takes on E3 because Arjun can't take like this he would lose his Pawn so instead Arjun takes with his pawn and we have a big trade and these pawns do not impress anybody hikaro can also grab this Pawn but then there is maybe Rook C1 and queen B3 he just goes back and he says Arjun you're not going to beat me you're just not I mean you don't you don't have the you don't have the pieces you have these double dwns arjin doing his best I mean he's he's he's sliding he's pressuring but it's Hikaru who gets the Queens off the board it's a rook and night end game and they got seven pawns each Hikaru is good with the draw you know why he's good with the draw cuz he's guaranteed a candidate spot that's why Argent plays Rook C3 and hikaro just starts bringing his King there's other plans here you can try to reroute the Knight a little bit earlier there was a there was a plan that could have been played somewhere around here Yaro could have played Knight B8 and tried to put his Rook on C6 and then played Knight D6 Knight F6 with a queen on C7 like lot of lot of stuff you could do but uh hikaro plays it very simple and straightforward and uh this is just not enough material to beat one of the best players in the world actually right around here the computer was even saying black has like a minus point4 Advantage which in an end game is a big deal yeah hikaro just kept it very simple and uh traded the pawns played in the center and in this position Rook A6 is going to send us to an end game that would be a draw and that's it argent's chances are finished and now Hikaru awaits what happens in this game and what happens in this game now if vidit uh loses if an managers to beat yeno let's see what happens uh hikaro makes a draw so he has eight points if vidit wins and Yenko both win iaro doesn't make the candidates so all eyes are on those games you know what I mean he's got eight points but two guys can now get eight and a half and beat hikaro because only the top two will make it so Anish giri Andre yeno Andre needs to win Andre plays a Queen's Gambit declined now here's the thing you got to remember when it's move two you don't you you you know you're maybe playing for a win but you're also kind of happy to make a draw right like it it's weird cuz if you win at all costs if you play to win it all cost but then you lose could you have drawn right so he just plays we're just in an exchange Queen's Gambit declined Knight E2 and yeno plays C5 which is an aggressive move you actually notice a lot of time being spent by uh by a niche right because Bishop F5 is not a common move I mean more generally black goes here C6 Knight D Knight D7 maybe black plays for C5 but Bishop F5 is very provocative because white can go after this and then probably Andre wants to play B6 and just shake things up a little bit Knight E is the option chosen by uh Anish takes takes and uh he takes on D5 so yeno plays in a way where he's giving up a pawn he plays C5 DC Bishop C5 Knight takes D5 and that Bishop is hanging so yeno plays in a way where it's all prep 11 moves of deep prep he's Pawn down so he's he's going all in if giri cannot deal with the counterplay that's coming his way on the queen side his extra little stupid e- Pawn won't matter because he's not developed enough right so Knight takes F4 okay Pawn a queen takes Queen Rook takes e takes Knight D7 and heast just says uh Andre Andre you have Five Pawns I have six we have Rooks and Knight and Bishop so you're going to win this game Andre plays Knight F6 F3 H5 by Andre okay he's preventing G4 preventing G4 but uh I'm sorry isn't there just a pawn hanging on B7 yeah and he's car just two pawns up he's got six pawns and Dre has two ah four he's got four four math you YouTube you know YouTuber let me you know I'm going to drink a little matcha here so uh and uh plays Rook D4 creates counterplay Bish should B2 staying solid King F2 Rook B4 nice idea if Rook takes a takes Knight is hit this is hit Rook A2 Rook B2 would be very nice for black but Anish giri is not 1,200 he's like you know two and a half times that not exactly but we have a big trade and he's just better in a rook and night end game we just saw hikaro in a rook and night end game hikaro in a rook and night end game the pawns were identical they had Five Pawns each six pawns each this is just more for black uh for white and uh Andre does his best but my friends I think sadly this one has come to an end G takes F5 Andre could have tried to maybe take but he's he's just losing there is nothing to be done and I think he's going to be kicking himself a bit because this was just not the best opening choice I guess I mean it's very difficult for play to play for a win on demand especially against Anish giri who is very very very solid very very well prepared uh they all are but Anish you know he has a reputation of being like top three you know most prepared in the world I would say um and uh that's it the Run of Andre yeno is over and that means that if he loses which in this position he did he resigned that means all eyes are on videt guti vidit versus PR who will join hikaro vidit plays D4 D5 also just like the other game remember seven and a half for vidit seven for prka pratka plays DT C4 plays the Queen's gamut accepted Knight F3 Knight F6 this is the most solid approach why could play other things white could play E4 E3 on the other first few moves like this and Bishop takes C4 and this is a deep main line now white here can play Knight C3 B3 bring the bishop back voluntarily play Queen E2 Rook D1 I mean there are so many lines but white has another line and this is called the boring line and vidit takes on C5 and the boring line my friends just involves an early Queen trade so now it's an end game before the game even begins and I think the plan here by predka was make the game boring and potentially look to fight back in the end game Bishop E2 he put the King on E7 and then he put his Bishop on D7 and he brought his Bishop back and vidit went here now vidit struggling early out of the gate in terms of time 17 minutes down prka covering the threats just waiting for vid to come to him it's like this game like are you going to play for a win you going to play for a draw what are you going to do Bishop C3 now here an interesting move Rook here so that the pawn is protected so you can move the Knight vidit plays here both guys bring their Rooks and prka is the one playing for a win G5 wow so now Knight D4 getting out of the way of the pawn the Knight is hitting this which will allow the bishop to get to the B4 Square which will allow the the bishop to hit the king in fact you can play a vug in between move check look at that move if you just took on D4 here black would play Knight D5 hitting your bishop and stopping the check but you take on D4 that removes the defender of that square so I check your king now you move now I go here and white is a little bit better but it's still very tense now pra thinks for a while he could go here and then G4 but instead he plays G4 right away he should have played Knight D5 first because for example of Bishop A3 G4 and now Knight B3 trying to go here there is Bishop A4 which is a very curious idea if in the G see in the game Knight D5 did not happen Knight D4 happened and then G4 but but after Knight B3 now if you play Knight D5 I'm already too fast so there is you don't get to play Bishop A4 because I can take on D5 which defends this and removes the defender of that so he had to play that first because now he does it this way tries to bring his Rook to fight on the fifth rank Knight C5 from vidit Bishop C6 and vidit finds this nice Knight takes A6 look at that removing the defender of the bishop the Knight goes to D7 and vid plays this nice move Bishop F1 and it's not easy for black to make a move Rook A8 Bishop D6 you still can't take the Knight because of this very tense Knight C7 is about to happen Bishop A4 is apparently a losing blunder because white has this very symbol B3 for some reason vid did not like giving back the pawn even though apparently here he's like near plus two advantage on a on a high depth stockfish but instead of that he went here now black Stacks his Rooks Knight C7 check is possible and I think vid it like this because at the end of the sequence Knight C7 check there's a rook hanging but there's a rook hanging so here now there's a rook hanging here takes takes takes takes you can't take the pawn because Bishop B5 pins the Knight to the king so black has to go here now A4 you you can't take because Bishop B5 and my friends vidit is just up a pawn in an end game a Pure Clean Pawn non GMO Pawn Rook D4 allowing The Rook to infiltrate along the first rank but we defend ourselves and now we lash out with our Pawn this is a very calculated decision because he's going to lose a pawn with a check but his bravery is rewarded because after King to G2 the Knight moves the bishop escapes and vidit will win the pawn on B7 and that is so important because now his pawns will just go two connected furthermost outside pass pawns on the outskirts of the board black runs backwards the king is checked a few times he's not going to blunder a fork it doesn't even matter if he loses the Rook the pawn is queening Rook E5 Rook F5 and on the 47th move of the game has vidit hit his King in the corner Alexander prka resigned and not only did vidit qualify to the candidates tournament with this win he won the entire tournament the fiday grand Swiss 2023 is won by vidd GTI of India with eight and a half out of 11 second place Hikaru with eight out of 11 vidit lost the first round of the entire enre tournament then won seven out of his next 10 games this is his best tournament ever ever ever ever it's not close he's been waiting for a breakthrough for a long time vid's 1994 he's nearly 30 he's 28 29 years of age and he's been around 2720 2730 for the last couple of years this is his big moment and now we have two Indian players in the candidates for the first time ever we have prag Nando more on that later and a quick up update on the women's Side by sh rames Babu sister of prag Nanda and then after this I will give you an overall update of who else can make it to the candidates and what is at stake is playing against batag mul from Mongolia uh and um the only thing that can happen in this game for Vali is that she loses and even then she is guaranteed to win the event if she wins this game she becomes a Grandmas so a lot at stake and she plays like there is lot at stake look at her firing her kingside pawns away the queen takes the Knight on H4 and she gets a monster attacking position early but her opponent gets the Queens off and it's going to be kind of hard to win that but Vali is still in a very very strong position very active pieces she brings her Knight takes back with the King and puts the Knight square into the white position Rook to E2 black making progress for reasons I can't fully explain why sh did not like taking this Pawn it is a free Pawn though I think maybe Knight E4 counterattacking measures but she goes here and I mean white is still very very very much on the back foot but now she's starting to make a bit of a comeback E4 C6 and let's not let's not forget vashali already clinched the tournament so it's just about risk management but suddenly Here Comes white and this is very scary looking so black has to play defense and the players Shuffle their pieces back and forth there is not much that can be done here white plays Rook A2 and uh Black's not going to make any more progress the position is blocked there is still a bit to play for but white offers a draw and Vali wins she wins the tournament uh also with eight and a half out of 11 just like vidit she makes it to the candidates she was already guaranteed a spot she does not become a grand master she needs like four or five more rating points but this is the first time in his history a brother and a and a sister are playing in the open and the women's candidates this has happened before where siblings have played because the muzichuk sisters speaking of muzichuk there you go Anna muzichuk Maria muuk they have played in the women's candidates at the same time I believe uh but this is the first time it's been brother and sister open uh and uh same year and it's very very cool for India so if you're Indian you better be hyped about this and this is the final game to determine who is going to make it on the women's side uh p cramling you may know her as uh Stronger Master chess Legend and or Anna kling's Mom some of you might know Pia as Anna kling's mom and that's okay you haven't been following chess for you know her entire career which is some 20 30 years uh Anna musuk playing with the black side by the way we also have kind of a Queen's Gambit accepted just like in the vided game here very tense position but tough to break through and at some point the slides are going to clash and a lot of pieces are going to fly off the board and here we go here here the pie to start flying off the board and they're gone and they're gone and white is going to win the pawn back and this is a drawn end game that only black can play for a win because black has more pawns but it's very tough to win it because the kings are just too too advanced and whatever pawns you're going to get the other side's going to get a pawn as well Bishop takes E5 and uh now actually maybe only black can find a way to throw this if black you know accidentally like see King here G3 G 6 and King F6 is is a winning end game for white cuz this king is just stranded here so instead of any of that nonsense after King takes E5 the players agree to a draw Anam muzichuk gets second place just like Karu eight points and she also makes it to the candidates my friends before you go today here are your candidates yanish because he just played the World Chess Championship and was the runner up and the runner up does make it to the the candidates tournament again he also uh right yes yes two hiar Nakamura because he got second place in the grand Swiss vided G because he won the grand Swiss prag Nanda because he's a finalist in the World Cup now where it gets weird technically Magnus Carlson is on this list technically he's not instead it's going to number six ni abasov because Magnus does not want to play the candidates if he says he does n won't qualify it will be him Magnus and Fabiano Fabiano got third place at the World Cup by beating n so n gets a spot despite not earning a spot and that's because Magnus I mean not earning a spot I mean but he got fourth in the world cup so I don't know what magnus's deadline is like can he just show up the day of the cand be like no n just you just you just go go it's me I'm playing I I don't know I don't know what his deadline is I'm sure f is going to give him a deadline maybe he's already said he doesn't want to play I I you know he might change his mind I don't can he change his mind I don't know anyway the number one rated player in the world January 2024 right now that is on Pace to be alira fua because the others are Magnus Fabiano Hikaru dingl Ren dingl Ren cannot play the candidates because he's the World Champ Yan Hikaru Fabby all qualified and the fiday circuit winner the Fay circuit winner is it's a circuit of tournaments uh which qualify for leaderboard and if you play in enough of them and do well in enough of them you make it to the candidates at the moment the leaderboard uh number one is Fabiano but he already qualified then it's going to likely be Anish giri after this tournament because he got third got third in the grand Swiss so it's looking like it's going to be either gukesh or Anish giri but probably Anish giri probably but it's very close between those two if gukesh makes it 37.5 % of the candidates are going to be Indian which is crazy Anish giri looking to be the front runner right now crazy stuff so it's looking like the candidates will be everybody on this list plus Anish giri plus ala fua it's actually kind of like the weakest candidates or I saw somebody calculate something because uh average rating or whatever I I don't know but uh I'm excited I'm very excited and uh it's happening in Toronto uh in Spring of 2024 so if you're in Toronto I mean that's what they announced they might move it uh normally all Fay events are in like Russia Kazakhstan uh and all of these places but this would be the first candidates in North America in like 70 years or ever so exciting times appreciate you all very very much for covering uh for for following the tournament coverage alongside me uh back to regularly scheduled programming and um folks in London in the UK I will be there in November events
