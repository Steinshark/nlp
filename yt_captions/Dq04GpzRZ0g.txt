as i am writing this taiwan is suffering through one of its worst droughts in many years the northwestern part taipei new taipei city is generally fine there are enough reservoirs but other areas like tainan gaochon taitung and shinchu are having some issues their water infrastructure is not as resilient or their water demand is greater there are reports in the media of tsmc budgeting for millions of dollars to truck water down to its fabs in tainan ah and tsmc along with intel and a bunch of other companies are building fabs in arizona a land inundated with clean fresh drinking water the company and the industry as a whole has long had to deal with water usage issues at its facilities and the problem is only going to get worse as we progress forward we will continue but first i would like you to consider subscribing to the asian amateur newsletter the newsletter is a good companion to the channel i know that there's a lot of videos and the newsletter helps you read the best hits on your own time check out the newsletters for the full scripts as well as additional commentary after the fact you can find the link to the newsletter in the video description below or you can just go to asionometry.com as of right now you can expect a new newsletter every thursday at 1 am taiwan time much thanks when people think about water shortages they think about faster showers less flushing and the like and saving water in the home is important but water usage in the agricultural and industrial spaces far exceeds home residential usage and semiconductor manufacturing in particular uses a lot of it much of this water is for washing wafers thirty to forty percent of the steps in modern wafer fabrication involve some form of wafer cleaning for instance there is a step called wet cleaning where sequential wash steps are applied to remove organics metals and particles from the wafer between each of these washing steps water is used to rinse off the chemicals from the previous steps and semiconductor companies cannot use regular tap water out of your sink to wash these wafers too many particles that might damage the wafer instead they must use ultra pure water yes that is a real industry term ultra pure water is water it is used in various other applications like nuclear energy or chemical manufacturing but the cleanliness standards in the semiconductor industry are stricter than almost all the others in the industry they are trying to remove what are called killer particles particles large enough to affect a chip's nano architecture these can be microorganism waste organic particles dissolved metals gases and more as much as these as possible must be scrubbed out of the water it is a lot of work to generate and verify the purity of ultra pure water there are over a dozen steps and a number of those steps are repeated over many loops it takes about six thousand liters or one thousand six hundred gallons of city water to create three thousand eight hundred liters or one thousand gallons of ultra pure water and a single 200 millimeter or eight inch wafer can use over 5 600 liters or 2 000 gallons of ultra pure water the types of circuits made also affect water usage wafers are made in layers and as i mentioned earlier each time a layer is made it needs to be washed and cleaned before the next layer can be applied logic circuits like microprocessors have more layers and are more complex than other types of semiconductors such as memory ics display panels or solar panels thus their manufacturer requires more water and energy in 2020 tsmc noted in their corporate social responsibility report that they were not able to reach their water consumption goals set a few years back they had wanted to reduce the liters of water consumed per eight inch wafer equivalent layer by 27 percent they ended up just doing 5 the reasons for this are due to increased demands for process cleanliness in other words the more advanced the note process is the thirstier it tends to get it means more layers to wash more ultra pure water needed and more stringent standards for that ultra pure water with each new process node the threshold for something to become a killer particle gets a little smaller making it that much harder to scrub out so the cutting edge chips of today take more water to fab than they did 10 years earlier despite all the advances made in water reuse and conservation and it is likely the trend will continue we can't just only think about all the water coming in we also got to consider what is coming out these processes generate a lot of wastewater and much of it needs to be treated in 2013 tsmc's fabs in tainan generated 19 million tons of wastewater tainan and the entire city that same year generated 29 million tons wastewater left behind from this wet washing contains a high amount of pollutants like ammonia phosphate and fluoride there are studies of semiconductor workers getting cancer from exposure to these chemicals and not all wastewater is the same some of it needs more expensive and extensive treatments than others for instance ultraviolet light which is used for disinfection is relatively cheap but others like reverse electrodialysis where salt ions are transported through a membrane using the power of friendship cost substantially more so to properly deal with all these different types of wastewater large foundries separate the streams and give each one their own special treatment addressing over 25 chemicals in total some of the final treated water output is reusable meaning that you can put it back into the system at the very beginning and generate more ultra pure water with it but some of that water won't be reusable so it is most often put into the cooling tower where it is evaporated away to help maintain temperatures this helps control the environment within the massive fab the single biggest use of the facilities energy and water after direct manufacturing such a system is complicated and expensive so for many smaller companies it is more cost effective to simply aggregate the water broadly treat it and return it to the city once it meets minimum health and safety requirements they would then get new raw water from the city to process into ultra pure large fabs like tsmc samsung and intel have to implement these water reuse and recycling technologies because of their scale they have to make so many chips that without these water recycling techniques they would run out pretty quick this explains why tsmc's recycle rate in 2017 was 87 but per singapore study also done in 2017 the average semiconductor fab recycles less than half of that 42 in 2019 tsmc fabs in tainan alone consume 50 000 metric tons or 50 million liters of water a day sourcing all that raw water to be used is a challenge the area draws from the nan hua and zheng one reservoirs which as of right now are dangerously low in capacity and taiwan's south is also its agricultural heart which needs water to feed its population to keep from draining the area's water supply the company's fabs had to optimize their water draw and usage in addition to the water recycling technologies we talked about earlier the company builds a large rain collection system to capture rain water and store it in 700 ton tanks after running some checks the rain can be processed used for landscaping purposes or sent to the sewers meanwhile the company has signed tenders to build water reclamation plants near its fabs these would recycle industrial wastewater using reverse osmosis hollow fiber ultrafiltration sand filtration and more these procedures are kind of like singapore's new water the first facilities to come online are in tainan science park additional reclaimed water capacity is expected to arrive in the coming years from future plants in the yeongkong and unping areas of tainan considering all we have learned thus far arizona might seem a funny place to put a fab because as you might notice much of the state is a desert currently forty percent of total water demand is met by non-renewable groundwater the colorado river and other surface water sources 57 and reclaimed water provides the rest so basically where the colorado falls short the shortfalls get pulled out of the ground this is not quite sustainable for the most part the state government has managed to control water usage by transferring water away from the farms to the city agriculture devours the vast majority of water in the american southwest almost 90 percent of total demand in 1980 turning farmland into cities and suburbs over the years has helped curb overall water usage the state has attempted to come up with a coordinated plan for corralling water to man the results have come up dry and people are still pumping groundwater it is a concern so how does it make economic sense for a rational government to want to put a semiconductor fab there there are two prevailing reasons the first is that high volume semiconductor manufacturing is such a profitable and high value ad industry that the state is willing to take on the cost even if that means shelling out to build water infrastructure or taking someone else's allotment away the state gets paid a lot more for having foundries on its land than with other usages a 2012 paper compared the economic value of four land usages in the city of chandler arizona where the faps will be the four usages were high value semiconductor manufacturing industrial manufacturing single-story office buildings and retail they found that the economic benefits from semiconductor manufacturing outweigh the costs of providing the water governments get paid a lot more on a per acre basis with semiconductor manufacturing than with other land usages they are very much incentivized to bring these facilities here much of this revenue enters the state coffers through property taxation the industry brings less high-paying jobs on a per-acre basis than with other land usages it is likely due to the fact that most of the work is automated the second reason has to do with these water recycling and reuse technologies the industry is rich enough to be able to invest in water saving reusing and recycling techniques that means a high percentage of water far higher than with other land usages is theoretically returned to the wastewater system thus for the foundries themselves the other advantages that arizona provides a ready supply of educated talent tax incentives seismic stability among others win out over the simple lack of water high value semiconductor manufacturing is so valuable and profitable that governments are more likely to find water for it by taking away someone else's share usually a farmer's that's been the case in both taiwan and arizona where farmers are finding their water allocations cut and diverted to tech companies agriculture is the number one usage of water virtually everywhere there is an argument to be made that most agriculture as it is practiced is not an economically efficient use of precious water especially if it comes out of the ground but there are political consequences associated with doing this farmers in the united states for instance are some of the most valuable constituents around losing the farmers is a fast way to lose your reelection so governments have to strike that balance delicately the semiconductor industry's thirst will not abate moore's law will continue pushing ahead water recycling reduction techniques and reuse technologies have to keep up if not then at some point there is not going to be enough water to go around for everyone right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching if
