- We have 10 grand and
some really hot peppers. Let's see who wants the 10 grand. - There they are, right there. There's the lucky people. - So these are the first
random people we bumped into. So we have 10 grand and
a really hot pepper, if anyone wants to eat it. - Wait, do you have to eat the whole thing or just take a bite? - I mean, like at least half of it. It's a ghost pepper though. - Wait, that's for real. If we both eat half, can we split it? - Sure. - Do you want to?
- It's up to you. - All right. - Dude, it's like incredibly hot. Half and half. There you go, five grand each, you wanna do it?
- Yeah! - All right, on my count, ready? Three, two, one. Oh, she's doing it. - Oh no, you don't have to eat the tip. You good? - Do I have to try this again? - Yeah, go for it. - Oh, dear God. - Is it spicy? - I feel like if I say no,
it's gonna hit me in the face. - Wow, she ate that quick. So yeah, those weren't real. But here's five grand
and here's five grand. Normal YouTubers would make
them eat ghost peppers, but we don't like torturing people. I mean, I do like torturing people, but not that much torturing people. All right, let's go harass other people. So we don't have any more money, so now we're just gonna
use a check for $10,000. Whoever wins will write their name in, and I see people over
there, let's go do it. I have a check for 10
grand and a ghost pepper, if you eat it. - Is it really that bad? - Yeah, it's literally the
hottest pepper in the world. - On a scale of one to the
hottest, it's the hottest. - [Participant In Black Shirt]
But like, $10,000, dude. - Oh my god. - Come on, bro. - Okay, yeah, sure. - Cheers. - All right, Jimmy, give them the go. - All right, go. - Three, two, one.
- Give me the countdown. - 10 grand.
- Get it. - Eat it.
- You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it!
- Eat it! - You're all right. She's doing it, she's doing it. - Oh, I can't. Okay. - You got it. It'll take about 30 seconds to kick in. - Use water to swallow it. - How are you doing? - I'm doing okay so far. - You're good. - I did it! - You did it? Did it hurt? - Yeah. Not really, honestly. Oh, yeah. - All right, fun fact,
they're not ghost peppers. We just wanted to see how you'd react. But you still get 10 grand
for eating it anyway. We're gonna keep giving out challenges, but we're gonna do it a little different. We have a wheel in our warehouse and wanna bring random
people to our warehouse, have them spin it and do that. Let's go. Welcome to our new show. All right, let's spin it. - What a spin! - That was a pretty good one. Tell us, what would you do
with $800 if you won it? - Two months of rent. - Two months of rent? - Pay my rent, MrBeast. - Call your ex and ask
her why you broke up. $800 is quite a bit. - Hello? - Hey, Anna, it's Kelln. Why did we break up? - Because you cheated on me. - All right, hang up. - Oh my god! - Before I pay you, is this true? - I mean... - I feel like I shouldn't pay him. Just, yeah, all right. - Round of applause. - Hey, that's enough,
he doesn't need more. - Yeah, don't clap too much for cheaters. - All right, what's your name, man? - It's Alex. I once beat Dark Souls on
a Samsung Smart Fridge. - Wow. - That is a fun fact. - I have a fridge as well. Let's go ahead and spin. Oh, that was a hard one. 100? I feel bad, there you go. No laughs. The crew will try and make you laugh, whatever you do, do not laugh. - Can I call a friend in? - Whoop! - All right, you're done. - What's green and has wheels? - A garbage truck. - No, grass, I lied about the wheels. - Cool. - Good job. - Why do you look like
my disappointed stepdad? - Because I am your disappointed stepdad. - Do you wanna speak to my manager? - He smiled. It was a toothless smile.
- It was a smile. - Should we get a
consensus from the crowd? - What do you guys think?
- Was it a laugh, crowd? - Not a laugh! - All right, pay the man. No, I'm the host now, this is my show. - Kick him out of here! Kick him out. - But wait, I'm the bouncer. - Hey, hey, hey! I want his suit jacket. Give me his suit jacket. - Don't try to take over my show. What is your name? - Hannah. - That was Chandler's sister. All right, 600. And now the big one. Punt. Punt the baby 30 feet. Someone give me a baby. All right, here you go. Chandler, $600 is on the
line for your sister. - I think she can do it, she played soccer for a year. - Do you believe in yourself? - Yes, I do. - All right, let's see it. Wow. - That kind of hurt. - I'll be the official rule judge guy. - That looks like a very solid punt. There was a lot of arch on it, but I don't know. - 55 feet. - Wait a minute, is 55
feet more than 30 feet? So does Chandler get any commission? - Well, since I actually won it. - Actually, you get an extra 100 for that, that was funny. - I'm never inviting you again. - Oh, sibling love. - I wanted to put some
respect on our name. - All right, let's go. She's won more off of
challenges than you have. - Oh! - I can put the baby 100 yards. - Okay, let's go test it. How much am I betting? $200. Don't let your sister
show you up now, Chandler. - Right here, right here. - Oh no. - Hold it. - All right, I'm in line with the baby. - [Chris And MrBeast] 48 feet. - Beautiful. - He literally ran away. - We're never gonna see Chandler again. - Bobby, Bobby, Bobby! - You guys remember him
from this video right here. How do you like the place? - Love it. - Perfect. - Very, very nice. - I'm glad you're enjoying it. - Oh, it went on back. - And this one. Yeah, that one. All right. Chandler will challenge you to a game of rock, paper, scissors. - Don't worry, Chandler
never wins anything. - Chandler can't win anything. - You ready? - This is a sure fire win. - Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Good job, good job. - Here you go. Let's give him a round of applause. You too, Chandler's brother. I forgot your name. - 1,000. - Oh, it's 200. Chandler, you're behind your brother. He's better than you. - You're always in his shadow. - Wow. Call your mom and tell her
you got someone pregnant. - She's not gonna believe it. - All right. - Hello? - You already sound upset. - I just have a headache and I don't feel good. - I'm sorry, Mom. I have a little more bad news. - Okay. - I got someone impregnated. - Oh, whatever. Whatever. - All right. - Let's see if she calls back. Wait, let's see if she calls back. Oh, she's calling. - Yeah, what was that all about? - I got someone pregnant. - No, you didn't. - All right, but I'ma need
some child support money for somebody. - All right, here you go, you passed. - Baby bottle! - That is not what I wanted. - Bring home the bacon, baby! - What do I do? - Quit a job you don't have. - So you're gonna have
to go to a public place and you're gonna have to walk in and quit a job that you do not have. - Can I speak to your manager? - Yes. - All right. - To McDonald's. - Hi, hello. I've been working here
for a really long time. I think I'm gonna quit, this whole chicken business
is not working for me. Is that okay? - I'm so confused. - We got a new set of people. All right, all right. Good job. Go ahead and spin this real quick. - All right. - 800! - You have to cry on command. I'm just kidding. - You have to cry on
command, he was right. - Oh, really? - All right, cry.
- But it's gotta be convincing though.
- Cry. - I gotta see tears.
- I don't see any tears! - Can someone punch me in the... - He just punched his nuts. - Oh! - I don't see any tears. - I'm uncomfortable. - Are you all right? - Hey, buddy, whoa, hey, hey. - I see sweat, but no tears yet. How should he cry? - Poke yourself in the eye! - Slap him in the face! - Onion! - Wait, we have lemons. - Give him a lemon. - Give me a lemon. - He wants a lemon. - Give me a lemon. - It's a skit that I've seen before. - ShopMrBeast.com.
- Teddy, Teddy, Teddy! - Now I can't tell what's lemon and what's crying. He also plugged the merch, to be fair too. - He did. - Stop. Go. Stop hurting yourself.
- Take the money. - This man punched himself in the nuts and then squirted lemons in his eye. - To be fair, that was
one of our top prizes. It was worth it. This is our editor you've
known from previous videos. Can you put something on
Chandler's face right now? Here we go, I like that, that's funny. And if it doesn't land on what you want, just edit it to say what you want. - A million. - 40 grand. - Get that out of the way. Oh, it's 400. Now spin the wheel. Close. - What'd I get? - Shoot your shot. Call your crush and ask them out. - I don't have a crush. - Call Ethan and ask him out. - Ethan, Ethan, Ethan! - Here it goes, I hope he answers. - Will you be mine? - Hello? - I have a question. Do you like me, yes or no? - Where are you? - Where are you? Do you wanna go to the movies and wear MrBeast merch there? - Sure, yeah, sounds great. - Yeah! - Jake, give this to her after she sees the movie with Ethan. - Wait a minute, Ethan's my crush. - Ethan, you have a date. When are you guys going? - I don't know, but I
wanna see it really bad. - And make her pay for the movie. - She's paying for the popcorn. - Oh, that's expensive. - The viewers ship it, so you need to keep them updated. Have fun editing. - Draw a MrBeast logo with
peanut butter on Chris' back. - Let's do it. It feels good actually. - Should've got crunchy. - Is it easier if I do like that, or like this? Do you watch Bob Ross? - Now lick it off. - No, I can't do it. - Do you guys approve of his art? Here you go. Grab it with the peanut butter hand. - Does anyone have any Ritz crackers? - There you go. - Yeah! - What's your name again? - Savannah. - Yeah, Savannah. - 400. - All right, five. - All right, give MrBeast a high five. - You gotta give him a high five. You gotta catch him. - Come on, girl! - Oh my god. I can't. - He locked it. - I'm just kidding. - So you have him a high five? - Yes, sir. - She won. Show the camera, here you go. - Thank you. - Woo, yeah! - If you don't get 1,000,
they're gonna get mad. - We're having an earthquake. - What an impressive spin. - Yeah! - Let me read your
search history out loud. - Oh my god, no! - $1,000. - $1,000. - Read it, read it! - Here. - Do I have permission to go
through your search history? - You have permission. - Blow up suits. Sumo blow up suits. Thunder bubbles. What is a thunder bubble?
- What's a thunder bubble? - A thunder bubble, I don't know. - Why are you searching for it then? - How you eat chicken wings. That's actually in his search history. World's largest bowl of cereal. Good search. - I mean, it's a good search. - It's just Amazon and YouTube and Magic Men fleece pajama. - What? - We just did the last month
and there was nothing juicy. - Sorry. - But enjoy $1,000.
- You get $1,000. - Good job. And to wrap up the video, Chandler, I'm giving you
a special opportunity, since you don't win many challenges, and everyone here got a bunch of money, spin the wheel, if you do what
it says, you get 10 grand. - 10 grand, let's do it. - 10 grand.
- Let's do it. - Spin the wheel. He's been super excited
about this all day. Oh gosh. - It got faster, I guess. - Shop, no, pic, no, no, no. Um, all right, well,
you don't get 10 grand, you went bankrupt. No, don't break it, Chandler! Chandler! Chandler! I was gonna give you a second try, but you broke the wheel. - I can put it back up. - The thing about me,
I've been told I'm funny, and you know, that I should
be a standup comedian. - Yeah. - But I prefer sitting. - I feel terrible. - Get a different phone,
that's a good phone. - I need $1,000, MrBeast,
please give me money. - Oh my gosh, wait.
- Stop being intimidating. Get the sweat off your hands. - You're supposed to help me. He said. - I got pickle juice on me. - One day I was at home,
sitting on my couch, and I went on Instagram
that somebody got $10,000, and it wasn't me, it was MrBeast. - There we go, now we have an outro.
