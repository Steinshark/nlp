okay so you know those old games that used to be in newspapers that would be like spot the difference between these two pictures this this really feels like one of those games so we have a new pixel phone ladies and gentlemen not the pixel six so this was the uh often rumored but definitely not cancelled pixel 5a yeah so they they announced that it wasn't cancelled but then they never gave us a real date for it and then they pre-announced the pixel 6 but now we've quietly got this new pixel 5a it's real you didn't forget about it did you so the pixel a series has been great we already know what it's about right the great cameras great software overall value for the money and they've continued that formula and there's nothing wrong with that formula but this is the pixel 5a and this is the pixel 4a 5g announced in september 2020 nearly a year ago and like i said it's like that game there are so many unchanged things this has got to be the smallest year-over-year refresh i've ever seen between phones in my life so here let's just go over all the things that are exactly the same okay so it's the same exact specs as last year snapdragon 765 g chip same six gigs of ram same 128 gigs of storage same 12 megapixel camera on the back alongside the same 16 megapixel ultra wide same back mounted fingerprint sensor same speakers and same headphone jack and it's got the same perfectly fine 18 watt charging and the same lack of wireless charging so the natural question is okay it's a new phone what is actually different what do they change so this is where the spotting the differences game comes in you might have seen uh the color side by side this is the easiest thing to spot it is a slightly new color last year the 4a5 g was just called just black the new 5a is literally called mostly black it's actually a slightly green cast to it so kind of catches the light nice sometimes but yeah then it looks like a green phone but it's mostly black then the 5a is actually slightly very slightly larger it's rocking a 6.3 inch 1080p 60 hertz oled display instead of the 6.2 inch 1080p 60hz oled display from last year same pixel density same hole punch cut out just a little bit bigger and then from there there's a bunch of nice little quality of life improvements you might not ever know just from picking up the phone but the longer you use it the more obvious they would be so the 5a has a metal unibody construction now instead of the straight polycarbonate from last year and you can hardly tell holding it because they coat it in this soft touch finish anyway so it feels kind of like a rubberized type of plastic but no doubt that's going to wear better over time and it also lets them get to ip67 water and dust resistance which the 4a 5g did not have and i do like this new textured power button on the 5a it's got a nice little accent color and i still love when phone makers do this honestly they all should and it's got a raised pattern to id in your pocket so that's cool and then on the inside the pixel 5a has a substantially larger battery so up to nearly 4 700 milliamp hours and that is sweet so the last a series pixels were already quite good with the battery life because they're not drawing a whole ton of power again they still all have 60 hertz displays but the 5a's literal biggest improvement is on something it already did well so that's totally welcome long lasting battery is always good to see but then the only other things you'd be able to identify you'd have to check the spec list for uh gorilla glass 6 on the new one versus gorilla glass 3 on the 4a5g and they actually removed the laser autofocus on the new 5a so i don't know maybe a bit of a cost saving move kind of a bummer to see that now gone but at the end of the day that's everything that's different old phone 4.99 5a 449 so honestly reviewing this phone is like the easy part because it's so similar to last year if you're looking for a pretty great all-around phone for a mid-range 500-ish dollar price other than not having a higher fresh rate i think this is a pretty safe bet i mean at this price you're competing against the samsung a series the iphone se oneplus nord and a couple others around there but this one's gonna have the best camera of that bunch again and a few nice google features great my bigger challenge was trying to figure out why like why did google just make almost the same phone 11 months later because it feels kind of pointless but these companies don't do things for no reason there's got to be a reason so number one i just feel like there is a pressure if you've started to do something year over year to just keep it updated even if it's not a big change it's not a new chip they didn't add that many features but if you're just gonna offer people the latest available slightly better version fine but number two this does have like some weird timing where it comes around the time where we're all now thinking about the upcoming release of the pixel 6 with tensor they literally already pre-announced this new more exciting pixel phone that's coming of course it'll be much more expensive but that means their only choices really were to do this or to not release the pixel 5a at all or to do 5a with tensor first so when you look at it that way i guess it sort of makes sense that we ended up with this i mean you don't want to debut your custom new silicon design with a mid-range phone because then it inherits the reputation of mid-range silicon possibly you of course want to put it in the shiny new pixel six so okay i get that makes sense and that also likely would have been a bit too expensive for pixel 5a so i'm sure they just wanted to release tensor with a new flagship pixel that's pixel six what's funny is i'm actually pretty confident based on conversations i've had with people at google that they really actually wanted to launch tensor with pixel 5 that's what they wanted to do they wanted that all to line up but things didn't quite work out and so they ended up moving tents or back and just pushed pixel 5 out the door with whatever just a qualcomm chip that worked with it it was a 765g and so you might have noticed that phone also didn't have the neural core and that other custom silicon that's supposed to go with the 765g it just kind of felt like it got rushed out so now we're waiting for pixel 6. so pixel 6 will launch tensor pixel 5a is potentially the last qualcomm powered non-tensor powered pixel phone and so now i think that the biggest question actually is what is the future of the pixel a series what will they do with the next versions of this and if i was betting i would think that their best plan would be to kind of do the same thing apple does which is to use the same chip in the cheaper phone so what apple did with the iphone se is they use the same chip that was in the iphone 11 seemingly overpowered but obviously makes it much more future proof same deal if they can use the same tensor chip in pixel 6a that would be ideal then google of course will save money on the rest of the hardware around that ship so pixel 6 is a big phone it's a metal and glass sandwich type thing while the a series can stay pretty toned down honestly i think this is a pretty solid metal body even if it is coated in this rubberized material it's water resistant it's a nice size in a world of sub 500 phones this body with a tensor chip should be pretty good now in order for all of this to work we kind of still need pixel 6 to do somewhat well there's a lot actually writing on pixel sticks doing well we've heard this talk about them ramping up their marketing efforts and really trying on this pixel to sell a lot of them but the reason i bring that up is they want to sell a bunch that they start making a lot of them in mass and manufacturing at a high scale so that the price of the chip starts to come down a little bit and then it makes sense to make a cheaper phone cheaper body around tensor and later ship a pixel 6a because we don't really want a qualcomm powered 6a as much as we wanted tensor powered one i would think so yeah people love the a series and google couldn't resist drop in a minor refresh just to get a new decent phone at this range out the door makes sense there's a lot of people waiting for it now you have it there you go it's pretty good but yeah there's just a lot riding on pixel six in google land that's what i'm excited for shout out to the sponsor of this video expressvpn so quick question how did you choose which internet provider that you use actually i'll probably just answer that for you you likely didn't have a choice or if you did you're pretty lucky because in most areas you don't have a choice and so because these isps essentially have a monopoly over the areas that they serve if they start doing things you disagree with or if they start to track all the websites you visit even when you're in incognito mode what are you gonna do switch you can't so using expressvpn stops this by rerouting your connection through a secure encrypted server so your isps can't see a thing and also rerouting your connection through a different server can actually be kind of fun for example if i want to watch modern family it's not on us netflix no problem i just connect to a server that's in the uk refresh and i can watch it and it's not just modern family you can get thousands of other shows on netflix basically unlocked just by switching your location when you use expressvpn so if you don't want your isp to have complete control and knowledge over every website you visit and you want to unlock more shows it's kind of a no-brainer you can grab expressvpn today and if you use my code or go to expressvpn.com mkbhd that'll get you three extra months free thanks again to expressvpn for sponsoring this video
