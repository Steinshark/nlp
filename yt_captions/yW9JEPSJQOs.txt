for a long time the democratic people's republic of korea or dprk has been trying to make itself self-sufficient in food production something we might take for granted in other countries is very hard for this one reliable information about the country is hard to come by the government's official channels are not exactly super credible and so people mostly rely on anecdotes or rumors but we're going to do our best in this video we're going to parse what we know about the dprk or north korea i will use the two names interchangeably their agricultural instability and what the government is doing about it but first let me talk about the agenometry newsletter if you subscribe to the channel you should also sign up for the newsletter read the full scripts to older videos with extra commentary after the fact there's also newsletter exclusives you can find the link to the newsletter in the video description below or you can just go to asianometry.com as of right now you can expect a new newsletter every thursday at 1 am taiwan time historically korea's north was its industrial heart line the south its breadbasket the geography reflects this specialization 80 of north korea's land is composed of mountains and uplands with deep valleys in between the majority of the country's 25 million people live on the coastal plains and lowlands of the west about 15 percent of the country's land is arable it does not sound like a lot but plenty of countries can feed their people with less the global average of arable land per country for instance is 10 percent and in case you're curious taiwan's arable land percentage is about 17 most of north korea's farms are located on the country's west coast where the land weather and growing seasons are more favorable the cropping season is generally short the weather can get quite harsh during the winter especially in the mountains and the summers are short hot humid and rainy 60 percent of the dprk's rain comes between june and september the remaining 40 is widely distributed and sporadic which leaves the country vulnerable to droughts and floods these extreme climate events are worsened by inadequate infrastructure and deforestation as we will discuss later at the founding of the dprk the workers party of korea or wpk inherited from the japanese occupation government in advance industrialized society even taking into account the damage to sane during world war ii north korea held 72 percent of the peninsula's industrial capacity and over 90 percent of its hydroelectric capacity much of this was seized by the ruling wpk regime land belonging to korean landlords and japanese colonialists was also seized and redistributed to the peasantry throughout 1945 and 1946. this might be considered a land reform situation in previous videos i've talked a little about post-war land reforms in taiwan and japan as well as how they might unlocked untapped agricultural capacity and wealth for society this perhaps could have happened in the dprk as well but then the korean war happened the three-year conflict ravaged the peninsula caused immense population upheaval and annihilated its industrial infrastructure we will never know the true extent of the damage but it was probably pretty bad after the fighting stopped the dprk looked to its two major communist neighbors china and the soviet union for aid and guidance on the rebuild sino-soviet relations at the time were rapidly deteriorating and the north koreans leveraged the situation to extract the maximum possible concessions from the two i have done a few videos about this in previous times this created a dprk with selected influences from both giants domestically the dprk patterned its economy after the soviet union they created an orthodox centrally planned economy with the goal of suppressing markets the state owned every business and provided every job the state then seized all the land and established two types of farms cooperatives and state farms farmers can only work on these two not on their own private plots the state owned all the food grown on those lands and confiscated for distribution eternal leader kim il-sung pushed for this collectivization to make the dprk self-reliant in food production it was in line with the country's official state ideology which emphasizes political independence and self-reliance it also increased north korea's distance from the soviet union which at the time was advocating for a very tight economic relationship the collectivization drive criticized even by its communist bloc peers would lead to food shortages in the mid-1950s in response the north korean government heavily pushed the use of fertilizers pesticides tractors and irrigation systems yields stabilized but left the north korean agricultural sector dangerously dependent on certain raw inputs like oil over the years north korea accumulated vast debts to their major benefactors the soviet union and china these unpaid debts eventually led to the soviets withdrawing a variety of subsidies in 1987. that same year the dprk instituted a range of new agricultural reforms they doubled down on double cropping and fertilizers to expand their total arable land they raised forests reclaimed tidal land and cleared hillsides it seemed the intention was to compensate for the loss of soviet aid but such intense practices led to soil depletion and acidification and the new land they cleared and reclaimed was at best marginal thus food shortage still fell short of what was needed the collapse of the soviet union caused the north koreans to lose their main source of coal oil and steel the soviets had provided as much as two-thirds of their two-way trade the loss of oil in particular affected their ability to produce fertilizers and run irrigation infrastructure the dprk turned to china to compensate by 1993 the chinese nation provided north korea with 77 percent of its fuel and 68 percent of its food but in 1994 china began experiencing grain issues of its own they soon became disillusioned with its north korea relations and cut back on this trade in response the north koreans called the chinese traders to the socialist cause that same year north korean radio broadcast began admitting the existence of hunger while simultaneously denying its seriousness we do not know when exactly the famine began but studies of north korean mortality rates during this time in 1993 imply that certain provinces had already begun experiencing famine conditions in 1993 rations were delayed or temporarily suspended in certain provinces then in 1994 the government started triage entirely ending food shipments to four provinces a year later in 1995 they began coercive seizures of grain from the farms and established prison camps for those caught foraging for food refugees for certain hard-hit provinces began pouring into china leading to horrific media reports that same year 1995 and 1996 to a smaller extent the country's four western provinces where most of its farms are located experience flooding the waters collapsed terraces and silted fields the north korean government claimed that 5 million people were displaced over 1 million tons of grain were lost and an estimated 15 billion dollars of damages occurred no doubt the floods were pretty bad but it's likely the government exaggerated the extent of the damage food shortages existed long before the floods began and the numbers did not always match up for instance a un survey could only count 500 000 displaced people rather than 5 million playing up the damage from the floods and subsequent droughts allowed the government to save face while requesting aid from south korea or japan simultaneously it deflected outside criticism of the political regime and its governance this international food aid helped for sure but not all of it ended up in the hands and mouths of those north koreans most in need of it many charitable organizations eventually pulled out of north korea due to its disputes and a lack of accountability this was and continues to be a contentious debate with regards to north korean relations to sum it all up we know that a famine of some sort occurred in the dprk throughout the 1990s and that it was pretty bad but how bad it was how many people died and even when it actually started and ended remains uncertain death estimates range from 220 000 to 3.5 million best guesses are probably somewhere in between the country's agricultural production has improved in the years since the 1990s this is due to a combination of international aid favorable weather and economic reforms but north korean farmers continue to face a number of crop growing challenges much of what we know about the dprk's agricultural situation today comes from international aid programs which have been operating in the country since at least 2011. their information is as reliable as anything you can say about the country but remain subject to interference from north korean institutions after the famine the government finally allowed households to own and cultivate their own private plots people grow potatoes corn and vegetables on these small gardens since they are privately owned they tend to be well cared for and have played a large part in improving the country's food security in 2012 the kim jong-un government made certain economic policy changes to devolve more authority to the lower levels now actual workers on the collective farms can make more of their own decisions material and investment planning for instance rather than just blindly following party orders this is nothing like how deng xiaoping reformed china's agricultural practices but it is a step forward for sure dprk propaganda proclaimed that these reforms have given flexibility to farmers to be creative but as with everything in north korea we do not know the extent these reforms have been implemented as well as whether they are actually impacting the bottom line statistics one of north korea's biggest agricultural concerns is its deteriorating soil quality generally modern conservation agriculture advocates for diversified crop rotations permanent organic soil cover and minimum soil disturbance north korean farmers very aggressively plow and till their soil they also blast it with a lot of chemical fertilizers which as i mentioned before has caused the soil to turn acidic this interferes with the soil's ability to absorb air and water as well as the plant's ability to take up nutrients north korean farmers also very aggressively double crop which means to plant several crops in the same area or same crop year for instance a double crop of potatoes a big crop in the spring and then another in the winter barley is a primary spring crop but it is also grown throughout the winter in smaller quantities such aggressive double cropping year after year has deteriorated the land's capacity to cultivate food north korea's soils have a reddish hue due to a lack of organic matter in 2011 the average yield to paddy rice was 3.9 tons per hectare way down from the 8.0 of the 1980s in order to preserve the soil quality farmers should probably rotate in a few legumes from time to time cultivating legumes can improve several aspects of soil fertility they increase the amount of soil nitrogen soil water retention and more wheat yields are higher when following a batch of legume harvests than wheat however north korean farmers are reluctant to implement these legume-based cropping schemes due to fear of not being able to meet wheat production goals set by the government i don't blame them that situation is unlikely to change so long as goals and plans are set by edict from above the dprk's farmers have long lacked adequate farming technology like tractors suited for the country's smaller and irregularly shaped fields just as often they are unable to run or maintain that technology due to shortages of energy or parts this prevents farmers from maximizing their efforts donations help but a big reason for this situation has to do with the country's inability to raise funds to purchase these items those within the dprk assigned the blame for this to the united states pointing to american trade sanctions like the export control act and the trading with the enemy act i want to note the former pass in 1940 and the latter 1917 long before north korea existed as a state and north korea was removed from trading with the enemy act restrictions in 2008. i would also be remiss to remind viewers that both china and the soviet union hardly american lackeys would do support and aid to the dprk on their own accord the country is a notorious deadbeat over the past few decades the north korean government has intensively exerted to expand its overall arable land but the best land has already been cultivated so much of these efforts involve cutting down trees on the hillsides to make way for terraces during the great famine the government allowed lands with slopes above 15 percent to be cultivated the soils on these lands are pretty poor quality despite this satellite imagery shows that one million hectares of land on slopes above 10 degrees have been cleared to grow cereals as i mentioned much of the country is mountainous the area's weather is also prone to unpredictable periods of rainfall without trees to hold down the soil big rainstorms can very easily wash it down and create rivers of silt not only do these damage the soil's growing capacity they make floods more dangerous to people and property floods have been noticeably more destructive since the 1980s when these deforestation efforts began and they also affect the population's ability to generate energy to sustain themselves 77 percent of the rural population and 28 percent of the urban population rely on wood for cooking the work of nobel prize winner amartya sen notes that famines happen not only because food crops fail but also because food distribution networks collapse during the dprk central planning era the state collected all the farm's harvests and distributed them to the population every household received food rations how big those rations were was determined by occupation and household size during the great famine even when food was available oil shortages made distributing that food difficult that old food rationing system collapsed and ordinary north koreans resorted to illegal private markets for access to food when you hear the words black markets you might think of gangster tough guys from the movies and whatnot but north korea's black markets are generally run by women they are mostly just housewives making and selling stuff to keep their families alive after the famine subsided the north korean government at first attempted to crack down on these markets but after a long and bumpy while they formalized them providing them with housing facilities and even security the government refused to call it market reform but that's essentially what it was today defector surveys say that most ordinary north koreans get their food from these markets as well as the private plots that i mentioned earlier the government has also attempted to revitalize the old food ration system but to what extent it now exists is hard to tell on one hand defectors say they no longer receive food rations from it like back in the old days but we also know that the state is still taking up to 70 percent of state farmers annual harvests for distribution so i reckon that those rations are only going to the country's political and economic elites to retain their support of the regime the north korean government has seen its budget and resources vastly depleted over the years they are trying to do all of this reform with an official government budget of something like 3.3 billion usd a 2007 figure and a nominal 2017 gdp of 30 billion usd kim jong-un clearly considers the reform and revitalization of the country's agricultural sector a core aspect of his policy he has repeatedly said in speeches that he wants the country to focus on improving people's lives through increased food production but his government has been rather short on putting forth concrete policy solutions for making this improvement most of the things he says are vague like a seed revolution or more of the same like double cropping while distribution has indeed improved and famine is no longer a major threat the situation still falls short of self-sufficiency the country's farms have suffered real abuse and soil damage over the decades and these proposals are not going to help the fundamental agricultural situation needs to change before north korea's people can start seeing enough food on the table alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching if you enjoyed the video consider subscribing check out the newsletter follow
