I interviewed Sam bankman freed and he hated it so much that he left within minutes in part because he didn't know he would be interviewed by me he thought he was being interviewed by someone else on Twitter and I snuck up in the DMS and got on the call and started peppering him with some harder questions and within minutes of that um suddenly Mr open and honest decided he needed to leave but I didn't let that stop me because I joined an interview the very next day doing the exact same thing ambushing him again and I got some pretty good answers out of it I think the running theme Here is with this whole press tour he's going with this image of you know I'm embarrassed I made a mistake but I'm here to be open and honest now but that's not true because when you actually hit him with some hard questions suddenly meetings come up Suddenly he can't talk suddenly he's just Mr ums and oz so I wanted to show both interviews I think they're very interesting I really wanted to press him on this eight billion dollars that mysteriously went missing that he didn't know about and I'm sure I'm going to be breaking these down more specifically in the days to come but for now I just want wanted you to enjoy these unedited conversations with Sam bankmanfried that he didn't know he'd be having uh coffee Zilla the mic is yours man hey thanks for having me um I just wanted to quickly ask so there's this big question about this eight billion dollars that went into some kind of a stub account if I just want to get some clarification on this from my understanding what you're basically claiming is is that back when FTX didn't have banking you'd use silvergate through to have people to wire money to Alameda research and then credit them on the FTX side but you didn't actually account for that money going back to them so essentially you had like eight billion dollars coming to FTX you didn't have on the book technically I mean how can you explain more how that worked because it seems like such a key part of this whole thing and so far we've gotten like very vague things about stub accounts just try to be as specific as you can on how that actually happened so um I so and again some of these are things I'm trying to piece together that I don't have the full answer to but um uh but I think that part of it was I believe that there was um you know uh correct FTX accounting um in terms of you know the audit financials um but um I but that at least I can say that when you sort of pulled up um you know on a dashboard what uh what you know the accounts look like um uh it would not have I it wouldn't have uh displayed um you know those transfers and it wouldn't have displayed the balances related to those uh which meant that it was um that the sort of what you would naively see as the relevant um uh you know it's the relevant uh sort of position size was quite a bit smaller than what the full position size wise specifically you're talking about the funds that went into Alameda that was credited to Ft on on the customer side on FTX you're saying you're saying that basically when you looked at your dashboard Alameda was using those funds to trade perhaps but that ultimately you couldn't see that on the Alameda side because there was some kind of an accounting problem where there was a mix up with where it was credited is that the story yeah it's something roughly like that or at the very least that the the this the the common displays of it did not um did not just did not include that piece of the accounting a real quick second follow-up um so I've talked to a few Alameda insiders and I've kind of run them by your uh story of things I think you probably are aware I'm pretty skeptical um and they one of them when I told them like sort of like could it be that Sam wouldn't know about this somebody who worked with you and they actually like they laughed and they said there's no way he's like he's like claiming to be stupid now when he was like this genius Wonder kid and so my sense of things is how do you explain this how do you explain the fact that your some of some of the people who worked with you for years your employees have come out and said there's no way he didn't know about these back doors there's no way he didn't know what Caroline was doing when you guys were very close the office is we're right next to each other I mean how do you expect us to believe this story you're spinning I I don't know what to say likey I I had a lot going on um and I was spread thin I was a bit less grounded than I had been before um and I lost track of a lot of important things and I I mean I think that hang on one second I think spread thin is one thing right like I think you know things can get out of hand but we're talking about a fundamental understanding of whether Alameda was co-mingling funds with FTX I mean I saw your Stephanopoulos and Sorkin interview and you're pretty categorical that you had no idea that you were mingling fun so that's what I'm asking about not like did you know exactly what was happening on November 7th or 8th I mean I can understand sort of things getting out of control but we're talking about the most fundamental grasp on how your business Works you're telling us you had no idea I was not aware of a lot of what was going on I was vaguely aware that some of these systems existed um I know details of them and uh and I I you know was not spending much time uh and on uh looking at you know position risk management it was a big mistake I mean you're right Sam I've just got so guys guys I've just got a DM of Sam Sam has to has to leave so guys uh so yeah I I have a couple questions read the margin account I mean um there's sort of all this talk about the terms of service did you break terms of service did you not you're basically claiming that there was a separate side of your terms of service which said that uh if people had margin accounts you could use kind of their funds or there was looser language around that but I talked to somebody from Alameda and asked how big the position of like or how many people had assets in the type of accounts that that terms of service would apply to versus the regular terms of service which said you couldn't use their money and they said it was about a billion that was in the margin trading or the the margin like uh side of things where you could reuse their funds or whatever and there was the rest of it was not there so does that mean the rest of the money was stolen I mean like it seems like you're putting all your eggs behind this one excuse about you know there was this separate side of the terms of service how do you address everyone else so I don't have all the day in front of me my memory is that it was substantially more than a billion um in the margin trading program um but I don't have that day in front of me right now so I can't verify that um on top of that there were other effects as well um and I don't have the data about all the details of those in front of me but my understanding is that um you know some of those were uh you know uh early uh wire transfers sent directly to Alameda which I think contributed to the position as well um and then their open Futures positions on top of that you know on top of the spot margin positions um where uh you know there can be effectively socialized uh you know losses clawbacks if you know one is unable to be closed um uh in time and so I think it was a combination of those factors um uh there may have been other factors too but that's what I've been you know able to to piece together um and that you know putting those together I think he is is likely how you got um to most of this but um uh but here's the thing how do how do you account for maybe the difference in what people are hearing from insiders uh who are not being accused of Fraud and you who sort of is there's a very different sort of story going on here where you you know you're saying like oh there's this big position that we didn't know about because you told me that the last time we spoke in a space and I went and followed up and I said hey is this true could it be that this uh you know number just wasn't known about and some Alameda Insider said no way you could see on dashboards really simply where it was and FTX dashboards not Alameda dashboards dashboards that you yourself had access to so my question is sort of like it seems like when I go to Alameda insiders or FTX insiders they're saying this story makes no sense but when I go to you who sort of has every incentive to sort of lie and obfuscate um because obviously the incentive here is well otherwise you might go to jail uh which obviously would be a very bad thing for you it seems like all of a sudden all the excuses come out and then when we follow up on them they don't seem to be true so I I don't know like help me Square this because you know it'd be nice if you were telling the truth but everything we're hearing from insiders is that you're not I don't know what to tell you I'm saying what I believe I don't know which insiders you're talking about I don't know exactly what they said it doesn't line up with my beliefs but I can't speak to what they think or what they said but why are multiple people within your company at less senior roles knowing more about the company than you and almie was not a company that is running at the time but I hear you I I'm sorry I I don't know exactly what you're referring to I don't know who you're talking about I don't know what they said um I don't well I'm telling you what some of what they said I mean for example one of them was that there was like that like that back door system or whatever a that you knew it existed and B that it was easy to see the balance or the the position of Alameda very simply on FTX dashboards because they had a they had a margin trading account with you guys so you guys could have seen it but you guys could see the margin positions of everybody no but a lot of the decision did not appear in that main account so where was the position it was in a separate sub account I believe related to wire transfers that had been sent you know to Alameda research uh generally primarily to FTX um having its own bank accounts so who controlled the secret stub account I did anyone at Alameda know about this secret stub account I mean are we supposed to believe that just like there was this stub account that nobody knew about I don't know who knew about what when I'm sorry I mean clearly somebody lost the money right like obviously the money went somewhere somebody lost it it just seems really convenient that eight billion dollars was located in this like account that didn't show up when you pulled up alameda's balances right yeah I I don't know what to tell you um okay so a separate question is obviously around this Forbes thing because you've said you don't have you don't have present knowledge of sort of like alameda's balances and they came out and said that you were giving them up-to-date balances from Alameda how do you square that just as of a month ago you knew um alameda's position how does that swear with your statement about like you don't know what's going on I haven't seen the the thing that you're referring to but I was able to give very rough approximations that included a subset of the list of assets that Alameda had um I by asking about the assets I believe to be the largest sets of them um I was not giving you know full accountings um I of all of alameda's balances or positions um because I you know didn't generally have those and because it was it was a complicated process dependent on liquidity of tokens and things like that from the Ford's perspective so I was just sending them a sort of abbreviated partial list of Alameda assets periodically but that means you knew that what what Alameda had even roughly you knew what Alameda had I had a rough sense of what their assets are that is correct um by rough I I do mean to within you know 10 billion or so um I did not have a fine grain sense of what their asset total asset value was and I did not have a fine-grained sense of their liabilities or if their margin position size or how that was split up I guess one of my questions is like what do you think should be done if we find out that you're lying about all of this like sort of because it's kind of one thing to to steal people's money it's another thing to lie about it what do you think should be done like because I I mean it's gonna be obviously a lot of this is gonna eventually get litigated uh you know eventually Caroline Ellison's gonna have to take the stand what happens if she pulls out text messages that shows you knew about it I mean do you think that wipes away your credibility I mean I think a lot of my credibility has already been wiped away frankly and I think that's honestly that's not what I'm thinking about right now I'm not trying to focus on you know when I like I'm just thinking about like customers or who I think are are or what matter so you're saying there's a chance for them to get money back or for us to get our money back I don't want to speak out of turn and I I can't make promises on behalf of the company I can't speak on behalf of the company um and I don't know what decisions everyone's gonna make um I do know that FTX us to my knowledge is totally solvent and could I think um return everyone's money tomorrow if it wanted to um and I think internationally uh you know there are a lot of Pathways you know potentially for there that one could imagine um FTX International taking I think you know I know that as of before I filed um there were billions of dollars of like serious funding uh offers potentially on the table and um you know I would I would uh expect to hope that those are being people who are those funding offers I I don't know that I have uh authority to uh well you said you had four billion dollars like that came in right yep is that still does that still exist was that ever real uh I think it uh I mean I think it I I don't know for sure but um I think that some of those might um it I I my guess is that that some of them might that and um I you know I I hope that the serve relevant teams are doing whatever they can to maximize value for customers here yeah it just kind of doesn't make a lot of sense why someone would pour four billion dollars when you guys have liabilities sort of as high as you do um can you talk a bit about the marked um The Marked market like statements you were making around solvency you're making some pretty outrageous statements about like FTX you know had the money when a lot of it was serum ftt these tokens that you know you can't sell in those amounts and you know that would completely crash the price they can't support that kind of selling um where you kind of deliberately misleading people there so I what I can say is I was just thinking about them in terms of well uh you know their Mark Price was just whatever their market price was at the time and you know obviously I was cognizant of the fact that um uh that you know you can't the the market price isn't necessarily I mean is is never you know what you could sell a large amount of of something for but I also massively misjudged that discrepancy there and um uh what what do you mean you massively misjudged it because you knew sort of roughly the percentage of of serum and ftt you held and you knew the the trading volume I mean you are a smart guy you're a professional Trader you know there's no way you make a simple mistake like that right like how how's that even possible I mean was a pretty big misjudgment and mistakes that I made um and a pretty embarrassing one but I was thinking if it internally in the context of Standard Market environment and obviously that still means you know substantial impact but uh but it's a different scale than what you would see um than what we did see in the market crash that happened where um without selling uh you know without liquidating the position there was a you know much larger than 50 market crash in a few day period um with you know uh very little mid-side liquidity and I you know that obviously history has said again again that those events are possible those very correlated Market crashes and not just very correlated Market crashes in those instruments but once were Hedges don't end up working fully or even right but we don't we don't even need to to have this market crash for the statement about Mark to Market uh accounting making no sense right and you just said that yourself even with with standard movements right if you tried to sell the amount of serum or FDT that you had on the books you wouldn't have gotten half you wouldn't have gotten a quarter of what you put on your books to investors and so the question is is like we know that you're not the problem is is like every time it comes to this hard point the answer seems to always be I made an embarrassing mistake but at what point are you gonna say like no I'm a smart guy right you were you were at the highest levels of this entire industry you were the guy to go to the smartest guy in the room right it's hard to believe that you made this many embarrassing mistakes one embarrassing mistake I get it but you're just everything's an embarrassing mistake at least tell us that you knew that the mark to Market made no sense and the way that I was thinking about risk at score was starting with march Market and then adjusting down effectively from that um and uh and obviously that means that there should be a real buffer because of exactly what you're saying that buffer should have been a lot larger than I was thinking but you never you never you never went you never went down from risk from there and you said publicly you said FDX is solvent other views May differ well there is no other view on it there's the fact of how markets work and you are making public misleading statements it wasn't one time you did this you continued to make misleading statements about it after people have had given you pushback so which which times are you talking about here I think it was in one of your follow-ups about the what happened you uh you said something about other views May differ oh that was ftxc us was it not I'm gonna look it up real quick I got a quick question about um Dan Friedberg your Chief regulatory officer this is a guy uh so obviously one I I I don't feel comfortable like talking about other people without getting you know sort of there sign off on that so I I think there's a limited extent to which I'm gonna be willing uh or or feel comfortable um you know speaking on others behalves no that's totally fair and I don't want you to speak on his behalf obviously I want you to share your perspective your unique perspective on the situation um just like the same I might ask a question about Caroline Ellison but I only could expect your position on the situation so kind of the um the the situation there is obviously this is sort of a tale of two stories about how FTX failed one is like a lack of Regulation a lack of clarity of the kind of just this thing that accumulated over time the other one is of course the story of fraud of course we have to look at who are the adults in the room one of the adults obviously was Dan Friedberg Chief regulatory officer um I'm sure you're aware he was behind the um ultimate bet Scandal where he gave players god mode in a poker game where people could see um the hands and he actually like basically conspired with Russ Hamilton to hide that so does that suggest something about your intention that you hired a guy that basically one of his biggest achievements was hiding fraud um can you explain sort of your thinking I know you don't want to talk about him can you explain you're thinking about why this would be the guy you choose as the chief regulatory officer um I mean we had a number of people uh in the legal department uh we had that was you know maybe our fastest growing Department um we had a number of outside law firms as well you know Dan was obviously one of the people who had been you know working uh you know for fkx for a while he was yeah he's the chief guy he should have caught some of this stuff you'd think in theory well when you say he's the chief guy I mean there's you know we also General counsels we had we had other positions as well but um uh but uh you know I I can't speak to what other people's you know views were what they thought or knew or were intending when um but I you know I know that like our our you know legal and Regulatory team had an enormous task in front of them we were looking to get you know licensed and regulated in dozens of jurisdictions at once we did end up doing that that was an unbelievably large undertaking which I think you know took up most of the time of you know most of our legal Reliance departments and you know in retrospect I think you know probably took up too much time um uh but at the end of the day I was CEO and that means that at the end of the day it's on me to make sure that we have people who are in charge of you know all the important things and I did that for some of the areas I failed to do that for others and but why'd you choose him specifically I mean obviously you could have chosen a lot of different lawyers to go with and I understand you had multiple lawyers but if this is if this story of FTX is largely a failure of regulation of failure of controls at an organization and your Chief regulatory officer is Dan Friedberg the question is well maybe this wouldn't have happened if you hadn't put a guy like this in front of this I'm not obviously saying it's his fault solely but I'm just asking sort of what was the thinking behind putting this guy in charge because it seems like you couldn't pick a less qualified candidate if you want to get actual regulation in the room I'm pretty con I I didn't say this is a failure of regulation and we did an enormous amount of work on you know getting licensed and regulated we're licensed in more jurisdictions than I think any other exchange was um I think it was absolutely a failure of oversight of risk management um um but uh uh but you know and I think that you know in retrospect I would have viewed the core duties and things I I needed to make sure more so than anything else very differently than I did um but I but from a you know becoming licensed perspective uh we did do quite a bit there and were um able to accomplish that and you know in Fairly short period of time and so I I think I'm not sure that I completely agree with the premise of um of that for me the question and you know I'll just say that like the people who work with FTX like I have enormous respect for most of them and they you know did enormously valuable work and um you know they didn't do all the work obviously they're really important things that didn't get done um but that's on me as CEO to make sure that there are people who are doing all the important things because there's way too much to do we're doing way too much as a company for um you know any particular person to be expected to be definitely on top of even if some important things um given how many other important things they also had to be dealing with at the time um so and by the way I do apologize I do I am fairly late at this point for next thing I do have to to hop off Sam thank you so much time and coffee Zilla and other you know speakers thank you so much Marty everybody thank you so much
