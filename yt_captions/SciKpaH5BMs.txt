in this video we look at the rise and sudden fall of south korea's former president park geun-hye the daughter of a former dictator she presented herself as a nostalgic icon the korean people could trust and turn to and she stayed popular despite a number of corruption scandals then it all came tumbling down really quickly and in a really bizarre way we will get to it but first let me talk about the asian armature newsletter if you subscribe to the channel you should also sign up to the newsletter check out videos you might not have seen before and read writings that i never bothered to turn into a video you can find the link to the newsletter in the video description below or you can just go to asianometry.com much thanks hey was born the first child of korea's third president pakchanghi in 1961 pakchanghi led a military coup that ended the second republic of korea park had himself elected president of the new third republic the 1960s were a turbulent time in south korea's history first lady yukyung soo and i'm going to really butcher these names all night long pakchanghi's wife and mother apokhyon hey was killed in 1974 by a north korean sympathizer at the seoul national theater of korea it had been accidental as the assassin was targeting the president with her mother's passing park gen hey filled the role of the nation's first lady this went on until 1979 when her father the president was also assassinated the assassination of park chung-hee was a significant but mysterious event in korea's history he was shot by his longtime friend and owned security chief kim jae-goo during the trial kim said that one of his motives for killing his friend was his frustration over pak's inaction in curtailing the influence of an associate choite min and his influence over first lady park geun-hye toi te min was an associate of pak changhi he had been a police officer a buddhist monk and an unofficial civil servant throughout the 1960s he held various roles like the president of the korean welfare association and vice president of the national buddhist youth association one of choi's first roles in the government was to promote park's new community campaign this was an ultra-nationalist movement that raised funds for infrastructure ordained as a pastor by the presbyterian church of korea choi set up religious organizations to raise money for this campaign and likely embezzled from them it was around then that choi established a relationship with pak geun-hye for second-hand testimony after the assassination of the first lady yuu pyeong-soo choi sent a letter to pakian hai then in her early twenties he claimed to deliver a message from her mother the former first lady had appeared in his dream you had told choi my daughter gyun hey is foolish so you should help her park invited him to the blue house korea's presidential home there in front of the young first lady choi was possessed by the spirit of park's mother he reproduced her expression and voice again this comes to a second hand and is really bizarre but it is hard to deny that there was something going on choi was more than a simple grief counselor after park chung-hee's assassination his daughter left the public eye she managed a yukyongsu foundation established by her mother for children's welfare and served as chairman of the korea cultural foundation she also continued her association with choite min by then founder and head of the eternal life church in 1989 the relationship was significant enough that the korean cia reported about it to then president ro tae wu it was accused that the relationship was used to influence the direction of various memorial and education projects other rumors claimed that the two had a physical relationship when asked about it by a fellow pastor choi said i'm old park john hey and i are a married couple in the spirit world not a physical couple choyte men died in 1994. whatever the true nature of that relationship had been it passed down from the pastor down to his daughter toy soon seal after park's assassination another military general chun duhuan seized power and served as korea's fifth president throughout most of the 1980s despite this toon struggled to maintain legitimacy throughout this period of time first due to the way he sees power after the pak assassination and second due to his violent suppression of the may 1980 guangzhou uprising the latter resulted in many deaths the actual number is uncertain ranging from 165 to over 2 000. there is a great movie called a taxi driver that takes place during this momentous event it is based on a true story and i highly recommend it anyway eventually president trune handed power over to the sixth president the aforementioned road te wu a former member of his own administration after a free and fair election it would be south korea's first peaceful transfer of power but suddenly transitioning to free elections after years of martial law and rigged elections had many repercussions for one thing south korea did not have the time to develop established national level political parties without that south korean presidential politics started off with simple regionalism early candidates appealed to their regional strongholds with multiple opposition candidates this eventually split the opposition vote and led to roh a member of chun's own party winning the election in 1990 rose party eventually merged with two others to create a right-wing center-right mega-block tied mostly to what had once been the province of gyeongsan they faced off against a left-wing block that drew most of its electoral energy from the province of honam this created something like the two-party system we see in the united states though with greater influence from random third parties with no chance of winning anything over time the structure stabilized south korean voting patterns at this time depended on regions and personal connections like blood ties hometown ties or schooling ties internal party politics depended on local clicks and informal connections organized around a single candidate personality or region south korea's parties thus are vulnerable to illegal funding scandals like from a table or two or any other personal scandal as well as a rise of populist fervor like from a former president's daughter back to pak gyun hey as i mentioned puck left the public eye after her father's assassination she managed private foundations and stayed out of politics her relationship with choi was just her own matter and that of the foundations she managed this changed in 1997 18 years after her father's death she emerged in the public eye after being elected as an assemblywoman in daegu her hometown and pakchanghi's power base like taiwan's relationship with the generalissimo chiang kai-shek pakchanghi has a rather complicated legacy in south korea on one hand yes he acted brutally and suppressed many freedoms on the other hand he laid the foundations for korea's present economic success and wealth like i said it's complicated anyway conservatives in industrial areas like daegu and the wider south gyeongsan province loved him and they would love her too nostalgia from 60s aged elder voters combined with empathy for pacquiaon hayes personal tragedies helped boost her political star she even experienced a reagan-like moment of her own during the 2006 elections a mentally disturbed man attacked her with a knife the resulting wound required 60 stitches and several hours of surgery her first words upon waking up was how is daejeon a reference to south korea's fifth largest city she eventually ran for the presidency in the december 2012 elections her election slogan recalled her father's let's live well despite corruption allegations she won the presidency over opposition contender moon jae-in with 51.6 percent of the vote like many other korean presidents pacquiaon hai faced many political scandals throughout her tenure a year after election in 2013 one of her spokesmen faced allegations of misconduct he was fired while she was visiting the united states then in 2014 an incredible tragedy a fairy named the civil sank on its way to the island of jeju killing 304 people this includes 250 students from tanwan high school in the lower middle class region of ansan the ferry was already old 18 years when it was purchased from japan it was then modified from a cargo ship to a passenger ship changing its center of gravity and making it more susceptible to accidents and before it set off on its fateful trip it had been overloaded here the regulators failed to exercise proper oversight with private operators authorized to self-regulate the government's response to the accident was also criticized the korean coast guard botched the response and initial news reports claimed that everyone had been rescued it was a mess and the activists continued protesting refusing to go away and then in 2015 the south korean government mishandled a serious outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome or merce this virus sometimes called camel virus because it comes from camels is a cousin of our good friend from 2019 unlike that other one this virus has a pretty high mortality rate but is relatively difficult to spread from person to person a 68-year-old returning from saudi arabia sought medical help and was diagnosed with merce 186 people subsequently caught it resulting in 38 deaths over ten thousand were quarantined the government misjudged the camel viruses transmissibility and neglected to properly communicate with the public about their efforts rumors flew resulting in a fair amount of panic sounds familiar these were terrible scandals and they had some effect on her personal approval ratings her overall approval rating in december 2015 hovered at slightly over 40 percent like 43 depending on whichever poll you believed this was about donald trump levels taking into account the same point in their presidencies but not bad by south korean standards current lame duck president moon jae-in is right now hovering at the 30 range and even that is considered high like with trump puck's approval ratings had a floor her traditional stronghold in south korea's elder population consistently over 60 percent of people 60 years older approved of her performance and that number hit 77 percent near year's end and as we all know old people vote second south korea's electoral system first adopted during the pak chung he days and then modified in 1990 is explicitly designed to favor ruling parties in its national assembly generally conservatives for instance in 1985 the ruling conservative djp won just 32.5 percent of the popular vote but still received over half of the 276 seats over the 26 years since 1990 the right-wing coalition won all but one of the six general elections thus the scandals had little effect on her party's electoral results leading up to the april 2016 general elections her party the sainouri party had won every by-election in the previous four years they even played extremely well in the june 2014 local elections winning eight of the seventeen open elections coming just two months after the civil ferry disaster this was a strong showing and people expected the same thing to happen with the april 2016 elections as well what actually happened surprised a lot of political observers pog's party lost 30 seats from 152 to 122. not only did the party lose his majority in the assembly it also lost his status as the largest party the largest party would be the opposition democratic party with 123 seats needless to say this was unexpected the reason this happened was the sudden rise of a credible third party in korean politics occupying the center ancho su had made good in business founding the anti-virus software company unlab in 1995. it became korea's largest computer security company after a brief stint in academia he entered korean politics in 2011 as an independent in 2016 he established the people's party taking with him a few members of the left wing despite this he attracted voters from both the left and right wing winning 38 seats well above the 20-seat threshold it would be the first time a third party entered the national assembly since 1996 and for the first time it signaled a break in the regionalism that ruled korean politics for so long it shook pak's power base and left her an early lame duck the pak administration up until now had done a good job of keeping a lid on bad press from the media then in august 2016 the right-leaning chosan iubo newspaper published a few stories about corruption amongst high-ranking presidential aides for instance one aide his mother-in-law sold over 100 million dollars of real estate to a large company at above market prices another story by sister tv network tv chosun detailed how two foundations left by choi soon-sil daughter of shaman choi taimin received tens of millions of dollars from cebu like samsung it was one of the first real signs of the daughter's influence in the government the pak administration quickly shut these stories down and the general public sort of shrugged high-level korean politics is rife with corruption the administration evaded another scandal a year earlier with little harm so just another day in the office so to speak chosun quieted down but another paper picked up the mantle the left-leaning hang kyorei published a series of stories soon coming to focus on choi soon-sil and her daughter chung yura chong yura attended a private women's college in seoul ewa university there one of her classmates complained to the paper that she was passing her courses with high marks without attending class in september 27 2016 the paper published a story titled choi soon-sil changed her daughter's academic advisor it detailed how choi paid ewa's president an overnight visit and had an academic advisor quickly dismissed more stories came out chung turned out to be the very picture of privilege she only attended 17 days of her last year at high school and supplied fake documents to graduate she entered university with an equestrian scholarship but the school bent the rules on sports athletes so to admit her several professors supplied her with the answers to their tests they ordered their assistance to write and do projects for her so on and most flagrantly she posted on facebook blame your own parents if you don't have ability money is also capability the series of seemingly mundane stories blew up they especially resonated with younger koreans who often find themselves grinding to succeed in a brutal competitive society nobody likes a spoiled brat with a silver spoon another company picked up the chain jtbc was a struggling news channel subsidiary of a larger media company that company had once been an affiliate of samsung the chebour ordinarily that would have squelched any chance of breaking a news story like what was to come but samsung was in the midst of a transition from father to son and the son was widely rumored to prefer the core businesses the samsung sugar daddy was closing his pockets so jtbc had to make money company leadership didn't care what stories the network ran or who it pissed off so long as the ratings were good on october 24th the network delivered when it acquired a tablet pc previously owned by choi in it they found selfies confirming its owner and most notably top secret drafts of presidential speeches including one from a recent trip to dresden detailing thoughts on korean reunification it confirmed that choi soon-sil a woman with no formal credentials and barely a high school education was meddling in state affairs holding meetings with presidential aides and pushing chable to give her money the day after the news broke park gave a public speech with an explanation of choice involvement it would be the first of three when you apologize you want to do it quickly specifically and sincerely do it right and everyone can move on the first speech took one minute 49 seconds it gave a surface level overview of choi's involvement in policy she did not say anything about the corruption and it felt pretty indifferent park did not know that this was her chance to turn the tide her speech enraged the people her approval rating crashed to 14 and kicked off the first of many candlelight vigils in korea's cities large-scale rallies in downtown seoul with tens of thousands of people pak waited a few days until her second apology on november 4th this one lasted for nine minutes in it she repeated her assertions about her relationship to choi and sought public understanding she also explained her unwillingness to step down the second apology was a little better but not by much when it rains it pours by now the news agency is reporting scandals and scathing headlines each day so the mass vigils continued on november 12th a million people attended a rally in seoul by this point her approval rating hit five percent by now even her die-hard supporters the 60-plus cohorts abandoned her her third national apology took place on november 29th and in it she discussed resigning however she explained that she wanted to have negotiations with the opposition parties before stepping down people believed that this was a delaying tactic the protests continued and the politicians began talking about impeachment as americans might know impeaching a president is extremely difficult a million protesters out on the streets means nothing if there's a small handful of the right people on your side however park's party the sanuri party could not maintain its party discipline like as i said earlier they revolved around personalities and regions when she refused to step down to save her own party discipline fell apart in the end 234 mps out of 300 voted in favor of impeachment this includes 62 members of our own party a sizable faction of conservatives had broken off the first major conservative split in korea's history the south korean constitutional court has three months to review the impeachment charge they unanimously voted that due diligence was followed and upheld the charge all the judges had been appointed by conservative presidents the fallout from the puk impeachment was pretty massive in 2018 choi soon-sil was sentenced to 20 years in prison various members of pak's administration were also jailed including her former health minister spy chief and chief of staff in august 2018 samsung head jaylee was also sentenced to five years in prison but he was eventually released in august 2021 on parole due to national interest i guess 11 billion dollars in running the country's biggest company kind of matters on the other hand the three press publications that broke the choice scandal the han kilray jtbc and tv chosun all received the korea journalism award for their work the scandal ended two decades of unified conservative factionalism the next presidential elections are scheduled for march 2022 and a hint at a new era of multi-party politics in south korea's coming years talk herself was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined 17 million dollars found guilty of abuse of power and coercion absence makes the heart grow fonder it seems and her supporters have started to advocate for a pardon korean politics is pretty wild isn't it alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching if you enjoyed
