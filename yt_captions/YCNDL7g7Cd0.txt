ladies and gentlemen we all love chess Bots whether it's watching individuals cheat whether it's watching the games of stockfish or Komodo or playing against mittens there are some extremely fascinating Bots out there in the world of Chess but we all have to start somewhere which is why in today's video I will be playing every single beginner chess bot on chess.com and I will try to beat every single beginner chess bot on chess.com within 30 minutes or less this is the beginner chess but speedrun there's only one rule I have to alternate which colors I play every game which will take me about three to four seconds in between every single one of these games I got nothing else to say here we go I've never done something like this before please let me know if you enjoy this type of content Anna maybe I will do an intermediate and an advanced bot run as well let the time begin I will play against Martin game one and he plays E4 we gotta try to win as fast as possible E5 whoa I've already blundered oh that's bad okay but he's not gonna go he's not gonna go there so oh my God he went there oh that's really bad okay oh why well since when does Martin play such good moves this is ridiculous okay he's not gonna do that though okay I was I was really really concerned for a second I needed to beat Martin very fast Martin is by far the worst ball on chess.com so if I can't beat Martin okay let's let's let's let's pre there's no way he takes my knight right that's ridiculous okay we're up a rook okay we're gonna bait him into taking the bishop and then play Queen A2 mate oh get absolutely smoke Martin all right next game we are playing against Wayne this time we'll have the white pieces I'm gonna open up with E4 Wayne plays all right we gotta go for a nice little Vienna what are we doing Vienna Gambit what do we do okay that's trash you're trash Wayne you're trash all right is he gonna hang his Queen big question don't have your queen out in the open like this okay now he's just down a pawn and all the I hung this but he's not gonna do that that's a free Bishop Bozo but he's he has a fork does he okay well I'm gonna take that too he's gonna take with a pawn he he did what he didn't even take what is okay we're gonna win his Rook nice little Fork let's get in nice and deep here with the queen let's see if he takes and now I'm gonna weave a mating net I'm gonna go here so his King can't move and I hope he does something that so annoying okay all right okay let's resign now anytime you want s don't resign very annoying how much time I got 153. all right I'm on good Pace there's goddamn 15 Bots okay 15 Bots that you gotta beat each one in two minutes or less just gotta last two minutes two minutes oh my God why is this guy so hard to beat oh my goodness oh my goodness dude dude enough oh my God this is nuts he just doesn't want to lose okay D7 and Rook D6 I it's over Rook D6 is made you bozo brother that was so lucky oh my God you are so trash you are so trash let it be known all right we're playing Fabian Fabian I gotta play Black this game all right I gotta I gotta catch up one time what the what even is that what for Rook H3 what he better not take my Pawn all right I got a you know what this dude is dude is so bad oh my goodness he's so bad E5 I'm hanging upon here by accident I should probably protect it that's a free Queen you absolute monkey all right yes there we go there we go E4 got the brain of a chimp him and me both by the way I gotta get my queen in the only way to get the queen in is like this and now I just need some the queen needs help let's get D4 let's get a knight getting in there that doesn't do anything Bishop takes all right Knight D5 I gotta open up the position nice and I should have made Knight C2 is a mate very soon oh my God why are these Bots like randomly defending themselves right at the end of the game okay never mind gave him too much credit let's somehow get our Bishop in check okay double check take his Rook and before Queen D4 oh my goodness what are these Bots doing this is so utterly absurd since when do they play Queen B1 was just made in one but we'll oh okay all right we're still making good time yo he's escaping made this is this is unbelievable all right Queen E3 rookie eight no Queen G3 thank you all right four three up all right we gotta get a game with white now I'm gonna play a London I'm gonna play a London probably not the best opening actually if you're trying to win fast I'm just pre-moving the London let's change it back to a Queen's Gambit in case we get taken now one thing the Bots don't do is oh one thing they don't do is they don't blunder Mateen one they very rarely blunderbain one they'll lose all their pieces to you but you generally have to like actually put in a little work oh my God sometimes they make accidental good moves and and and that that is very dejecting check how do I could have taken the Rook but I just wanted to remove a defender of the king oh I'm gonna Showboat a little bit obliterated there uh who's the next Philip hi Philip you're terrible just like the rest please don't go here okay thank you Scandinavian Scandinavian nice I'm gonna put my queen on A5 oh okay this guy knows openings oh good developing what what queen F3 is next probably this spot knows real openings oh my God this is unbelievable okay made a little getaway okay this is a real position okay let's try to launch some Pawns because I'm very why why am I in a real position against the 400 elobot okay why hasn't he hung his Queen yet okay so now he's gonna and he did not now he's gonna hang something ah there it is okay there's the self-destruction thank you all right we six minutes six minutes this is bot number five we're making good time nice check what I didn't even I need to go Queen H3 I'm rotating my queen over here nice I love that move now I can get in Knight F3 Queen H1 I'm not rushing with this move because he could just block I'm bringing in my knight and rookie 192 and queen H1 are all threats that move is nice but that's Maiden one nice all righty five up six six and a half six something something all right ilani you look very nice thank you look like a very nice person You're Gonna Lose though all right I knew this was what she said something so weird gotta play for the center two Pawns in the center if possible Knights and Bishops and then develop two Pawns in the center if possible Knights and Bishops and develop Free Pawn if this I have a fork very common fork okay we can still do that that's a free Queen elani I don't know why you did that you fell for it that's what the bot just said after giving me a queen she said you fell for it that's oh smothered mate yes look at that oh she can't take because of the Rook oh my goodness can you have a chance to get even no because ratio okay I'm playing Black now against Noel who's ready to fight well yo two can play at that game you bozo yeah now we're just playing a Scandinavian with H4 H5 on the board okay now we're playing a Karo Khan dude okay Advanced variation I'm gonna play E6 C5 I don't I don't know what this is Noel I don't I don't know okay undermine the center the Knight is going to C6 typical stuff I could have taken that but I'm trying to make every move in half a second okay that's bad that's really bad Noel uh okay I mean I I didn't take the Rook because I could take it anytime of course you should take the Rook but I'm like going for as fast of a win as I possibly can so double check where's my mate where's my mate how do I not have a mate I'm just gonna win all those pieces take the Knight give a check where's my mate bro where's my mate why do I not have a mate check this is ridiculous oh my God how am I oh and may I just add the first move H5 oh clutching it out in the end spectacular stuff all right uh Noel that was you you're not very good Oliver how are you buddy all right time to lose E4 all right let's play no funny business this is a good first move thanks all right he also plays Scandinavian all right we're gonna develop our Knight develop our Bishop two Pawns in the center or one oh okay okay no problem no no I mean I thought that the 500 wouldn't hang his Queen all right Central play putting stuff in the center what the what is happening okay I'm gonna go get my queen to C8 maybe maybe monitors this oh oh you really confused me that time can I have another shot no you're trash all right milika 550 uh I gotta play Black this game all right what are we doing D4 let's play a Dutch defense F5 Knight F6 and then we're gonna play a Leningrad or I'll play classical I'm gonna pin the Knight and then I'm gonna play B6 like this why is the 500 elobot playing like a very very good and solid opening does she have like an older sibling that taught her whoa I can't Castle no way the bot just played that okay thank you wow that was nuts okay let's finish up our development here this is a very common ah I see it's a close position eight pawns each so I'm sneaking in to Target some stuff thank you thank you very much and I'm gonna make my way downtown uh okay lining up some nasty discoveries discovered check and I I win the queen and now when you're winning like this you just gotta open everything up check check okay open up the whole ah it goes that way damn okay no problem check all right that was nice King got hunted down uh now we're playing Genji we've got white uh let's play that's not okay let's just play a Queen spawn then that's a good move that's actually a great move now it's going to be very difficult for me to develop that is not a great move uh the way you deal with these Pawns in the center is okay you just win them apparently because you're playing a beginner bot the principled develop not rushing that is a free Pawn okay my opponent's king is in the center so I can it's very good for me to open up the center while I okay opening up the center like this grants very good tactical opportunities very quickly that's a good defensive move but this is still gonna work because it's a discovered attack yup discovered attack now my opponent's down a queen and and with the King still stuck in the center I can okay still gotta defend my pieces rookie one and I'm just trying to get down there as long as I clear out the defenses I just gotta get rid of the Knight actually is the most important or I can like sneak around it somehow this queen h8 Maybe and that should be GG check and now I prevented the king from escaping and uh it's mate nice all right just good principal chess Aaron Reykjavik I play Black this game all right making good time uh E4 E5 let's play principal chess night on C6 alrighty strike the scholars meet me they're all trying to Scholars mate no problem the way you punish this is you immediately jump into the center of the board and there you go it immediately pays off he doesn't defend his Pawn and he has this and then I will trade Queens he does not so now I'm gonna try to put two Pawns in the center like this also bring my knight back that's a free Bishop that's a free Pawn you could take this still but I have Queen E7 and that's just going after his King yeah made on C2 oh my goodness the hero a little instructive moment here which I'll sacrifice some time for how to stop Scholars mate and punish your opponents for disrespecting your knowledge of Chess new game uh Mina hopefully Mina also does not play for Scholars mate uh let's play E4 I've played enough Queen spawns back to back let's play the ponziani if we can knight C6 uh C3 okay another individual who doesn't respect us we're gonna try to do the exact same thing two Pawns in the center oh good move that time actually yes a good move Pawns in the center always good in principled and that facilitates other things like them hanging their Queen for some reason okay develop Castle don't hang a piece my day seven was a good move that doesn't do anything King in the center open up the center all right thank you all right Queenie TSU and that's mate nice all right Zara 850. it's getting serious now on in the center all right trying to develop okay we're playing uh London maybe this okay nice in principle this person's playing much better than the others will probably be the longest yeah it's not a good move okay don't have blind spots for Pawns in the center like this very common opponent was trying to sneak in Knight C7 now we're gonna take good spotting so far by the you know the tactics Bishop before check is a very good move let's this is completely unnecessary but there's a lot of weaknesses in the center like this after which we should just have a completely winning position won't be the first time our Knight has landed with devastating effect there it is and now we're gonna win the queen with a discovered check we're gonna come back and protect this piece here so we don't lose of course not necessary but I don't want to lose any material okay and now we we I mean we are just winning uh King D1 Knight F2 is a mate on Rook D4 is a mate they're both mates okay two more bonds to go Santiago looks like a very serious man I'm gonna try to play E4 against Santiago buenos dias go easy on me I'm just learning Vienna you're not learning you're gonna get eviscerated which one are we going for all right we're doing a symmetrical what are we doing all right I'm gonna try to play a pure Vienna here against the beginner bot wow he said go easy on me he's better than I am at chess wow this is like all normal wow you have this is crazy he's playing like playing some really really good moves here it's a sensational Knight D4 we gotta know like Queen F2 okay sadly the run is over but it was very fun I have to prevent Knight D4 I could also Castle and now I'm gonna attack on this side with like F5 for example on Bishop G5 I sealed the center shot now I'm threatening to open up the King this is a very nice example of how to play like beginner chess Queen H5 opening up the position that's made the king is completely sealed now and that's just a mate if this nice very very clean win for us and we will end playing against Kareem who's quite good but I'm 2800 so you know he's dead uh okay Birds opening play principled I mean I don't know what the heck that is but we're kind of playing like a Queen's Gambit style all right that's a big hole I'm gonna play Knight F6 I'm gonna play Bishop F5 we're gonna fight for that and then we're gonna finish up our development with E6 and you don't have to take all right you do not have to take this has no threat we're just gonna Castle G4 is a little too much for my liking okay we'll defend the pawn and we'll kick the queen out on the next move and remember okay been waiting for that the Knight can do damage uh where is the king going what a ridiculous move uh check and we're gonna try to get back into the position now now with the King there I had this but I play too fast and open up the position [Music] what what okay whoa all right now when you have a big material lead you can actually afford a little bit of material sacrifice as long as it means getting to the opponent's game and you'll notice that I did just lose a lot of material but I am getting to that King and uh it's going to be very violent here comes my Rook here comes my knight and yes I lost a bit of material for sure but it's the friends I made along the way that counts so ah [Music] takes check The Rook check please don't go here thank you thing is running we gotta cut the king off oh no I'm Mouse slipped all right time to pre-move the entire rest of the game scumbag oh my God I lost that Queen too oh let's go let's go what are you gonna do huh you got nothing you ain't got nothing all you're doing is wasting my time you're so lucky you are so lucky that I Mouse slipped oh let's go 19 minutes and 22 seconds not bad I mean not bad I I good principal chess for the most part taking advantage of I mean like all these Bots will hang a queen at some point if you just play well so I'm pretty proud of this performance but I think next time I'm gonna try to do it in 15 minutes so that concludes the beginner bot speedrun let me know your predictions for intermediate I'll see you then get out of here
