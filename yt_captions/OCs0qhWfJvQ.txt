this right here is a very affordable phone positioning itself as the number one go-to device for the sub 300 euro mock last year's honor 7x was a runaway success and so there is a lot of excitement with this one I'm also adding three honor 8 X phones to a running iPhone 10s giveaway so instructions for that are in the description below to say one thing the phone looks refreshingly different the back is glass but with two separate textures each side reflects light in a slightly different way and the transition is subtle but surprising the left side carries all the details while the right just the fingerprint scanner which is nicely located and easy to feel for and then at the bottom you've got a headphone jack and a microUSB port turning it around the display is an impressive 6.5 inches it's a 1080p IPS panel and the chin is only a fraction larger than the other three bezels which makes it screen to body ratio higher than the 1 plus 6 and samsung galaxy note 9 and then when you compare it to similarly priced phones like Charlie's me a 2 while obviously there is more to the story than this the screen looks good the money there are actually a few more benefits to be had with the display you've got video enhancement which dials up the contrast when you're watching video glare minimization so the display is even clearer under bright sunlight and then you've got Rheinland certified eye comfort mode which is like an official certification for eye protection in a similar way that an IP rating certifies water and dust resistance hardware wise the firm is packing the kieran 7/10 chip and 4 gigabytes of RAM with the base model bearing in mind that this is a budget priced phone performances ample and apps load up quickly I've already done a dedicated video on GPU turbo but that is a technology that is in action here and you'll feel it when playing games like pop G mobile and mobile legends this should then combine with the battery capacity of 30 750 milliamp hours to give some pretty great endurance results but we'll have to wait a bit for the 4/3 from the time I spent with it though I've been getting around six hours of screen on time on average camera wise you've got a pretty classic honor set up but with the twist this AI isn't exactly subtle and it sometimes adds a pretty serious vignette to photos and pushes contrast way up but there are cases when it's more than that for example it can detect scenes when the background is too bright and then take multiple shots at different exposures to compensate this is a twenty plus two megapixel setup and during the day era she captures pretty great photos colors come up bold shadows dark and detail is usually present in all parts of the image we've got port reload too but the most anticipated feature here is night mode and when I say night mode that might ring a bell because as with another firm we all know and love nightmare Don the 8x allows you to hold the phone steady for a few seconds while the phone captures the best parts of the image at different exposures using AI stabilization to keep blur to a minimum and the software is so powerful that it easily brings the 8x up to parity with some much more expensive devices normal video tops out at 1080p but you do get super slow-motion at 480 fps err you've got a 16 megapixel selfie camera - with all the wacky arrow modes you come to expect from an honor phone alright with new entrants like the pocke for an f1 the mid-range smartphone market has really heated up over the last couple of weeks having said that I'm excited about this firm it's taking a different approach it's got a unique visual identity from the back but also a massive amount of display on the front and while this is by no means a full review the fern is looking like it delivers a really slick experience for less honor is also launching a competition called cheer for on 8x and they're asking people to film a 15 second clip or any social comments in which you say something you like about the 8x put it on social media and tag their accounts with this hashtag and in return they've got a whole bunch of prizes you can find out more about that on my channels or the honor global channels thanks it off watching guys my name is Erin this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you guys next time [Music]
