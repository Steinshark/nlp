so a couple of weeks ago I tried to shift over from my iPhone to a flip phone I loved some parts of it others made me cry till I eventually decided this is not for me there needs to be more competition and more innovation in this market before I flip then techno reached out they said we've got this new flip phone we want to sponsor a video so you can tell people about it I told them listen I've just tested a flip phone I'm not ready to move to one that includes yours and they said that's fine just try it so I did and while I still won't be switching to it I am really glad this Phantom V flip exists and here are the 10 reasons why for starters the unboxing you get your nice premium packaging with every inner box having this faux leather finish your sim ejector your USBC cable of 45 or power brick a pretty nice feeling case that protects both sides of the phone and obviously the phone and I'm really glad that this is still a thing because yeah if you upgraded phones every year and very little change then of course like most big companies say you could just use the power brick and cable that you already had for the environment but the thing is most people don't upgrade every year the vast majority of people now are sitting in the once every three to four years bucket especially in the category of expensive falling points not to mention the fact that the power brick and the cable you already have are you not probably going to want to send those off with the old phone since that's what they were made for plus you'd still need a case ninety percent of people use one and so there's no real reason for a company to not give you one except for please spend another 50 on our website and we'll create an entirely different order and shipment that's in no way environmentally friendly okay then we've got the price foldable phones right now feel like they're in a bubble where just because the early starting prices were so high that it set the precedent that this is what a foldable phone should cost but with the first phones it made sense because to do something experimental you have to invest a lot in research and development to sell not many units but you know we're at our third to fifth generation of foldables with most companies these companies have already recouped those r d costs credit where do the flips have come down a bit since Jan and one with their default starting price at now a thousand dollars but like 1800 for one of the phones that should not be a thing today and so part of why I'm so glad that this thing exists is that it's a working example about this has a 1 to 120 hertz OLED display it has eight gigs of RAM 256 gigs of storage a pretty good Diamond City 8050 chip and it's 699 now with something like this happens in an industry it's good for all of us here's something else really cool so you know like every phone since the year 2000 has had a flash on the back this one actually has a really bright quad flash but the more interesting thing is that it also has a dual flash on the front and when I first saw this I thought wait that's pointless I mean most phones nowadays can already brighten their screens up when taking a dark selfie and that's the same thing right well no if you compare this shot taken with no flash to this shot with the screen brightening feature to this shot with the front flash you can see that while brightness goes up with the bright screen mode the sharpness doesn't and the color accuracy actually goes down it almost starts to look a little hazy and so I have actually found this front flash to be legitimately the best way to take selfies even in already good lighting it just lets your camera capture that little bit of extra facial detail I think techno's gestures are really clever like how I've got a pinch out to open chat gbte a swipe up with two fingers to bring up the vaults which is all your stuff that you can lock behind your fingerprint you can even do things like a clockwise rotation to instantly start a voice search okay this is also really smart design I've always liked leather-like finishes I want every single company to offer this as an option because it's just zero fingerprint hassle-free the hinge has a little bit more friction than I'm used to but the upside of that is that it holds in any position from about 20 degrees onwards I'm glad that when it folds it folds completely flat but more importantly the fact that it can do that while also finding room for the screen to rest without being pressed together which means that when it's open it doesn't really have a noticeable crease you can see it from some angles but it's good enough that during most day-to-day use it's literally as if it's not there which now that I've experienced it it's almost using how did techno on their first ever flip phone priced at 699 do that while others who've been doing this for years with more expensive phones have not either way I do hope this acts as an incentive for other manufacturers to get it right going forward and then you've got this cover screen which they call the planet design now I gotta say I'm not used to using circular screens but one thing this does do at least is feel like a very distinct experience to the inner display it kind of behaves like a SmartWatch with a bunch of these easy to flick through functional but not two functional widgets you've got things like Fitness you've got alarms and a stopwatch and it's all very pleasantly animated plus the music tile is pretty cool because it really does look like you're playing a vinyl and that leads me to the customization the customization settings here are absolutely endless and I'm all about it okay deep breath so for starters themes there's built-in ones and you can download like a thousand more you've got different live wallpapers that sync to how far open or closed your phone is static wallpapers with the ability to quickly find more and what I've done which is to cycle through them every single time I unlock my phone there's cover screen personalization where you can either lean in to the fact that let's be honest it really does look like a watch face you can go very abstract and artsy and stick a whale on there or you can just go all the way and get a pet or a stylized version of yourself which I don't hate nearly as much as I thought I would there's the always on display stuff which again lets you do basically anything you can think of including deciding how much or little information you want to see and that's not even touching the deep deep personalization which I could go on about for an entirely separate video but what's also really cool is the special functions section of the settings it's an entire subclimator things that you couldn't normally fiddle with on your phone all the way from app booster which lets you select a few of your favorite tabs and the phone will keep them ready for launch at all times to music gesture which lets you change the song that's playing by swiping on your screen even when the phone's on standby to Whatsapp voice changer which turns this voice terrorize your entire social Circle or the feeling particularly you can go to this voice and if you're enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be fun fantastic now I've always thought that flip phones are cool there are honestly few higher Pleasures in life than ending a phone call like this but what I find really difficult is feeling like I'm sacrificing functionality for the sake of being cool and that's what a lot of folding firms have done historically with battery there's still some compromise here it's a 4 000 million power cello getting but that paired with fast 45 watt charging actually feels pretty healthy compared to the 3700 million power and 25 watt combo that I've just come from with the Samsung also remember flip phones will last a lot longer than you expect just because you're spending a large portion of your time on a tiny cover screen and speaking of which number two the cameras this is the highest resolution overall package of cameras that you can get on a flip phone and obviously we're well past the point where that's the only important metric but the only reason I mention it is that I have multiple times now taken a photo with this phone forgotten about it seen it again another time while flicking through the gallery and only then realized wait a sec the detail can be insane it has the same caveat as every flip phone in its effort every time you want to take a real photo but the Selfies which are the defaults are really good in almost all lighting conditions with a nice balance of smoothing the skin but not erasing every last bit of texture and importantly for a flip phone like this it's good that you can activate the camera with gestures like a high five or voice commands but the thing that I found most interesting is the weird security features just lots of little tricks that no one would think to build into their phone but now they're here they make a lot of sense like just for example how after two failed unlock attempts your phone will start secretly taking photos of whoever's trying and upload those photos to the cloud which has resulted in an entire library of shops that look like this or if you stick the phone on charge and someone else unplugs it while it's still locked it'll ring at full volume these are great features to have built into a phone and I'd love to see others adopting them too
