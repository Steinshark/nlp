ladies and gentlemen recently I traveled to California to be a part of the streamer Awards oh and just in case you missed it I won chess streamer of the year 2022. now while I was out there I also made a pit stop I snuck into YouTube headquarters and I met a lot of great people had some wonderful conversations and challenged some folks to chess and one of those amazing folks is Leo olebe he's the global head of gaming for YouTube and in this video I'm going to show you the whole game and parts of our conversation that I had with Leo you see I didn't know Leo's chess ELO when we were going into the game but by the end of it I found myself in a situation where there was Checkmate in three on the board I hope you enjoyed this video YouTube thanks so much for having me hey what's going on I'm Leo olebe I'm Global head of gaming at YouTube I'm here sitting down with Levy also known as Gotham chess playing some chess and I am not the global head of anything at YouTube but I do have the largest chess Channel on YouTube hopefully for a while at least right now with amazing videos and awesome content and also he said it not me cool things you've been teaching me how to play chess for a while and so I'm I'm excited to have the opportunity to sit down with you destroy you in chess even though come on let's be real that's not gonna happen chess has this weird way of making people obsess over results in Elo but and I get a question a lot like hey I'm 30 I'm a professional what are my chances being a world champion and uh just I just tell people to enjoy the game I mean so far so good so you know many games it's the most popular position after one excellent one move in I remember you like you had a video like do all the things on the inside and then get the the people out here so we're gonna we're gonna do something we'll see what happens I like this strategy I'm just gonna we're following uh world championship games really yeah Spanish opening is that was that literally the Spanish opening yeah oh no we're still like oh I totally knew that I knew that we're still like in the Realms of you know modern known Theory and so on all right so we're gonna bring two so you obviously studied the Berlin variation absolutely I did you know you know what here's what I've always thought that there's like there's nothing better than the balloon fish Berlin variation after the Spanish open you're not how do they get how do they all get different names for these things usually Berlin is like the first person to play it played it in a tournament in Berlin oh yeah okay and then it sometimes they get names beyond that like uh whatever Shira variation because a guy named Shiro of night or so we need like the San Bruno spectacle yeah the San Bruno variation the San Bruno variation of the Berlin defense for for all of the terrible mistakes I'm about to make you know so far so good be great to see you also do streaming I know you have a lot of video on demand on the I think there's a lot of people that you can reach and you can teach like rhyming intended um by live streaming a platform and the thing that's really cool about that is you know like when you go live your live turns into archived live right and then your community has the opportunity to do clips from your live or clips from archive live that then they can you can then in turn get folks excited turn things into VOD and like it's like rinse and repeat so when I think about what does it take to be amazing on the platform and build this great like long-term business it's kind of touching it on live touching it in short touching it on VOD and giving those things the opportunity to kind of like reinforce each other it's almost like chess if you get it right I can't sit here and say that I have actively thought about streaming chess more on YouTube and I've rejected it I'm honestly just as good as I am at chess I'm a little bit of an idiot a little bit like slow on some of the other fronts not at all no no I'll tell you like um I was telling the folks out there my my guy who helps me with YouTube shorts and yeah this guy he told me in March 2022 to get into it in November okay yeah was telling me for a long time and it turns out I you know I just kind of thought I can't monetize them as well as long form no it's just one big ecosystem of the content that's exactly right that's exactly right that's the way I like to think about it and then also some days you want to go live some days you want to produce other types of content I did not intentionally like copy or move by the way thank you for threatening my uh Bishop Oh you mean like just like like I mirrored you like that didn't I it's hard to talk and play chess it's extremely hard yeah but you do that all the time poorly very poorly I play much better if I don't have to energy yeah yeah of course so interesting I know what I know what's going on over here I just want to take the bishop you're so baiting me that's not cool but okay you know what's funny okay so that's not a fair exchange it's not a fair exchange but that's something it's like you can do absolutely brilliant things without even realizing it so you just played something called like a fishing pole trap like you're beating me that's when you attack a piece and if they if you're castled yeah and there's a rook there so you have in Castle oh if we do this yes you can like open up some attack it's not a fair trade it's a gamble but right right because you totally know that I'm gonna move my you know H5 to H4 it's a g for it it's a GPS can I can I do that yeah really I could do this wait of course I can you're right I see what you're saying so I can do that you're just giving up the ghost here I did get a bishop though so you have to prove that this was a good sacrifice that was absolutely good it was a great sacrifice I'm I'm like I'm like 17 moves like ahead at least I don't know cover up my king none of this like fair trade stuff next thing you're gonna do is take my knight which is please don't do that like that would not be cool so I'm just gonna do that but you're inducing me to take it's a fair trade though it's not a bad move I mean if I take you just take back if it's not dangerous like I'm not even gonna do it you you said not to so okay excellent I like this this is good man I don't know what's happening all right I'm just gonna mix it up with that movie you can't make I can't make not because it's a mistake but like the online wouldn't even look oh of course duh sorry I didn't even see that we're playing like sideways and it's yeah I forget all the things that we were supposed to talk about it's hard to play chess and talk at the same time but that's okay because chess is just really fun so how long how long have you been playing chess for started when I was five yeah so my parents were deciding where to put me in Montessori after school because they couldn't be yeah one time yeah so my dad said art because he's a lunatic like there's no way he's gonna sit down for chess my mom said no let's put him into chess you know we have like uh you know former Soviet Union uh you know like Russian Jewish family you know there's a lot of Chess culture amazing and I I used to only go to chess class and I used to skip art completely like I would just run around really yeah I would hide in the tube uh-huh so they couldn't see me and they couldn't call me back to hard class that's cool and so then you could go go to chess class I would just only go to chess class I started playing tournaments when I was younger like seven years old in college I had to make the decision whether to do something more traditional you know corporate job or teach chess and then I decided like oh my God I gotta make moves I gotta make moves no it's not easy it's not okay you know what we can do that that's a good move now what you might find um crazy is I also have a Russian Jewish Heritage and my my family and my grandparents side are from Belarus and then also Moscow wow so I'm actually 33 Ashkenazi Jew and my family's from New York City as well so I'm I'm literally like a black Russian I was born in Nairobi oh my God yeah but like so like a lot of the Heritage you're talking about that's wild yeah I'm probably like 99.99 Ashkenazi Jew but I've never done amazing amazing yeah new we're brothers Brothers in chess I will take it that's that's so funny wow I wonder if Leo comes from that or maybe it actually does I'm named after my Russian grandfather named Leo and is is I could is um his last name was kofton wow I was named after my great-grandfather so there you go amazing that is so cool yeah my my grandfather was a um actually did was a pen pal with Tolstoy so we have like a Tolstoy letter it's like Haymaker after Haymaker of super cool historical facts I knew we were gonna Bond over this this is amazing is I don't even know whose turn it is is it my turn it's your turn but I don't know what did you do last I just retreated why did you Retreat are you attack you're playing brilliant moves you don't even realize I just like I'm getting a little chest Hustler Vibe you know like I don't know why this means like oh it's crazy I took your uh like what about this what about that no I'm trying to play extraordinarily conservative and then go ahead and eventually I'll get your bishop or both of them if you choose to do nothing oh my Bishop's yeah you're gonna take it should be great but I'm not worried because I'll take back so I'm gonna I'm gonna go here one thing that's interesting is I was talking to Renee about this and he said something really good I kind of said the same thing I forgot it was it was a really good quote he said something like chess is the game that every gamer plays and it's the same for athletes celebrities anybody when you have a couple hours what can you do on your phone you can play some game well there's a lot of popular games but yeah chess is it's fun and we were on the train the other day and I saw a guy's reflection in the in the window it was chess like three years ago it would have been something else but right now everyone's sort of getting into it realizing that it's not that hard like the learning curve is not that that intense and you're gonna Castle maybe I think chess is amazing like your videos are so compelling to watch and you teach people you draw them in like you've gotten me excited about Chess again and like oh like just trying to learn more and it feels like it's one of those games where it's like layer after later after like peel this and then it reveals that and and so I don't know my mind's just kind of going crazy I don't know how you kind of like parse it all when you're trying to think about how to even teach people and make more chess content yeah there's even a lot of layers to uh to the answer uh first of all on the teaching front I don't know when that really became a thing for me but I think I'm fortunate enough to have started teaching four and five-year-olds and six-year-olds so I had to break it down and oh that's cool and keep their attention that's how to make it simple and interesting yeah and get them excited about it because it's also building like a long-term I mean client if you will like you have to kid has to be excited totally and then I mean I just kind of started on YouTube but I have no idea what I was expecting yeah uh started making little Recaps here and there in the beginning it was like people were excited but also a little hateful because it was very small space I was a bit more sarcastic I wasn't really because oh you're not being serious enough yeah exactly I'm sorry that's exactly how chess actually you know in many cases is yes and I kind of wanted to break that some cases I did a good job in some cases maybe it was a little bit too much but now that like the growth of the channel is there I can say no I did all the right things that means that means you're the bad boy of Chess oh this bad boy baby but I think it's more just if you showed a hundred people yeah randomly Around the World Chess videos and you showed them my Channel or somebody else's channel it's not a knock on anybody else's Channel but they would continue to come back to mind because it's not just chess it's you get some jokes you get some current event reference you get a reference to a sport you get yeah you know I break the fourth wall like hey pay attention I know you're like running errands or listening in the shower or whatever I just I don't know I think I may humanize it a bit more so um well it's super fun you know you have like a really really this is the thing when you start playing chess and get into it 20 years and are you gonna play the move I'm thinking I am I don't know if you think what I'm gonna do is that the movie thought I was gonna do yeah I know we have to play competitively yes I'm gonna have to play the best move now no but yeah I'm sure you you have to play the best move yes we have to play the best move um but you have a really really amazing idea here okay first I'm gonna play the best move I'm gonna let you you know try to find you know what I'm trying to do all right I'm gonna go here okay you have to find Checkmate in three moves forced so you play a move yep yep it's gonna be check check the third move is Checkmate every move has to be a check every move has to be a check everyone has to be a check so essentially like it has to be a move and you have to have a check on the next move okay I might need help but I'm I like thinking about the guidance yup it's crazy you can sacrifice your queen yeah that's kind of crazy it's the nice move the next move is to to check right moving this guy probably well I guess it doesn't matter where he goes he's gonna get gone and is right but you should not have to go check right boom it's a double check to double check I saw that you you talked about double checks in one of your things dude look at how crazy I can't take and I can't Vlog I have to go here and now yes look how crazy that is look what we just made something just made something crazy I know that is so good we were just messing around and look so good so that's what I saw and I was like I was gonna set you up for that but you played the first move I didn't I didn't have to go here no but I would have had to defend but yeah that see this well if you if you had if you had not moved there could I have done the same thing well I was I saw it coming so I was like no I got to tell you it was actually very hard to defend again so uh I was happy that you found it now I would resign and then uh you know are you gonna do the little Tippy thing though you gotta like tip it we can okay we can zoom in on it yeah if it's uh technically the top guys when they when they get checkmated they just oh well your top guy said no no no you don't got to do it really you know that's not that's not good you're not supposed to rest on a pawn there we go thank you so much for making it this far in the video once again a big big shout out and a thank you to Leo and everybody at the YouTube team for having me when I went out to California can you give me like another minute minute and a half of your time I just want to explain this position to you uh before you go essentially what's going on here is that Leo and I stumbled into a position where black has a really really really serious threat and that threat is the fact that the queen and the Rook are forming a battery on the H file a long time ago when I took Leo's Bishop I opened that up for myself and in chess the two most important criteria for determining who has a good or a bad position is material and King safety and right now I am up material but my king is looking really really weak so what I would have had to do here I I allowed Leo to kind of test his creativity and find after Queen F3 the move Queen H1 which which is and one of the most incredible tactics I have ever seen which then gets a double check by both of these pieces slides back and now Rook H1 is made now after Queen H4 during the game I thought that the best move was for me to sacrifice my own Bishop with check a check is the most forcing move in chess and so Leo would not be able to make this move when he goes here I was thinking give him a check and then trade his Queen but that's actually also quite dangerous because the Knight will go back and suddenly he's creating a checkmating thread so it's not easy at all what I would have had to play here is I would have had to basically kick the window out and jump all right so that my King has a little bit of an escape path I'm gonna have to sacrifice my Pawn here and it looks dangerous but by some sort of Miracle it looks like I'm going to get checkmated but suddenly my Knights come to the rescue and they cover all of this of the checkmating squares and if he does this now my king can escape out to F2 so I have to I I have to say I during the game I saw that this was coming I hadn't really considered F4 yet maybe with a little bit more thought I had only considered sacrificing my Bishop but what a position that I found myself in and Leo is just like three or four hundred so it's just incredible like in chess you have to focus the whole time it doesn't matter how much you've played in your life or what the level difference between the two players is you might accidentally stumble into a really bad situation I was very lucky I could have maybe gotten out of this one but Queen H1 was a really really nice way to end the game uh and end that chat with Leo anyway I hope you enjoyed today's video now get out of here
