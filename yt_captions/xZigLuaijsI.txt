one of the biggest issues with replacing gas powered vehicles with electric ones has to do with recharging today is a simple and easy to fill up your gas powered car gas stations are convenient and ubiquitous you pay fill up the tank and boom you're done for electric vehicles things are different recharging can take a significant amount of time even at the more advanced charging stations having it take 30 minutes is not uncommon recharging should at least partially replicate the gas station experience but the task of building out an entire network on par with modern gas stations is pretty daunting but that is something that taiwan-based gogoro is trying to do with their battery swap stations in this video we're going to look at how gogoro built out its comprehensive super convenient 2000 station strong battery swap network across taiwan but first i would like to speak to you a little bit about the patreon if you like what this channel does you can support the work by joining the early access tier early access members get to see videos before they are released to the public so head on over to the patreon page and take a look i deeply appreciate anything you'd be able to sign up for thank you and on with the show taiwan has the highest density of scooter users in the world one out of every 1.67 people uses a scooter and most of those scooters are gas powered their foul smoke is a big contributor to taiwan's haze and air pollution problems it is not the only polluter of course but a significant one and an electric alternative would be a definite step in the right direction that is what gogoro is trying to do with their smart scooter gogoro was founded in 2011 by entrepreneur horus luke born in hong kong and educated in the united states luke had been the chief creative officer of handset maker htc he resigned to found gogoro alongside matt taylor htc's former chief technology officer the company launched the gogoro smart scooter in 2015 in taiwan it was not the first electric scooter to come out in the taiwan market others have tried before but with little success and there are a couple reasons why those electric scooters never caught on but recharging is a big one drivers accustomed to gas stations have what is known as range anxiety the concern that the ev's range might not be enough to reach its destination it continues to impede electrical vehicle consumer adoption today so in order for google road to be successful they need to tackle the recharging issue right off the bat thus that same year they began building out what they called the gogoro energy network at the heart of the energy network is the go station these battery stations allow customers to swap out a used battery for a new one 24 hours a day seven days a week users get access to the stations when they subscribe to a monthly plan they pay a flat fee and get a certain number of kilometers to drive if they go over that they pay per kilometer the process is quite smooth if your goguro starts running low on power you open up an app and it guides you to the nearest go station the go station is not a discrete place like a gas station but usually is like a kiosk at a 711 or some other building once you get to the go station you take the used battery out of your gogoro there too and plug it into an open slot on the station's wall the system will run diagnostics and record the battery's receipt then a recharge battery pops out somewhere for insertion into the scooter once the used battery is inserted the station can either quickly recharge it for future reuse or decide to hold off or until energy prices are cheaper a user study at a google row battery station finds that the average swap takes about 96 seconds the most commonly cited issue with them is that the batteries are a bit heavy being over 25 pounds or 12 kilograms the go station has a built-in screen that shows information about the battery reminders for maintenance and other information like the weather forecast the internal computer can connect to the greater gogoro network through cellular or wi-fi this centralized control allows gogoro to do several things first it can respond to instances of scooter theft if a goguro is reported missing the company can remotely disable access to its battery network eventually the stolen scooter is going to lose power second the company can look at usage data to determine where to build out additional stations and save on energy grid recharging costs considering how many stations there have to be every little bit helps gogoro's battery swap stations have to be convenient to both use and find that means building them out spot by spot by the end of 2015 the year of the smart scooters launch there were over 110 go stations mostly in taipei obviously taipei is not enough so the company thereafter built out stations in all of taiwan's metro areas including taitung my hometown of tainan and gauchon by the end of 2017 stations were added to yulin and jiayii as well making it possible for a google world owner to ride their electric scooter up and down taiwan's west side at that time the company announced that owners had completed over 4 million battery swaps and counting in december 2020 the company gave a presentation to announce that it had built over 2 000 go stations in taiwan with over 750 000 batteries currently in service the majority of the taiwanese population is now within one kilometer of a gogoro recharging station doing all of this took just five years regardless of what you might say about taiwan's density it is certainly an achievement in a podcast interview gorilla engineer daniel vickery says that the stations are quote about as cheap and about as simple to build as one of those coke machines this also enables goggle road to deploy these very fast we can take an existing city and transform it to be electric without pulling a bunch of building permits to do any construction or anything like that that may be so but building out a countrywide network will always cost a pretty penny i googled the cost of a coke vending machine and those sell for about three to four thousand dollars this number is a little lower than what taiwanese business articles say about how much each go station costs their consensus seems to be in the range of twenty eight thousand dollars to sixty four thousand dollars and that range makes more sense to me assuming the high end of about 64 thousand dollars on average since there are multiple variants of the go station including a super sized one that implies that gogoro spent upwards of 125 million dollars to build out its battery swap network and that does not include the cost of the 750 000 batteries currently in circulation around taiwan each of those cost somewhere north of 700 nor does it include the cost of renting the land or using the power grid that is a heavy cost to swallow for a privately held startup so let us talk about government subsidies subsidies play a big part in the eevee story for better or worse just look at the criticism of tesla for its reliance on regulatory credits to generate profits the belief is out there that the ev adoption trend is largely driven by corporate welfare in the aforementioned december 2020 presentation gogoro says that over half of its go stations were built out entirely with its own funds doing so allows for construction to happen sooner the rest of those go stations have received some form of government support 657 stations or a third overall got a 200 000 ntd or 7145 usd construction subsidy from the taiwan government and then about 300 stations belonged to taiwan's national oil company cpc corporation cpc looking to improve its environmental impact committed to rolling out charging stations to some of its 2400 petrol stations across the island this will help availability in rural areas so those battery swap stations are fully funded and subsidized by the taiwanese government through cpc the taiwan's government subsidy support has effectively deemed gogoro's battery swap technology the country-wide standard that has sparked some criticism but considering the lingering confusion in the united states with their various charging solutions i think it's largely acceptable other than that the taiwan government's approach towards ev scooter adoption has been limited to subsidies this is rather hands-off in comparison to places like norway where ev owners enjoy no vat free city parking and charging free toll roads and other such perks but i think this approach has benefited gogoro somewhat going by our earlier assumptions some eighty percent of the governor energy network can still be funded and built without a single dollar of government subsidies it's a healthy sign for other companies attempting the battery swap model when gogoro debuted its smart scooter the ev industry was still trying to decide between charging and battery swapping battery technologies continue to advance year after year as electric vehicle ranges increase and recharge times decrease charging stations become more feasible compared to battery swaps goguro does offer a mobile charging option for their scooters and it is important that owners can access that but the majority of the company's time and investment has gone into their battery swap strategy and rightfully so the google role energy network today can largely be considered a success widely available super convenient and affordable in the coming years the company says that their focus will be less on the build out of new stations but rather expanding the available battery slots at each existing station so growing capacity to match future scooter sales the big question is whether or not the battery swapping strategy can work with cars cars use bigger batteries than scooters and that makes the self-service model much less feasible in 2013 tesla demoed a autonomous battery swap solution in which robots would swap out the drain battery underneath a tesla s it was pretty nifty but a year later the company ditched that strategy likely due to consumer disinterest and worked on building out their supercharger network there remains just one private company trying to make battery swap stations for cars work china-based neo with their neo power stations their battery swap solution is futuristic and elegant but as of this writing they have less than 200 stations the network is far from widespread enough especially in the sprawl of china to fix the range anxiety problem furthermore the fact that neo prominently advertises alternate charging solutions like a power charger and a mobile van solution that comes and charges your car is a sign that they know it too having secured strong market share in the taiwanese electric scooter market goguro is embarking on exporting their technology to overseas markets recently the company established a joint venture with hero motor corp to enter the india market hero branded scooters using gogoro battery technology and swap stations would roll out in the world's second biggest two-wheeler market india's motorcycle market is said to be 18 times the size of taiwan's they have also recently struck deals with two very large chinese companies traditional scooter maker dcj and electric scooter maker yadia to build scooters in china the scooters would use gogoro's swappable battery technology and electric drivetrains the part of the scooter that sends power from the motor to the wheels this is a massive opportunity for the company china has formulated new environmental regulations for scooters and 270 million need to be upgraded by 2025. there are other obstacles to society adopting electric vehicles and mass that are not discussed in this video for instance i have not touched on the unique economics of the scooter itself but fixing the recharging issues were critical having figured out the situation in little taiwan gogoro is now on the way to making their solution the de facto standard around the world all right everyone thanks for watching that's it for tonight if you want more content you can like and subscribe to the
