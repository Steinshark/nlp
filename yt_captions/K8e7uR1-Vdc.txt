you probably don't need telling their Android is a very powerful and versatile operating system but Google is working on something else which may well end up being a direct replacement I split this video into four main sections and by the end of it we should have a pretty clear idea of what all the fuss is about so before we get into it a quick note on kernels computer kernels are the core of an operating system they provide the basic mechanisms around which the OS can be built and a lot of androids main problems come from the fact that it is based off the line of kernel which was not originally intended for phones and in fact Android the software itself was built initially for digital cameras so from its very core it isn't exactly specialized for what a phone it needs to do so what about for sure well this OS is based off a completely new kernel with two key benefits it is designed with the smart connected future in mind and is much less specific in his code and so built to work across a wider range of devices they call this kernel zircon all right so what's the benefit the reason that for sure OS is so powerful is that this kernel lets it run on pretty much everything everything from small phones and PCs to fridges and traffic lights one operating system for everything so as more and more small devices in our entering people's homes a single OS could essentially mean completely seamless integration between them your music could switch from your phone's speaker to your small speaker the moment you enter a room and your car could pick up your Spotify session if exactly where you left off when you walked out the building also with Android voice commands kind of feel like a tacked on feature whereas actually they have the potential to be even easier than interacting with your phone using your fingers and so for sure will kind of be built around this idea alongside much tighter security measures it could solve what is arguably one of androids biggest downsides and that is fragmentation fragmentation is the reason why a lot of these phones don't perform as well as their hardware is capable of is the reason why updates are all over the place and it exists because Android is a bit of a jumbled mess Android has software kernel and drivers all woven together in a slightly different configuring reach device this means Google can't just push an update through to every Android phone out there these three aspects have to be decoupled manually by OEMs like Samsung and HTC Google has very little control over how people experience Android on 95% of phones and this is a problem because these OEMs don't really have an incentive to keep your device updated they'd have an incentive to maintain performance over two years that you might use a phone if anything they want your current devices to become obsolete so you'll buy more hardware which is where their profits are for sure is simpler it's cleaner it's built with updates in mind and it's also one of the ways that Google can actually regain control over the end-user software experience also for sure OS is written on the flutter software development kit which is important because this works with Android 2 meaning that it's very likely Android apps will be able to run on it obviously this is completely critical for any potential new operating system it's not like Google could just start from scratch with the vast library of apps and games they've built on Android so then you might be wondering what does pusher look like because Fisher is such an adaptable bit of software it doesn't need a visual UI to run but if you were to have it on a small phone we've got a pretty good idea of what it might look like a very early apk file was leased last year and basically it's a list but instead of one list that leads to another everything is on this one page and you never really leave the page all applications you open operate within their own space and one tab back home just minimizes them it seems very focused and the emphasis on accounts logging in and logging out reinforces its online nature interestingly there's a volume and brightness slider right on the home page which may well mean there's no status bar is different with us to be expected with an OS built on entirely different DMA okay so the big question is for sure about to replace Android maybe definitely not in the next couple of years but Google has dedicated enough resources to this project they've actually got over a hundred engineers working on it right now to kind of show that it's more than just a cytosol this is a serious part of Google's vision of the future in fact only a couple of weeks ago we found out that for sure is now already being tested on smartphones after a code change was found on the honor play so what do you think are you excited about the connected future we're moving towards or are you just a little worried that Google is slowly but surely controlling more and more aspects of our lives let me know in the comments down below as always thank you so much for watching my name is Aaron this is mr. he's the boss I don't catch you in the next one [Music]
