so I end up going to prison for 16 months this was my first impr prison in prison I told Hamas about this encounter with the Israeli intelligence in prison in prison I told them the truth and this is my plan but they said is this everything I said this is everything I said no you write more so there is nothing else so who's your handling what's your mission like they did not give me any Mission Hamas became suspicious of me instead of helping me I became a suspect but my father is one of the founders of the movement so they could not torture me but in the meantime they were torturing hundreds of other prisoners for suspicion of collaborating with Israel dozens were killed during that time and hundreds were tortured they destroyed their lives completely and they were brutal didn't this some of this was taking place in the prison you were in in prison all of it I see so I'm talking about the 16 months of a nightmare Beyond anyone's imagination where I am suspect but they are not touching me while everyone else everyone around me is being tortured and killed for 16 months and I was wondering is my turn going to come because of my father's status and their hypocrisy and of course their shame uh they did not do anything anything uh to me but the thing is I didn't up to that point I did not betray I did I just told them the truth not under pressure I thought you know they could help me that this is my plan and this is how things went wrong between me and Hamas to the core when I was released from prison after 16 months Hamas followed up outside prison my father was still in prison but different Israeli prison at that time so he wasn't there to protect me and I was outraged are was he in prison with you no no no my father was in a high security prison I was in a like more of a jail okay okay so he was in inside prison to protect me and when I was released he was still in Israeli prison my father spent some 30 years of his life in Israeli prisons so now outside the prison Hamas is coming after me say like just keep us posted what's going on and now uh they're I don't want to say blackmailing me but uh in the human nature the Handler of Hamas uh found opportunity actually to um to take a to Total Advantage he wanted me to become somehow like his  and I was in a situation I prefer to die you know I did not betray my people I don't have any intention to betray anybody I was thought that okay you know we're fighting against occupation and this is the way to just become a Shahid and exit all this tragedy for good so I was going suicidal I did not mean you know to uh to sell my people for money so the only Refuge was left on the table is to actually go to the Israeli intelligence and ask them for help from Hamas this time because Hamas what were they requiring of you the the the Hamas Handler what what was being required of you the moment they put you at defense and you are in a society like this where everything is ruled based on shame and honor it's the most shameful thing you they can ask you to do whatever they want you to do and it's up to the individual it's not even to the Hamas movement so and they're going to hold it against you for eternity what kind of life is this it's like someone is holding something against you but and nothing will clean that shame no matter what you do except if you die even if I became a suicide bomber the shame will hunt me to my grave this was the reality of it so this is where I think everything just went out of control I was like since childhood I had no mercy from these people and right now trying to actually just Escape My Misery by dying for Allah by dying for the nation against the Zionist occupation they're coming after me so this is my psychic and I was no matter what I do even if I die I will never be able to please them and why would I die so in the first encounter with the Israeli intelligence I told them the whole truth how did you make contact with them they made a contact after I was released from prison this was the original plan wasn't it yeah okay yeah so after I was released from prison uh they contact me and um in the first meeting I asked them why didn't you come to help the people who were tortured in prison if you now want me really to work for you you abandoned money you abandoned me they said none of these people who were tortured and killed had any relationship with the Israeli intelligence it's all in Hamas head the Handler said I have been working with the agency for 18 years one asset in our district was was cut in the action and this Man still alive in the United States and he gave me the name of that person he said this is is the only one this is the only true story the hundreds of others who have been killed had no relation they are all innocent people well if he was telling me the truth this is even uh more disastrous and uh I decide to go to the second to go back to the second meeting and the third meeting and every meeting they were just building me up I was so broken building you up in what way building me up in uh education uh conversation open conversation about who they are what they do uh and so this is when your political attitude started to switch your your attitude towards history not yet this was just the early beginning it was the early beginning because simply um they said here's money you go back to school and and they gave me enough money exact amount that pays for my school and when I needed the to uh to do anything Financial they said not possible we cannot give you any amount of money because if we give you money and you do you cannot prove where you got this money from they will kill you so I said you only go to school oh what's my mission there is no Mission there was no gun there is no goh SP what school did you go so did you go back to high school back to the high school I graduated from high school but also they wanted me to go to college and I graduated four years college and during that entire time they funded my education and my education only and there was no other deal than that there is was no other deal why did they do that because this is how they work and this is how the Israeli intelligence work they said from the beginning they said listen we don't work with losers it doesn't matter like the fact that you are son of a Hamas leader does not qualify you you must be like us you need to think like us and you need to be a part of your society and you need to be productive you cannot be a loser if you are a loser you will not gain the respect of your own society and they did a long process of uh fool in Hamas uh that we don't have a relationship that included you know some attack on our house some arrests in the future uh all type of Illusion uh orchestrated by the Israeli intelligence to just convince the society that I was a wanted person at some point that there was no way in the world um that I had a relationship with the Israeli intelligence especially when Hamas start building their trust with me again and I had uh top secrets of the movement but the Israelis did not act uh upon my intelligence or my information to just keep Hamas feeling safe for as long as possible um so part of the building me up you know it was we had hundreds of meetings and uh ER they showed me uh many of the values for example when we got into operation later on civilians were involved we avoid civilians every time um the civilian involvement was a big concern for the agency and I was really surprised because I thought that the wisdom on the Palestinian street that the Israelis will give you poison to put in the town's water they will give you a gun to shoot your own people they will make you rape women and take uh footage of them so you can blackmail them uh they will all type of crazy stories that they had it had nothing in reality [Music]
