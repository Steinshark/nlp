how to find time after work hey you can say hi YouTube you can say hi YouTube okay you can say hi to them can you can you say please like the video subscribe super thanks me my software development colleagues often ask me where do I get all the time for reading all the techbooks and articles watching conference talks and listening to podcasts I analyzed my consumption for November December and here is what I did and that's only Tech rated content all right I bet a lot of you are getting excited right now also I do want to notice something you guys at this point get your Tech articles by listening to me read the tech articles hi YouTube subscribe yeah thank you thank you for saying that that's facts uh listen to seven podcast episodes five hours listened to a half of an audio book got them I got a half and I actually have three qus of an audio book done actually I only have like two hours left of Dune book two uh watch six EP uh videos uh talks from uh some conferences six hours read three books 12 hours what are you reading like a children's book what kind of book can you read in four 4 hours uh read plenty of articles on the internet and offline medium okay well come on medium come on I paid for medium okay I paid for medium just to be the most disappointed person in that you know of right speed reading well that's 60 hours uh for two months so that seems huge and 30 hours per month seems reasonable which means around 7 hours per week seems doable in one hour per day that sounds easy that's 1 hour per day that it has to be available for learning wait a minute should I sacrifice one hour of my precious spare time for learning things that I need at work no way uh I hear this argument all the time I hear it all the time and I do want to just throw in something a little bit here which is that you shouldn't look at it this way in general if this is your thought if this is how you think of it when you hear this statement I want you to do a little reorienting here it's not about what you need for work in the moment I want you to work and learn things in which is in the area you want to be in right that you want to be an expert in something that you want to take a lot of time in and be able to do that for a decade long experience right and so you shouldn't look at learning as something that only complement what you're doing at your job right now it should be where you want to be right keep pushing towards that one thing and then it doesn't matter about your current job it matters about where you're going to be and it just makes learning 10 times more exciting right it just does you don't have to because you don't you need that time for writing blog posts coding and to prepare conference docks it's not free time AKA time where I can do what I want for parents care and play with the children uh it's time between working uh working hours free time and sleeping time let's call it Duty time isn't there a better term for that Duty time I'm not sure Duty time is the time that we have spent for going to work purchase uh purchase food cook dinner going to sleep and so on all activities that we do have to do besides your primary work okay yeah life responsibilities okay the trick is to refine some of the duty time for learning time okay for example uh commuting every day 2 by 45 minutes to my workplace and back home dude right then and there right here you know what you should also consider doing leave the Bay Area okay Walnut Creek ain't worth the commute in to San Francisco okay ain't no way I dude commuting is nuts okay the fact that we built a life around everybody living in the exact same city or city superplex where they just commute all day is just insane when I was living in the Bay Area I tried to move as close as I could to my job I was like 15 to 18 minutes away and I was considered like a super short commute it was just the worst even those 15 to 20 minutes depending on sometimes traffic got real bad it was like 22 minutes uh even with that it was such an emotional drain it was so bad sure I'd listen to podcast and all that crap but still I hated it I hated it 5 minutes to get to the train station with my bike 10 minutes to wait for the connecting trains 25 minutes on the trains 15 minutes to get uh from the train to my working place and vice versa that alone makes 90 minutes of Duty time per day or 80 almost freely available learning time I don't like listening to podcasts while I'm riding my bike which makes 10 minutes a day that I can't use okay safety purposes I like it uh I also love cooking uh but I also have to clean up the kitchen afterwards let's say that uh takes me 40 minutes 40 minutes of Duty time 40 minutes to uh 40 minutes time for watching videos of conference talks uh you know I always have a hard time mixing activities you know what I mean and what I mean by mixing activities is that you can really only get the most out of something if you're engaged right uh there's there's a whole thing that's kind of going on with this part like if you love cooking you should do the cookings you know what I mean there's something about taking and constantly splitting up our time to always maximize it that I think kind of robs you of the joy of the activity you're doing and really what you get out of out of it right like I love uh I I really want well actually something I really want to do is get really good at grilling and so when I do grillings like I turn off everything I don't look at anything it's about just being in that one moment doing that one thing super super well right and it's just you know griller confirmed I love the idea of grilling right I want to be that dude mult I think multitasking is just I honestly think it's bad for your soul I think it's really really like it's something you got to be careful of um there's something about being engaged in the thing you're doing that's really good uh if I want to I read in the evening okay that's free time so it doesn't count or listening to an Audi book to calm down uh or before falling asleep yes that's Duty time see it's this it's this constant like trying to get everything out of stuff uh that gives me easily another 30 minutes per day I can easily transform 2.5 hours of Duty time per day that I can use for at least 1 hour of learning time I don't even have to use half of the available time that's good because I'm not good at listening while I cope vegetables with a sharp knife I'm not sure what cope vegetables means I'm not sure what this phrase means but it seems exciting I think it also depends on the right tools for using Duty time efficiently uh too for example I can't do any housekeeping fully capable or with a stationary desktop PC so I've invested some money in optimizing my media consumption a smart tablet Dell ven Venue 8 Pro for watching talks while working in the kitchen and traveling by train luckily a few sites allow you to download videos offline for viewing a smartphone with plenty of storage okay uh two uh because uh one for the spare if the other one is charging Bluetooth headphones Phillips sb4000 for high quality Interruption free lising what what is this wired headphones with good noil shielding all right Bluetooth some Bluetooth all right if I'm on the move I mostly use my smartphone and wired earphones uh at home it depends if kids are around while I'm doing work I use the headset and bone conduction headphones what the hell is bone conduction uh otherwise headsets I also think it doesn't matter if you're 100% concentrated on all the stuff you consume this way you're always getting key facts or main ideas it's really important information will be spared to be consumed in my free time anyways because it's worthwhile for important stuff I write down notes and a notebook that I have almost always on me these notes will be uh will be hopefully F uh featured in some upcoming blog posts um I don't know so I I take a really really really really different approach to this I'm going to give you kind of my Approach right after this last sentence and I think it's different there's plenty of time out there that wants to be uh that wants to be spent well update 2023 I still do uh do it this way and can keep up with the news and it and more what I would now recommend practice listening to audio in at least twice the speed as the original to get used to that increase the speed by 0.1 every month okay so I'm I'm I'm I'm going to go with two things okay I'm going to go with the philosophical thing and I'm going to go with the Practical thing uh number one philosophically there's definitely like a heavy tone of like consumerism in here in the sense that it's just like a constant consumption the point is to constantly be consuming something at all points like you're you're just nonstop like life gluttony and so I do think that there is something very worrisome about that in general I've even been trying to practice not listen to anything and just being okay with silence right like constantly trying to be intentional in the thing I am doing and so the constant consumption can lead you into this life of constantly needing consumption right you kind of almost develop a dependency on consuming itself all form of consumption is in some sense an addictive trait right uh no matter how much you don't want to agree with that that's fine I don't care this is my take not your take but I think that there's some like high level of something in there it's like a stimulus addiction yeah exactly um but second like more practical purpose thing I have been trying to do the opposite of what's being said here uh instead of just constantly maximizing every fractional second everything doing something uh for good portions of the day I will do a singular activity with all might and strength and I refuse myself to uh kind of go off the rails even when I'm waiting for CI CI is uh what's it called takes two minutes I will watch logs I try not to let myself become distracted and if I have something to program as I'm watching the logs go I go back and program that thing right so that my way my next run because right now I'm doing some CI work right I'm just like doing the thing I'm not going on Twitter while it's building I'm not changing my YouTube list while I'm doing I'm not listening to Great asmin gold takes while I'm I'm doing it we're not listening to Kit Boga scam the scammers I'm just doing the thing while I do it and I find that by doing that for like 4 hours a day it's equivalent of doing other things for 8 hours a day which opens up a huge amount of time to then do also focused learning you know what I mean so that way I can do super focused learning on something else now when I'm doing something that's really boring and I don't care and I'm just fine and I want like I usually set set aside my morning times to listen to podcasts and stuff while just doing some basic work and kind of just adjusting things then I'll do that I have like my kind of mixed my mixed area to get caught on stuff and then my focus time to really be successful at stuff and so my focus time comes afterwards usually later in the day it helps me it makes me feel more I think awake and everything so for like the last four hours of work I'm very focused then after that I go really focused with just the kids and the wife and then I want to focus on dinner and cleaning up and then I focus like I just focus at one thing at a time and then I sit down with my kids and read them 45 minutes Wheel of Time book four right now and then I just kind of just keep on doing this like very high focused no Mindless approach and that's that so there you go it's just something I've been thinking of which is almost the opposite of this article and I feel like I accomplish all the things he accomplishes I've read four books in the last year but the books were 5 600 pages long you know what I mean so it's like it's like a different approach to life I would say I don't know I'm not convinced The Continuous consumption is good but I am convinced that being focused time is good you know like just doing the thing I don't know I feel like you'll use less time this is why I never uh never ever listen to music while I'm working I find myself annoyed that any of my brain Cycles are going to uh the music and working interesting yeah I've been turning off music a lot lately too uh do you do audio books I have done a lot of audiobooks yes um during I like I said I have that morning to kind of I call it distracted time it's an intentional distracted time it's where I just listen to things and kind of just like just do these tasks that I know I have to do that are just they feel very brainless right uh anyways I do music but no lyrics uh trying to C right now would you please keep it down a little bit absolutely uh the brain needs downtime let's see I do some of my best thinking don't laugh in the bathroom uh especially when showering yeah showering really helps because you so the reason why that the reason why that happens is you've developed a habit in the shower of not being able to consume and you actually just unlock your brain's ability to do thinking I know this sounds really weird but that's what I mean that's what most the world was like I I do think that that's why we see some really amazing writings from Over the thousands of years things that have lived for thousands of years observations on life stories and all that kind of stuff because they had more time to just sit and do a thing without all the continuous distractions I feel like we're just going to get less and less of that as time you know as as we just have just pure constant distractions it's tough do one thing do it well and do it until you're done yeah showering is garbage collection confirmed yeah that's why I do my best thinking I feel like sometimes in the shower cuz it's almost like like a form of meditation you know what I mean it's meditation because it's like I cannot do any other thing other than thinking on a singular topic thank you for coming to my TED Talk the name is it's odd that you're you know it's it's kind of odd that you're watching me on Twitch probably while working and I'm telling you to focus uh you know I'd really appreciate if you maybe stick around for my portion of the day and then other people's portion also you know you can also check out some other people but you know make sure you also have time to you know do the Thing by itself okay don't don't get too distracted cool stream thanks see you um the name is the prime J
