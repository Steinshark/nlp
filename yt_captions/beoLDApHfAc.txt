in the entirety of last year the one smartphone that gave me the biggest goosebumps moment that feeling of holy cow this is cool was Qualys p30 pro so you can probably imagine the p40 pro is exciting to me and this time round they've dropped not just a p40 pro but also a p40 pro plus which does sound a little bit like a way branded protein bar but it's actually their new tier of super phone first up the standard p40 pro the box isn't a massive departure from prior Huawei phones with the exception of this explore it on App Gallery label there's the smartphone which I gotta say has some immediate weight to it a tray and then your standard fare insert containing a sim eject tool and a TPU case it's simple very lightly textured on the inside with a little huawei logo on the bottom corner the rest of the unboxing experience is very familiar whoa is 40 watts super charger a USBC cable and a pair of reasonably capable wired earphones [Music] so I've got my p30 Pro here and the most immediate change is that the camera module is even bigger we've seen quite a lot of this over the last few years cameras are becoming the biggest differentiating factor between flagships so they're slowly invading more and more of the backs of our phones attack of the cameras that makes it sound like a low-budget Star Wars film as for that finish I will say this the p20 Pro was pretty much the first phone to introduce a gradient finish I loved it the p30 Pro came with Aurora which took that to the next level and so a very small part of me is disappointed that they didn't take this to the next level with the p40 but on the other hand I had the widest grin on my face when unboxing this because it now has a matte finish it's still an evolution just maybe not in the direction we were expecting but understated design sells there's a reason why pretty much every company makes a plain black version of their phone you flip it around though and there's no subtlety here the p40 pro is the first smartphone in the world with what they call an overflow display it's curved on not just the sides but also the top and bottom although from what I can see it looks more like it's the glass that's doing most of the curving hair not the display you only have a cup of water and you filled it right to the brim and there's a little bit of surface tension on top yeah that's kind of what this screen reminds me of and it's a good display I remember my first thought being just wow that's a clean bright panel but about an hour later I noticed something it is minor but I just can't unsee it there's quite an unusual lack of symmetry here besides have a different thickness to the top which in itself has a different thickness to the bottom you've got I think the biggest hole punch cut out I've ever seen on phone positioned in what feels like a fairly weird location I almost want to just push it a millimeter to the left but the thing that irks me and this could just be me it might not bother you at all but it's the corners because of how the glass curves down here and it curves down here you've almost got four points in the bezel that feel like they're protruding anyways there's also an under screen fingerprint scanner and it's about 30% larger and 30% faster than last year and that makes more difference than you think it's still a standard optical scanner but the extra sensor area means you can almost miss the icon and/or still scan your finger plus there's secure 3d face unlocking thanks to an infrared sensor hidden in this hole punch which does somewhat explain the size of the protrusion it's great face unlocking though it even works perfectly in a dark so may be worth the trade-off what I really like here is that yeah it's not a small phone but at least why isn't trying to build a tablet like it feels like a lot of companies are doing now it's got a six point five eight inch OLED display and with its narrow sides I'd say it's more manageable than Samsung's s 20 plus + s 20 Ultra with quite an unusual screen resolution of 26 40 by 1200 that sits somewhere between full HD Plus and quad HD plus so it's not the sharpest screen out there but I'm someone who tends to keep their phone running up full HD anyways so it definitely feels sharp enough and he probably wouldn't want to use this on quad HD plus even if it was an option the phone already has a 90 Hertz refresh rate to improve screen fluidity and not the biggest battery of four thousand two hundred and milliamp hours so adding an ultra high resolution on top of that might be pushing it a step too far I'm not saying battery will be bad here the wolly software is famously aggressive meaning that it prioritizes the minimization of background processes to preserve battery but detailed battery comparison coming in a couple of days so if you could subscribe for that that would be amazing now why has always paid attention to their cameras and if the size of the module wasn't already indication enough the p40 Pro and Pro Plus which I'll get to are no exception in fact in a way I'd say this is their biggest jump yet when it comes to cameras the central component is the sensor and for the most part a larger sensor equals better photos so last year the Kwame P 30 Pro brought in a almost market-leading sensor size Samsung then leapfrogged about this year with the s 20 ultra but and how the p40 Pro has just worn up that it's a 50 megapixel main camera which I realize is not that helpful a figure but while we said it'll capture the kind of detail don't mean each photo can tell multiple stories at once that you could crop into any part of a shot and see enough detail that all stand a in its own right in practice I'm not sold on that angle but what I can say is that whilst it might not be number one in this race foot pixels from the time I've spent with it so far I think this takes the best photos I've ever seen on a phone within five minutes of testing it I've come to that conclusion and I stood by after hours more shots a lush but not in a really fake way for some older Huawei phones have tended towards the large sensor means natural background blur none of this at all was taken in portrait mode and you can quite comfortably crop into these photos and still have a pin sharp result and there's a whole lot more going on in terms of both the software and the hardware of this camera system for example octave phase detection autofocus for in other words practically instant focusing on whatever pops interview not to mention the weight given to AI features this time around the p40 probe comes with the same keren 995 g chip that we saw on the mate very pro last year but according to what way it's any with this phone that they've truly taken advantage of it's AI capabilities I was a bit hesitant with the way AI is constantly used to market smart phones but these are core features in the past Huawei Ferns could recognize environments and pets and sort of then tune your photos accordingly but that range of scenarios that it can now recognize is far greater they can know which sport to take a photo off the posture of people sitting around you and even their facial expressions so in theory this better understanding leads to better photos so for example it'll know you're taking a photo of an annoying reflective object and it can reduce reflections Orica know if someone has just jumped into the back of your photo without you realizing completely ruined it it can snap them out of existence you can literally see it in action take a photo wait two to three seconds and then watch the AI do its work but more importantly I'd say is that this image processing engine is also important for night mode and I was expecting to be amazed here whoa is p20 Pro a couple years ago that phone blew me away the p30 Pro blew me away again and sure enough it is even better now this right here is a screen recording to give you an idea we're in almost pitch black and yet and it's just phenomenal the photos shot in dim rooms look like they could have been taken with flood lights shining on them not to mention you can literally point the camera up at the sky and handheld capture photos like these and video and while we ferns have historically focused on taking good photos but videos never been a priority well it seems like p40 is a big jump in the right direction you can take 4k video on the front camera and the rear can now do 4k at 60 frames per second as well as that crazy ultra slow 7680 frame per second video that we saw on the mate 30 pro the video is also now steadier than before the phone combines optical image stabilization with AI stabilization and it works better in low light as someone who gets excited about cameras this has been a fun few days but I always feel like there's a more important trend going on with this phone so the way it works with most flagships is you have one amazing primary camera but then all the other cameras on the phone the ultra wide the telephoto your front cameras they all kind of play second fiddle to this you feel this noticeable drop in quality when switching between them and this is something Huawei is absolutely nailed as well as that maned 50 megapixel camera you get a 32 megapixel dual front-facing camera which is definitely the best I've ever seen from the company this was taken with the Sun directly behind me and this was taken in a dimly lit room and you can still crop in and see details there's a high-end 40 megapixel ultra wide camera a time-of-flight camera for death detection and the telephoto camera is even better than last years it has five times optical zoom with better stabilization and a much better sensor so more than ever it doesn't feel that your camera system has a weak link if that makes sense although I'll save any detailed comparisons for a separate video coming very soon now that telephoto camera serves as a pretty perfect segue to talk about the elephant in the room because yes this time around Huawei has a p40 a p40 pro but also a p40 Pro Plus it's a strategy we're just starting to see this year have a normal flagship have a pro flagship and then have like a an ultra level flagship because all because it makes more profit take a look at Samsung there'll be a whole load of consumers that drawn into buying a Galaxy S 20 because it does have amazing specs very hundred pounds here in the UK but a portion of those people will then start comparing it to the s 20 plus and the s 20 ultra and before they know it have convinced themselves that they're actually willing to pay 50 percent more to get those extra features the ultra gives the least value for money out of the entire s 20 lineup but it's the best selling model so with that in mind the p40 pro plus takes the p40 Pro and dials a couple of things up to the next level that quad camera set up for example now becomes a Penta attack of the cameras you heard it here first it's actually a bit of a shame I do have a p40 Pro Plus on its way to me but it's stuck in customs so I haven't actually used it yet but the extra lens it adds is interesting pop always essentially swapped out the five times zoom camera on the pro for two different zoom cameras one with three times optical zoom and one with ten times ten times optical zoom that's a world record and in fact it's doubling the p40 Pro and pretty much every other small f---ing camera out there the three times is just there to give you more consistency as you kind of slowly zoom into things if you just had a 10 times zoom your photo quality at say 5 times zoom would kind of suck and the other thing is finish this phone swaps out glass for nanotech ceramic which supposedly has the strength of sapphire and the reflective index of diamonds okay so a couple of important things about the p40 probe before I bring this all together I want to just make a distinction between power and speed because this phone with its Kiran 995 G chip and eight gigs of lpddr4 X Ram is not the most powerful phone on the market and you might feel it in heavy tasks like emulation and gaming but at the same time I would say it's one of the fastest phones we're at a stage where the general speed of your phone is less about processor and more about things like how fast your software is and how is mui combined with this new 90 hurt screen refresh rate does make this phone fly whether it's menus webpages or apps and on that note this software is largely the same as what you used to but it comes with a new voice assistant tsylia it's obviously very early days so I won't judge it yet but early impressions are that it talks with a fluent English accent which is good but also that it seems to struggle with things that should be child's play for an assistant always app gallery is a bigger focus here because that's the main way you're going to download apps on it but I want to save this for a separate video because there's so much to it and what it means the phone also I mentioned that the wired charging is a forty watts but new here is that you can wirelessly charge at 40 watts you will still have to buy a wireless charger separately but all of a sudden and being able to wirelessly charge with outer speed compromise makes it a much more tantalizing offer the phone has a four layer cooling system ip68 water and dust resistance support for expandable storage Wi-Fi six-plus functionality and no headphone jack okay so my impressions of the p40 pro after a few days of using it of it it has many many steps in the right direction and pretty much every aspect of the p30 Pro is better here display camera performance but we're just gonna have to wait and see on those detailed camera and battery comparisons how this stacks up to its current competition so thanks a lot for watching and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
