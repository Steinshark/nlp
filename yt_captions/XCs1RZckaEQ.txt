modern software development summarized originally titled why I hate Frameworks by Benji Smith Let's Pretend I've decided to build a spice rack I've done small woodworking projects before and I think I have a pretty good idea of what I need some wood a few basic tools a tape measure a saw a level and a hammer if I were going to build a whole house rather than just a spice rack I'd still need a tape measure I saw a level and a hammer among other things so if I go to the hardware store and buy the tools and I ask the sales clerk where can I find a hammer a hammer yes nobody really buys a hammer anymore they they are kind of old-fashioned surprised at this development I'd ask him why well the problem with hammers is that there there are so many different kinds Sledge hammers claw hammers ball peen hammers wow uh everyone loves a good old-fashioned ball peen hammer what if you bought one kind of hammer and then realized that you needed a different kind of hammer later you'd have to buy a separate hammer for your next task as it turns out most people really want a single Hammer that can handle all of the different kinds of hammering tasks you might encounter in your life I feel like I can see where this is going hmm well I suppose that sounds all right can you show me where to find a universal hammer no we don't sell those anymore they're pretty obsolete really I thought you just said the universal Hammer was the wave of the future as it turns out if you if you make only one kind of hammer capable of Performing all the same tasks of those different kinds of hammers then it isn't very good at uh at any of them driving a nail with a sledgehammer isn't very effective and if you want to kill someone there's really no substitute for a ball peen hammer no what really a quite factual statement no one wants to kill someone with a sledgehammer what are you a Warrior from Diablo 4 okay us regular humans use ball peen all right that's true so if nobody buys Universal hammers anymore and if you're no longer selling all those old-fashioned kinds of hammers what kind of hammers do you sell actually we don't sell hammers at all so well according to our research what people really need wasn't a universal Hammer after all it's always better to have the right kind of hammer for the job so we started selling Hammer factories capable of producing whatever kinds of hammers you might be interested in using all you need to do is Staff the hammer Factory with workers activate the Machinery by by the raw materials pay the utility bills and Presto you'll have exactly the kind of hammer you need in no time flat this article is getting a little too close to home right now is this is this where we get that the the phrase like just a hammer in search of a nail the goal is this where the golden Hammer anti-pattern comes from but I don't really want to buy a hammer Factory that's good because we don't sell them anymore but I thought you just said we discovered that most people don't actually need an entire Hammer Factory some people for example will never need a ball peen hammer maybe they've never had to kill someone no dude why is that analogy even present [Laughter] or me or maybe they killed them with ice picks instead so there's no point in someone buying a hammer Factor they can produce every kind of hammer Under the Sun yeah that makes a lot of sense so instead we started selling schematic diagrams for Hammer factories enabled our clients to build their own Hammer factories customize Engineers to manufacture only the kinds of hammers they would actually need let me guess you don't sell those anymore nope sure don't as it turns out people don't want to build entire factories just to manufacture a couple hammers leave the factory building up to the factory building expert that's what I always say and I would agree with you there yep so we stopped selling those schematics and started selling Hammer Factory factories wait Hammer Factory building factories each Hammer factory factory is built for you by the top experts in the hammer factory factory business so you don't need to worry about all the details that go into building a factory yet you still get all the benefits of having your own customized Hammer Factory churning out your own customized hammers according to your own specific Hammer designs well that doesn't really I know what you're going to say and we don't sell those anymore either for some reason not many people were buying the hammer Factory so we came up with a new solution to address them uh-huh when we step back and look at the global tool infrastructure we determined that people were frustrated with having to manage and operate Hammer Factory factories as well as the hammer Factory that It produced that kind of overhead can get pretty cumbersome when you deal with the likely scenario of also operating a tape measure Factory and a saw factory factory and a level factory factory not to mention a lumber manufacturing conglomerate holding company foreign we determined that it's just too complex for someone who really wants to build a spice rack yeah no kidding so this week we introduced a general purpose tool building factory factory so that all of your different tool Factory factories can be produced by a single unified Factory the factory factory will produce only the tool Factory factories that you actually need and each of those Factory factories will produce a single Factory based on your Custom Tool specifications okay this is actually really starting to sound like front-end development okay now we're finally getting somewhere see this whole time I was like they're not abstract enough but finally we're just starting to scratch the surface okay I assume this is an allegory about react server components the final set of tools that emerge from this process will be the ideal tools for your particular project you'll have exactly the hammer you need the exact right tape measure for your task and at all let's see all at the Press of a button though you may have to deploy a few configuration files to make it all work according to your expectations so you don't have any hammers none at all no if you really want a high quality industrial engineered spice rack you desperately need something more advanced than a simple Hammer from a rinky dink hardware store and this is the way everyone is doing it now everyone is using a general purpose tool building factory factory now whenever they need a hammer yes well all right I guess that's what I'll have to do if this is the way things are done now I guess I'd better learn how to do it good for you this thing comes with documentation right you just got you know you just gotta see the Tweet you know the Tweet was obvious the Tweet was it was there in front of us straight meme machine you know it shut it down you know for a fact that's how it works light a store I'm going to thank you in a moment the name is I do write memes and that was such an excellent article I actually do want to take a second and say something about it here's one thing that you guys really got to know is that there are there is a time for a factory factory and I do not doubt it I am fully on board that some levels of abstraction are truly wonderful but there is something that happens when all you do is rely on abstractions you don't learn the underlying concept take a moment and understand how to build a spice rack with a Hammer okay just get the hammer out get some Nails get a little bit of wood glue and just try it out yourself you know why because when you go to the factory factory and that factory produces factories that produce the tool you want in a factory you're going to understand how at least that inner Factory works and it is going to be incredible take a moment and understand your environment I cannot say it enough thank you light a store the name is the maimagine
