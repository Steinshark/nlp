[Music] if you want to work full-time as a documentary filmmaker there's no way around it you're going to have to travel sometimes it's the best thing about the job and it's going to take you all over the world to some seriously amazing places but the trade-off is that when you're on the road it can be really hard to stay healthy now I don't know about you but I'm the kind of person who generally feels healthiest when I'm in some sort of daily routine but that's pretty much impossible when you're on a travel shoot so what can we do as filmmakers to keep ourselves healthy on a tough shoot since traveling is pretty much mandatory and let's be honest it's also one of the coolest perks of the job I wanted to share some of the health hacks and philosophies that I've learned over the years to keep me in decent shape when I'm traveling and that's exactly what I'm going to talk about today I'll start with four of the core lifestyle principles I try to live by on the road and then at the end I'll get into some of the physical items I bring with me to make staying healthy a little bit easier okay let's get into it [Music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is Luke Forsyth and on this channel I teach the skills I've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to work out that subscribe button because I've got more videos like it coming every week so I have a long history of being pretty hard on my body I spend five Summers working as a tree planter in Northern Canada bending over to plant thousands of trees a day while living in a tent and sleeping on the ground for months at a time when I first started traveling seriously I took a whole lot more manual labor type jobs like fruit picking and construction and during those years I really didn't think about being healthy at all I was just out of college and I loved roughing it almost like living as tough as possible with some sort of badge of honor all I cared about was having crazy experiences and pushing things to their extreme no matter what the physical and mental toll was when I eventually settled in Cambodia and started working full-time as a photojournalist I carried this mentality with me one of the biggest projects I did early on in my career was a two-year trip of the entirety of the Mekong River from Vietnam all the way to Tibet just me and one of my best friends who is also a photographer we had a decent but not unlimited budget and so to make the money stretch as far as possible we took the cheapest forms of transportation slept in the worst hotels ate the most basic food and pretty much did everything else we could to make the trip last longer we split the whole trip up into three week sections and tackled them one at a time it was super fun and an incredible opportunity for a young documentary filmmaker but I noticed a pattern on each of these trips we'd start out really excited with a ton of energy to be in a new place and we'd be shooting all day like crazy but by the end of the three weeks we'd start to get quiet and grumpy and really really tired we'd still shoot every day but it felt like I was sometimes just going through the motions that I could get home and rest I'd be chugging like two red bulls a day by the end and wanting a nap even then now it's not like I had a bad time or anything because that trip was and still is one of the standout moments of my whole career what I realized later though was that if we just taken a little bit better care of ourselves I probably wouldn't have burnt out so hard and I might have even been more productive then when I moved into documentary video I had the Good Fortune to be mentored by Paul one of the world's very best adventure Shooters like the guy has worked with Jimmy chin and Ronan azturk and all the other big names in that world and is a total beast in every sense of the word but even though I've still never seen anyone work harder than Pablo on some of the shoots we did together I noticed that he still made the effort to maintain healthy habits no matter how long the days were over the years since then I realized that he was right the only way to operate at a high level both physically and creatively is to stay healthy and for documentary filmmakers like us who can sometimes be on the road constantly while we're shooting you have to get a system in place and stick to it if you want any of these habits to work I feel like any health strategy that can work in The Madness of a film shoot has to be dead simple and so by keeping it to just four basic principles to follow I found it so much easier to keep up on say day 19 of shooting none of this stuff is rocket science but with some discipline it will make a huge difference in your energy levels I'm gonna just get the one I find the hardest to stick to out of the way right off the bat when I'm at home I think I have a pretty good diet and I try to make good choices whenever possible but as soon as I get on a plane or the highway I feel like the quality of my food is the first thing to go out the window it's like day two of shooting and I'll be putting back tall boys and Monster energy drink for breakfast and wondering if Taco Bell is open yet oh yeah peanut butter cup Doritos sausage car Panini and let's crack a Cadbury egg over the whole thing I guess I'm sort of exaggerating here but also not that much I find it so so hard to make healthy food choices while I'm traveling but I've learned over the years that it's one of the best ways to feel good over the long term not talking about dieting or trying to find kale salads in the middle of the desert but the better you eat the better you'll think and perform creatively not to mention physically since it can be really hard to predict what's available to you wherever you're going my basic philosophy is just two points no sugar in drinks and no food that my grandmother wouldn't recognize the sugary drinks part is pretty obvious they just give you nothing and will lead to massive energy dumps after a short-lived Buzz drink coffee or tea if you need to stay awake and plain water if you're thirsty but slamming a liter of Mountain Dew is only ever a bad idea and in terms of eating like my nanny all I mean here is to stick to real food rather than processed stuff filmmaking can be really physical so you should eat when you're hungry but if you try your hardest to stick to real food so like a bag of peanuts instead of a Snickers bar or a piece of chicken instead of a KFC bucket it makes a huge difference in the long run I've been on shoots where I've just said screw it and let it all go because it was way easier and I always felt worse you crash out in the middle of the day and you just generally feel sluggish and tired when you eat like crap so when you stop to stock up for snacks go for the real stuff instead of a double baconator and you're gonna do better work speaking of mental Clarity the next thing has everything to do with staying fresh and that's to prioritize sleep sometimes filmmakers like to talk about how little they sleep on shoots almost like they're bragging about how hard things were but the truth is that exhausted people in Creative positions don't usually perform at their best at the end of a long day it can be so tempting to hit the bar with the sound guy or stay up for hours going over footage instead of going to sleep but in my experience you have to put sleep right at the top of your list of priorities or you're going to burn out really quickly only you know how much sleep you need and some days there's not going to be any choice in the matter you're going to wrap it midnight and have to be up at 4am for that Sunrise shoot and that's just the way it goes sometimes but when you possibly can protect your sleep even if it feels like there's another million things to do if you do that you're going to be in a better mood which will make you nicer to your crew and your subjects you'll make better eating choices and when things go wrong which they will you'll make better decisions without losing your temper there's tons of books and research out there to back all this up but seriously sleep as much as you can when I was traveling up the Mekong we were lucky enough to be able to eat Southeast Asian food for super super cheap and for the most part that's pretty healthy stuff the one thing we never ever did though was exercise we were constantly in new cities and we were shooting all the time so it wasn't like we were going to go and find a new gym to sign up for everywhere we went I've always been pretty active but when traveling I sort of had the attitude that if I couldn't do some big fancy workout routine there was no point in doing anything wasn't until I met guys like Pablo that I realized that the top performers were also staying active on the road even if it was just in small quantities getting exercise is good for your energy levels and your mental health we all know that but it's just as important if not more important for filmmakers on the road when you start feeling overwhelmed like when one of your characters stops returning your calls or when that access you really wanted gets denied the stress can build up to a boiling point but more often than not if you just went out for a walk or did a hundred jumping jacks that stress would feel quite a bit less powerful it's pretty hard to feel anxious while you're doing burpees and just a little bit of exercise can make a big difference so just because you don't have access to a state-of-the-art gym make some time for a bit of movement every day that you can and you'll be a much better filmmaker like go for a 20 minute walk before bed or do a 10 minute body weight circuit or a super quick yoga flow do as many push-ups as you can in three minutes if you can make time for an hour workout great but don't make the mistake of thinking that because you can't go to Planet Fitness you should therefore do nothing instead something is way way better than nothing and getting in whatever you can is going to make a big difference trust me oh quick hack here wrap a yoga mat around your tripod when you pack it yoga mats are super useful for all kinds of exercising so you'll save a ton of space by packing it this way and you'll keep your tripod better protected too and while we're on the subject of limited time for things like exercise the last thing I try and do on every shoot helps out here and that's to give yourself extra time in the morning a few months ago I went way up North for a shoot where we had Sunrise call times every day and my natural instinct was set an alarm for like half an hour before hit snooze once take a shower and then stumble down the van but for me personally that isn't the best headspace to start the day in and so I got up at 5am every day to give myself Time by getting up early I was able to make a coffee read a bit of a book and then get in a 20 minute workout by the time we were rolling I felt great instead of feeling rushed and groggy I was both mentally and physically sharp the few days I didn't do this I was noticeably slower in the mornings staying healthy on the road means both physically and mentally and for me I just feel like I'm better if I'm not rushed it also makes me feel like I have a little bit of a life outside the shoot and that can be huge for your sanity now I know some days it won't be possible you'll get back late you'll have to get up super early and if you have to choose between not sleeping enough and having a nice chill morning I'd say go for the sleep but if you can at all make it happen giving yourself extra time in the morning is going to set the tone for the rest of the day and is always worth it in my experience okay so those are the four foundational ideas I try to stick to on the road if you can dial in all four of these things you're gonna feel so much better out there but before I sign off here I also wanted to quickly mention some of the the actual physical things I bring with me while traveling that make this stuff just a little easier or more comfortable the first thing I make sure to always pack is this a thermos I love coffee in the mornings but I don't always have time to sit there and sip one casually with breakfast so a thermos lets me bring it with me I know this isn't exactly about health but for me coffee is such a quality of life booster that if I don't have any I am way less happy while traveling to get a decent one you'll have hot coffee well past lunch and that can be like liquid gold just make sure to get one that really shuts not like a travel sippy mug so you don't have to worry about it dumping all over the gear when it falls between the seats the next one is all about supplementing your diet and that's a greens powder of some sort I bring these travel packs from athletic greens with me not sponsored and it covers me for all sorts of vitamins and minerals plus probiotics it's not as good as eating a really well balanced diet and fresh vegetables every day but if you're in a place without a lot of this kind of thing getting these Basics can stop you from getting sick there's a ton of Brands out there but this one actually tastes halfway decent instead of like old wood um like a lot of greens powders do so I like it moving on is this thin which is called a suspension trainer or a TRX and it's basically like a gym in a bag that you can set up just by using a door like I said getting some sort of exercise is so good for making you feel your best and this thing opens up a bunch of possibilities in small spaces when there's no gyms around it also packs into this tiny bag and it doesn't weigh much so it always comes with me in terms of making sure that I get sleep even when I'm changing time zones I like to keep melatonin with me now I'm not a doctor and you definitely shouldn't take medical advice from me ever but when I'm just starting a new shoot and I get to a place sometimes it can be hard to get into a sleep Rhythm starting off on the wrong foot can be very hard to recover from too so I usually try and jump start the process with melatonin which is just a natural hormone that your body produces when it's ready to sleep if I've changed a bunch of time zones and my body is totally out of sync I'll take a few of these and more often than not I'll be able to get into a solid sleep Rhythm right away again always check with the doctor before you listen to anything I say but it definitely works for me the last thing I'll tack on here as a bonus item it's more just a quality of life tool is this thing which is the omnicharge ultimate I've been carrying around external battery chargers for years but this one is the only one I've ever had that's powerful enough to charge my computer or iPad or even my drone batteries I'm not being paid to talk about this but for someone like me who spends so much time on the road this thing has bailed me out a bunch of times so it's part of the travel kit as well there we go some of the strategies and items I bring with me to stay healthy insane on travel shoots if you do anything differently or have any Travel Health hacks I didn't mention let me know about them in the comments as always hope that video was helpful and if it was maybe think about subscribing to the channel for more like it every week and if you did like that one maybe check out this other video I made about my daily routine as a filmmaker while not on the road see ya [Music]
