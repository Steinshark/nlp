i'm not happy about today's video okay but i'm starting it by just giving you guys a word from our sponsor which is me on this channel guys don't forget to pump the coin zilla don't invest in anything it's the coin you literally just have to subscribe today we're talking about a 3.6 billion with the b uh scam that happened with the crypto exchange called africt there really is only one reaction you're gonna have when you hear about this welcome to the 10 million dollar studio guys i'm your host coffeezilla and yes another day another scam i'm wondering like are we doing the same video is it groundhog day like we're just doing the same video over and over and over again but look hey you guys keep getting scammed i will keep covering it i don't know did i not dodge that i almost got hit dude basically we got a mystery on our hands today these south african crypto exchange brothers vanished and so does 3.6 billion dollars in bitcoin i mean what's the mystery guys like i wonder what happened when the two guys who ran the exchange and 3.6 billion dollars vanished oh where where could it have gone i'm sorry to laugh it's it's so sad what's going on right now these guys ran a thing called afrocrypt and before you say stephen this is insensitive like be respectful listen you've got to see their promotional video it's so bad how did people put 3.6 billion dollars into this let's watch we always keep marching forward and explore this is their only video by the way sorry real quick okay bring the unknown world we always seek for innovation to achieve excellence ai or artificial intelligence offers our future infinite opportunities but what happens when ai comes across a fund how brilliant would it be afrocrypt was created by a team of seasoned technologists and experienced finance professionals that recognized the opportunity for algorithmic trading within the digital asset markets the result is the afrikrypt ai driven trading platform this is every corporate presentation just sort of mashed into one you get the stock music you've got the poorly animated uh graphics a i is a cutting ed the robo-voice cutting-edge technology that we will use to make you money it is the future i am sure which is why if you put your money with us you are sure to succeed success follows success y'all fell for this wow dude again oh this is a hard one for me because i'm like guy if you fell for this what and it gets so much worse that's the worst part of this it's just like it's gonna get gradually worse so basically these guys uh these two brothers started up afrocrypt and it was a the world's first south african crypto exchange that um had ai trading on it or something they managed to accumulate 3.6 billion to bitcoin and then in april they suddenly froze accounts because um well i'll just read it to you this is an email everyone got dear client we regret to inform you that uh due to a recent breach in our system client accounts client wallets and nodes were all compromised getting hacked is the new crypto version of the dog ate my homework it's like hey i know it's supposed to have your stuff ready today but the dog ate it and whenever you hear that there's a there's like a 50 50 chance they actually got hacked or just the founders are running with your money that's true so they say it has caused afrocrypt to halt operations okay that's weird but this is the worst part they say we urge all clients to be patient as we attempt to resolve the situation at hand it's understandable that clients may proceed with the legal route but we ask clients to please acknowledge that this will only delay the recovery process they're literally telling you don't go to lawyers don't go to the cops dude it could delay it you're sincerely and it's the ceo amir kg but now it's time to meet the team guys who are these kg brothers that ran off with everyone's money well raheez is the older one he's 20 years old you heard that right the ceo of a crypto exchange entrusted with 3.6 uh billion dollars in crypto assets is 20 years old that's how old the guy is right okay sure we're in la la land now okay whatever amir kg he's 17 which nice beard if you really are 17. from one guy to another nice but in all seriousness we're supposed to believe these uh young whipper had 3.6 billion dollars and people thought they were going to run it well according to one article the reason some of these investors believed it is because they were told that raw ease is a childhood prodigy who was able to create a trading algorithm that allowed them to trade while they attended school wow never heard that one before childhood prodigy turns out to be a massive scammer and we've heard from these supposed childhood prodigies before who turn out to be scammers like stefan keane you guys remember that guy the ponzi schemer so anyways they claim that they are hacked but meanwhile nobody can find them and they seem to have run away understandably people got their lawyers involved and apparently the court high court i guess in south africa told the brothers the afrocrypt brothers that they had to give back the bitcoin and they had until july 19th to argue against the liquidation instead it just looks like they ran away and not only did they run away they also just shut the website down i mean they're not even trying to pretend this isn't a scam anymore and they moved these supposed hacked bitcoins of course they moved after the uh they couldn't find these guys these kg brothers and they moved it through what's called tumblers and mixers guys this is very interesting so part of crypto that makes it difficult to like steal money is the fact that well everything's in the blockchain so supposedly you can trace it right the problem is is there's this new innovation called these mixers i guess it's not that new but basically how it works is that you send your basically dirty money bitcoin into this massive pot of other people's bitcoin and you get out to another address bitcoin that may not be yours but it's like similar to the amount so like let's say ice in in 20 bitcoin and let's say they're sort of marked we know those are still in bitcoin i'm gonna get out a bunch of unstolen bitcoin and that bitcoin is going to get washed somewhere else so it basically think of putting a bunch of money into a like a dryer or something it all tumbles around and you take your amount of money back out so you're probably not going to have the same dirty bills it's a really shady way of laundering dirty money just an interesting quirk of this case that i thought was worth mentioning so that's basically the story in a nutshell now i did go to where they said they were located in south africa well no i didn't go i went to google maps and of course you can't find any building with their name on it anywhere here it just looks like some bogus address here they're at the pharmaceutical society of south africa okay they also said they had an international address in china of course nowhere to be found there either for now sadly i think most people's money is gone um let this be a lesson guys hey [Music] watch coffeezilla okay none of my fans would have ever fallen for this and nobody should be falling for this we've seen the same mo over and over again right sketchy exchange pops up nobody's heard of the founders before or they have very little to recommend them people put way too much money with it they don't store their money in cold wallets it gets hacked and then the founders disappear but anyways that's it for now we'll follow up in the story if we have any new developments and thanks for watching hey you took my money away you said that it was safe but i'm loved and i don't feel okay
