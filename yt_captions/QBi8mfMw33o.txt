we always hear about the camera night mode when it comes to flagship phones but the Huawei p30 light is 329 pounds or 320 dollars so how good could it possibly be so to test it we came out to Leicester in the UK not exactly the heart of the country but at the same time a new and interesting playground and it turns out there are two different regional variants of this phone the one I'm using here has got a 2 megapixel depth sensor 8 megapixel ultra wide camera and then a 48 megapixel main camera alright so to keep things off Abbey Park one of the main public spaces in the city and it was affair going on whilst we were there which was kind of perfect also sidenote take a look at what the back of this phone looks like with this much light around it's honestly unlike anything I've ever seen before the first shot I got was of a ride in motion it was going round and round in a circle and you can see that in the final image because the shutter was open for a full 6 seconds for this photo you can quite clearly see the contrast between these sharp fences on the outside and the wheel in motion on the inside this is the second shot and bear in mind you can probably tell there is still some light in the sky at this point does not reach pitch black yet but I felt like this image in particular would really benefit from bringing out the darkness so I pretty much just grabbed the contrast slider threw it up till the end and this is what we got the final photo in this fairground was taken in the lowest lighting condition of all of them we found this little wooden hut style building and this is the shot I actually found I was still getting that magic moment when you checked the photo after you've taken it that you get with the p30 Pro even though this camera is not as capable it's a lot better than I thought it was gonna be you can see the grass over here is a little soft but then wherever there is light in the image the phone really takes advantage of that so before we headed to central Leicester we actually headed further out this is the National Space Center and let me tell you is a weird place to be in the dark the whole thing shuts at 5 and so we've pretty much the only people there it's eerie I found the classic spot where people take photos when they go into the center and there's a runway that's really well lit but then the building itself has pretty much no light on it so this was the most challenging photo we've taken so far and after a quick edit I added a vignette i massively increased the contrast and i used a bit of noise reduction i was very happy with the all right central Esther and this is a Friday night we're filming it on so there are tons of people cars traffic and interesting looking buildings so this is the perfect place to test the camera oh yeah and by the time we got there it was pretty much pitch black so the only lights we did have what either from the street or from the building's themselves first up was high cross a giant shopping center with over a hundred shops inside of it and this is the classic angle we took this photo from and you can actually see if you look carefully the traffic trails on the roads here's that same photo with a bit of extra pop at it there's also a car park specifically for high cross and it's an interesting building in its own right but there's not exactly any standout color feature so I feel like this one actually works better in monochrome with a bit of extra sharpness we also went inside as it was closing up for the day and there is a fair bit of artificial lighting inside of here so it's not exactly a scenario you even need night mode for but nonetheless the photo did come out pretty bright and pretty evenly exposed it was kind of annoying me that I'd taken it from a slightly off-centre position so with a little bit of post correction this was the final result there's a casino here too and it's a bit of a weird one because it's a beautiful building with this LED wall but then everything else around it is pretty bland looking but nonetheless we've got a photo of it and it's a pretty good example of what the phone's mean lens does to any source of light in the dark there is a massive amount of lens flare maybe not forever on but personally I think it adds to the image in a similar vein we found a casino called Genting and this was also in a street where pretty much nothing else was happening so the building really stood out and seeing as there was very little color apart from that building why not just remove all of it so we ended up with this photo I was pretty happy there are two buildings left they are right next to each other and it was kind of something I was saving till the end because I was secretly really looking forward to it we've got Athena which is a conference centre and you probably agree a pretty strange looking building and it was kind of a perfect fit for another one of these photos where we just remove all the colour but the Reds and finally is Lester's fairly self-explanatory curved theatre I feel like the base image turned out okay but I wanted to use this as an opportunity to see just how much we can push the image how much detail and color could we extract from it the Furby there's no raw image but at the same time the difference between the before and after here is pretty substantial there's not much more to say apart from the fact that I came all impressed this is more than I thought it would be able to do considering the price considering that this feature is barely even advertised on this phone the p30 light is coming to pretty much all major retailers in the UK on May the 10th and if you enjoy this video it'll be massively appreciated if you could subscribe to the channel my name is
