foreign my first job I went up in salary by forty thousand 
dollars and I'm not telling you that to sound like   one of these Tech Bros of we can make all this 
money okay that was terrible I'm sorry I promise   you I'll never do that again but I'm telling you 
that because what it really showed me anyways is   not that that was realistic for every job that I 
would go to next of course not the more senior you   get your salary gets leveled out of course or your 
total comp as well but what it showed me and for   those of you watching when you're first starting 
out in your career oftentimes many of us will end   up taking a position that might be underpaying us 
a little bit for me that was definitely the case   I was so excited to get my first job that I said 
I don't care about salary I just want experience   which I am very grateful for that I did and there 
was a lot of pros and cons to that at the time but   the purpose being depending on where you are at 
in your career it will look different from jumping   from one salary to the next one compensation to 
the next I should say and that's really why I   wanted to make this video is because I get so many 
comments and questions around I feel underpaid or   I want to switch jobs but I don't know how and 
right now the market is kind of scary you go on   social media you see the news and it's saying 
how all these individuals are getting laid off   and what does this mean so I thought this video 
now is more important than ever really to really   ensure you are well equipped for applying to your 
next tech job and how to make sure to get that   bank first we gotta talk about your resume where 
is that at make sure to not only dust it off but   actually put some work into each application you 
use it for I know it sounds like a lot of work   give this video a like if you have done this 
in the past gone to write your resume and then   just blasted it out to hundreds of jobs I think 
everyone watching this should like this video at   this point because I've been there too I have 
done this so many times the problem with that   though is a lot of times it's actually not a human 
that's reviewing your resume to start off with and   if you are using the same resume with not unique 
keywords Associated to what job you are applying   to your resume is going to get lost imagine you 
are applying to a job that hundreds maybe even   sometimes thousands of people are applying to I 
know for myself when I go on LinkedIn for example   and you can actually see how many other applicants 
have applied to that job that to me sometimes is   almost a deterrent if there's too many people 
that apply to this job that I was like oh this   sounds amazing but it shouldn't be what it 
should do is really fuel you to ensure your   resume is going to stand out well how do you 
make your resume stand out for one you need   to specifically apply to each job it's way better 
to apply to one or two jobs a day than say apply   to 10 or 20 jobs quality over quantity goes a 
long way here I know you'll often hear that job   hunting is a numbers game which is true but it's 
also a quality game take time to actually ensure   your resume is lined up to what the job posting 
is for this isn't saying change who you are or   your skills or abilities but it might be something 
simple as in their job posting they refer to it as   software engineering and on your resume you have 
software development now sometimes this won't be   a big deal but other times depending on the system 
they use this might not get inserted through to a   real human inserted through pass a test let's go 
past the test here are some tools that I really   like when I'm looking to see if my resume matches 
up to a job posting We have this one here which is   great for ensuring your keywords are the same this 
one here which will give you suggestions onto to   what to add to your resume what the resume score 
is and one more here this might sound even more   painful than my first tip about updating your 
resume which is utilize your network when I   look for a job one of the things I really struggle 
with is reaching out to my network and I know that   sounds funny it's your network it's your friends 
but it's I always feel as though I am using them   or asking for something I shouldn't be asking it's 
a weird feeling for me and maybe some of you have   felt the same way and I was actually having this 
conversation the other day with someone and they   said you know what Tiff when you are on the other 
side of that and someone comes to you for help   or for advice or to see if you know anyone that's 
hiring does it stress you out or does it give you   the why are they reaching out no it never does 
but what does stress me out and what I really   do not enjoy is when people beat around the bush 
they come to me and they say things like hey Tiff   I want to catch up for coffee I want to see how 
you're doing with a sole intent of asking about a   job posting or asking about something now that's 
fine but being upfront and honest about why you   want to connect with someone goes a long way time 
is very valuable and the busier the older we get   it seems like more responsibilities keep on coming 
our way when you are reaching out to your network   and asking them about jobs or different tips for 
that job hunting process be upfront as to what   you are looking for you can do that and still be 
kind but there's a second part to this the second   part to networking is reaching out to people you 
might not know now what do I mean by this well   for example if you are starting to apply to jobs 
you also need to reach out to the recruiter for   that job reach out to the hiring manager take that 
extra step to really stand out another thing that   I will sometimes do if I'm looking to reach out to 
someone very particular and maybe they are someone   that might get bombarded with tons of different 
LinkedIn messages is I actually subscribe to a   platform that shares different email addresses 
with me the one I have is called Zoom info and   it's definitely not cheap and there are tons of 
other ones out there let's see let's go through   a few right now okay one more all right you get 
the point there are different ones out there where   you can type in someone's name see where they 
work and also their email this is a great way   first of all don't abuse this system but if you 
are having trouble getting in touch with someone   that you really feel you're a good position for 
this role or maybe they want to explore if they   have openings that they aren't posting using these 
tools is something that a lot of job Seekers do   but we just don't share that information prepare 
for your interview this is so key don't treat   your interview like you have no control over it 
you have all the control in it taking time to   properly prepare for interviews is something that 
so many people miss out on they rather would spend   their time worrying about the interview versus 
actually preparing themselves and hopefully doing   really well on it so what does preparing for an 
interview really look like for one thing if you   are preparing for a technical interview aside from 
the obvious preparing for the technical aspects   of it ensure to focus as well on the soft skill 
side this is something that too often is kind of   pushed to the side especially for technical 
roles there are so many great platforms out   there nowadays that will really help you be able 
to practice your interviews I know one that I've   shared recently is Google warm-up which is a great 
way to actually talk to an AI which kind of feels   like a person to get a sense of an interview 
process there are also a bunch of other ones and also I'm linking all these down below so you 
can easily access them now this is really where   you will stand out this is what will make or 
break your next decision which is around salary   negotiation I know the most uncomfortable part 
for many of us for this process but why should   it be really oh salary negotiation this is the 
critical part of the interview so you've come   a long way you've put in so much work for this job 
interview that it feels almost like I just want to   take anything I just want to get through this I'm 
so close to the finish line but the reality is if   you don't take the time to properly negotiate 
your salary what will happen is you will start   resenting this company and going back full circle 
to what I shared with you at the very beginning   this is exactly what happened to me I started 
realizing what my co-workers were getting paid   as I'm sure we all have those chats over the 
coffee coffee water cooler water cooler this   is after being remote for two too many years 
I don't know uh what we do in office anymore   but the reality is you start having these 
conversations with people and realize that   you are getting underpaid and in turn you start 
you can't help but start resenting where you work   and starting to look other places so ensuring 
you negotiate a salary that is both fair to   you and the company that you feel good about is 
essential for long-term growth with this company   so how do you do that well for one you need to 
do your research I really enjoy levels.fyi they   have some great research that they have done 
great data they have on there that you can   start specifying by role location company now it 
does Focus mainly on big Tech but it is starting   to focus on some smaller tech companies as well 
so definitely check that out for kind of a base   range and ensure when you do you educate yourself 
not only on full compensation but what base salary   looks like what stock looks like understand 
what these are and how it will fit into your   negotiating strategy so someone comes to you and 
says what is your are your expectations for total   this can be played in so many ways and I've seen 
so many videos saying to do this not to do this   and I'll be honest with you I'm not going to give 
you a one way or the other for the reason being   everyone's comfort zone is so different and when 
I see these videos I think I would never do that   maybe it worked for them but it doesn't mean it 
would work for me and that's something you need   to figure out but you do need to get comfortable 
with having those uncomfortable conversations   talking about numbers and if that company 
doesn't see your value or your worth that's   okay there are tons of companies out there 
it's one of those things that you really need   to be aligned on in order to facilitate long-term 
growth also if you are looking to practice salary   negotiation this website here interviewer dot IO 
I recently discovered it it's not free I'll give   you that but if you're really scared about 
this or nervous about this negotiation part   I would definitely check it out it gives you an 
opportunity to start playing around with playing   around to practicing negotiating a salary 
and it's a great way to get comfortable with   just that repetitive process about talking about

lean into your network and also to your potential   Network what that looks like and some tips around 
salary and negotiation it's something that should   not be so taboo and not spoken about we need
