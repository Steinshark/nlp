i got the tesla electrophone but not just that i've actually spent the last six months one by one buying up eight of the rarest limited edition smartphones in the world so let's see if they're worth it getting more and more expensive as we go okay number eight is the pacman phone by oneplus which is now valued at six hundred dollars beautiful box though wow we've got manuals and stickers is the first thing a standard oneplus charger the phone a classic red cable but then also a secret compartment which is hiding this bespoke pacman case inside of it i freaking love this phone there's a whole suite of custom pac-man wallpapers oneplus has retrofit the icons and the interface pacman eats the dot as you scroll this is wild there's a brand new fingerprint scanning animation it's actually unlocking so fast i can't see it properly there are challenges within the phone that actually unlock new pac-man themed goodies there's a new camera filter just for this phone but that's not even the coolest bit what do you think to this back panel it's okay right kind of plain just a single pac-man floating randomly over here but then you turn the lights off to reveal what he's actually doing there crazy to think that this is like the cheapest phone on the entire list so let's step it up with the 700 dragon ball z smartphone which is a collaboration with the phone company realme literally every part of this packaging is round full of dragon ball easter eggs i'm not a die-hard fan of the show but i did used to watch the episodes as a kid and man this is taking me way back even the sim ejector tool is shaped like a dragon ball and then we get the phone what a color it's a really considered balance between the blue and the orange love that little accent right there this is stunning and it's it's just the right amount of customized like it's very clear that this is a dragon ball z phone but at the same time i'm just glad that it doesn't have the entire cast's faces plastered over it we've got the usual set of custom wallpapers and also an icon pack that also applies to every icon not just a few that it's been configured for i appreciate the effort but that doesn't mean that i think it looks good but one thing that they've absolutely smashed here is the dragon ball z charging animation that you see when you plug the phone in now i've actually been even more excited about number six the 800 league of legends smartphone by oppo largely because if you've seen my other videos in this series you will know that oppo knows how to make a limited edition tell me this isn't the coolest smartphone box you've ever seen so you know the theme here is league of legends well this rocket is one of the special moves that you can use in the game so in the bottom compartment you get a figure that's the character whose move it is but slide out the cylinder and you get two further sections the first has a case for the phone very precise and matte and then below that you get the bullet necklace that this league of legends character is known for wearing but this is my favorite bit that necklace doubles as a secret sim ejector tool to make sure that you always have one with you at all times come to think of it i i probably wouldn't recommend wearing a bullet around your neck all the time the other side has the phone a completely custom 65 watt charger and of course a cable to go with it i still can't get over the fact that this box is freaking rocket the buttons this is so slick the fact that you have the neon blue and purple around the edges the textured matte finish in the middle the league of legends logo engraved on the side rails as well as check this out the buttons on either side are themed to the color of the side that they're on this wallpaper is wild that transition though ah these phones get me far too excited and the android skin is very heavily customized maybe too heavily customized but oppo has not let me down when it comes to effort there's an led ring around the cameras very cool very impractical given that you can't actually see it while you're using the phone and also that it's barely brighter than the neon edges all right ramping up further then to number five this smartphone designed by oneplus is based off a game that i actually play genshin impact which has made a bit of a splash because it also happens to be one of the most demanding beautiful games ever on a mobile oh lord these boxes they keep getting better and better there's an envelope which contains what i'm assuming is codes for in-game items and a pin badge can't say i'll be wearing that one and then if we turn this top layer around there's also a poster of one of the genshin characters using this specific oneplus phone again that's kind of a really weird specific thing to want to use though oh this is nice though then there's a case which has multiple layers in its design for a bit of depth it also has an external cooling system custom branded too it's a really thoughtful inclusion and then the phone box which below the outer skin is is a much more traditional affair you get the device on top and then a more standard oneplus charger one plus case with a rubbery material and a normal red oneplus cable it kinda looks like most of the budget went into the box contents the phone itself is pretty vanilla looking i feel like there should at least be some sort of custom icon pack or custom wallpaper but there's nothing so i guess the only standout feature is this plug this in turn that on wow it's actually very quiet for how fast the fan is spinning and that is like freezing cold to the touch so it probably will help quite a lot with sustained gaming performance oh it is actually also calling my hands from the sides that's nice okay your eyes are not deceiving you this is the actual box of smartphone number four we're now getting to the extremely hard to find rare phones hence the 1 200 price tag worth it for these peels though wow goodness me you might have heard of a manga series called detective conan it's literally been running since 1996 hugely popular in japan and this building you're looking at is an extremely faithful 3d recreation of the secret detective agency that the main character works from right down to the coffee shop that they actually use as a disguise it opens from the top with an insert just containing a couple of manuals the phone is the next thing you see but we'll get to that in a minute all right so the second layer has four key things a key ring with a pickle on it conan's iconic bow tie memorialized as a fridge magnet probably the most elaborate sim ejector tool that i've ever seen and then a very custom case with even a custom texture on the inside but we can go deeper my friends and my gosh this would be heaven for a conan fan it's a custom blue and red cable dare i say suspiciously close to spiderman colors a custom 65w fast charger i'm starting to enjoy these charge appeals very underrated and then a pair of holographic earphones all right let's see this phone set it up what's going on here this is weird deduce the password to gain access who else anyone so if i click deduce love is blank but zero is start is that even english it says the password is a single digit six am i being denied access to the phone i just paid twelve hundred dollars for what if i just try zero zero is the only other number in there i'm in that was weird so i just looked that up and that is a puzzle to see if you are enough of a detective to be able to use the detective conan phone clearly i am i like this home screen better it's much more flat and less in your face i've just realized something about this phone's back this is not just glass this is electrochromic glass which means that if i tap one button on this phone it can change its own chemical arrangement to modify its color you can also apparently change it just by saying a specific command using the phone's voice assistant i think that's the coolest phone yet moving up to 1 400 now this is the transformers decepticon smartphone by the company red magic i had a brief look at what it does and this is going to break some boundaries but just for context the decepticons are basically just the bad guys within the transformers universe hence the shady dark color theme alright so first up is a pin badge quite a dense quality pin badge actually we've got an insert that has manuals a page of stickers and a case man i just i love how confident the design is here it makes this feel like a like a proper transformers experience and not just like a normal phone box with a skin on it there's a secret compartment with the charger it's incredibly heavy and it's also the first time i've seen a metallic finish like this a braided cable beneath that again tons of attention to detail here i might go as far as to say that this box is even cooler than the conan box it even has little metal logos built into it and then on the other side another hidden compartment containing what they call a turbo cooler again keeping with the whole metal theme okay right off the bat this is a spicy looking phone there's so many different textures and details all in one place and notice how it's designed so that in the light it's incredibly reflective and vibrant but then as soon as i tilt it it becomes enveloped in shadow this is a very gamery kind of home screen but it actually calls to me red magic has really tightened up their game recently this doesn't look nearly as garish as their old phones used to wow that keyboard is something though also some hidden leds inside of it nice touch all right so i have a very important test that i want to do with this phone see this phone has three different levels of cooling you have just the phone as it is with its large heatsink on the inside that passively takes heat away from the chip you can dial it up though by turning on the fan on the inside which apparently spins 20 000 times per minute which is absolutely nuts but then we can also pair that with this external cooling attachment which is apparently using a centrifugal turbo fan to achieve refrigeration levels of temperature reduction so i'm gonna run the same performance benchmark at each of these three levels versus samsung's galaxy s22 ultra and let's see how much difference they make okay the samsung's on the left the red magic is on the right let's run that first test without any extra calling whoa the red magic is quite significantly ahead of the samsung okay internal fan on let's run that again you can tell the transformers phone is running the test even faster so the score on the red magic phone has gone up by about five percent the score on the samsung has actually gone down i'm actually really excited to see what happens now then wow such a unit wow the volume of air being pushed out of here is like i could dry my hair with this round three let's hit it okay the gap now is just crazy oh my god the samsung score is just tanked whereas the transformers phone again has gone up but nonetheless it goes to show that by using a cooler like this you can very well sustain your maximum level of performance wow they've added so many camera modes and there's also a ton of genuinely interesting camera filters here too all right let me try and take a selfie with this cyberpunk one look what it's done to my eyes okay but now at number two is where the price starts to jump up dramatically you know how the last phone was one thousand four hundred dollars right 8 100 is how much this phone costs and yeah it's not even the most expensive on this list so if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be priceless this is the tesla electrophone it's designed by the caviar company and apparently infuses the design elements of a tesla into a smartphone i always get nervous to do these expensive phone unboxings they always find a newfangled way of presenting these phones caviar royal gift getting closer and closer it's even heavier than normal caviar boxes eight thousand one hundred dollars that's eight times the cost of a normal iphone 13 pro three two one oh my gosh that is so so cool normally these hyper expensive phones they're just too much they're almost like garish but this is actually almost tasteful i'm a big fan of that let's see what else we get inside so underneath that we have an insert which has a whole load of things inside of it so there's the certificate of ownership there's a international warranty there's the gift guide and then what are you uh i'm 99 sure that this is is literally just a piece taken off a car maybe that's our certificate of authenticity okay so we also have a charging brake okay just a very standard white power brick very standard pair of ear pods then the cable which is again just very very standard smartphone charging cable but this is what i want to see does it wow that is like two iphones worth of weight there's so many different sections here and every single one has its own elevation and its own texture okay so right in the middle there's a textured aluminium plate which is apparently made from an actual melted down tesla there's a copper insert going through the middle which represents how it's arguably the most important metal in the construction of an electric car it's it's needed for all the wiring there's these white sections which are also lightly textured almost like a carbon fiber type thing and then all the black stuff is basically just titanium and there's a reason that you don't see any mainstream titanium phones it is up to 30 times more expensive than aluminium but i mean i recently shot a titanium phone with an air rifle and it actually bounced the bullet back so the benefit is that it's extremely strong okay you can see elon musk in the top right then i think it's a tesla cyber truck then the logo below that i think is a model s and then right at the bottom i think is a tesla roadster the fact that it is just a fairly normal iphone at its core is both a little sad for the tech person inside of me who would have loved a completely new tesla operating system to review but then quite possibly also a benefit for the billionaires actually buying this who already have an iphone and just want a faf-free fancier version of it so this is limited edition number three out [Music] we're talking about a phone released back in 2015 a phone that i probably would have given my right arm to own back then and it's even rarer now getting the smartphone has basically been an entire year of actively monitoring ebay alerts until someone listed it and it practically doesn't even exist on the internet anymore the one i have here is valued at around 12 000 right now but people have paid up to 91 000 for one of these that had a special serial number so the first thing you see is a metal decal of iron man himself a message that reads we are greater than i i swear this was one of the best collabs samsung has ever done a wireless charging bed meant to resemble iron man's heart which is fitting because that's what's keeping the phone powered up you got the smartphone a charger and a cable just the standard samsung ones unfortunately there's a plain-ish case but it's made to be like that to complement the phone itself so you know i'll forgive it a pair of standard samsung earphones remember when samsung used to give earphones with all phones a sim ejector tool couple of documents and then a little card to tell buyers that the film is in cinemas now as if the five extra tickets they'd sell as a result of this actually meant something okay this one plastic peel is about to cost me about 3 000 in value oh my gosh it's so it's so light you kind of forget how light phones used to be it's like it's barely there let's turn it on oh my gosh this moving parallax wallpaper is so 2015. it's also so fun to see a phone that has different colored borders to just the black that we get on everything now funnily enough the s6 edge was the first mainstream phone to ever have a curved screen and samsung went all in on it you might know by the way but just a couple of weeks ago i went to see mr beast in america and while i was with him he strongly recommended that i watch the show called death note it's free on netflix he said so anyways i searched high and low for this show like i was convinced that i was typing it wrong until i realized it's only available on the us version of netflix so by booting up surfsharkvpn i was able to change my location from the uk to the us and all of a sudden access the entire library of u.s netflix shows including death note which i've just finished and wow surfshot costs literally 2.49 a month which split between the seven people i share it with is 36 cents and if you hit the link in the description and use the code boss you will get it not just for that 249 a month price but also three extra months for free fully refundable if you don't like it
