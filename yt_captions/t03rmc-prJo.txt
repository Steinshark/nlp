[Music] this custom gaming PC represents over 600 hours of work and the full Hardline water cooling setup barely scratches the surface look at this it is beyond a doubt the most beautiful rig we have ever built which means obviously we had a little help nerdforge is here and we're going to be showing them how to Hardline water cool a system as well as how to thank our sponsor see Sonic who made this collaboration possible let me put it this way flights from Norway not cheap shout out to Sonic and Shout Out nerdforge you guys are gonna have a lot of fun with this one because you have only seen two sides of it again so much so much how many hours do you have in this Pelican case well 2 two weeks 12 hours a day for three people oh I don't know it's a lot of math how many hours was your flight nine hours was the last flight and then two hours for the first one so it's been shaking nicely what's it like a lot of foam it seems fine so far this is the front panel oh my God okay it seems fine at least on first glance but I don't know about the lights and this is the even bigger Parts I'm sorry about all the phone the hotel sign seems to not be doing oh no I brought super glue don't worry we have a whole week yes oh and there's people oh he's Sur seems like most of the things are okay like even the screen but we also have to test the lights though to see that they work oh should we do that right now yes is it all powered off of the SATA connector yes so there's one for each panel by the way huge thank you see Sonic plane tickets are not cheap because we're showing off their 1600 watt we were able to afford it it's arrived oh my God oh my God how did you program that they're just fire LEDs like these prefabricated fire ones they have the flicker effect how is this done it's a photo frame like a digital photo frame that would just kind of hijacked oh the photo frame around Android I just basically bridged it so it continuously runs and the boot animation is what you're seeing this is a good animation on repeat I mean it works how does this uh well get to that I cut a hole in the mesh oh you're not supposed to do that's probably we take the front panel and I'm kind of just lured it in there oh and then looped it over there and hopefully we can like cover it up with something nice and then the side panel we just lured it between here and then stuck on the inside and then if this is the same we can just oh it slots together like oh my God it looks better like this when it's like together do you want to start building computer yes EK oh hooked us up with so much stuff oh my God I'm sorry but this is the first thing I see yeah I think we have a couple options I think they're all slightly different purples I love purple we also have all of our cables I didn't know you can get them in purple let me matches my hair Reservoir radiator also huge two more radiators I think thank you this guy right here that's the monoblock for the CPU and oh my God that's heavy and now her GPU block we also went with acrylic tubing your options are patchy and acrylic pet G is easier to work with acrylic looks a little bit better I went with acrylic always for the Aesthetics yeah I mean I'm all for it first thing we have to do is remove this GP water block and put on the other GPU water block this one's perfectly fine this is from alpha cool should I do yeah you can do it to be fair I have built a PC once this is the same thing it's just if you screw it up it leaks and kills all your stuff it's really heavy yeah what's on the back oh my God it's a whole other block so afraid of ruining you cannot do anything with this GPS has already been done oh very nice I need that screwdriver because I keep losing my bits should I just like eyeball it or yeah it's fine Ah that's pretty good I mean wow I managed to cut something I just need to cover that up it's very nice in a weird way does it have to be even I think you're doing a better job than I would have done so perfect so there you go your first power block GPU are we going to be able to see the cooling liquid oh yeah about the board yep there's a couple things to note about this for one this board's like twelve hundred dollars it's like the most expensive motherboard you can buy pretty much aside from like servers also I've had my way with this CPU it's full Copper for one also the IHS just falls off is it supposed to do that so we just need to like not touch it and as long as we just like leave it in there it's fine okay anyway this is what needs to go on that's gorgeous okay it's gonna be a bit of pain in the ass uh this back plate all these brm coolers and stuff have to come off then it's similar to the GPU block thermal pad stick this on why is this so scary it's too little I have no idea the comments can tell her man how was that oh thanks that's probably too much I'll know for next time it's it's so pretty counter oh you kind of see where this motherboard's been wet before kind of see the water coming all along here that's for one we sub-zeroed it we have a rough plan for our Loop and I think it's gonna look freaking particularly look at the side there's this Reservoir that we found we do have one problem though the 7000d despite having like you know cutouts right here for a vertical GPU does not have an included pcie riser for the GPU if you wanna cut some holes in the case sure why not no not quite [Music] okay it did work nice okay uh did you save the glasses for girly I'll follow the rules do I look cool now yeah thank you cool points added let's go okay easy nice do you know what something that's really dumb that I realized after you tapped it this has a little bit on the top that's not threaded so you didn't need to tap it at all right we have a functional vertical Mount now PCI brackets in there nice and good with their standoffs you want to know the plan is the plan to have this actually screwed in all the way uh well it was pretty screwed in but yeah now it's screwed up yeah we've got a couple pretty fun runs in this so from here the outlet of the pump up over and into the GPU right here is going to be pretty fun what the hell Alex and then from here up over the RAM and into this one also will be pretty fun what the hell Alex oh my God they're totally not aligned Alex they're off by like at least six seven mils you don't need the computer to look good to you I mean well I guess let's get started shall we you should have gone to Jay's two cents it might have taken four years to get the finished build but boy would it ever look nice you're gonna have a lot of difficulty making a 90 that's that tight it would be way easier to freehand bend it from here oh my God it would not how many PCs have you water cooled in the last couple years really you're gonna go there yeah on camera yeah where does this damn feel like I'm observing a married couple do you really think you can do that 90 oh I can do that all right first one we're doing that 90 Pro PC building tip the this is an excellent switch so if he's bothering you you just you grab one of these okay this is a practice binge this is going to take me to attempts basically what we're doing is we're taking the hard tubing and we are making it soft so we're showing it a picture of its grandma okay when we can see that it's starting to get a little bit uh flexible we want to make sure that we heat up more than just the exact area and then we're gonna go ahead and give it a little 90-ish degree Bend here oh God I screwed it up so badly you got to make sure you heat it evenly on all sides and you don't want to get any bubbles in it Alex may be right about the bend radius here so you can see the the tubing is still curved when it's going in so we're not going to get a good seal because it's been deformed it's no longer perfectly round but hold on hold on everybody just calm down for a second here okay I think it's a lot more stressful than I thought relax there is another option see if we do that it fits yeah and then we can have a perfect 90 degree well not perfect but we'll make a better one then though but we could just make this one even bigger yeah what if that goes up and then down well yeah that could work all right I gotta do this again do it slower oh yeah oh we're definitely gonna need higher temperature later crap I really wish this Bend wasn't like front and center whose idea was it to start with this one it's also like one of the easiest ones so that's fair yeah it kinked a little uh let's put it in and see if you notice yeah when you see it from the front you can't even see it I kind of want to take one more stab at it okay Linus yeah we get that one in there we see if we still have tubing left so it needs to be a little shorter here I would take this off and I would put it on the Belt Sander take off maybe a couple of millimeters how's this it's pretty bad oh god oh this side's much worse well you can't do any worse than me let's go are you I'm not sure sure but okay which one do I do okay so what do we do one Bend first we do the bend for right here so we know that it's clears we get it in the correct spot then we do the second bend it comes down to this and then cut it yeah sure sorry all right just remember you couldn't possibly do any worse than me as long as it's 45 ish you're in pretty good shape make sure you get the underside too though otherwise it'll crumple up that's looking pretty 45-ish to me yeah you can really see the flaws when you pull out the things oh yeah see it's perfect oh I'm so relieved now our Bend here is also quite flexible in terms of uh where we put it it just determines how tight the angle will be if we put it here then it would need to be like a 90 degree makes sense right probably what you want is somewhere in between so somewhere around here yeah down like that but we should also do at this stage is we can cut the piece so we can cut it like here it's an awful sound truly okay it's starting to loosen yeah I remember same plane yeah time to commit this is less good than your last one but still better than mine can I borrow this for just a second yes we're just going to give her a little kind of a little wiggle yeah a little wiggle wiggle it right in there we're trying okay good enough if it's good enough for you it's good enough for me look from no no you'll never look at it that way that is true see so how's that yeah it's nice so now all we need to do is we just play around with exactly where we want it to kind of land we are pretty darn close you want to just double check that looks pretty good does that look pretty good yeah go ahead and work it and half centimeter extra yeah if you'll even be able to too bad I got it I got it I got it I got it [Music] okay so you can see right now they're both seated and it goes down that way a little bit yeah right yeah so this is a perfect opportunity for us to make fine adjustments with the belt sander yeah let's just take off like that right so when that's gone we're done we're probably trying to keep it like as straight as possible wise ideally beautiful that's all so now we'll just pick the bits off there oh that's much better what perfect freaking nailed it nice ah you know what I think her screwing up the plane of the bend actually worked in your favor it comes out I think it corrects it a little bit it was the plan all along can I take another crack at my 90 do I get another shot I really think we should just not do it that way think about how hard this one's going to be if we have to go up and over hear me out a 90 and a 90 and we just go straight over and we do another extension here then we only have to do 190. sure basically this is what I have in mind though let me just come out like that so let's see if I can put all I've just learned to use there and then add a couple extra centimeters nice make sure to keep moving like horizontally as well it is looking very good I think it's like like lightly more than 90. ah you can really tell it's not 90 degrees oh that looks so much better you need this ah this is why you say the scraps it's good it's a little bit like leaning but close enough you can't see it from the front not bad yeah do you think it leaks I don't know we haven't probably like tightened everything yet so I am kind of curious if we just you know pump it up a little bit will it stay [Music] oh well that was fast we'll try it again with less pressure okay leave it this has gone a lot better than I expected we have a water cooled system that doesn't leak that's pretty good what should we do we could do some painting like this part maybe make it match the outside I learned how to paint yeah we did an lmg paint night and mine was definitely the worst I know all right we have the insides of the computer figured out so we took them all out and now we're going to make this you know fit with the rest of all the stuff that they've done what's really exciting is we can finally use our sandblaster for something yes we did a little test piece here it looks freaking sweet and by opening up the top we can fit this whole case inside it's gonna look awesome yes turn it on up there you have two gloves in here foot pedal to spray the sand around okay it just simply recirculates so spray the thing sand collects down below and then you just blast [Music] that is so satisfying oh my God in hindsight sandblasting that was a terrible idea uh so we have finished beads they take forever to strip paint also the painting on there powder coating really good and durable thank you Corsair also our air compressor not able to just flat out sandblast for a while especially when you're laser cutting at the same time so it's five hours later totally worth it though it looks so much better I don't know why but it looks so violent now that we have it nice and shiny let's make it dirty again oh beautiful yeah yes what is this it's just a mix of black paint and water spray the whole thing uh grab some paper towels and dab it off again cover it just completely completely yeah but we just made it not black yes and now we're going to make it black we're going to take it off again I know this seems very wrong but it's gonna be nice this does seem very wrong so now just grab a bunch of this and then we can just like dab it off again we're gonna take off like almost everything but just give it some nice texture it's kind of like a Time attack thing too because you got to get it off before it dries completely I kind of like this yeah I kind of like it there because it's like if we go too much darker it just becomes black again that becomes why did we spend five hours sandblasting it what was the paint we used it's a super matte black paint from Stuart sample while we were doing the sandblasting we also had another thing in the oven this right here is our cable management cover we know that all of you are going to be commenting oh cyberpunk the game the game's not fair cyberpunk's a whole aesthetic not just a game so we wrote three paragraphs about it final step drug version it's super simple you just grab a brush and apply as little paint as possible and then you just like dab it on on like the high points and then you get some nice like Edge lightings the only like scary part is getting too much paint because then you get streaks and you don't want streaks kind of work it in to your brush get it off make sure there's almost nothing on it oh but if it gets straight you can also just like wipe it off with a finger the best tools like that yeah perfect it's like really parameter and don't use a brush you like for this because it's gonna go through oh nice the highlights help so much even though they're so subtle I have a bit too much in here somewhere yeah if you don't have paint all over your hands after this you've done it wrong just look at this that looks awesome I think you did a great job oh thank you yeah oh geez there's a lot to do here today all that we have to do to get this done is reassemble the case install the components put fancy washers on the radiators wear the Corsair RGB engrave the side panel reinstall the hard line do the cables Cable Management fill the loop post the computer update Windows do the RGB software while the computer is working just fine this is great we went to plug in the RGB header on the inside which just fell off and uh that's a lot of water that is a lot of water I guess did it disconnect right here yeah it did that's the outlet of the pump so what we've done we've swapped out some of the fittings unfortunately these ones are alpha cool they aren't quite color matched but they do have two O-rings I don't want to be clear here that Alpha cools fittings are inherently better than eks I just specked it these super low profile ones because I thought that they looked cool and I was a bit concerned that they wouldn't be as good at holding tubes in and I was correct only use these if you really need to everything's dried off now though so all we have to do is a bit of cable management it's uh not as tidy around here I absolutely hate RGB this is all RGB that's all RGB this is RGB that's our [Music] we filled the loop last night let it go for a while came back pump wasn't working fortunately when I went to go and drain it I did one last little click of the pump and it sprayed water all over the place you can see the water on the ground right here which means the pump's working and we can finally put this together for once and for all so say your tagline please let's have a look at the final result finally [Music] Nano site appreciate [Music] how care are you bugs [Music] store [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] .com [Music] foreign oh my God that looks so good did you make this oh it's 3D printed but it's hand painted yes how did you paint the ones in the back okay please tell me you took some shortcuts like all these air conditioners right like did you hand paint every fan blade everything is hand painted yes why I mean it's incredible don't get me wrong but like it's still the Aesthetics oh my God it goes around the front too this is so cool and this is not a display you just I guess have a technique for yeah you've just got like a nice diffuser layer in there I guess that's around it looks around yeah yeah I love these nice little touches to give it that kind of true to life look like the little aluminum foil bits here excuse me aluminum foil European how did your tubing bins work out not too bad not too bad yeah I mean if you go around yeah okay okay should I turn it or should we walk around how fragile is it uh it's like this is old card stock so you can like wow you can hit it what did you just like carve this or what oh this is just take away boxes like the pattern here yeah oh I love the side panel we left the peel on though is that on purpose for you oh okay all right here we go this looks awesome how are you so much better at bending tubing than me you've done it like four times love the dye color you know there's a lot of really talented PC modders out there it's like this Micro Niche whereas if you take the the miniature scene which is much bigger and are like okay you super talented people build a PC I guess this is what you end up with well we combine our powers Right Next Level man it wouldn't have been this good on the inside or without Alex this is like the coolest computer I think I have ever seen that is the biggest compliment the essay what what as much as I respect I already agree with you CD project red and their Ambitions with cyberpunk 2077. I dislike how the game has become the de facto standard for the cyberpunk aesthetic I'm sure this would be okay if the game wasn't a steaming pile of excrement on release but unfortunately it was oh did you did you write this um the bottom part Alex wrote the rest how the hell are you guys gonna take this back with you uh we're not it's staying here forever oh really yeah oh my God that is so generous so why don't we just hold on to it until we do LTX 2023 and then why don't we auction it for charity sure does that work for everybody that's amazing you guys are invited of course we'll be happy to cover your airfare because this is this is like a piece of PC Building history I think I think it would be really really cool and by the way don't feel any pressure if you can't make it out that's fine I'm sure we'll be able to whatever works for you but I would be I'd be honored if you came out and we're there to to kind of see us send it off in style That'll be amazing okay you know what else is amazing this message from our sponsor hey hey got him it's a full sponsored video I see Sonic oh right see Sonic man how cool is see Sonic they sponsor all the coolest stuff lately man yeah they offer up to 12 year warranties up to 80 plus titanium efficient power supplies and you can check them out at the link down below it's a new power supply 1600 Watts oh wow they have the 1600 watt unit now is that the unit that's featured in here yeah well that's fortunate because with the rumored power draw of upcoming gpus we need something that's going to be ready for them thank you so much for building this this is incredible are you a hugger yeah okay this has been so much fun to build and yeah I'm just super happy to be a part of this I love it
