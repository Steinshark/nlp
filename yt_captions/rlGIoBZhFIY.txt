ladies and gentlemen welcome to one of the most epic days of Chess that I can ever remember it is the last round of action at the Tata steel chess tournament of 2024 and going into this round we have a five way tie for first which means if we have a tie for first at the end of this round we are going to have all the players put on boxing gloves and punch each other in the face and what that means in chess terms is they're going to play Blitz chess against each other and they're going to have absolutely zero violence this recap has no less than 10 chess games once again it is going to be fast PA paced not fast face I don't even know what that is buckle up enjoy yourselves here are your standings after 12 rounds of action left side five-way TI for first and on the right side is the Challenger section and that is a two-way tie for first now your appetizer game of the day is from the Challenger section it is Leon mendonsa and he is going up against Divia deshmuk and if he wins this game he might win the Challenger section and there is a major prize for winning the Challenger section now you may wonder why there's a king on E2 this is Theory I promise this is from the forite Sicilian Defense and uh there's this really weird setup I'm not going to get into the specifics because I can write a PhD on this opening but uh as you can tell from the time management both players are clearly aware of the theory it's not important I hate to disrespect The Challengers but we are here to feature the best players in the world world and they are in the master section and Divia desmo here makes an inaccuracy and very quickly white ends up on top and she blunders a piece uh instead of Rook takes sh4 she4 C4 she could have traded the queens and gone to an end game she blunders her Rook is now stuck and if she moves The Rook let's say back to C8 white takes the queen so that's a major mistake and Leon is the winner of the Challenger section that is not the entire recap Mar Andrea maritti made a draw I had to serve you up normally I would feature this game in Greater detail but that is not what we are here for we are here for the master section and that means that Leon mendonsa will now play in the 2025 Master section so massive congratulations to him Indians just keep impressing like Divia had a good tournament and in this section we have vid GUI the current Indian number one we have Prague we have gesh who are going to be playing in the candidates all three of these guys will we have wey versus vidit we have Anish giri if he wins he joins the leaders against uh and he's playing max vardam if n back Abdul Satur beats Alexander donchenko he makes it to the finals and we have param Mak Lukes gkes has to win with black highly unlikely but we will see if he gets it done now this is a battle of two guys in first place a draw might guarantee them a first place spot but nothing is guaranteed and we plays a major sideline of the queen Pawn opening not playing a Queen's Gambit in fact not playing it at all he plays a very solid setup this is called the Kali system and it's like a London without a bishop on F4 which looks stupid but it's actually not there are very you know key differences in the openings namely the fact that you can quickly go for E4 and your Bishop never really moved so if you want to add an extremely boring opening to your repertoire that you probably don't understand CU you're not high rated and your opponent doesn't understand either because they're not high-rated but you just want to have some fun play the collie system plus I'm pretty sure collie's like the name of a dog in some book or movie I don't know CD oh Border Collie du take take now we get into an isolated Pawn middle game and this is vintage wayy he gets some powerful attacking options over here he has the isolated Pawn which means the squares around the the pawn are going to be very uh useful and then he plays this gangster move Rook E4 vidit things plays this Rook E4 is a shock to the system that Rook is going right there and let me tell you something Wei does not have good intentions he plays the other Rook to C1 he forces vidit to make pawn moves to try to defend himself self and now he starts targeting the weakness vidid had to go here E6 is now weak King to h8 vid's giving up the pawn and Wei gets it he is now a pawn up with all the benefits of an attacking position and a 30-minute time Advantage Queen to G6 Bishop back to D2 it's a bit of a complicated mess but we is just up a pawn not only is he up a pawn he sacrifices his Rook he forces vidit Knight backwards and he plays Knight takes E4 now the position is completely disintegrating for black because white has a bishop and two two pawns for a rook a pass pawn and still future attacking possibilities and the position begins locking up vid's time starts getting under 20 minutes it's complicated but wey is converting he is defending his King and he's got the pass deep on and it goes from bad to worst vid's losing pawns and the pieces are getting to his king queen C2 back Knight takes G6 oh my goodness Bishop F5 on the way Queen C7 on the way Knight f8 on the way the Rook is getting in as well the king always has a balcony to go smoke on couple of moves later in this position vidit resigns vidit stormed a massive comeback he won two games in a row to get a tie for first he was the Indian number one for a day less than 24 hours later he loses to Wei who is our first finalist Wei defeats his co-leader vidit gudra this also happened like a year or two ago at the Asian games that's crazy so you got to feel for vidit but he's still a candidate so we'll see vidit back in a couple of months uh a crazy run for him winning two out of his last three games now we move on to see who will join Wei as a finalist Anish giri versus max vadam the Heartbreak story of the event Max has had a very very rough time he's had a lot of good fights but he has not gotten the results he's wanted and in this position somebody kidnaps Anish giri Karma has come full circle at the Tata steel chess tournament 2024 Anish giri has been stealing a pawn upon a bishop so many times on camera well in this game Anish giri was stole en himself and taken over by an alien who played G4 I don't know what happened to Anish giri I don't know if he's actually getting an extraterrestrial life force playing in his body but he goes on one of the most deranged attacks I have ever seen this is not how an garyi plays chess this is how Gotham chess plays three minute games on chess.com and loses and Anish giri in a in trying to get a first place finish just launches an insane attack on his opponent I mean he's just got he castles Queens side and he's just he's just this is not how an G plays chess F4 Max vadam starts striking back it's a completely insane position Anish plays Bishop D3 ef4 e F4 Queen C7 and now we have Rook to H4 and he's just building this up there was a moment here actually that after Bishop G4 black could have been better but I think Max vadam got a little bit scared I think he got a little bit scared I guess you know he didn't like something here Rook D2 and black can just chill like black is not actually getting mated here uh and in fact can start as his own attack so I don't know if Max had played Bishop G4 this game could have gone very differently but it's been that kind of an event for Max and Anish giri sacrifices a bit who is this man king to f8 F5 you know people go through midlife crisis they get a new hair color they get a new car you know they start doing crazy stuff like going skydiving and each plays G4 H4 H5 marches his opponent down and brutally attacks his King while shredding open the position and oh my oh my God and he did all of this with no Bishop by the way like the bishop is just behind the pawn and Max fadon resigns he resigns because if he takes he loses his Queen if he goes here he's going to get mated I don't know why he resigned right here I mean according to the computer he could have played on for a little bit uh but then he would have lost his Queen so maybe he yeah but I don't know he he he called it a day uh right around here so Rook D7 and um yeah he just resigned uh which is shocking but Anish giri is the second finalist an giri my man showed up today and played G4 look at this I'm telling you like an alien kidnapped Den giri I have never seen him play chess like this ever ever second finalist now if ner Beck loses this game or draws it he's not going to be a finalist right so we have a sicilian which is just about the best opening to play right if you're trying to win a game Queen D3 massive sideline there's like 20 different possibilities F4 and a couple of moves moves later we're going to get a castles right we have same side position not's got to start an attack and Denko is just trying to trade Queens with him it's it's kind of interesting to play when you know your opponent has to take a risk right like how do you punish them right H6 Bishop H4 Norbeck starts biting his time and all right now we're now we're in an attack but does he want to take the pawn because if he takes the pawn you kind of open up the attack for black so what are you going to do nordbeck takes allows the opening of the position and he's going to give up a rook he's giving up a rook to take the game into imbalanced territory he gets this and then he defends his rook and the idea here is he wants to attack donchenko on the dark squares while denko's King is in the center the computer hates it the computer is giving an advantage to Black right they have H it's a bishop and a pawn for a rook we have Bishop E3 pawns are falling off the board no BR has a bishop for a rook but we might be headed to an end game no he doesn't take the Rook he is playing against Black's weak king queen D1 check Queen back to d8 Queen B2 what is going on in this position Queen C7 Bishop F4 nock's chances are slipping but the bishop comes back and the queen comes forward and the bishop is worth more than a rook at this point because you can see Black's Rook is just very passive King d8 now the king's under attack Bishop back to D2 he's sniping him from a distance Queen B6 Bishop B4 oh my goodness Rook G7 and the bishop gets in and now black is completely stuck he takes and now he's winning and Nock escapes he gets the bishop off he's got the pass pawns we enter the 50th move territory it's off to a pawn race and nck is winning B5 black can hang around but if black never plays the move B5 white just walks up the side of the board so he plays B5 we get into a pawn race both guys make new Queens but when it's all said and done no bre's got too many pawns G5 the white king is going to make it up the board and move 66 after an insanely tense game a game where nck calculated gave up a rook for a bishop to try to just Target Black's King cuz he knew it was going to be weak in the long run what a daring game from nck to be down material like this but know that in the long run the rook and the King were so weak for black it pays off he's the third finalist what is going on nobody can break away and that means will it come down to this will gukesh also win with black no chance winning with black is impossible you'll notice Anish won with white Wei won with white noek won with white with white it's a little bit easier because you know you can dictate which way the game is going to go Bishop B4 all right Bishop to B4 is a regen Queen A4 check Knight C6 you don't lose a piece both guys play a bunch of theory here Ed and now param it param plays param makulu plays this game like he has to win so he plays Knight E5 G4 F3 he is playing like KES giri in the previous game param always down for a fight he's going to go along and he is going to play H4 H5 all right we got NFL playoffs today we got Ravens I hope the Ravens beat the Chiefs good Lord the Chiefs are the new Patriots and then we got the Lions and the 49ers I can carear less about that one but you know I want the Lions to win just to nothing against San Francisco other than the fact that it's San Francisco let's be serious but uh I want the Lions to fulfill you know the crazy story of not winning and so long and anyway I I couldn't really care less I have no personal Vendetta but the Ravens are so good um and I'm just I'm a bandwagoner so like everybody hates the Chiefs right now so I'm just you know I'm just actively putting my f fandom out there but I I'm a New York Sports Fan so I'm just sad all the time anyway that's you didn't have to know about that uh Knight takes F7 so this man is playing completely insane chess there is no need to sack the KN but probably you know gukesh looked at him and was like you want to take the risk that didn't happen H4 H5 is the best thing to do he sacks the Knight first and then he does it like this baram is is insane bro like his chess is completely wild he plays chess like a heavyweight boxer Great move from gukesh and actually peram should sack the bishop the computer gives this the top evaluation and then you have Knight D5 you can sack every piece you have to do this this is nuts King E7 E4 to go Bishop G5 black has to go here this is insane but he doesn't find that he backs up he backs up he spends some time he backs up and gesh is now going to be able to consolidate his King a little bit param still trying to open him up and oil him up by the way B4 but now gas just right there he's on the queen side he's defending himself here comes the queen and now gukesh is the bully all right gukesh was getting bullied in this game now he is the bully look at his King go the king walks all the way up the board and around complete Insanity Queen F7 on the board D6 D5 he's got backup Rook H shade but kukesh survives there's not enough pieces to continue the attack and in this position after King E1 Rook B2 and the King sliding over here it's an Unstoppable mate you cannot Escape Checkmate there are no checks on the king the fire burns out and dear Lord we have four out of five finalists the only reason we don't have five finalists is because wey beat vidit so two of the potential finalists played each other every other person won can you imagine the last round of the event you are playing the person who is winning the tournament and you win and so does everybody else you look back you're like a gash no damn four people win so now what we do in the Chess World is we got to break a tie throwing those boxing gloves you know b b b you determine all the weight you start throwing punches kicks wrestling none of that we break a tie in chess with a tie break the guys will now play a blitz knockout tournament not rapid because we don't have the time for that we don't have the venue scheduled for tomorrow Blitz and the matchups in the first round of the blitz knockout RS follows noer Abdu satov is up against we and kukes is up against the N gei now going into the blitz I predicted that the favorites were right here and unfortunately they got paired against each other you will also notice uh we's rating is 2740 but then actually a couple of games later it's going to change these are not their ratings uh we's Blitz is 2684 in fact we hasn't played a blitz tournament since 2019 more on that later but no is a very active rapid and Blitz player so I thought these guys were the favorites all right we have E4 and my man Wei plays a Petr defense it's great not a Petro an alakin Alin defense Petro is E4 E5 Knight F3 Knight F6 this man plays this insane provocative opening you would never see this in a classical chest because white can just get a pretty nice Advantage uh D6 and it's 3 minute with 2 second bonus we trade off the pieces nor keeping it nice solid thick and tight C3 Knight D2 Knight 4 white ends up with a very pleasant slight advantage and uh well now it's kind of like one of these positions like what are you going to do like black is just sort of sitting there on the sixth rank Queen C1 King H7 there goes nck H4 he spends quite a bit of time right he undeveloped 30 seconds in a Blitz game is a lot of time spent we strikes back with E5 and now it's it's it's a critical moment in the game already H5 by nerb trying to attack E4 both guys attacking each other we brings the the king out and then puts it back and the idea was that now that the G file is opened up he might be able to attack nck nck attacks the center but you see we's got bad intentions we always has bad intentions here he was winning by the way Bishop D4 he could have actually sacked his Knight and just immediately gone for it and look at that I mean that just looks horrendous but that's not what happens both guys trying to keep it solid he grabs a pawn but are you sure you want to open these two files I'm not so sure both guys at a minute Bishop G 3 Queen H4 they're repeating NRE is trying to NRE played here to go here and here we shuts that right down Bishop F1 now it's 30 seconds versus 20 the entire tournament is hanging on a knife edge D5 Knight G5 and oh my oh my God oh my God how are you going to survive this Rook D1 both guys at 10 seconds Rook G4 threatening to take the bishop Queen F1 Queen goes back to H5 now the only way to play here is Queen E2 repinning the queen and the point is if the queen goes to G6 Rook F4 is now not a threat anymore because the H file is free so Bishop here and Rook D6 and you get in but nerc plays Bishop C7 and all of a sudden he's losing with 10 seconds remaining his position completely disintegrates and we wins he wins Rook F3 check the attack breaks through we is a finalist he just knocks out NOC ABD sort of and the reason that I said we is a finalist in Blitz is because he's a wild card nobody knows anything about Wei like he hasn't played a tournament in so long clearly he's in great form and we by the way is the youngest player to ever cross 2700 faster than fua faster than Magnus he's the one of the biggest wh ifs in chess history and I've been talking about this time and time again now the other match who's going to join them gesh versus Anish giri I think of the four these guys are the worst Blitz players I'm not trying to insult them I'm just saying when you got four Blitz players some are better than others okay and I think gukesh is not as experienced and Anish is just better at classical and Rapid that's just the truth we is the biggest wild card so I was like this matchup is really heartbreaking for me because I I wish they kind of mixed it all more it's sad that NRE and we had to knock each other out that's just what I think we's rating is not even indicative of uh of uh of of his Blitz playing ability I think like gukesh and and and an N classical monsters their rapid and Blitz is not as strong as NOC and uh uh and Wei now this goes on full display pretty early because in the first game gukesh builds up just a pleasant Edge right he just a just a slight positional Advantage they got a queenless middle game and um they're shuffling they're shuffling pieces and you know it's a very slow and steady you see this GES very methodical very slowly playing against the isolated Pawn both guys creating some play but then something happens and we go to a rook and Knight at end game and he starts creating outside counterplay but he blunders like he that pawn is just stuck now and gukesh is trying to pick up the pawn right so he plays King B7 he pushes the Knight out to the edge of the board gukesh is winning he's completely outplaying an KN I was shocked by this completely shocked plays Knight D6 B5 expertly done and now after Rook D1 Knight F4 he had to put his Rook on D2 the reason he had to put his Rook on D2 so he can play G3 a little bit faster but he puts his Rook here and Anish a perfectly timed move removes the blockade of the position and with 5 Seconds on the clock gukesh loses sight of the position loses a piece and Anish giri wins with black the first Blitz game after being under pressure and I was like oh no it's actually coming true GES is just simply not experienced enough in Blitz oh my goodness and now Anish is going to put him away I mean winning with black is massive so Anish is going to put him away experience is going to triumph over Youth and he's got the white pieces kind of hard to play chess when you have to not lose it's actually a lot easier to play chess when you just have to play chess so Anish just plays a very solid position trades off his dark squared Bishop life is good Rook B1 Rook d right everything is good but gukesh back against the wall it is easier to play for a win in chess than it is to play for a draw he's just going for it tournament life can't end now C6 kicks him out look at his pieces H3 well time strike this this that was like football commentary oh that's well timed Knight E4 Bishop F5 he slides oh my God is Anish going to lose material take take take oh my God look at gash's pieces the Bishops are slicing and dicing the Knights Bishop B4 Knight E4 that's a fork you don't quite win material Knight F6 wait a minute The Rook is trapped The Rook is trapped if Rook goes to B2 the Knight the Knight is uh falling you like Bishop D1 even attacking the queen and then the Knight is oh my God The Rook is trapped with 5 seconds remaining and he shuffles around but he's completely lost Lucas just won he lost with white and now he he wins with black so he ties the match and now we go again and we start the game Knight to F3 Anish gets the black pieces it's an Armageddon game so white starts with uh less time wait I'm very perplexed I don't understand why white starts with less time um shouldn't Black start with less time I don't what is this transmission why does black have 30 seconds more than what I'm I'm so confused I don't know man I don't know maybe they bid for it I I don't know what the rules are you guys are going to have to tell me why is I I don't know I don't know what's happening I did not even notice this during the live transmission also I just got to say we got to fix live transmission for these rapid and Blitz events I mean my God it is a it is a nightmare uh but I will say that Anish giri got a hilarious structure early in the game with the light squares he was poking he was proding but uh look at this my man gukesh just expanded on the queen side traded off the pawns and just got in and uh how is an going to defend his position that's that that's my question Bishop C look at this look at that how do you guard your yourself you play Queen E8 I got Bishop B5 how are you protecting yourself all of a sudden Anish has to sack his E6 pawn and just he just has to defend this end game he has to trade he has to go here kick out the bishop and play F4 this is his only chance and it is not pleasant instead he tries to activate his Queen now gash finds this and this look at that stockfish like maneuvering getting the pawn defended and now Anish tries to create counterplay but he's down a minute and what's worse is he's down the game the queen and Bishop hit the Knight there is no way to protect it everything falls apart Rook C6 is on the way Rook C5 is on the way and GES against all ODS this move came after losing on time actually Rook C5 and each gear loses on time but he was lost on the board my man gesh lost the first game after getting a great position backto back wins it's Wei it's gesh it's the Tara steel 2024 finals and it's brought to you by me all right we got no sponsors Wei gesh one of these two will be a first time winner of the Tata steel chess tournament neither one of them has won the Masters all I learned in this event is that if Magnus Carlson does not participate golly we have a great time cuz we don't know who's going to win Wei plays 9 of3 this is this is the second Blitz game D5 E3 C4 and if you were confused why way nck was one game it's because they drew the first game I didn't say that I apologize I'm very excited they drew the first game this is the final game E6 B3 Bishop D6 and gkes plays Knight C6 which is a very big decision like generally you want to put the pawn on C5 and then you know you're going to get all this G4 business like we did in that game uh in the in the Anish Gir versus max rerd down but Knight C6 no C Pawn movement you want to take the center he captures on D5 and then he plays G3 now what's fascinating is that you know he's going to go here so to me Bishop F5 is a very natural move and then you know what I would go here bro I'm not even I'm like why did you let me in because now Bishop F1 I can just take and you're going to have weaknesses for the rest of the game oh what about this look at this take take King you know King E2 right Knight B B2 Queen C2 the Knight is trapped but you know it it this is not really what white wants so gukesh doesn't do that he he doesn't play Bishop F5 and try to go for the light squares he kind of just quickly castles but I was sitting there wondering what if he did that and now kcash plays Knight E5 we trade a bunch of pieces and this is what we have to work with how is anybody going to win this position same side castling solid structure you know the way we is going to have to play this no pun intended is he's going to need to play A4 B4 and try to utilize that Bishop kukes is going to have to try to create counterplay on this side of the board we see both guys getting to work both guys trying to do exactly what they're supposed to do D4 is a well-timed central strike but you do open up this are you not concerned now Bishop C6 is insanity because you lose this pawn and your king is super weak so obviously that doesn't happen instead Queen F3 I love this position for gkes cuz that pawn sucks okay but you're going to trade off C for D and then it's just going to be a draw probably Bishop 2 E6 Queen E3 three and now gcash plays H4 giving up the pawn to damage White's structure of course he doesn't have to do that he could just put a rook over here but but but they're trying to win and he thinks that by sacrificing his Pawn he's wrecking we structure look at that five Pawn islands that is horrendous five Pawn Islands now Rook E8 way he plays Queen G5 trying to create some attacking chances kukes is confident he's not worried about going to an endgame down material because these pawns suck but the only way to make the pawns not suck is to create an attack and we ye is hoping to do this he wants the pawns all together but Knight H5 now the pawns have to move so now both guys are about at at a minute and entire T Steel tournament which has taken two and a half weeks if not more it's taken like three weeks is going to come down to a bullet game in an end game Rook G5 Rook C5 look at that he was threatening to play H5 H6 now he's got threats on both of these pieces Rook D4 is the best move here trying to win the H Pawn while losing the pawn on C6 but instead of that he tries to trade the problem with Bishop D5 is he spent half his time and now it's Knight for Bishop so now there's an imbalance you see a moment ago there was no imbalance there was no need to do this there was probably a way to do this where you could lose the pawn on C6 but even create counterplay but that's really hard to do instead Bishop D5 he doesn't lose the pawn but we plays D4 that's a long-term weakness and this Rook is going to go to work and you need to prevent black from getting counterplay on the second rank both guys have to have have very low time gash has 10 seconds Knight before KN D5 Wei plays H5 now GES has to give up the pawn but that's not what he wanted a long time ago when he played H5 H4 he did not want this position he gave up the pawn with the reasoning of damaging white structure and weakening White's King both of things both of those things don't matter anymore and he's simply worse and now Wei is going to try to turn the screw the only chance gkes has is Wei blundering something he's going to blunder something to the Knight Rook e six look at him just marching his King to the other side of the board Rook B8 looking for something both guys at 10 seconds King C3 Rook E6 F3 defending everything Knight D5 he slides the king all the way to B3 Knight back to E7 H4 slowly taking o squares you can't take this if you take this Pawn you're going to lose this pawn and allow a passer so gkes plays back to D6 but that Bishop C6 this Rook is hanging while this Rook is hanging Rook C7 Rook C5 back to everything's defended gash plays here Bishop D5 he's he's guarding everything Rook C6 and and then Wei Rook G8 Rook he blundered his it's pinned with 6 seconds remaining he finds rookie six Rook e eight Rook e six gash's King is boxed in he tries to make a run for it but he blunders he blunders a fork and he resigns because he's going to lose and beat down a piece and wey is the champ the champ of the 2024 Tata steel chess tournament defeating ner P Abdul to of and kukesh in a playoff wow you know the craziest thing about Wei this man is born in 1999 he's 24 this year he's turning 25 and yet he's a veteran of the game 10 years ago nine years ago in 2015 he became the youngest ever 2700 of all time we is the biggest whatif in chess history for nine years his rating has been from 2695 to 2740 that's it he almost plays no tournaments if you look at his tournament history he almost never plays Blitz he almost never plays rapid and he almost never plays classical the last like four years especially particularly after the pandemic he just won this tournament he's 24 he's so young and he's now 2750 and he's the ninth highest rated player in the world he's 20 points away from Dingle Ren maybe less he's like 15 points away from dingly Ren GES heartbreaking but a valiant fight a valiant fight for cash a valiant fight for vidit who came back to tie for first but you just couldn't get in the way of Wei uh Luke Leon Luke M mendonsa mandona from the challengers section making it back to the Masters uh for 2025 and all this event taught me was if we don't have Magnus Carlson playing we're on the edge of our seat like 50,000 people were watching that live playoff at the end cuz we just don't know who's going to win like it's incredible watching Magnus bulldoze everybody but it's kind of fun not knowing who's going to win we is the winner wow that's wild that's all I have for you today T Steel was a wild ride let me know if youve enjoyed the coverage let me know your impressions of the uh event in the comments now get out of here
