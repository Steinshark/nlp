hey what is up guys mkbhd here and as promised this is a first look and impressions of the all-new iphone 10 r and i have a sneaky feeling this is gonna be the way to go for a lot of people this year so in case you missed it apple just announced three new iphones iphone 10s iphone 10s max and iphone 10 r my full video detailing the 10s and 10x max is live it's linked below those are the more familiar phones that we are expecting but a little bit of a curious new look that's different is this r so iphone 10r has the same a12 bionic chip as the other two phones the same ram the same new upgraded internal specs the same face id the same notch the same ios 12 the same speakers the same lightning so what's different what makes it the r also i don't really know what the r stands for there could be a couple things but there's a couple things that make this phone the r first off it's an lcd display instead of the oled in the other two phones not a huge deal on the surface as apple generally makes pretty good lcds but it's also worth noting it's a lower resolution as well 1792 by 828 so a little bit above 720p on a 6.1 inch display so it's not going to be the sharpest screen in the world it's still over 300 pixels per inch but you can't even watch 1080p hd videos on the screen which is a bit of a bummer so definitely keep that in mind and then the other difference with the display is the bezels all the way around are just slightly thicker and this has to do with the fact that you can bend an lcd display like you can with an oled and those other iphones have a display going right up to basically the edge to the corner because you can tuck the drivers in the edge and the oled right up to the corners that's what they did with the iphone 10. with iphone 10 r and this lcd you have what they're calling a liquid retina display which basically means they tried their best but you can't quite get to touching the edge with this kind of screen so you'll notice every 10r has a slightly thicker bezel a little bit of a chin it's noticeable for me someone who's been using an iphone 10 for a while but it's actually still way better obviously than the huge forehead and chin we had on iphone 8. the screen is still true tone it still has touch to wake but it's now lacking 3d touch so no force pressing things anymore on iphone 10r but to be honest they kind of built around that with a long press in areas where 3d touch might be missed like the control center and truthfully i won't really miss it i barely use 3d touch ever anyway but now you know another major difference iphone 10r has a single camera as you can see instead of the dual camera setup so this single camera is the same as the primary one on the 10s it's the newest 12 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization an f 1.8 aperture new image processing all that and it still has actually that software enabled portrait mode as well including the adjustment of the bokeh effect and everything so you're really not missing out on much of anything in the camera department at all just literally the telephoto lens which is impressive and then other minor things the iphone 10r is ip67 rated not ip68 but the real difference the head turner that you've definitely noticed by now is all these new colors iphone 10r comes in six new colors red blue coral yellow white and black and i'm gonna you know what i'm gonna go through each one of these with like a sort of a mini review because that's what we do here right okay so let's start with the coral it's a it's this sort of a peachy pastel color maybe more of a salmon depending on how the light hits it and then all these iphone 10rs have aluminum frames instead of stainless steel so they do color the frames too and this salmon has a sort of like this pale orange frame to it it's all right i'm going to go 6 out of 10. white is sort of like your de facto standard so it actually is brighter and actually white compared to the silver that we have on the iphone 10 so it's actually different and then the sides are still silver but they're also pretty bright not really a whole ton of contrast on this phone since everything is so bright here but hey if you like to keep it clean this is the clean look i'm going to go 6.5 out of 10. then there's the blue this is nice this is this is like a sky baby blue type of look and the rails are even more pale blue but they go together since they both sort of feel like a desaturated in a way bonus points if you wear a lot of blue jeans i think this is this is giving me iphone 5c vibes i'm gonna go eight out of ten then black you already know i got a soft spot for matte black and this one is right up that alley super clean stealthy dark mode all those things even the bands kind of sort of look like batman's art pieces only downside is this one is definitely going to show the most fingerprints so i'm going 8 out of 10 again then yellow this one has like a taxi vibe to it i don't know there's not a whole lot of yellow items in my life but if they were i'm sure this would be more saturated yellow than all of them and this wouldn't be so bad but the aluminum sides of this one are really pale like almost different color yellow it's kind of weird it just sort of reminds me of the worst version of the iphone 5c i wasn't into that not my style sorry yellow four out of ten and then last but not least product red damn this is nice this is like a deep rich ferrari red and we're actually getting it on day one instead of waiting six months and it has that black front and the colored camera ring looks good on pretty much all these phones but i'd say looks the best here and the aluminum frame matches i'd say the most closely of any of the colors aside from the white this one is a winner easily my favorite color option 9.5 out of 10. but there you have it that is iphone 10r it's like that it's a funky frankenstein iphone with some things from iphone 8 some things from iphone 10 it kind of technically qualifies in that way as a new design and you can even kind of see some of the color of the aluminum frame up on the front so a wallpaper that matches it does make a real difference basically you can look at this phone as sort of the new iphone 8. this is the ideal upgrade for someone on an iphone 8 or older right now not an iphone 10. it's going to start at 749 for 64 gigs definitely not cheap but still much cheaper than the iphone 10 s and it's going to come out about a month after the 10s in october so stay tuned for the full review when i do get my hands on these things but until the next one thanks for watching r.i.p to the home button catch you guys in the next one peace
