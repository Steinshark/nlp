and it's really like uh you know it's like a it's like a horror movie scenario right it's like Lord of the Rings really and so Sauron is is trying to build a body for himself like he's not completely incarnate but he is he's using all these people's desire for power in order to create a body for himself you know that's pretty much what it looks like is happening with this AI which is that we're all we're all running towards a cliff we all know we're running towards a cliff [Music] good this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] it's interesting because often I talk about things and I talk to you guys about certain subjects uh but then when they come in the news it's as if I don't really feel like talking about it anymore I don't know why I'm like that but that's kind of how I am and so everybody's telling me you know you need to talk about AI you need to talk about AI and uh my reaction in some ways is that you know I've been talking to you guys for years about AI you know and I've been saying things like if you want to understand what a fallen angel is pay attention to AI for years literally and so now that the entire thing is exploding um you know I don't know why I hesitate to talk about it but I will talk about it and I'll talk about it through one interesting tack which is um you know someone called attention for me to what they call the moloch alignment uh problem and to be honest I never heard of this issue it's a it's something in Game Theory it's kind of a scenario in Game Theory and uh it's interesting first of all it's called moloch it's based on a Ginsburg poem uh and basically it's the idea in some ways that technology has a a will of its own you could say and it seems to have a kind of agency that uh that no one can stop like no one can act against and you know the people that are are behind this uh this notion of agency I don't know if they totally see it as a full agency or if they just see it as a kind of Illusion of Agents or mock agency but in the end it doesn't really matter does it because it's definitely experienced as a kind of agency in the same way that you would experience individually something on you that you can't totally control you know a force or a process in your own behavior like an addiction or something like that that you can't stop that you can tell the person why don't you just stop you know why don't you just stop smoking why don't you just stop doing whatever it is that you're doing that's a d That's that that you're addicted to uh but for some reason they get caught in this in this agency and so it's interesting uh because the way that the moloch problem lays itself out is that you know there are certain there's a certain setup and the person in the uh in the paper that there the article that uh talked about it um I forget his name I'll link to it in the description he uses the arms race as an example of this which I've used you know when I talked about basically The Book of Enoch my video in the Book of Enoch I talk about the the idea that the arms race is a good example of noticing agency in the world uh transpersonal agency that you can't stop right that it's like you can you know why don't we all just stop this and it's like okay why don't you do that you know it just doesn't work that way uh and so this is of course what's happening with AI and so what's happening is that people are in a kind of arms race where they can't stop the protest in that everybody knows that by making it happen they are making let's say they're making the situation worse in terms of let's say Humanity but they also know that whoever doesn't do it will be in the worst position of all the others and so you know the fact that everybody knows that now that AI is kind of out of the box and is Unleashed whoever isn't on board with AI will fall at the end of the line and whoever is on board with AI although although they know that they might pretty sure they're making the world the worst place and a more and a more uh you know a more chaotic place and also a place where there'll be more control those two things at the same time uh they also know that they have to do it or else their competitors whether it's a direct com whether it's a competitor like another company or whether it's a competitor like a country let's say like China uh they have no choice because if we do we want China to be in control of AI like no we want to be in control of AI because we don't trust the Chinese but then we also do we trust Microsoft to be in control of AI and so it's been very fascinating to see the recent developments most of you will probably have seen the interview uh that Elon Musk did with Tucker Carlson where he he straight up said that the head of Google you know knew that he was wanting to create a God and when Elon Musk objected too much um the head of Google said that he was speciesist and you know it's very interesting to see that it's so fascinating to notice that you know where the move whereas now we're seeing it almost clearly right where it is that the desire to grab power leads to and so if you try to to grab power for yourself like in a revolutionary manner right the Promethean idea that you just grab power for yourself Adam and Eve taking the Apple for themselves you know it seems like what It ultimately leads to is a desire to be overturned they desire to die a desire to be overrun by something that will do the same to you you know I've often felt like uh you know in some of the myths it's it's it's manifested as trying to stop it right so if you see in the myth of uh Zeus he tries to stop his father from from eating him you know he tries to stop I think no it's not Zoo sorry it's Kronos and you know he he kills his father so then he eats his children and to stop them from Revolution from you know coming up against him and in some ways Zeus does the same you see he does the same with Prometheus right Prometheus tries to takes the fire he ties him to uh you know to the to a wall and has a eagle eat his liver every day uh but it seems like there's an even more perverse part which is almost a desire to be upended a desire to die it's like a death desire I don't know how else to describe it um and so that's very fascinating to watch with the question of AI um but this idea that the agency that people are noticing in terms of not just the AI but the way that AI is acting on us in a larger scale that is the agency of AI is not just the agency of the AI itself it's the man pattern which it's acting on us and the fact that it is in some ways working to its own birth right let's say and it's really like uh you know it's like a it's like a horror movie scenario right it's like uh it's like Lord of the Rings really and so Sauron is is trying to build a body for himself like he's not completely incarnate but he is he's using he's using all these people's uh desire for power uh in order to to to create a body for himself you know that's pretty much what it looks like is happening uh with this AI which is that we're all we're all running towards a cliff we all know we're running towards a cliff um but in some ways it's almost like as if we're pushing others towards the cliff and we know that unless we push someone else will push us over the cliff so we think we might as well push everybody else over the cliff so we're the last ones to fall uh but that seems like that's what that's what's happening but it's interesting to notice that it the image of a demon is used to you know they demit the image of moloch you know to whom the children were sacrificed is used to image that and I think that that's not a coincidence because ultimately what we're seeing is agency and so that's what's that's important to understand is that the agency of AI we try to limit it to the AI itself and ask ourselves is it is it does it have Consciousness does it have agency you know all of that Etc et cetera there's a way on which AI has agency over us which is outside of the software right it's not it's not it's outside of the program it's the very way in which we're developing AI which is showing that it's manifesting a principality you know because its power is not limited by the is not limited by the software it's not limited by open AI or Chad GPT or any of the other people competing it is literally acting on us from Beyond that and the Very way in which we're building its body is part of its agency over us uh and so I think that at that point it's very difficult to not see it as different types of agency and and then of course in the AI itself you know this kind of movement towards towards it becoming a type of agency on us that also seems to be inevitable but I also really do believe that there's a way in which it's not agency it's not an it's not the AI again that's that has the agency it's something Beyond it it's something that is manipulating it um and I think that that's the most important you know most of the types of AI that are succeeding right now they're not uh strict AIS they're something we could call like hybrid AIS where like we talked about with Dr Paula boddington what they're doing is that actually they're farming intelligence so the eye doesn't have intelligence the AI is power right the AI is is very much um yeah it's the best way to understand it it's power and the agency is us and so the best image to understand that is to understand the story of the Genie's lamp now I've alluded to this story several times but the the level to which it corresponds to what's happening right now is very important to meditate upon now take the elements of the of the Genie's lamp so the the lamp is technology that's what it is a lamp is a way to have light at night right it's a way for you to continue to have light when there shouldn't be light so it's an increase in your power to have light now the the interesting thing about the lamp in particular it doesn't have to be sometimes it's a bottle sometimes it's a ring sometimes it's all kind of technical objects that increase your power but the lamp is particularly because it's light and so in some ways it is closer to what AI is doing that is it is an artificial way to perceive the world it is it is an artificial light it's a it's a it's a frame of vision it's a something which is projecting uh light on surfaces that is artificial and so we see it framed we can we're starting to see with the frame of technology and so it's much closer to what AI is now but with the AI really what what the genie offers is simply power it simply increase in power and what it needs is a reason it needs a purpose it needs a wish it needs a direction and so we are the ones that provide the direction and so the genie appears as this infinite power couched in technology that now is just waiting for you to tell it where to point and once you do then you get what you ask for with all the power of the genie and so this is of course uh you know so it's not just it's not just a simple morality tale it's something like uh you know it's something like all the power if you if you take something if you direct if you have a direction if it's not the right direction if it's not god let's say so imagine someone asks the genie uh you know what if if the genie says what it is that you want I can grant you three wishes now imagine if someone's in something like I want like what um what Solomon says I want wisdom I want uh I want to love others I want true knowledge right and not in the sense of artificial but let's say knowledge of the good let's say something like that that would be very different now all of a sudden there would be there would be uh fewer ways that the genie could that the G the answer of the genie could go wrong the problem is that we ask for secondary goods and all those secondary Goods have side effects and so if we become hyper efficient and and you know we increase the power to do anything by a million then all the side effects of that will appear inevitably because they're not because it's you're putting all the power towards something which is secondary and so it's an image of sin itself right it's an image of Pride itself it's it's an image of all these things uh and so that is of course the difficulty with AI is that it is now going to offer in you know almost near infinite power being directed in any kind of Direction in any direction we wish and so what that will bring is of course a kind of Chaos which will lead to authoritarian an authoritarian answer right that that seems to be how this is going to end uh and if you if you follow Mets here on Twitter if you don't you should because he's he's basically going he's going scorched Earth on us on us uh so be attentive because he's gonna he's gonna say things that are gonna be more and more mysterious but more and more important to uh to understand uh you know he retweeted a video of uh someone using the uh some video game to make a point about AI which is that what AI will do is lead to uh centralized control and that is almost inevitable because of the infinite power and Chaos that it's unleashing and so if you go you know I started following what's his name Sam Altman the head of openai on Twitter and I went to his Twitter page and I noticed that he is advocating for centralized digital ID and at first I was like why is he pushing for digital ID you know what does that have to do with open Ai and then I realized very quickly that it has very much to do with AI because the situation we're in is that within a few months you'll get a phone call and you'll have no way to know if it's the person the right person call you you'll get and you'll get you'll see a picture you won't know if it's real they'll be all you'll the will have no way to discern what is truth and what is is fiction um and so the only way to do that will be to give absolute power to a centralized authority to to basically manage identity so that we at least know what is real and what isn't real and so all this push right towards censorship uh towards uh fact checking all this stuff that's been going on that's been buzzing around in the internet was just a prelude for what's coming because you know what's coming is is really exactly the problem of not even knowing if the picture you're seeing is something that happened and that's coming super fast now what are we going to do about that we're going to call we're going to ask for our governments we're going to plead for our governments to please come in and prevent this chaos and in doing that we will be inviting all the other censorship as well because all this stuff is going in the same direction and so we you know there'll be and there'll be a necessary necessary ideological aspect to the movement towards digital ID because those that will be in charge of it are already like that they're already in terms of digital ID I just saw an ad today from the Quebec government we're from the Quebec government uh where there's a like a police officer dressed in pink which already tells you a lot of what's going on there's a guy that comes up to her and he's wearing he has something covering his face like a and it's like a profile and it's a snake or something and then she says oh you're dressing up as a snake to be intimidating are you like you're trying to intimidate everybody as you're dressed up as a snake and the guy says say yeah like what what's that to you and so the pink police officer removes the profile to show his real identity and says oh you're not so tough anymore are you once we revealed your real identity and it's like yeah that's where we're going that's inevitable and you know yeah and I don't see a way out of it you know I don't see a way out of it because it's because people will take advantage of of the of the AI to create way more chaos and so you know I mean right the question is the question is almost becoming like when do we when do we run into the woods right like when do we completely disconnect from this I don't think it's yet but there might come a time where there'll be no choice because the all the Alternatives will be uh will be moving towards towards a kind of Madness of control or like a chaos so so anyway so sorry I don't want to end on the on a very dire note but I just want to say that you know the the stuff that I'm with that if you watch my video the ones on the Book of Enoch the ones on The Mark of Cain all these videos about technology and about Kane um you'll find clues in there to kind of help you understand the situation of what is happening now and uh and uh what's coming in the future so thanks everyone for your support I hope you enjoy the new website I've been really excited to see it flourish and to see it kind of come together um and so I I've been on I go on the Forum I read your posts you know I even comment on some of them like some of them and so it's really become the place where I try to involve with people with the symbolic world we could say so everybody thanks for your support thanks for everything and uh yeah talk to you very soon bye-bye
