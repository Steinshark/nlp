name a better comeback than Ponzi schemes used to be illegal but in 2022 they're flying higher than oil prices more common than a single guy at a board ape convention they have exploded in popularity especially among our ruling class the billionaires which is why today we are investigating yet another billion dollar Ponzi scheme and no I'm not talking about dokwan's terrible decisions that's totally last month today we're talking about usdd that's a double d as in double the dumb people who believe in it and like all Ponzi schemes this one says it's different Luna failed after it offered 20 a year and attracted billions of dollars in Investments usdd is changing the game by offering something different offering double the amount of Interest nearly 39.6 percent per year according to their website and they claim it's risk-free because of course they claim that right now we've seen this movie a thousand times but let's pretend to be a government for a second and give this Ponzi scheme the benefit of the doubt how are they claiming such a high risk-free return how is it possible and who's behind it well it turns out to be a billionaire named Justin Sun he's quite the controversial figure in his own right according to the verge he fled multiple countries under fear of prosecution and a former employee alleges that they were engaged in quote insider trading all the time which you know in my opinion is just too much some of the time sure who doesn't enjoy a couple hours of insider trading but all the time it's just greedy now when Justin isn't allegedly insider trading all the time he has another job which is as an ambassador for the country of Granada which gives him diplomatic immunity in Switzerland which doesn't really matter except for the fact that it grants him the title of his Excellency for some reason which he really enjoys being called in interviews you're Excellency I yeah it's kind of crunchy but we're gonna look Beyond Justin Sun's colorful past today and ask the real question what is usdd all about is it truly upon this game is it something completely legit well Justin admits that quote he came up with the idea for usdd after witnessing Tara's dramatic Ascent in other words they made a lot of money now he wants a piece but his timing was unfortunate he launched usdd only a few days before Tara Luna's collapse which obviously isn't a great luck despite that he still wants to convince people that his coin is going to be different he claims that just because one goes bad doesn't mean they're all bad it's kind of like real estate I believe Luna's fail it's kind of like you know recently in China's real estate Evergreen using too much like Leverage uh in a very short period of time so according to Justin UST and Luna failed because they grew too quick and were over leveraged and he's not going to suffer the same mistake but before we get into the differences we have to address the similarities between us Terror and usdd because there are a lot they both claim to be algorithmic stable coins which just means they rely on Arbitrage to keep their value at one dollar they both also offer insane rates of return and both of them acknowledge this is probably unsustainable in the long term but that's where the similarities stop and the differences begin because obviously us Terror has collapsed after accumulating billions of dollars usdd on the other hand is much younger only about a month old and already has a market cap of 700 million dollars or so additionally usdd doesn't actually work as an algorithmic stable coin at all yet right now the mechanism for Arbitrage project is actually turned off and minting new usdd is only allowed for a small number of whitelisted Institutions such as Alameda research among other people now the reason this is important is because it makes usdd safe from the famous algorithmic death spiral at least for now because this is only possible when burning and minting is active so if you're planning to short this coin probably don't because it's not actually an algorithmic stable coin yet of course they claim that they will eventually be one when they enable this feature because of course they're not that stable until people can Arbitrage which is probably why they're de-pegged from a dollar and instead trade about at 97 cents but the question this all begs is why is this worth a dollar at all if it's not really an algorithmic stable coin why isn't it just worthless well the reason for that is something called the Tron Dow Reserve which claims to back usdd with a bunch of crypto Assets in fact they not only backed them they say we've over collateralized we have more than enough money to back up this usdd and this is one reason they claim they're different they're collateralized at 300 percent and promise they're gonna use it to defend their money they also link the associated addresses that have this two billion dollars worth of funds that they say they have and if this is all true doesn't that make usdd intrinsically valuable if it really is backed by all this money that's the logic anyways I mean look at this chart they provide they're the most backed of any coin and some crypto YouTubers even think it's an ultra conservative investment people should really be thinking of this as an ultra conservative over collateralized stablecoin not some risky algo Staples so why am I telling you different why do I think that this is ultimately a Ponzi scheme well it's simple they're offering forty percent a year on their website of risk-free yield but if that's not enough for you let's think about this for a second they're only over collateralized as long as this coin doesn't get super successful because over time as more and more people invest in it they don't just magically get more collateral they're collateral girl stays the same which means that slowly by their own success they will become under collateralized and eventually death spiral like every other algo stablecoin in fact if they ever reach the success of something like U.S Terra they would actually only have about 10 percent collateralization now it's here that some people might want to stop for a second because you might say well that's of course why Justin's son is so careful in interviews he says that the growth of usdd needs to be slow it needs to be organic he's not in a big hurry first of all we need to based on our growth organic growth rather than a very short period of time grows with full average I think that that's the first lesson but this actually doesn't track to reality because ustd has grown extremely fast they've grown to almost a billion dollars in a little over a month and it's almost all been minted inorganically by centralized entities remember regular people can't just print usdd in fact one of their biggest users is actually none other than then Justin's son himself that's right big shocker the main user of usdd is the creator Justin Sun I discovered this when I started investigating his various wallets see he minted 40 million on ethereum and also 40 million dollars on the binance smart chain but it didn't start there it originated on his home blockchain of Tron and passed through a bridge contract why that's important is because we can back Trace through that bridge contract to find out who on Tron minted all this money when we trace it back we get to this account which I believe is Justin's son's Tron wallet or at least one of them one way we can confirm this is because this wallet is the primary voting stakeholder on another one of Justin Sons projects the just Lind Dow now this is a bit of a tangent but just Lind is a Tron lending platform that claims to be a decentralized autonomous organization basically what that means is they accept Community votes in order to decide what to do next according to their website if the proposal receives more more than 600 million supporting votes plus takes the majority of votes it will be passed so what's the catch well the wallet we just identified is probably Justin's son they control exactly 600 million and one votes which basically means they can always pass literally whatever they want on this Dow right really decentralized guys that's what it looks like in 2022 and you can see from their governance page that these votes go basically uncontested this proposal for example has 135 votes against 600 million for all of this means we can be pretty confident when we say this is Justin's son's wallet and the reason this is so interesting is because of Justin's son's claims that he's a big fan of decentralization he actually says that's the whole reason for the need of an algorithmic stablecoin in the first place I think while the most important answer at least to myself for algorithm stable plan is we basically want to make a decision on our own Fates uh in our own hands so basically I think these days stablecoin is the most centralized part of this decentralized world that's right forget about these centralized entities the reason we need another algorithmic stable coin is for decentralization but like just Lind how decentralized is usdd really we already know that it's tightly controlled by a few whitelisted institutions but it gets way worse than that because now that we have what is nearly certainly Justin's son's wallet we can now see how much usdd he himself is responsible for minting and the answer is 683 million tokens that's right ladies and gentlemen the entire sum of tokens they've ever minted is like 723 million which means that Justin himself has minted 94 of all the tokens in existence so much for decentralized growth I guess see it turns out this whole project is basically just Justin's son selling to retail Traders looking for a quick Buck which brings me to my first theory of what usdd might be used for not only do I obviously think this coin is offering unsustainable yield I think it is also a really clever way for Justin sun to offload Tron without affecting price because let's think about it the wallet we just identified controls 70 million dollars worth of Tron but if it sold that on the open market you're never going to get that the price is going to plummet right but go with me for a second what if you could burn one dollar of Tron and get one usdd which is how this whole thing works incidentally and then you sell that usdd for another coin without affecting price like usdc so long as you could bring in enough people willing to buy your new token usdd by maybe let's say offering them insane yields you could actually cash out of your Tron without ever affecting the price of Tron it's one way to actualize games without tanking your own coin which would be pretty smart if you ask me but I have to say this is speculation at this point what we know for sure is that usdd is absolutely not decentralized 94 of it comes from one wallet and its supposed growth hasn't been organic at all nothing could be further from the truth decentralization in this case is nothing more than a buzzword that is being used to make people feel empowered just like Dao was a buzzword for just lint to make people feel a part of something that was controlled by 600 million and one votes I would highly recommend you guys stay away from this coin it's a billionaire game copied from a previous billionaires game that crashed horrendously I mean how much more do you really need to know stay away from claims that say that this is a safe or conservative bet because that's also what they said about things like Celsius it's literally a joke oh and by the way there's a really funny moment in this interview I've been showing you that I want to play right here it's when Justin starts talking about this coin being backed by liquidity listen closely I think you'll be able to hear something in the background uh I think in the future we will be very careful to handle the liquidity pool and also um the whole market cap of the usdd just to be clear I did not add the siren it literally went off in the middle of their interview anyway that's basically it big thanks to the Twitter user defyak for helping me with some of this research and I want to thank all of you for watching
