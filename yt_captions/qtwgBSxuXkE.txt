ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the second day of the Champions chess tour it is the air things Masters which is the first event of six in this new modern format in 2023. long story short there's three divisions it's double elimination hundreds of Grandmasters and today we will be focusing on various Chess Records that were broken in division a or division one that is the best division first we have our semi-final matchup it's Magnus Carlson versus Arjun aragaisi of India and it's Wesley so versus Hikaru Nakamura uh the matchup of the finals in the chess.com Global Championship don't worry about all the names of the events uh I'm gonna take you through a lot of these records and uh yeah uh one major record is how fast my hair is just disintegrating I mean it's crazy it's probably from looking at all your games um anyway this will be a tragic departure of all my hair and then I'll have my you know I'll just have an egghead after that all right um first things first um we gotta look at this game between Alexis Toronto and alireza ferrugia now you might say Levy you didn't name either of these guys in the intro right this is double elimination when you lose there's a loser's bracket so these guys are in the losers bracket all right and first I want to show you this game and tell you the first Chess Record that was broken then we will look at you know magnus's match hikaru's match uh and so on I am out of water actually I have a drop left so I'm going to drink that drop um tremendous now I will be parched for 25 minutes all right Alexi started with D4 against ferrugia um Alexi lost a tough match against Magnus yesterday farrugio lost uh three nothing to Arjun arag I see this game was a semi-to-rush now uh there is a line here for black that goes Pawn takes Knight takes E4 Knight takes B takes Pawn takes Pawn takes Bishop check Bishop block Bishop take Queen take Castle Bishop out Pawn out Castle Bishop B7 Rook out Knight out Rook out Queen out Etc that's Chess at the highest level we could turn that into a you into a tick tock right that was that was real nice nice Pace we had right there um but nowadays what they do when you take on D5 is they take back on D4 and what they were doing for a while there was no I'm just kidding I'm not going to continue um was Queen D4 Ed and now this very interesting and aggressive move E4 but there's also this and what happened in this game was very weird because in this position serrana caught Ali Raza totally off guard with this queen A4 move first of all Knight C6 is wrong like you're supposed to go Knight bd7 to support the Knight so alireza got himself caught in prep and by this point was down 10 minutes in a 15-minute game that's not a lot of time for those of you that can do math well I didn't actually tell you the exact amount of time but white had 15 minutes white played every move instantly so farouja has five which is really really bad news and from this point forward Serana never let up he took the pawn that he was given right because that's the whole point I mean his position so strong he's gonna win the pawn took the pawn and then ferrugia attacked his Queen but Serana is a Gotham chess subscriber so he lost his Queen in one move and never got no I'm just no I'm so sorry uh oh God it it's medic humor to laugh at your own jokes uh Knight A4 he equal he knows that I can't I can't oh God okay he knows that he doesn't have to move his Queen out of the way because equal or exceeding danger right so he get he gives up his Queen he wins the queen back and then he goes like this he gives up the pawn on A2 completely to go Knight C5 upon to B6 and now two examples of danger levels Rook A1 if you move the bishop the Knight will take it then I can take it anywhere it moves so we have takes takes and now Serana just plays a surgical Eastern European Schoolboy type of end game two Bishops what else trades one pair of Rooks and then both designs I can beat YouTube Bishops versus just Bishop Knight my Bishops are laser beaming you I also have what's called a pawn majority you don't have to say it like a French person I'm just deranged A6 Bishop E5 and he's just going to bring his King check sneaks in and he's gonna win the house he's gonna win the pawns and now he's doing very well and the other thing is if you take on B2 I lock the cage then the horse is trapped Ali Reza got his night trapped and there was one final trick here look at this absolutely fascinating position King C5 is this position to draw King C5 looking for this this this this this this this winning this Pawn trying to make it maybe Serana sacrifices his Pawn in order to make a passer King E3 and the pawn runs and he makes a queen and gets back before Ali Reza can do anything King G1 it would have been more of the same checks and then that's a winning position Alexi serrana played a perfect game of chess like when I say a perfect game that was perfect you might not appreciate that game because you don't care who Alexi serrana is that was a perfect game of chess he knocked out alireza farouza in two games like they play a best of two in the loser in a loser's bracket folks Chess Record number one Oliver farooza just lost five games in a row this is the fourth ranked player in the world this is the youngest man to ever cross 2 800 feet a he went 0-3 yesterday and he went oh into bro he didn't win or draw a game he went oh out of five I don't know if that's ever happened that is nuts Serana moves on in the losers bracket by the way the whole brackets available in the description because I just can't show it all I just can't show it all to you I mean they they listen I love them for what they did and they gave hundreds of people an opportunity to make a career but good Lord isn't more confusing all right I'm you know I'm just I'm I got no professional production here anyway um the next match that I have for you is Hikaru versus Wesley so so every single time Wesley and Hikaru play each other it's like if I mean I I don't know what's a good movie scene with an infinite Loop I like I can't think of one I mean I'm thinking Harry Potter Voldemort but they nah they I mean Harry won that spoiler alert um so I don't know I mean they just you just Unstoppable Force immovable object this was their Armageddon game so Hikaru so what they do when they make it to Armageddon and the match is tied to break a tie black wins if the game is a draw but black starts with less time how much less time they bid both guys say I will play with this amount of time if you give me black Wesley bid 944 Hikaru bid 928 that's crazy that is crazy Hikaru beat him out by 16 seconds so he started the game down five and a half minutes on the clock and what did you did we get we got a billion because that's literally all they play against each other like and their styles are such razor thin right next to each other right and they and that's what they do so Hikaru plays an auntie Berlin rather Wesley plays in Auntie Berlin Hikaru plays what I can only understand as candidates preparation and early on oh and something else happened in this game there was a technical difficulty so like they played a game and then it restarted because it was wrong and then Wesley didn't play the same opening so weird it was like the weirdest thing it's like they played a game and it was an official game and the game had to abort and then I don't know it was really very online chess is hard right anyway from the early going it was Hikaru consolidating but then he started this attack and he got a really nice position I mean Wesley was trying to do his best but look at Hikaru King in the center does not care marching down the white king who is seemingly comfortably in the corner nope I'll tell you this king is in a villa in the Italian mountains thought he was far away from everybody and all of a sudden the enemy uh the the enemy family over there is uh rolling up the mountains you know what I mean like in their very fancy cars all right I mean that's basically the equivalent of what's going on here Hikaru has come to collect we have a little bit now he castles now the king is coming too King is also going to come join the attack over here in the mountains uh we have takes takes and Wesley starts to take a little bit more risk um but Hikaru is doing very well just absolutely no problems here and uh walks down into Wesley's territory ultimately but there's just nothing that can be done uh it's a very solid position but uh the players end up uh repeating moves here even though Hikaru actually could play on but they're playing Armageddon and this is actually the second Chess Record of the day that was broken uh because they finish their match kikaru won their match but he didn't win a game that's like that's like serious beast mode Behavior right there five draws and that is how you advance I mean that's tough only in chess is that possible that is like you know even in football like soccer right like if you advance by making a draw you're probably one in penalties or aggregate or goals away or whatever right four to four what was that Barcelona Liverpool I don't even remember but like I mean that's yeah these guys are such a tough that you they keep them away from each other do not let them play unless it's a final or something I don't even know let them play because I feel like they are so exactly similar in style and repertoire that well I mean I I don't know I was gonna say save it till the final but then the final will be boring there but they they put it on they put on a show against other players but it's because their styles are so similar this is just what happens it's not really a complaint it's just life that's just what happens you know what I mean like um but uh Hikaru advances he's our first finalist and our next finalist is one of these two guys so Magnus sat down to play Eric icy and he played a very weird system he played a symmetrical English with B3 and then he played Knight C3 and he played Queen B1 the move Queen B1 looks like well for those of you that don't know Magnus is not playing his games from Norway Magnus is playing his games from Toronto not because he loves Canada but because he's actually staying at the chesbraw Mansion uh I have no idea if it's a mansion but I can only assume so because they got like 10 dudes in there uh he's staying at the chess bra Mansion because he's on their Pro chess League team if you don't know what Pro chess league is and you have no clue what I'm saying right now don't worry I'll probably make a video about it at some point in the future or it's already out so Magnus is playing on the Canada team uh and uh he is also playing this event so he's crashing there and I'm assuming they're gonna film content and etc etc um Queen B1 is a move which is weird and uh it looks like again Magnus stayed up all night probably drank got you know woke up and thought he could Castle I don't I mean it just looks like you think that if you go here your Rook also hops over some of you beginners have done that because I've seen some of my students do that um Queen B1 is a strange move but you are trying to dominate the diagonal and there are ideas behind this I promise um Bishop E7 E3 and now Bishop B5 you can also play like A3 Bishop D3 this is like another weird way but Bishop B5 makes a lot of sense and you know it's not easy for black to develop the bishop to that square and the position from the opening looked like this you know we had a little file we had a little thing he played E4 F4 and then he danced back to B5 and then he took and then he did this and this this is positional masterpiece why traded his light scored Bishop five out of his remaining seven pawns are on light squares pretty soon it will be six because he will play H3 he controls the file and he has dark Square targets and this ridiculous Queen on B1 will slowly come out Queen C2 and there's another really fun idea in these positions which is at any given moment to just sacrifice The Rook very common idea to create a past pawn and also to create a blockade now you may notice the computer hates it right because it doesn't work at this very moment but look it's actually reconsidering and now it's saying it's equal it doesn't work in that exact move order but that's the general idea so Magnus just very slowly will improve his position slightest Queen over now Rook D5 now H3 and how does white go from here to totally dominant position sometimes in life and in chess you must take one step back to take two steps forward and in this position we have Knight to H2 and you are going to go here hitting this and also you are going to hit that again and you're going to go here and break this apart and when the guy over extends trying to defend himself now you go back and then you go here and now you have secured Knight G5 for yourself in the future and now you have an opposite colored Bishop position with pressure on this pawn and that's all Magnus needs that's all he needs and slowly and but surely Queen B3 even the queen trade at the right moment Rook takes Rook D6 one Pawn down another Pawn down is coming Rook G7 F3 just has to give up Division I mean in this position Eric icy was basically losing every Pawn he was going to lose this pawn and this pawn and that pawn and instead of losing any of those pawns Magnus just went directly for his Bishop he was like give me the bishop and uh yeah he wins it via Rook end game it was absolutely never close and he ends at an absolutely brutal style because if take take the king cannot I mean come on this is I mean good Lord I was like yo this man is he's up to it again he's gonna do it again I mean can you what what is this how does he just do this constantly to everybody he plays but that wasn't the end of the story C4 error guys he played D5 and a triangle triangle defense CD exchange Queen's Gambit declined and man this was a very odd move order both guys just grabbing Bishops nobody taking Knights and uh I mean this is don't play chess like this just don't even I mean like what like 90 to Knight G3 Knight F5 Knight H4 Knight he could do it you can't don't look at this I don't care you are like the eight-year-old kid who has a teenager sibling and sees them doing cool stuff and you can't do it you're not old enough yet stop you can't get away with stuff like this however you will notice white has a lot of dark squared pawns and no dark squared Bishop yes that's good positional play now we have H4 and K I mean literally just does whatever he wants really I nobody can control him uh Knight E2 Knight F4 nice take take open e-file various attacking ideas with H5 F5 Knight G5 maybe Knight E5 really flexible position and it's never too late to go Queen A4 and just give your opponent the uh you know the good old uh and they're not gonna get anything and it looked like it was just gonna be typical Magnus stuff boom boom Queen E2 all right he's down a pawn But Eric icy can't move anything but everybody seems like I'm not gonna lose nope G5 deep oh boy disconnecting the bishop wow it's actually not over now White's Bishop is locked down Queen G6 rookie seven Queenie oh sacrificing the pawn with a check but now Rook G7 blocks 96 back jumping into F4 oh boy oh boy and Arjun aragaisi was like bro I don't care if I'm playing Mac my king is safe but he blundered actually uh in this position I think I Regice should have defended his Knight first I think that's what the computer gave but we're just going to conveniently avoid that because stockfish ruins everything see again like if the eval bar wasn't there you would have never known anything you're not even paying attention you probably don't even have the game on your screen right now all right sitting there like oh yeah yeah Regice what how do you even watch chess without you know what I don't care thank you for watching regardless of if you even watch um I think after Queen E8 Queen F3 in this position uh uh Magnus had to play Queen takes Pawn and like give I mean that's not easy and they were low on time and Eric icy earned his stripes and I think your Magnus wanted to play F4 and if onpassant but to be honest that doesn't even make oh it does make sense this loses but he can go here dank ff2 just Bishop D3 uh yeah well Magnus played F3 I think he Mouse slipped and uh this is just a completely lost position uh and Magnus actually lost the game to Eric I see they also went to uh Armageddon um and uh yeah Magnus one their Armageddon was not it it wasn't like again armageddon's are only fun because one guy has a lot less time but Magnus uh got black and he held pretty comfortably he had uh five minutes less than every guy see so allow me to explain the extremely confusing format of this final so it's going to be Magnus versus Hikaru surprise surprise alireza knocked out Owen five ridiculous Hikaru advances by not winning a game Crazy um Magnus Hikaru in the final shocker no one could have seen that coming oh uh now the winner of the final does not actually win the final all right because what happens is when you lose in the final you are now going to the losers bracket to play the final match in the losers bracket against the winner of the losers bracket okay so you play that match whoever wins that match now plays the winner of the winners bracket which would be Magnus so Hikaru could lose to Magnus I'm pretty sure this is how it works then he would win in the losers bracket then he would go back and play Madness and then if he beats Magnus they have to play again because that was only magnus's first time losing yo it's dank it is dank but The Show Must Go On so Hikaru and Magnus will play the winners bracket final for now then we will see what happens I think that's how it works if I'm wrong and the last two minutes were completely incorrect I'm very sorry but I am trying to see this as a spectator if I confused any of you I'm sorry because I'm also confused but soon we will know what's up and Hikaru and Magnus have now both Auto qualified for this group one group a in the next event because the top three finishers Auto qualify so what does that mean winner of the losers bracket and the top two finishers in uh group a which they are because they're in the winner anyway just go just leave I bye I will see you tomorrow for Hikaru Magnus part one get out of here
