hey I'm not a furry so tell me how crazy is this I have 15 years of experience but much of it was at the same company so I don't have a ton of experience in many different environments that being said a new job I recently took has some pretty strict coding standards uh way more than I've dealt with in the past a lot of it makes sense basic solid stuff like making your methods short and to the point dry using line breaks when appropriate Etc others however are quite odd in my experience for instance this is C Sharp okay so obvious first mistake C sharp can we all agree C sharp clear mistake here just an absolute clear mistake uh let's see okay not using statements Allowed no using statements allowed weird every single declaration or usage must be fully spelled out with the fully qualified name for example I'm not exactly sure how [Music] this ever happen to happen like who at what point said you know what if you don't import standard and C plus plus we don't import anything in C sharp like that's the only thing that makes sense here uh file folder structure and naming each dot CS file should contain no more than one member a class is broken into perhaps a dozen CS I think I just had a tomgasm what the hell did I just read you have a file for each method what property Constructor including both the type of member method and property and scope public and static in the same of the file or same name of the file example would be the be this one class one static property my prop someone just said in here someone just said that doesn't look too bad who said oh there it was did you see that this isn't that bad actually man that glass is half full my friend your glass is so half full I am I'm shook that you could actually go it's not that bad I mean have you seen Jay diesel you're right you're right this ain't no Jade diesel okay this ain't no Jade diesel but what the hell what the hell are you trying to say here [Music] uh okay no no I get it I get it I get it I can't no no berating the employees I get it I'm sorry I'm sorry dark ninja has some valid points we will start using partial class implementation file property Constructor method as soon as possible foreign [Music] third party references okay okay I'm excited I like third-party references do you guys like third-party references because you know sometimes I don't like to write every piece of code like I don't want to write HTTP 2 again uh third party references they hate a nougat uh every project has a underscore dependencies folder which contains a third-party Diller's reference to the project in turn internally developed libraries again nuget is not allowed not even for internal feeds if a project needs to reference a little output from another project they just have to add that project to the solution and do a project reference they have dozens and dozens of internally developed tooling like this and an average solution file might have eight or nine project referenced in it I feel like I'm taking crazy pills but I'm curious of others opinions Mortimer 452 you are not taking crazy pills okay you are a completely sane and normal individual and this is perfectly in exactly how a good Enterprise C sharp Microsoft Project should be oriented okay this is beautiful and precise C sharp okay so don't let anybody try to fool you into believing that this is anything but the Lord's way of doing coding okay okay let's read some comments uh okay 10 years of experience all in C sharp what the actual what are the justifications for these things I would say all your boy bullet points are highly unusual that is such a nice term for what they are what you're saying is unusual no it's not it's not it's not Tom level genius I'm just saying it's unusual that's all I'm saying okay unusual uh I'm not let's see I'm not justifying any of this insanity but though but this rule class is broken to perhaps does it reminds me of a job I took back in 2010 where we used a centralized Source control no no tell me tell me this is not Jay diesel this cannot be a continuation of J diesel you cannot tell me this is Jay diesel you cannot say this this is not true where we use the centralized Source control product that was configured such that if you checked out if you if you checked out a file it was locked and no one else oh okay not okay it's not it's not it's not uh it was locked and no one could edit that file until you checked it back in okay that's Mercurial isn't it we didn't do anything crazy like this but I can see scenarios where if you have exclusive locks on files for Source control where you'd want to decompose classes into the smallest parts so that if Susan is Susan come on is modifying a method of the class I can still work on another method of the same class okay I mean this is oddly notification for the craziest programming principle I've ever seen in my entire lifetime but I kid you not this actually is completely reasonable justification what brain still insane yes absolutely Susan could be the genius in this situation dude Tom and Susan power couple careful careful careful why not use git I don't why are you asking me okay why are you asking me I didn't make this as soon as it just keeps checking out all the files let's see okay yes reminding me blah blah this is precisely the reason why they are doing it but with only three devs it seems Overkill oh wow wow that guy called it that guy called literally the reason so it's a source control problem dude I'm so confused I feel like if this I haven't used tortoise SVN in so long but three devs what kind of product are you working on that you're colliding that much second off what year was this this was 26 days ago I get that if this was 20 years ago when I was using tortoise put this ain't tortoise anymore can we move on can we just move on three devs one get oh let's see on uh that was TFS uh in my let's see in my job I don't know what does TFS stand for am I too I'm not Reddit enough I don't read it I don't read it oh my goodness I think it may have been visual Source safe's fault Tom Foundation server okay it's Tom Foundation server Tom genius again it's clear genius Tom Coming showing his prowess showing his prowess his heavy heavy prowess right uh let's see uh TFS old Microsoft Source control dude crazy crazy I remember having to ask a TFS admin to unlock a file while someone was on vacation yeah that that can't be real that can't be real I want that job give me that job I want to go on vacation lock the Epic date hey I don't I don't trust any of you dabs okay I'm locking the whole while I'm on vacation I vacation you vacation that is so beautiful this is the most beautiful or I I cannot believe this can exist I cannot believe this can actually exist let's see a file per method is absolutely insane these standards seem incredibly controlling to the extent that I wonder how micromanaged other things are yeah wait you can just you can have your title hey Eric 987-235 here yeah that's the only let's see that's the only one that really jumped out at me really that's the only one that's the only one like that this didn't jump out at you this didn't jump out at you this didn't jump out of you like what do you mean how is this not all so crazy again .net more like dot not a gen
