so the nice thing about edsack is it's a big enough computer you can walk around inside it and it has all the components you would find in a modern machine but now rather than being buried inside a piece of silicon i can actually point at them this rack is the beating heart this is generating the clock that drives the rest of the machine and then the remaining circuits down here are what we call the digit pulse generators we need to know when the first second third and fourth bit of a number is going through the machine because edsat works serially rather than in parallel like a modern machine and so what these circuits are doing is dividing down those clock pulses and so every time a new word comes into the machine then bit 36 will light up digit 36 on the digit pulse generators so this here i said is the beating heart and there's a lovely knob on the front so you can speed the machine up and slow it down what does 36 have to do with anything so when you're designing a machine particularly with a numerical calculation you need to choose a word length that holds enough digits for the kind of calculations you want to do and with 36 bits you can work on 10 10 digit numbers and that was the target that the edsack team had and at that period machines didn't manipulate characters so the idea of bytes and 8-bit quantities that was too small it wasn't a useful number so the early machines we always talk about the word length and edsack was 36 other machines at the time would have been 36 40 60 depending on how much precision they wanted in their numbers and that was the the driving influence on the numerical machines so that's the the clock generators and the digit pulse generators these two racks and there are two more identical to them at the back of the machine these are the interface to the memory in the original machine the memory consisted of long tanks full of mercury and the idea was to store numbers you sent them into the mercury's electrical pulses those pulses travel at the speed of sound down the mercury tube and so in a 5 foot tube of mercury you can store a large number of bits and then at the far end you can receive those bits either regenerate them and send them back round the tube and then you store them or you can send them out to the computer if it's the word information the computer wants so just give me a minute let's go and get the key this is a short delay line this one would hold just one word of data and each end is a what's called a piezoelectric crystal that's a crystal which twitches if you put electric current through it and so you transmit from one side that will send a sound wave through the mercury when it hits the other end it compresses the crystal that makes it emit electricity was the 36-bit word if that word was all ones then you'd have 36 pulses if it was all zeros it would be completely quiet and if it was one zero one zero one zero you'd have pulse gap pulse gap pulse gap these were used for what you would now call registers in the computer like the accumulator the current instruction the program counter which they called sequence counter there were much longer five foot tubes that were used in the memory and being five foot long those can contain several hundred bits and you needed that to scale up to the 1000 words of memory the original machine had would they have been exactly the same very similar but they were mounted in sets of 16 held in place by rigid frame for the system to work properly the two crystals have to be exactly in line and you want to minimize any kind of thermal expansion effects so it's a significant piece of engineering to build the long tubes for each individual tank of mercury there's one of these and it essentially has a transmitter that sends the pulse into the tank of mercury a receiver that picks up the pulse and then cleans it up and turns it into a one or zero that the computer is expecting they took the mercury delay line idea from radar where their concept had been developed but they knew it had limitations and and expected there to be improvements and other kinds of memory technology so they designed it that these units could drive other things the mercury and that works for us because mercury is expensive toxic and has some operational problems so we're replacing the mercury delay lines with ones made out of stretched steel wires the same idea we send pulses through them but we send the pulses by twisting the wire and that little twitch goes down the y and have a train of twitches going down as far as these are concerned it could be a mercury delay line it could be one of those steel wire delay lines it could be any other kind of delay line so even the first machine they were thinking about memory upgrades this empty rack is one we haven't started very much work on yet this would have been the circuits to drive the paper tape reader and the teleprinter we do have a teleprinter and we do have a tape reader we've been driving those using a modern computer to test them out we've now got to design the interface circuits that fit here these switches were what were called engineer switches all early machines had these so that when engineers were testing the computer you could key in an instruction and see if the machine would obey it and in the higher part of the machine up here will be a bank of things called uni selectors which are a mechanical device that are the equivalent of the boot rom in the modern pc it had a hard wired small program that would be fetched into the main memory machine and that program executed knew how to read in user programs written in the user programming language which is a kind of assembly code so this is will be a very important rack when it's done these three racks are called main control as each instruction is fetched from the memory well main control does that fetch when it's got the instruction it has to decode it and tell the rest of the machine what to do so in these circuits here you've got the various stages of all the decoding and for example for an ad instruction main control knows it has to fetch data out of the memory of the machine give it to what's called the accumulator in the computer part of the machine and tell the the computer to add that data to the number that's already there if it's a subtract instruction it's the same data flow but it has to tell the computer part of the machine to do a subtraction so this wasn't using sort of binary with two's complement or that sort of thing oh yeah there is a two's complement machine but this is essentially the logic that's decoding the instructions and then working the various units so in a modern machine you'd call this instruction fetch and decode again it's quite complicated because it's got to read in the instruction as a sequence of pulses look at the whole sequence decode them and then tell the rest of the machine what to do in the original machine there would have been a large wooden box and inside that the mercury delay lines and there's another box at the very back of the machine how much mercury would that be um the current day price is about 160 000 pounds worth and quite a significant weight in its own right so we will still have a wooden box here but it'll be our steel wire delay lines in them here is the second bank of circuits that are driving the memory the regeneration circuits and then as we come completely round this part presently is empty but in fact all the chassis are in cambridge where a chap is working on them this would be the computer part of the machine so in here would be the adding circuits the multiplying circuits shifting and all those all those parts so in the terminology of the time these three racks are the computer would you say processor no they said they call it the computer because it's doing computation adding and subtracting this part in the middle main control is the automatic bit of edsec and then the two sets of racks that you saw for storage generation are the delay storage part of the machine so as you walk around you're seeing the individual parts of the machine and you can tie it back to the the name edsack what's going on behind here people hard at work so we're having a volunteers meeting here today we meet about every three months to see how various parts are progressing and to swap notes and make sure everything's going to connect together most of our volunteers have been building the circuits at home on kitchen tables in garden sheds the tools you need a soldiering iron oscilloscope so you can look at the waveforms and so forth and then we bring them here and connect them together and see what happens these are similar sorts of tools as to what the original people building very much so well john i think you started your career as a radar technician in the air force which is how you got to know this technology so john is working here on the unit selector unit i talked about the boot rom or the initial instructions those are coded by how he's wired up these uni selectors when the operator presses the start button a rotor spins in here and as it passes each set of contacts that gets injected into the memory to download the program and it's an impressively noisy thing when you make it work sorry it's so noisy no that's fine each of these units has got a set of fingers inside if you come on this side you can see it okay okay press the button and so essentially you're reading that initial program off the contacts as the finger spins around in the machine they called them the initial orders it was a fixed program that knew how to read in user programs and it was compared to a modern boot rom it's actually quite clever it could read in programs and assembly code and knew how to join in library routines all written all written in 40 instructions amazingly compact clever code so would this be what would be known as bootstrap yeah very much so some of these valves are coming out of boxes that are labeled 1943 so they've not been used they were made it's already written a sequence of outputs that collects all of the stamps in the world you'd think you're done right you've built this machine suddenly it's collected all the stamps in the world no there could be more stamps within the arm system in the first archimedes would run reliably well above 100 degrees c
