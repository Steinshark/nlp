this is world's cheapest laptop all the way to the most expensive so let's see what improves as you spend more money and does expensive necessarily mean better so at just 70 we have a code of 1.1 pretty basic unboxing experience it just comes presented in some foam inserts but even then how is this possible for that price this is a full laptop it's thin it's light it's got a smooth matte finish and like it's not even badly built the hinge is smooth the body doesn't Creak this 70 laptop comes with 12 months of Microsoft apps included worth sixty dollars the delivery was free oh my God the trackpad's probably a 5 out of ten it's a little bit small and rough but it does respond to multi-touch gestures this keyboard though this I would give a six to the Keys have nice travel which gives that satisfying typewriter-like experience only downside is the plastic around the keys does flex a little bit as you press now for every laptop we're also going to run cinebench which gets the computer to render this incredibly realistic difficult scenario to see how powerful the processor is so in this case our dual core 1 0.1 gigahertz Intel Celeron is really struggling this is like watching paint dry which leads us to a pretty lowly score of 308 points to be fair though you really don't need much power to run things like Microsoft Word and this is plenty and then to test the graphics GTA five this is quite funny the laptop's 64 gigabytes of internal memory is not even enough to hold the game so running out of this which costs about three times as much as the laptop another fun fact this laptop actually doesn't have the graphics power to even be able to open GTA 5 in full screen so you actually have to go into the app config file and tweak the settings so that it only opens in this windowed mode and then we full screen it oh my gosh it's running at like four frames per second so we're running this at 800 by 600 resolution that's like a smartphone resolution from 12 years ago hardest thing to process here is the loading times of everything I'm waiting for this game to load for about 10 minutes oh my God we're in but it does look like a mobile game in a best case scenario I'll move my finger across the trackpad and like a full two seconds later the laptop follows feels kind of ironic trying to sprint in this condition Okay so we've jumped online and I clicked quick join into a real other person's race although the irony of quick is not lost on me I'm sorry moving in 1968. it's actually just occurred to me how much lag is going to be introduced into this session for my so yeah 1968 on GTA 5 my mom's age hey off we go look how their cars just jumping there is so much lag happening right now probably mostly on my end I've just gone through a building that shouldn't have happened just got absolutely whooped by a 55 year old so how much more does 500 get you this is the Lenovo v15 G2 and first impressions the unboxing is surprisingly similar still a plain cardboard box which just like last time comes with a laptop embedded between two pieces of foam and then a charger but in terms of the actual machine itself big difference the webcam has gone from a slightly laggy pretty grainy 720p image on the coda to a slightly higher quality but still 720p webcam but it does have a light that shows you when a program is accessing it when even a manual shutter that you can use to physically cover it up during your private moments there's more ports on the sides including a full-on ethernet for Wired internet a Kensington Lockport which lets you physically restrain your laptop to your office table for example and also a USB 3.2 Port which if I try and transfer across the same file on both of these laptops on the coder if I drop that onto the desktop it took about five seconds drag the same file across that just happened instantly there was no loading bar I guess it makes sense theoretically USB 3.2 is 10 times faster than USB 2.0 I like this trackpad it's made of a noticeably smoother material and if you listen to The Click sounds that the coder makes compared to this the Lenovo does feel more refined and put together 7 out of 10. the keys are also smoother they're very cushioned and there's no flexing of the body at all when you hit them which is great for typing quietly but it does lose a little bit of that satisfying chaotic typing energy that the coda has so actually my rating at a six overall oh we haven't talked about speakers yet both laptops have bottom firing speakers which does sound like a strange idea but it's actually done with a lot of mid-price machines like this to try and bounce the sound into your face as opposed to just blindly shooting up into the ceiling but the sound quality is where this is the 70 coder well the point is you can tell that these are low power speakers that are not moving a lot of air but for five hundred dollars [Applause] much better it lacks a little bit of sharpness but it's good enough the screen's gone from an 11.6 inch to a 15.6 inch which is about two times the area although I would say the contrast is slightly worse and the viewing angles kind of suck because this is a TN panel which is the most basic form of modern LCD but where I am noticing the biggest improvement with this 500 laptop is the performance everything takes so long to happen on the coda even pulling up the Bing home page is a big ask although it might just not want to I can see why but everything here is happening many times faster fast enough that it doesn't feel like a burden and that's because for starters the storage has gone up from 64 gigabytes of simple flash memory to 256 gigabytes of fast M2 SSD there's a better wi-fi chip and better antenna which is making such a difference that we're stuck at 40 megabits per second here but we're at 200 on the Lenovo even though we're the same distance from the same network it's the benefit of being compatible with Wi-Fi 6 which this one isn't the process has been upgraded from a 1.1 gigahertz dual core to a 2.2 six gigahertz AMD ryzen 3 quad-core with actually eight threads meaning that it can handle even more workflows leading to an astronomical CPU bump on cinebent all the way from 308 points to 4942. that's actually wild suspending seven times more does actually get you a lot more than seven times the performance 6 16 times in this case and of course this upgraded chip also has upgraded Graphics baked into it so if we pull up GTA 5 again so much better it actually looks like a proper PC game now I don't love the lack of contrast on the screen it does look quite washed out but it is thankfully running at at least 30 frames per second which is smooth enough that you can kind of just not think about it let's see if we can find moon in 1968 again let's give her something to moan about now that I'm back with some proper equipment it's been a long time since I've played proper PC games but you know what it is pretty cool that for 500 you can play GTA 5 on quite easily medium settings meaning that from the next laptops of onwards we're going to be going even past the technical Max limit of this game now let's see for ourselves this is where things get properly exciting the 1200 MSI Katana you can definitely tell the weight of the package has gone up but I'm quite surprised to see that the quality of the presentation is kind of the same there's a much larger power supply to keep something off this caliber Juiced up and the laptop it does beg the obvious question the 500 laptop is already at the point where there's very little wrong with it so what on Earth do you get for two and a half times the price of that okay the web page of this laptop is actually hilarious the new Katana gf76 is built with the same Exquisite craftsmanship used to forge a blade what do I do with that knowledge foreign anyways aside from the blade-like properties the first thing I'm noticing is that it is even bigger isn't it beating around the bush this is one of the chunkiest laptops I've ever laid my hands on it's kind of great because you know there's so much space to rest your hands on but I wouldn't necessarily say that the build quality is any higher it's about the same the trackpad's still on the smaller side I have no idea why when they have this much room for it it's good quality but I'm not loving the amount of force you need to put in to click it but I am enjoying this keyboard it's backlit for starters which is an actual game changer if you're planning on using it in bed at night though it is kind of evil looking so don't know how I feel about that and then the majority of the keys they are still a little bit on the soft side they don't have a huge amount of travel Which is less fun for typing but it means you can be more responsive when you're gaming and they've at least made sure that the space bar and the enter key do feel distinct and satisfying I could do this for quite a long time very fun 8 out of ten but twelve hundred dollars is well within what I would call the luxury price range so at this point it's not just about how good the fundamentals are it's also the other niceties for example it leans a lot more into gaming specific features so you've got this entire MSI Suite which lets you do literally any kind of fiddling you could possibly think of this gaming mode Wi-Fi analysis Hardware diagnosis everything you get high-res audio still coming from two downwards facing speakers but those now have two watts of power each instead of 1.5 so this is the base of the last laptop again very inoffensive sound there's nothing wrong with it and this is twelve hundred dollars it's definitely punchier and I can also tell more spatial separation essentially just because there's more distance between the two speakers but doesn't feel like a whole tier above I would say the general browsing around on the internet feels way quicker and if we run one of these speed tests you will probably be able to see why so again same connection to the same network but this has faster download speed by about 50 megabits per second almost double the upload speeds but the biggest Improvement you're getting between these two price points is the latency it's gone all the way from 102mm seconds to just 27. and when you've got general internet speeds as fast as this the latency actually becomes the bigger determining factor in the overall experience oh yeah also the screen huge leap I mean to start with just like the rest of the laptop it's bigger at 17.3 inches which might sound like a subtle difference versus 15.6 but in total that's about 25 more screen area which I'd actually say is very much the difference between this feeling like a laptop experience Tiding me over until I get home to my proper rig and feeling like you're at your main workstation like this is the place where the job gets done but also this is an IPS panel which compared to this TM panel is brighter has more poppy colors and better contrast and has a 144hz refresh rate versus 60. it'll be tough for you to experience it just through the camera but trust me all the scrolling and the browsing feels Next Level responsive and definitely like you're getting treated as opposed to just being purely functional but I think the thing you'll be most surprised by is the power difference so in terms of CPU now we have a 12th gen Intel i7 and it's actually kind of wild it's got 14 cores and 20 threads and if we run the same cinebench Benchmark that's 14 744 or in other words a full-on three times Improvement which yet again is more than the difference in price but this is what I'm here for the graphics this is the single biggest jump with this laptop because we've moved from integrated Graphics of 500 to a dedicated RTX 3060 graphics card now which as far as the general population's laptops are concerned easily puts this in the top five percent should be a night and day Improvement it's loaded in about a third of the time the last one and the cool bit is that this is powerful enough that this isn't even running just normal GTA this is GTA plus an additional set of Graphics mods called the ENB series which adds on additional effects like depth of fields and motion blur and better water this is the biggest jump so far textures are super high resolution now this graphics card also supports real-time Ray tracing which is why the lighting looks so ridiculously realistic I can't even picture what the next laptop is going to look like and you can see the lighting in real time cars going past so if twelve hundred dollars is already the luxury premium experience what on Earth does a seven thousand dollar laptop even do time for the mothership the MSI Titan all of a sudden the presentation has taken not just a step but a Leap Forward the box is super premium and dense the laptop is the first thing you see and it comes packing you get a little dragon for some reason you got 128 gigabyte USB stick which is pretty cool because it's got separate ends for both USBC and USB a and there's actually double the storage that the entire first laptop came with I think it even comes with a proper Mouse inside and then our power live rivaling the volume of the first laptop it in itself my God what has this thing been eating so to answer the question it's seven thousand dollars you get everything every Cutting Edge feature that a laptop could possibly offer everything that you don't need but you really really want it's here so for example this is not just a standard membrane keyboard like the rest of the laptops have or in other words one big plastic sheet with pressure pads underneath each key this is a mechanical keyboard every single key is its own moving part with its own mechanism to make each press just feel that extra bit crispy and purposeful I didn't know this until I just used it but as far as laptop keyboards go this is what a 10 feels like plus the LED system makes it look like a unicorn just vomited all over it and I'm not complaining about that there are lights everywhere on this thing there's the keyboard there's the logo these two strips over here the engine what what even is this and the control that you get over them is absolutely nuts I mean look at this software just for the logo alone I can pick every color it Cycles through the speed it Cycles how it cycles and here at the bottom I've got individual control over every single one of these zones and the keyboard is even more insane you can literally customize how each individual key reacts to being pressed this is kind of a fun exercise so this is how the speakers sounded on the original 70 laptop just use this as a point of reference of where we've come from this is what the Titan sounds like this is a world of difference I mean technically that's not a huge surprise this laptop is a hundred times the price of this stuff and it has a quad speaker system with two separate woofers just to handle base it's only just fully occurring to me how ridiculously bright the screen is it's got the same 144hz refresh rate as the last one but instead of it being a full HD IPS panel it's an Ultra HD mini LED panel it's based on similar LCD Tech as before but instead of having like one main backlight that shines onto it you have thousands of tiny LEDs that give you basically extreme levels of color Fidelity and contrast or in other words it's two times the brightness and four times the resolution I mean I could just keep going on and on it's got even more extreme Wi-Fi to the point where your router is going to be the bottleneck even faster USB ports to the point where whatever you're transferring from will be the limiting factor a proper cooling system four fans six exhausts and eight pipes but the thing that I'm most interested in is what this means for performance and gaming so this is running the Intel Core I9 139 808x processor which is probably the most gobbledygook naming I've ever heard from a tech company but basically means 24 cores 32 threads a technical Max of 5.6 gigahertz without even overclocking and 29 604 points on cinebench more than doubling the already high ceiling of the last laptop and the RTX 1490 Graphics is an even bigger jump It's Gonna mean we can take Grand Theft Auto to a whole other level oh my goodness so you know how the last laptop we had a graphics mod on GTA right now we're running 11 separate Graphics mods at the same time and this looks absolutely ridiculous this is probably the most advanced Graphics I've ever seen on a video game there are mods for everything right now lighting textures blue blue ray tracing uh even stuff like the density of vegetation goodness me look at the reflections of the entire city on the water I will say the fans are going absolutely out of control completely worth it over this one thing that I find absolutely hilarious though is that for all the things this laptop does look at the quality of the webcam why MSI why now if you ever find yourself spending large sums of money online like I have here please do
