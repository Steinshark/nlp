hey we are live on LinkedIn and later this video will be on YouTube and today the topic is are you looking for a c plus job okay that's the reason I went live and I know there is a lot of uh people which you know in the tech industry have become available again and have the opportunity to look for a new job to say that in a positive way um and meeting sickness plus has now for two years organizing uh I have been organizing an event for this and next week we have the next event the meeting series online drop Fair which is um what I want to talk to you about and also this TV sharing form where right now you can submit uh to up to 10 employers your uh resume or CV to see what if they're interested in you know giving you an interview and maybe a job even um so let me first talk about next week's event because I think that's like probably the most interesting to you right now um when you're able to join this event next week then you would be able to talk to some of those companies and let me talk about this a little bit um also if you have any questions in the chat I'll be of course you know looking every now and then and uh then I'm be able to answer those questions but first let's have a look at the event next week and what video C plus plus is doing here so this is a picture of the job fair from two years ago and this time um we are having six companies four of them are sponsors at the job fair um should mention that image D is technically not on the online event they're just in the form which I'm going to talk in a minute about um but Quasar DaVinci a lot again and ikawa's security software again we are in Latina's Medical Systems will be at the online event and you will be able to have a conversation about what they do as simple as possible with them for three hours each for screw up you can see here are the links to the Meetup event job fair dot meetingcpp.com is how you get on this page right now there are four companies which are attending as sponsors and until we have five companies which are will be at the event which you can actually meet and have a conversation with and six companies which have a registered interest for this event right now um these are the pages and the events on LinkedIn not not anything on media um Meetup is yeah meeting simplifies online is my user group for online events you can join that we are also having on next week Thursday uh the current Coupe maintenance as a guest and and following week on Monday we have Ryan agreements I guess speaking on concurrency so there are interesting uh online events in this group um and so this is the one component I wanted to talk about is we have the job fair next week which um if employers are still interested to join that as possible just let me quickly say that um but today I'm mostly talking to you know if you're actually looking for a job not if you're offering an open position so the other option I have for you is the CV sharing form which currently holds 10 companies where you can select to send your CV to okay so CV upload dot meetingcpp.com will get you to that site um it should be in the video description to those students drop Fed Up the ecp.com and see the upload.vac.com and oh yeah so 10 companies as of today they are imagely cervo Max King kdep Native Instruments Circa ambition Kazar Da Vinci and Vlada genius um there are this is a wide range of companies which are you know from the gaming to the financial work to uh audio um and in between there's embedded there's companies which are remote first and there's companies which are offering International or different relocation options and so there's a little bit for everyone um and this is kind of the first step of this form where you can select you know a little bit of what you know about C plus possibly have you worked and also someone had a um a question about the relocation and the uh remote option today this is basically either how far do you want to move for a new job or um how far in the time zone are you willing to do a remote job like you know if you're doing internationally remote are you willing to stand up at midnight for your client and to go at 8am and into that because that's their work day and um maybe you're more flexible in that but yeah are you are you more like looking for remote work in your country or on your continent or internationally um which doesn't mean that you have to work from Midnight to 8am it's just an extreme example of what this could mean um and so this form then in the next uh when you go here and continue to share yesterday that's basically what you do then you add the CV and you select which employers uh you want this CV to be shared with so whatever you upload here is not automatically shared with those companies you still have to select that um and I think that's important cause um this is not like you know I want I want this to be focused on like that that it fits for both sides that the companies are not just you know having like 100 candidates to look on and pick the the best fitting ones but that actually the companies get uh candidates which have been selecting the company not interested in that company um that's the thought behind that um and that's basically it if you're looking for a job um send out this form and you will be able right now to contact 10 companies um and another thing which I've been giving some talks and writing blog posts about is this form also over all the other candidates sending this gives us an Aggregate and when I look at the blog post here uh we can see like this is the aggregate of last year um this is like what the candidates knew about uh their C plus skills and their fields of Works which have been attracted by the job fair um and just quick mentioned it also has like a lot of uh influence which companies show up like when we have a finance company we have more people from finance and especially uh when we have a gaming company then we have a little bit more game devil low personal showing up um so take those graphs as a bit of salt um and that's basically it let me see if there's any questions I see there's a question let me add the question to the screen is there a job position for connecting embedded systems to self-driving cars [Music] um I don't know the positions of the company so maybe as the answer I can give you but um let me go back into here into those so looking at the logos here ambition is um connected or owned by Daimler so they are doing technically working on similar systems and they might be working on automated driving or something like that I don't know you have to talk to them um and otherwise there's some companies which are doing embedded work in here but I don't know if they're actually doing embedded work and automotive and if that's connected to that topic um I do not know that but it's a good question then thank you for listening
