ladies and gentlemen welcome back to your favorite series on the internet guess the ELO in this series my twitch subscribers submit their games live to me when I'm streaming and I blindly analyze them and guess what their rating is today's episode has games that were so ridiculous they almost gave me a heart attack and put me in the hospital with a coma now before we jump into the games give me about 30 seconds of your time I've got some good news I've just launched a brand new chess course on Chesley which is my courses website on the Queen's Gambit declined it's a full repertoire against D4 C4 and Knight F3 it's got over five hours of video over 400 useful training exercises and as always folks there is a sample chapter link is in the description if you want to check it out this entire first chapter on the Queen's Gambit decline is absolutely free and every time we launch a new course we have a 50 off sale everything on Chesley is 50 off so basically the sponsor of today's video is myself and chesley's not a sponsor it is my courses website you are supporting me if you check out these chess courses they are wonderful and it's not just this one we have a bunch beginner chess course is wonderful middle games master class is outstanding as well really check it out go check out the free stuff at least it's a hundred percent free all right let's play guess the ELO uh game number one random new with the white pieces Gotham sub with the black pieces E4 G6 okay 500 let's go guess um okay definitely below a thousand wow very sophisticated black should open up the center here with Knight C5 D5 F5 is also good all right doesn't know I'm passion oh Something's Gonna Get blundered soon Knight F5 take the bishop oh not not now now Knight F3 check real quick yup gorgeous yeah white I wouldn't have traded but that's fine okay you're winning get the queen out get the Rook out amazing Queen F5 amazing amazing oh my God what who is this is this Magnus what this is like the best game I've ever seen uh-oh is the August Bishop E4 was winning The Rook what's the bro you're pushing the wrong pawns bro you're pushing the wrong pawns thank you why are you pushing those pawns bro you could have pushed the other Pawn so long ago oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh the conversion was a little bit suspicious I don't know why that guy was pushing his Queen side pawns but he could have pushed his GNH pawns all the way back here I mean he had a completely winning position after 20 moves but it took him like 10 000 years and he cleaned the wrong bomb but he still won God damn all right I still think it's three digit though uh but the way black played got me feeling like it's not three digit I think white just played like three digit but I mean black played white black didn't even blunder that's that's unbelievable all right so if I had to estimate I would say that white would get an estimate of around a thousand a round of I think black would get an estimate of around 1500. if not higher and what do I think the actual rating of the game is I think like 1100. I think that's my estimate of this game I think one person just had much better fundamental opening principles than the other but it's getting heavily skewed by the fact that white played so badly chance in hell that white of's 1500. how was the how is that possible I mean didn't I say that black played like a 1500 holy bro it thought black is a 2100 holy crap okay but to be fair I said that black played like a 1500 and white played like a 1000. so I was basically saying that blackout played white by 500 so I'm right I'm correct yeah you're wrong uh I don't know what I'm talking about anyway but black got the better of white in that game the opening was balanced no the hell it wasn't you stoner it was like losing for white after 10 moves what do you mean the opening was about I think this thing just ends its opening at like move nine wow wow okay well Gotham sub I'm really sorry but your opponent really pulled you down there buddy I that's not my fault it's just not it's not my fault I refuse to you know take accountability your opponent did not play well that game at all okay I'm I'm sorry they just didn't play well I I would love to have given you props and I kind of thought I know I did I thought you played like a 1500 but I uh yeah wow all right E4 second game I mean these games are this is a BlackMart dimmer or did white just hang upon we're about to find out okay oh Queen H4 oh no oh no that's a queen H4 check okay let's just forget for a second that black could go here let's just forget about that black got like 80 other good moves bro like he somebody just donated ten dollars and said check my game on Discord and linked a Discord link in the middle of a guess the ELO recording guy donated ten dollars to pull his game up like we're filming for YouTube brother just gave 10 bucks just took a ten dollar bill set it on fire it's gone completely gone guys why I'm why y'all doing this to yourselves I'm not I'm Gonna Keep moving on I'm not come on guys you could have used that ten dollars on yourself ain't nobody cutting that okay now white is crushing all right let's learn okay let's learn a couple of things number one when we're in the middle of a guess that you're recording don't donate ten dollars to get your game analyzed that's crazy behavior number two you got a lead in development you got more Center space it's too early in the game to be playing moves like D5 it's too early in the game you need to develop the other pieces and castle that's what you got to do okay you gotta play Knight C3 you're gonna play all these different things all right and right this just doesn't ain't a thing for a chicken wing it's not right okay I made you oh sorry sorry sorry yeah I turned off streamer we'll keep that in too I turned off streamer mode for a second so my Discord alert went off that's funny sorry anyway this is why you don't push pawns before you're developed because now your opponent is going to be close oh my God oh my God Bishop G's you can tell this game is like played by 800s because the opening is The Hunger Games you know in The Hunger Games in that first scene when like five people die this is the 800 ELO chess's The Hunger Games in the first 10 moves it's just running to safety and making sure you don't perish okay that's what it like look at this the whole field is clear and Black's just down a rook take the Rook take the Knight good long Castle this should be five check I predicted all these moves uh Bishop C6 okay rookie one nice G3 nice Knight F3 nice H4 okay rookies predicted like all those moves H4 is coming it will be played at some point oh not if you lose the pawn take the bishop oh good move take the Knight nice take the bishop take H7 um is there a mate okay you're just gonna win an end game no no no stupid stuff please take don't steal mate cut the king off good cut the king off cut the king off oh my God cut the king off now you can't he's gonna play King D6 cut the king off cut the king okay ladder mate there it is beautiful all right um triple digit uh triple digit for sure I mean you played a black mardemer and then you lost in four moves but your opponent played C6 then you played a bad move and then when everything was said and done you were up a rook I don't have a huge amount of information in this game I just kind of have an opening uh I'm gonna say 700 maybe 800 but I would I would say high 700 is what I'm thinking this is a 1500 game versus 1400 I mean how the how is that even possible how is that even possible but no I mean like how do you how do you blunder Queen H4 check how does the guy not sequinate how did the guy spend 50 seconds on this is this your friend do you pay this guy to lose to you guys this guy's just that comic count is 10 years old he's at a chess.com account for 10 years I I don't I don't even know what this I mean I I I don't I don't care let's just get through the episode I think I might have to call an ambulance this this is so I mean this just so sick it's just so sick you can be 1500 playing like I'm that's so sick come on guys you're sending me a lot of games where you're good wait what did uh what the chess.com think you were by the way chess.com thought white was 1800 in the last game and black was 1100 charles.com thought black played so poorly that they are 700 points different that is craziness I mean all right Gotham sub is black in the next game thank God we have a normal opening it's a nimso Indian B6 good F5 no no no the entire point of putting the Knight on e4 in the nimso is to take on C3 with the bishop and build behind your knight with F5 that's the whole point this is the point and then you go here and do all the good stuff why would you play Knight E4 and now this is nuts Bishop E7 but now you just have nothing you didn't even play a five oh why he why did he hang a pawn just nobody I'm gonna cry this is the problem with intermediate level chess this is the problem you buy a course for seventy dollars when it's fifty percent off that was made by Anish giri or something you can't even explain what the whole point of the opening is if I asked you to explain the point of this position to a five-year-old you couldn't do it what's the point of this whole opening what is what are all these moves fighting against this Square white would like to take the center with everything at the underneath every sophisticated chest opening is a fundamental idea that's why white does this to slowly build for the center all the moves are battling for one square and you just lost it you're just giving white all the central space that's what I mean what what are these openings what what are you just E4 here and black is dead black has no play ever what is Knight A6 where is the night going where is the night going it's going here and then what up its own ass like I would literally what is the point if you just play E4 where is the night at where are any of these two pieces ever moving this way the night when a6c7 E6 F6 this night instead of taking a 90 minute flight took a seven hour flight with three stops why why you needed to fly New York to Virginia instead you flew New York to Florida to New Hampshire I don't even know if there's an airport in New Hampshire to there's nothing in New Hampshire oh my God and the white takes from E6 oh my God white takes on E6 you guys make your opponents look like Magnus Carlson what now the knights just got F5 traps the night F5 H5 traps the where the the knights are having a convention on the edge of the board did you like that live sensor what are the knights doing why why you like horses you like the horses standing next to each other is that what this is you like the horses yeah what is Knight G5 they don't even see each other do you understand Ludwig is from New Hampshire Ludwig is single-handedly the only good thing that came out of New Hampshire in its entire existence Queen said bro this guy's going for mate oh my God what is the he put the Knight out there and he hung it but now the Rook is hanging oh my God Gotham sub you're gonna kill me bro he thought this was made thinking it was me oh my God he said I'm gonna lose my mind this is completely insane this is completely sick bro I am going to go to the game review and I swear to God this move was probably played in less than 10 seconds make a fort G3 no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no Queen E2 bro oh my God oh my God all right gg gg gg bro he didn't even how you play Queen F7 and not play Queen f8 how do you play Queen F7 and then not play one more forward Square I mean it's the most natural move in the world what oh okay I have absolutely no idea because it's guess the ELO like if I was just looking at this game I would say like I don't know 900 I I don't know I mean like the game wasn't that stupid it was just completely not understanding how to play the opening and then no it wasn't 300 because you guys have to understand they played a nimso Indian like nimso Indian is like you need it's a height requirement to go on a roller coaster okay it's you have to be at least somewhat good at the game I think these are early intermediate players I just think they completely did not understand the position and because of that they just did complete how are you gonna build a fence to make sure you have privacy from your neighbors and then drive your own car through the fence like what the what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing uh oh my God I I must say 1100 1100 has to be the rating of this game I I I can I just got a very nice donation from somebody that said my first time here it's cool to watch My Generation having their own businesses and doing their own things I'm 27 I don't know if we're in the right generation but uh you know I appreciate the kind words 1100 okay oh okay a little higher than I would have liked I said 1100 what did game review think I I did say though these are early intermediate players it's 14 20 versus 1290. these are early intermediate players that have absolutely no idea why they're playing their opening and this is a public service announcement I know I basically had a heart attack analyzing that game no no I don't care if it's Blitz I don't care if it's Blitz folks you are trying to improve your opening repertoire and model your openings after the top players that's what you're trying you're like oh well this is a really good opening I'm gonna play it but you do not understand at all what you are doing at all and you will suck the first few 10 20 times you plan opening okay you will suck at it you are you're gonna suck at understanding how to play the opening so I turned it up to a hundred to make fun of you in this game because this is guess the ELO and good Lord wait how many how much time was spent on Queen E1 I made fun of you because it was ridiculous you have to learn your openings you have to understand the ideas behind your openings how much time did he spend on Queenie one I predicted less than 10 seconds bro he spent two seconds on Queen E1 he spent two seconds on Queen E1 this man really had 95 seconds on the clock and spent two of them on Queen E1 check was it was their increment was it but was it bonus Blitz nope oh my goodness oh my goodness that's hysterical that is so crazy that's wild man that's oh my goodness y'all out of your minds man that's oh wow wow amazing I'm shook that game took some time off my life check the time on the queen sack what what did you just say did my own mod just tell me to check the is my mod watching on like a three minute delay my dude really said I'm the strike that's crazy all right next game yo you guys enjoying yourselves YouTube let me know drop the timestamp 15 colon 46 or whatever time it is I'm enjoying myself this is a great episode Knight D2 the thing is if you ever get uh if you ever get mad at anything that goes on and guess the ELO you're getting a little too parasocial all right this is uh this is hilarious stuff and listen if you sorry if the Windows security notification just came up um I don't know we're having a lot of distractions today if you submit a game for guess the ELO and you get roasted Just Let It Rock all right you said you volunteered for this okay and the amount of time that I insult myself on a day-to-day basis should get you to understand you know it's not that serious all right B4 okay uh Knight B3 Knight A5 or what I would go 94 Knight D2 Maybe okay oh oh Rook A1 is on the way oh oh B6 I'll go B6 here I'd squeeze I would squeeze here B6 B6 take the space away oh no black is getting counter play oh this is scary oh no why is white losing oh cause what why is white losing so badly uh oh this is nuts okay I think white is gonna make black on G7 I can sort of see it happening I don't know how on Earth it would happen because the next move is definitely Bishop F6 but Moment of Truth ah yeah that's I just kind of had a feeling I just this so but this was not a really that bad of a game like it was a London uh you rush with Knight D2 against the slav setup you should go C4 Knight C3 and queen B3 Knight D2 is not always the fastest move you need to make so that's why you got kind of a like you should not play C4 with a knight on D2 okay so you should not play like that your knight should be here if you're gonna play C4 otherwise your Pawn should be on C3 but I like what you did also in the future to anticipate Knight H5 play this so that you have this and then your Bishop is Big chilling not to be confused with Bing chilling chilling Bing chilling uh you got an okay position you got a good position but I guess you should have taken on C6 faster is what the computer wanted oh yeah I can speak Chinese pretty well I know mad words Lucy taught me a ton of uh Chinese I'm I'm trying to improve at it you know no no no I'm not saying no bad words can I swear I know I know a few words yeah I know a couple of funny ones have you spoken to Andrea today no brother she doesn't know you exist drop it Chinese is tough because in Chinese like five exact uh characters but pronounced differently mean the same thing like you can be talking about a shoe or you can be telling someone to jump off a cliff like it's it's uh Chinese is wild like that um Chinese is crazy you gotta you gotta you gotta really know what you're saying rematch with the bow Test sisters the next time that Lucy's home and the botesses are free so I could play them two against one and Lucy can make the moves for me uh anyway yeah I guess you have to do something like this and and you just play and black two blacks credit finding this what you should have done I guess is Knight E4 Bishop C4 just equal wow yeah black finding F6 is high level I want to say like 1500 probably this game is that crazy how much does the Checkmate in one blunder when am I playing Benjamin Bach last time I played Benjamin Bach I smoked them bro I'm never playing him again I beat a GM I never have to play him again bro that's how it works I beat him in title Tuesday yeah I think like 1600 probably because look this was a good game like white was putting pressure on black for a while for black to play F6 E5 to create counter play with the pawns as really high level stuff must have taken my middle games master class available at chesley.com the first two hours are free by the way so uh yeah you guys might want to check that out all my courses are absolutely free samples they they fat too so yes I know that Chinese is a tonal language thing you don't have to I am aware I thank you I appreciate that I I am aware it's a hard language I'm I'm getting better at it a little bit I'm gonna say like 1600 I think this was a high level game and um I'm ready to be you know I'm ready to be tremendously disappointed what shut up bro shut up man sweat 24 these he's 2482 he's a streamer too dude nah y'all catching me with these man y'all catching me y'all catching me with this y'all y'all play games against streamers and beat them and then submit their games to me and then I call them 800 points lower than they are come on do you remember when Anna kremling hung a queen or something or a mate and I like thought she was like 1100 oh my God this is messed up you guys are messed up for me oh my goodness oh my goodness all right we got one last game that's how he hung made that's crazy with a minute on the chess.com what yo if you hang Maiden one like No Cap chess.com should have a formula whatever rating you were before you hung Maiden one should be just cut in half just cut it in half just cut that no this is what am I even gonna name this guess the ELO episode like I legit this is like one of the dumbest guess the elos ever the ratings are so all over the place uh this is just so ridiculous none of these games have made any sense today no I'm not naming it there's hope for you all right oh my okay this is just a good Caro because normally Black Goes C6 in a Karo Khan and in this particular move order black has never played the move C6 so black is just yeah this is already worse because after E6 okay H5 is a little too sophisticated for my liking but I think H5 means that black is pretty high level black is probably like 17 1800. yup C5 you gotta go C5 Knight H6 yup C5 no no no no no okay Knight D7 is low level understanding this is clearly the move hey we just had this remember how last game I said don't play Knight D2 If You're Gonna Play C4 you remember this you can learn from black and from White right I said don't play Knight D2 if you're gonna do this same thing don't play this if you're gonna do this if at any point You're Gonna Play C5 don't play here right C5 Knight C6 is the idea C5 Knight C6 is always the idea that is why you play C5 later in the Cairo but in this version of the Cairo you don't have to play C6 you see you see now black went here and then it's gonna go C5 anyway so the Knight should have been there to put pressure on that now what I would do here there's a really strong idea here for black which is to play C4 what is the idea of C4 what is the idea of C4 correct trap the bishop King side attack yes an attack on this side of the board I get what you're saying you want to do this you lock the cage and you do this very good it has nothing to do with the bishop it has to do with the fact that if you try to attack your opponent by playing B5 black is going to really suffer when the Center opens up because you're not going to get as strong of an attack by locking the cage this is now impossible to open up counter play is impossible to create and B5 and queen A5 and B4 and Bishop A3 is just going to decide this game so black is going to absolutely Slaughter white in the next 10 moves all right ready yup yup I wouldn't even play before I would play Queen A5 but this is good uh yeah that's exactly why I wouldn't play Queen uh that's why I wouldn't play before I would play Queen A5 so that there is no Knight A4 because now there's B3 however you can do this in Knight B6 but now what the hell is white doing white has to play this this is the only chance why did white play H3 but not G4 I mean it's insane like what no understanding of time where is the king going where is it this is like in a mafia movie when the king tries to escape but all his bodyguards already got shot now G4 Queen B1 is made yup Rook Queen B1 oh he must Queen B1 check this is fine Queen B1 A1 nice resigns wow okay this is either a 1 000 or like a 2500. I think black is very close to nine uh to to 1900 2000. probably however the way white played so I'm gonna say like I'm gonna give I think black is gonna get a report card of like 2300 but I think black is like 1700. just because I don't think White I don't think white is that high rated white did not understand this this game at all so I think black is probably like 1800. wow no black white is 2100. that's crazy this should just show you even at 2100 people are getting worse positions in three moves that's actually nuts why does 2100 and was worse on move 3.
