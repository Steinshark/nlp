we've only done six videos about cases and we focused on specimens that are exceptionally popular exceptionally weird or exceptionally Innovative and the Dan Case C4 sfx falls rectangularly into the third category your picky so will be delighted by its classy appearance and modest size and you will be blown away by its versatility the build we're going to be tag teaming today is the ultimate Red Box we're going to be rocking a 7800 X 3D the ultimate gaming CPU and we're going to be pairing it with a gigabyte Aureus Elite 7900 XTX which is the ultimate uh don't worry it fits trust me is that the motherboard chipset fan how far are we gonna go kicking it apart oh okay in spite of competition from case makers both small and large Dan Case has maintained their position as a leader in small form factor case Innovation at just 14.7 liters this thing is small But Mighty every single side panel is perforated to maximize airflow and if we peek at the back of the case we see three pcie slot covers meaning that this case has support for Quad Slot Cards but this is weird they're at the top this kind of looks like a spot for a slim optical drive but surely it's an air duct no way yeah no way they designed really they designed a separate intake so Nvidia Founders edition cards will draw fresh air not from the CPU area which is back here but rather from directly outside the case close it's for the exhaust so that instead of dumping hot air from your GPU onto your CPU it just blows it out the side well how's this going to blow it up because it's a flow through cooler so it pulls in from the top flows through the bottom so instead of dumping it down no it doesn't yeah no it pulls in here no it flows downwards but look at the fan blades they go this way unless the mother motherboards on this side wait you don't even need a pcie riser I know it's it's a genius this is awesome if you think about it it's just a normal case but it's just upside down so it's just an inverted case which is totally a thing that exists it's just small they just were so clever about it I likey I can't believe I put a 40 90 in here out the back of the case out here so we are blowing some of it here but then also out the side of course we're not using a 49d we're using something bigger um it'll take a little brain power but okay it's a good thing they don't use rivets yeah there's no rivets on this case anywhere it's all screws so you can actually take the whole thing up completely apart you can even flip it right side up if you want oh like reassemble it in a conventional layout exactly what are you doing am I not taking out this brace that's not how I that's not how I would do it but sure I mean tell you what why don't you start doing it your way I'll start doing it my way and we'll see who gets it done faster that'll be the theme of this video what the what the heck Adam how is this is the cable and that's the difference between this fitting and not fitting yeah but watch this whoa hold on no no she goes she goes oh I got it in it only fits because I haven't screwed this in yet yeah yeah as you can see we have room up here to mount some fans right wait what we can do a 280 mil rad up here if we want not with this in it not with these in it the bend of it is is that we can install these 150 millimeter fans which will blow more air at lower volume nope well okay the word volume is I'm sorry that would be quieter yeah it'll blow more air more quietly yeah okay while Adam works on the power supply let's talk about our CPU it's the 7800x 3D it's the fastest gaming CPU on the planet sometimes the extra cores on the 7950x3d win out and sometimes the stupid High clocks on the 3900 KS can lead to better performance in games but this thing makes pretty much every CPU that costs more irrelevant at least as far as gaming is concerned oh just like I'm concerned I might have forgotten the segue to our sponsor the ridge simplify your life with the ridge wallet its slim design allows you to carry your essential cards and cash without weighing you down follow the link below and use code Linus to save 10 off your purchase and get free shipping for our motherboard we've gone with the Rog strix x670ei gaming EI e-i-e-i-o sorry sorry um it's the ER motherboard for am5 ITX right now it'll deliver the full complement of 24p cie Gen 5 lanes for both the GPU and SSD along with enough high speed USB to choke a horse why do you want to choke a horse I don't know you're the one who wants to choke a horse not me it definitely has some idiosyncrasies installing an SSD on this thing is like solving one of those Weird Science shop puzzles like I don't like anything in there and all the front i o is on this bizarre daughter board what do you expect it has to fit everything you'd have on a full-size board onto a little tiny one you know it's kind of interesting about this is that we have multiple ways to put our PSU in is that an 1100 watt power supply yeah he's so small I know right why are you so small I think only just a year ago was the first like thousand watt sfxl power supply introduced and now this is sfx and it has more watts it kind of cheats though yeah hey the modular interface is poking a centimeter out in some small form factor cases that's going to be a big problem but I guess we're making it work we can adjust the height of our PSU bracket which means that the wiring should be doable as well as we can get rid of this airflow diverter since we have a full length board on this graphics card it either goes on to here or you just take this out entirely and you just put it here no that's actually a mounting point for your ssds okay if you want two and a half inch SATA why does it line up with this power supply then oh can you do that too okay so these three on the bottom are all lined up and then these ones on the top are like not quite there's like two of them are you can put five screws on this power supply that's plenty if you had a cooler on your oh my God where's the motherboard go this is the motherboard oh yeah motherboard's way over here so oh yeah totally yeah there is no reason that that couldn't work just like we've seen on Intel for over a decade the latest AMD CPUs are using an LGA socket so the installation method is exactly the same as it is on Intel and it's done now I got to figure out how to get this bloody SSD in here don't tell me I want to figure it out it's a it's a journey wait why can't I just put it here oh well we have a we have a Gen 5 SSD and that's the Gen 4 slot I think I understand why they opted for this if you wanted an sfxl and this bracket that would allow it because right now there's just not enough space if this was any longer how does this even interfere oh hi all right that wasn't that bad oh wait aora sent over a Gen 5 SSD for this yeah Gen 5 ssds offer no tangible benefit for gaming or anything else but more fast is not you know as more better this is hilarious what we're looking at here is a pcie Gen 5 link to the second AMD chipset that makes a motherboard an x670 rather than a B series board normally they would have the two chipsets on the board and that's where you get those Gen 5 lanes that go to one of the ssds but it sits on a daughter board on this one because after they put the one on here they just plain Shucks shoot didn't have anywhere else to put it that is quite the bent SSD right now I don't think I did anything wrong but here we are now I noticed that we have a couple of different options for coolers I see a kraken x63 over here as well as an OCTA nhd9l because we have this side bracket that we can mount a radiator to as well so we can do a two 80 millimeter rad for the CPU I guess the tubing on this side yeah yeah well yeah because it'll be too there won't be enough space yeah it's going to be it's gonna be all yeah if it's on this or you can make your life easy have you ever known me to take the easy path uh no it's what these crap fans zanza XT that's what it yeah but they're not going to seal against the rad if you have them pulling through there's giant gaps here why are cooler manufacturers still doing this they only seal against it giving you better static pressure if you blow through which makes it really hard to clean stupid so I need to grab some more oh better fans all right one thing to note is that if you're doing a d shroud Mod on your GPU some manufacturers like to put a warranty sticker over the back of it even though it's technically not enforceable but your best course of action if you're doing this is to take some heat to the sticker to try and melt it off a little bit and then peel it off cleanly I didn't do that gigabyte will not replace this for us if I pick this up the thing about the whole warranty sticker thing is that you're not technically wrong it is not technically legal for them to deny your warranty claim just because you opened up the device but legal or not nothing prevents them from just you around what's the purpose of this little redirector shroud thing here I don't know I think it's for cable management but for me it only just inhibited where I could put the cables or maybe it's just chamber separation I knew I was going to screw up this orientation I wanted these down I mean this is fine I'm not redoing it yeah not only does this fit but for the size of this case not even looking like it's going to be a big problem for maintenance I would Mount these fans on the other side pulling air in but for performance this config is actually probably fine oh my God that's a little much that is a lot of it I'm gonna wipe it out it's gonna be all over the place I'm not done yet gosh what do you mean you're not done yet I'm good I've already got enough on there but I'm gonna take some of it off a little off the top okay it's like the when you pour a Guinness you scrape the foam there's an Irish one here yeah really you're gonna say that in front of him cool this is amazing it's like a little Fortress around the CPU you cannot pass yeah don't no what are you doing these are all laid out so I could re-screw them in Easy there's like four different types of screws cool that's all you give me not a sorry not a oops my bad I don't want to lie to you now hold on just to gosh darn second are we gonna have enough static pressure to push air through this heatsink oh yeah the fans are like right up against you yeah yeah wow there's like millimeters of room you could we could cut a bracket if we wanted but I did thermal testing on it and it runs cool this has 11 heat pipes on it yeah I know look at this it's insane what's going on there there are two USBC connectors on this board male USBC connectors you don't need to attach anything to them there is a power switch header over here you can use that but there's a second power switch header along with your reset switch and your hard drive and your power LED headers right here along with two USB 2 headers and two SATA ports and these just plug into those USBC connectors a little something like that what is this switch wait we do need it we have SATA oh snap I don't know if they still make them but at some point they made these super cool low profile SATA cables oh no I want the eight pin CPU connector before I put this on oh yeah where's that oh wait here's another sick feature you made a dum-dum forget move and now you got to fix it what do you do here let me make your life easier for you way wait yeah wait are these so you can cable manage on the other side of this I mean you could I'm just talking about how look at that so now you forget your cables or you need to redo your cable management or you want to do your fans at the end of the build oh you just enter they just take the bottom off that's so cool I am like just endlessly impressed by this case because every single time I go oh man I screwed up it feels like they're there to catch me coolest thing about this case is the way that it gets out of the way pretty much every heat generating component is just drawing fresh air directly from the outside so as long as that hot air makes its way away from the computer there's no recycling we need to plug in all our fans now before I put this on and we need to do our 24-pin okay I thought you were in charge of the power supply I thought yeah but you had the motherboard and usually you want to do the motherboard with the cables it's okay you got it we're going to be in there don't worry you're being angry it's okay I'm not getting angry angry I'm not angry or hungry it's okay when she was not that far away we're almost there you know it really minimizes my feelings when you attribute them to outside factors that's not fair you're right they're valid yes no they are I'm sorry I'm gonna dismiss it how many times have you put that GPU in it okay this is uh two are you done with the GPU yet I need to get these fans in I need to get these fans hooked up wait well we can hook them up now yeah oh for yeah I need to get the fans in and then the GPU goes in I just mean you didn't give me these extensions no I'm sorry we're just getting smoosh everything down in there cool we are not gonna have a big issue with fit there's a lot of cable in a very small area and I got kind of sausage thingies all right can I just yeah you get your delicate little lady hands in there yeah okay what the hell is this this is your cable management this is my only choice at this point sir sir sir it's a shorter adapter than I thought it's not your only choice at all it's not even too late to fix it sweet this does not look like it's going to do very well yeah listen I'm telling you the thermals on this thing were out of this world I did the testing did you I did did you though or did the lab do it because I did the testing actually really yeah I trust it more if the lab did it I should have said the lab did it so these GPU cables are going to be yeah okay body geez now this thing better freaking turn on yeah while it's pretty fun to build small form factor computers if you enjoy puzzles what's not fun is having one thing wrong with the puzzle that requires the whole puzzle to be taken apart and then redone that's not fun can you see the back plate of this GPU oh that's just how it is what yeah I don't believe you that is how it is that's how I pulled it from the box this tripped me up like 17 times when I was are you sure yeah because I it just goes like that it's a oh here the you can see the front panel on it this GPU looks like it's sitting in here like that this doesn't make any sense cool feature of the case that we didn't talk about yet you can put your pass through for the power supply in either of these two positions just make sure you don't stick your dumb finger through the one that you're not using and then have to put this stupid grommet back in I brought some cases for comparison so we got the mesh room yeah that's pretty fun it's basically this but standing and it's a sandwich layout so it does require a pcie riser cable this is a little bit larger in terms of volume but it does allow some ATX components gpus wait you can put an ATX board in here yes but only but then you can't put like a full-length GPU oh and then this is probably the most direct kind of comparison which is the nr200p and it's quite a bit bigger it's quite a bit bigger the funny thing about small form factor is that as you get close to the limits there's not really a lot of benefit in terms of desk space it's just more about the coolness yeah and this has lots of coolness is it going to work though what is that fan is that the motherboard chipset fan yeah it's stupid Zeus HD I don't think it posted that chipset fan is still going full bore how far are we gonna go kicking it apart oh that's fine oh my God okay bye well we did our best and one bios update that definitely wasn't user error later we're up and running but while temperatures are pretty solid with the CPU maxing out at 85 degrees and the GPU and then something 62. wow okay that's really good I'm thinking we might have screwed up this fan orientation we might be better off pulling fresh air from the outside and just hoping it'll find somewhere to go if we turn it around and see if it gets quieter oh balls really and this is why we have to build systems before we just say a case is really great it doesn't fit in there the RADS a touch wider holy fans on that side yeah but then it's hard to clean yeah that's the whole reason I did it this way in the first place you could you could force it on there just bend it oh my God I mean that is technically an option you know what I'm going for it I refuse to build a system that is that hard to maintain it is a lot quieter it is substantially quieter and we're still within we're still within the 90 degree limits that we want for our 1700 xdd yeah so my concern was that if we're drawing air in and heating it up drawing air in and heating it out the bottom is basically the only place you can exhaust anymore and so my concern was that all that hot air was just going to come and recirculate and recirculate it doesn't seem to be an issue with the GPU like GPU temps are just incredibly under control this is really impressive nearly full Turbo with the entire system absolutely pinned for those of you who are wondering how we did with air cooling though we tested with the nhd9l which is quite a bit easier to work with and got not quite the same performance in our synthetic full load test but it handled gaming just fine and if you wanted to get nearly the same results as this you could probably go with the D12 we just didn't have one for testing at this time I think it's worth showing what temps are like in a game we've pretty much settled in at 66 on the GPU and nearly full turbo on our CPU this is really impressive I bet I could even turn those radiator fans up a little bit and you'd be good to go this thing's freaking awesome I just want every computer to be in that now yeah why why go bigger I mean it's yeah also you said you had some nitpicks right oh yeah so I mean nitpicks front i o would have been nice to get more than just one USBC Port I mean you can always go out into a dock if you really care about that but yeah sure fine maybe some included cable ties there's no tie down spots there's not really a good way to tie anything down there's no window and that too I'm not just trying to play Devil's ad no I'm just saying that these are the I really like this case so when you attack it I feel like you're attacking me personally and maybe a thumbs maybe some thumb screws we're on Ray tracing quality Ultra everything else cranked 4K and I don't think it's gonna handle it very oh wow okay are you sure you're on Ray chasing Ultra yep whatever Frank ah it's about 40. did we mention the price oh no how much is it it's not like 300 bucks is it it's 200 euro so 220 us right now you have cheaper options like the nr200p or the mesh Licious that we brought out earlier but this but this one is so cool just like this cool segue to our sponsor aidsleep okay real talk when I don't get enough sleep I get cranky like an adult sized or almost adult-sized baby that's where eight sleep comes in with their
