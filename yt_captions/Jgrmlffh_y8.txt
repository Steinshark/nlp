for the past 5 years no production car could stop quicker than a Porsche 911 gt2rs at least not in Motor Trends extensive testing Porsche reigned king for a long stint but that no longer remains true hello everyone and welcome in this video we're covering the impressive feat achieved by the Ford Mustang darkh horse the shortest stopping distance of any road legal production car in the history of Motor Trends testing that record just 86 ft from traveling at 60 MPH to a full stop all right so 86 ft to stop from 60 to 0 mph that's kind of a random jumble of numbers who really cares so let's give it a bit of context and so if we're to calculate acceleration using these numbers here in order to decelerate from 60 down to zero and just 86 ft well you do a little bit of math and you find out that that means your average deceleration is 1 1.4 G's which is extremely impressive in all of Motor Trends testing this is the only car that's ever done it now a little context on how this testing works as it is important in understanding where this 1.4 G comes from so the test itself you're going to start the vehicle above 60 MPH you're going to slam on the brake pedal and then you're going to let ABS do all the work right so as you slam on that brake pedal above 60 MPH it's going to go up and reach somewhere around that Peak GeForce that it's able to decelerate at then the second you cross over 60 MPH the clock starts so we've already reached our Peak deceleration Force here and then we just maintain that all the way to a stop and then of course our acceleration goes to zero so the average for that 60 to Z is that 1.4 G's and because we know that we've already reached the peak before we stop uh for the entirety of that 60 to0 deceleration run well that can give us a good guesstimate of what the tire's frictional coefficient is in other words how much grip does that tire have and so that frictional coefficient just correlating with the g-forces so a me of 1.4 now in a previous video I explained how you can use this frictional coefficient to predict the theoretical best 0 to 60 time possible for a production C to achieve because now today we're at the limit of our tires we're no longer limited by horsepower as far as what 0 to 60 times we can get so using this frictional coefficient of 1.4 well we can use our equation velocity equals acceleration time time we have 88 ft per second which is equivalent to 60 MPH divide that by 45 ft/s squared which is 1.4 G's just in you know dumb American units and so you do that math you divide and you get a time of 1.95 seconds so using today's tires yes it is possible to break the 2cond barrier now I am talking about a true 0 to 60 so it is common within the industry to delete the first foot this is called rollup I don't agree with it but it is the norm and with roll out you would be deleting about 0.15 to about3 seconds so this would give us a theoretical predicted 0 to 60 time of about 1.65 to about 1.80 if you were deleting that first foot of roll out so you know real 0 to 60 time is this 1.95 uh but if you look at the you know current claims for records out there Dodge Demon saying they are doing it in 1.66 seconds with roll out so that does fall within this range as well as the remac NOA which they claim a 0 to 60 of 1.74 seconds again using roll out so deleting that first foot of acceleration so it is you know kind of wild uh where we're at today and that we can break that 2cond barrier though to be honest I don't know if there is a third-party verification of a vehicle actually Breaking 2 seconds uh and not showing a time that uses roll out in order to do it so it would be cool to see the first third party to do this and again it needs to be a production car you know one pulled from a customer or something like that not something that's been wildly prepped from the factory and is the first off the line and some crazy Prototype all right so getting back to the Mustang Dark Horse when they set this record part of me thinks you know is this lame or is it actually cool and I do think that it's cool but there is a really lame implication that comes along with this record so I asked Motor Trend if they could send me the top 20 shortest braking distances they have in all of their testing and thank you to Motor Trend they did send that data over and so an interesting thing happens when you plot out these 20 vehicles with their weight versus their braking distance in feet and so you'll notice basically what happens is it just forms a straight line because once you get the best tires on your car and you achieve this maximum friction uh and you have ideal conditions well they're all going to have a relatively similar breaking distance the thing that's upsetting here is if you look at the Mustang uh here all the way on the end it is the heaviest of the top 20 by far on average it is about 500 lb heavier than all the other cars uh in this top 20 for shortest breaking distance so you know what does that mean well it means that tires can hide the weight of a car and that's exactly what they've done here so yes you know there are reasons why you want to keep a vehicle lightweight it's going to improve handling it's going to improve acceleration uh it's going to reduce you know how much energy you have going into your brakes by pulling weight out but in this case the heaviest vehicle of the top 20 uh shortest braking distances also happens to have the shortest braking distance and I just feel like that is this thing that allows manufacturers to go well hey it's still super safe like it breaks really quick and so it allows them to think you know hey it's our right to be lazy and have you know our sports car cars weighing over 4,000 lb which just in my opinion is wrong on the flip side this just shows how absolutely powerful tires are I mean there's a reason why I think they're one of the absolute coolest things about cars now to illustrate how cool tires are I pulled some data from a car and driver top 15 list where they were looking at their shortest 70 to0 mph stopping distances in their own testing and so what's Wild is you can have a fairly similar plot here except instead of weight versus breaking distance we're looking at Price versus breaking distance and again you just have that flat line so you know a Ferrari La Ferrari well over a million dollars and it's stopping just like everything else that's well under a quarter million dollars so what's awesome about this is just that tires are the limiting factor physics doesn't care how much money you have you can't just throw money at the problem and expect to win so you can have you know the most expensive braking system out there the most advanced suspension in the world lightweight insane materials a crazy well-tuned ABS system and yet none of it really matters right a Mustang under $100,000 can do it all because it has really good tires it's just so cool that tires are this unifying Factor that's just like Hey we're all going to be about the same because this is what matters the most and so you know you can go to a track and you can throw some racing tires on your car and assuming it's got the braking system to handle it you can beat literally every production car on street legal road tires like that's wild that that can be done so I want to get back to this point can you throw money at it and actually have better braking distance well maybe so cut to the MC Mery spear Ling so the specifications I have for this car are for the Prototype they're not for the production version and this is a trackon vehicle so we're not talking about breaking you know road-going vehicle production records here but it does illustrate how you can use something other than tires in order to improve grip and thus improve stopping distances so looking at the specifications for the Prototype we have a vehicle that weighs about 2200 lb and because it has two fans that are constantly pulling air from underneath and shooting it out the back it's not the shooting out the back part that is important it's creating a vacuum underneath the car that is important that is sucking it down to the ground it's able to produce about 4400 lb of downforce so it's going to generate absurd grip just to give you an idea this vehicle is rear wheeel drive and yet it's capable of achieving a 0 to 60 in just 1.4 seconds again we're talking about the Prototype here and again this is not a production car but that is faster than any production car and it's only using the rear wheels to accelerate this is possible because of that massive downforce otherwise it would be much closer to our theoretical limit using street tires of somewhere around 1.95 seconds all right so to demonstrate just how powerful this downforce is and again one of the things that's really cool about this is that it's able to do it at 0 mph right it's not reliant on Arrow it's riant on the fans and the fans can work at any speed you're driving right so you can have this downforce at any speed you're driving so it can be very useful for breaking just how powerful well let's go with our prototype weight of 2200 lb and say it's making 4,400 lb of downforce and let's say we have a 170 lb driver and let's say our tires frictional coefficient is 1.4 using similar tires to the Mustang well with all of that we would be able to decelerate at a rate of 4 G's it's so exciting that the marker literally can't even write it and so if we look at our 60 to zero time for an average car today it's about 120 ft stopping at about 1G well this is four times that meaning it could stop from 60 mph to zero and yet yes just 30 ft that is absolutely absurd imagine driving down the highway you're traveling at 60 MPH you slam on the brakes and in less than two car lengths you're stopped now these are just estimates and they are my own calculations but I have no doubt that there is no production car today that can stop as quick as this vehicle can now speaking of vehicles that have absurd amounts of grip top fuel drag racers so these cars have a prepared surface they've got insanely sticky track tires and they've got over 10,000 horsepower what's not to love and recently Top Fuel car hit the Eighth Mile at 300 mph first time it's ever happened 3.8 mph in 2.96 3 seconds that's an average acceleration up to 300 mph of 4.6 GS over 4.6 G's and that means every 60 mph hour increment uh from zero all the way to 300 is happening in less than6 seconds these are numbers that just Boggle the mind it's absolutely crazy how quick accelerating top fuel vehicles are so there are ways you can buy your way out of you know this problem of accelerating or stopping quicker the thing is you know we're talking about track friendly versions not Street friendly versions where the tire actually has to last a certain number of miles now I have one final point to make and that is even under ideal conditions breaking can be very messy and I did not expect to see this so I was looking at a test conducted by Car and Driver where they were testing the braking distances for the Porsche GT4 RS well this vehicle is among the very best they have ever tested and so it's kind of cool to look at the data behind it and see what happens and so if you look at a plot of speed versus time Car and Driver does conduct their testing slightly differently from Motor Trend you're starting just above 70 and you're including that time of pressing the pedal and seeing how the car reacts and so you have a slight time where you're staying you know somewhere around 70 mph and then you have a fairly constant line down to the final stopping time and in this case the vehicle was able to stop in 2.5 seconds from 70 mph now what is interesting about this you shouldn't use it for predicting grip because again you have that initial ramp up and deceleration where you're pressing on that brake pedal and you don't yet have Peak friction and so the Motor Trend test better for predicting what is the tire's actual grip the car and driver test better for predicting what is the true in this case 70 to Z because it includes the time of you pressing that pedal so when you look at time versus deceleration what's very interesting and I didn't expect to see based on you know there's basically a straight line for Speed just going down is that the deceleration rate is changing constantly and so of course you're going to have this initial Peak you might wonder how does it Spike you know above 1.7 gs on that initial tipin well the faster you're traveling you've got air resistance pushing you back and if the car has down Force which the GT4 RS is capable of well that means you have better breaking so that initial Peak doesn't shock me that you know it's over something like 1.4 GS of course it is you've got wind resistance and you've got downforce both of which are helping you to slow down very quickly initially but as you get to those lower speeds you can't rely on downforce or wind resistance to slow you down and so that's why it was surprising to me to see in the data these huge you know Peaks and valleys going through where it's bouncing between you know below. n G's to above 1.4g I mean over a 0.5g gap and again if you look at the trace like it's fairly constant it just goes you know there it is but if you look deep into the data at a really fine scale you see that GeForce peaking all over the place on that surface so there's a lot of variables that can cause this what's your surface like what's your loading like how's the ABS working out how are the brakes working out what's your sampling rate there's a lot of reasons why it can look like this but it's very interesting that it does and it's not you know a more linear more constant just deceleration rate you get the average at the end it does really good in the end uh but the data is actually quite messy in how it achieves that okay so how did the Mustang Dark Horse doing cor and driver testing all right quiet bombshell it wasn't even top 15 and honestly it's not even that close to the field the 2019 Corvette ZR1 outbreak the Mustang by 15 ft in car and driv 70 to0 mph testing I think this illustrates a few points the differentiation in testing methodology and importantly that testing conditions can play a huge role so maybe the Mustang isn't the best breaking vcle I don't know why it brings me joy to make an entire video feel pointless right at the end of it but it is cool what the darkh horse achieved if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching
