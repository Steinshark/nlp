- [Mr. Beast] Guys, put
your hand in the air. Now turn around and put
it on the mini yacht. All right, last one of you
(dramatic music) to take your hand off
this mini yacht keeps it. This yacht has three beds, a kitchen, a stove, microwave, TV, literally anything you could
want in a yacht it has. Look at this thing, it's massive. Contestant number one is Chandler. He has the lowest winning
rate out of anyone (hip hop music)
in Mr. Beast history. But he did go on a three win streak. He is a new man. This is Jacob. He's a part
of my brother's channel. And he's currently zero
for one in challenges. This is Jake. He's a
force to be reckoned with. He's won all of these challenges. - Yes.
- This is Chris. - All of these wins.
- I don't see any. - Woo.
- Psych, here they are. Only one of you walk away with a yacht. Now I want to give you
guys a tour of the yacht. Chris, keep that hand
on the boat or yacht. All right, Chris,
welcome aboard the yacht. - And it's still on as you can- - [Mr. Beast] Yeah. I'm
keeping an eye on it. Let's show 'em the inside of the cabin. - We've got a stove.
- Keep that hand there. - It is there. We've got a microwave. We've got a working sink. - [Mr. Beast] We do have... Wow. The sink in the yacht works. - [Chris] 1, 2, 3 beds. And this is also a place to eat too. - [Mr. Beast] Dude, that
bed looks really nice. And then you have a
view of the ocean here. - Yeah.
- I'm six foot three. Look at this. This yacht is massive. Seriously, guys. I kind of want this. I can literally stand up
inside the mini yacht. I just found out it has the bathroom. - [Jake] Wait, what? - Now we're gonna show you the front. All right. Let's get you back in the water with everyone else. Play time's over. To make it easier for us
to see your left hands and to make sure you have 'em on the boat, we're putting "Xs" on
their hands on the boat so you can tell which one is their hand. - X marks the spot.
- Okay. - [Mr. Beast] So we
have a wall of balloon. Half the balloons have
really bad punishments and half the balloons have
a really positive thing. Pick a number between one and four. - Six. - Two.
- Three. - Four. - There's four.
- I didn't pick an answer. - I go next.
- Throw your dart, Jacob. - Nice shot, man.
- I didn't wanna (indistinct). - [Mr. Beast] Chris has it next. 'Cause he looks like a cute little guppy. - Thank you.
- Here you go, Christopher. - [Jake] All right, Chris,
let's see what you got. - [Chris] Sorry if I had somebody. - Oh.
- Hey, Tareq, toss it to me. Chris, let's see what you drew. - Oh oh. - Weighted vest. You have to
put on a vest (indistinct). - I'm gonna get a workout
while I'm winning a boat. - [Jake] How long did
you have to wear for? - 30 minutes. Chris, here is your
weighted vest all here. All right, here, I got you. There you go. All right, so now this Jake's turn. Remember there's some
very serious punishments up here, guys.
- Oh, he got one. - Tape hand to boat.
- Perfect. - [Chris] The tape's
gonna come off eventually and so is your arm hair.
- I can take pain. I ain't scared of no... I'm feeling good. Let me see. - [Chris] Go write that
one down in the book. - [Mr. Beast] Jake, you
now have tape on your hand. Does that make it easier?
- Yes. - [Chandler] No, it doesn't. - Yep. I can't take my
hand off for 30 minutes. - [Chris] Chandler, listen. You know you're not gonna win. What's the point in staying out here? - Well, I wanna throw a dart.
- Okay. I'll let you throw a dart
and then you'll go, right? - He wants to throw a dart.
- Here you go, Chandler. - [Mr. Beast] Uh-Oh. - Please don't miss this up, Chandler. (contestants laughing)
Wow. You hit it really good. Just not in the right spot.
- Take two. The fans want Chandler to hit it. - Hit the orange ballon.
(everyone cheering) (indistinct chatter) - [Jake] All right. Here we go, Chandler. - Binoculars.
- Binoculars. - Why?
- What? - You have to look through binoculars for five minutes straight.
(contestants laughing) - [Chris] That's hilarious. - Wow.
- How do I work these? - [Mr. Beast] Just put
'em up to your eyes. - Are they on?
- Starting now. - [Mr. Beast] It hasn't been five... There you go.
- Good luck. - [Chandler] I don't see anything. - All right. is it Jacob's turn? 'Cause he didn't get one the first time. - Jacob, it's your turn.
- Hey, don't miss this time. - Hey.
- I hit one. - Jacob got $10,000.
- No way. - No, I'm just kidding (indistinct) vest. - [Jacob] I was really excited. - [Mr. Beast] No, it's
just a weighted vest. - Got him.
- You got a weighted vest. - Dang it.
- Seriously. What if I said you won 10 grand. (cash register dings)
And he went, "Yes. Screw the boat." And then I was like, oh. - Has it been five minutes? - Chris?
- Yeah. - [Mr. Beast] Your time's basically up. Give Jacob to your vest.
- Hey, how's it going, bud? - Hey, Chris.
- You doing good? - I love being this close to you. - I love you.
- The sun. Oh my God. - I kind of missed my
weighted vests actually. It felt comforting.
- I feel it on my lungs. - I'm coming out.
- Doug Dimmadome. - [Chandler] Do you need some help? - I wanna get some sun. Hold on. I'm still on the boat, and now look, I'm taking my
thumb, putting it on the boat. My thumb is on the boat.
- Okay. Can we agree?
- There we go. - [Mr. Beast] All right,
I'm not gonna lie. Did not think you would do that. - We don't have much to worry about here except for alligator gars. It's like this long-nosed
fish with big ol' teeth on it. - Why the heck are we right here? - Big ol' teeth.
- It probably won't get through the wet suit, maybe. - Oh really?
- Yeah. I don't know- - Well, tell about to
Jacob. I bit him earlier. (hip hop music) - Children, I brought chicken
bite, but you must catch it. I'm gonna toss it to you. - Oh, come on, bro.
- You go first. - [Mr. Beast] There we go. (Mr. Beast laughs)
- Did it open? - Yes.
- We're good. - Oh no.
- Oh yeah. - All right.
(water splashing) - [Mr. Beast] (laughs) All
right. Everyone caught it. - [Jake] This is boat food right here. It's not as good as
the food I'm gonna make when I own this boat.
- Guys, I brought Gatorade. - Orange taste like...
(water splashes) - Tastes like that.
- Wait, where did it go? - Right here.
- It's right here. - [Jake] I'm gonna eat my
Buffalo bites like this. - All right. The boys are taken care of. - [Chris] Did you take
your hand off the boat? - [Jake] Did you take your hand off? - [Mr. Beast] We need to
watch the GoPro real quick. - [Jake] I'm gonna eat my
Buffalo bites like this. - [Mr. Beast] The boys are taken- You actually did take your hand off. - [Cameraman] His hand was
off, but his arm was still on. - [Mr. Beast] All right. That's out. - Bro, you just got your food-
- All right, Chandler. - [Jake] We beat Chandler. Yeah! - [Tareq] So, Chandler,
you got out so early. - I caught it, I was like, "Ha, you tried to make me drop it." And then I went to open my drink and my hand came off
'cause (indistinct) stupid. (hip hop music) - Each challenge gets shorter and shorter. - Have you ever just stood waist deep with one hand on a boat before? You're not prepared for this.
- No one is. - There's no training for this considering I found out
at four o'clock yesterday. So I only had last night
to sit in a bathtub, and put my hand...
- Oh! (Chris laughing)
(rock music) (Chris and Jake cheering) - He goes, "I only had four hours to train "and put my hand on this boat." (Jake laughing)
Oh my God. - [Chandler] That's dumber
than the thing I did. - Is it though?
- Yeah. It is. See you talk crap and it
just comes back to bite you. - He still doesn't
wanna take his hand off. - Take your walk. (cheers)
- Oh man. - So what happened, man?
- I got in the moment of explaining how I was preparing for the challenge last night. (soft music)
Just out of pure reaction my hand just slaps like that. And three seconds after it clicked with me that I was out and I was so devastating. - [Tareq] Were you not
even thinking about it? - I wasn't. I wasn't
thinking about it at all. - Dude, that mini yacht right there. - Yeah.
- That could have been yours. - Yeah. If I wasn't so stupid. (hip hop music) - We're gonna do something
a little different today. We're actually gonna give
Chandler a second life because he's Chandler. Do you need any other reason? It'd be hilarious if Chandler lost twice on the same challenge. - So embarrass myself
even more or just stay. - [Mr. Beast] I mean, you
can still win a mini yacht - But they're gonna be so mad if I win. Hey guys, I'm back apparently. - [Chris] You're covered in goose nips. - I'm so freezing. - Chandler, this is your second life. Please for your sake, don't lose again. - Chandler's already about to
get out because he's so cold. Look at him. He's covered
in goosebumps right now. He's not staying longer than 30 minutes. I guarantee.
- I'm skinny. I don't wanna... (screams) Stop touching me! (heavy metal music)
- I'm not trying to. I'm literally just over
here doing my own thing. I wish I sucked so bad, I got a second chance like you, buddy. The two challenges you
have won out of the three- - (grunts) I don't want to hear it. - Have been team challenges. Which means you don't have to do anything because you can't do anything.
(Jake laughing) And the one challenge you
did win, we felt bad for you. - [Tareq] Oh my God. The truth comes out. - He did say it. - Chris, you go first.
- Hey. - Oh.
- You missed. It's right over top of- - Oh! Oh my gosh.
- I got two. - Chandler popped two balloons. His first one. Check your phone. You get
two minutes on your phone. - Yay.
- That's his first one. Binocular again.
(gentle music) - [Chris] Hold his phone here. And he can check the
phone with his binocular. There you go.
- Let's go for it. - You think I'll miss? - Yep.
- Yep. Chandler, how are you enjoying
your time on your phone? - You know what, man? It's great. I can't. - [Jake] He's gone already. (laughs) He just took his hand off
to get the binoculars. - [Mr. Beast] Chandler
just got out a second time. - He lost twice in the same hour. (everyone laughing) - [Mr. Beast] I think it's fair to say from now on Chandler to get
two lives in every challenge. (contestants laughing) (hip hop music)
(grill sizzling) You wanna throw dart, sure. (indistinct), hand him a dart. - [Jake] My chances are very slim that I'll actually hit one. - Oh. got something.
- I got one! - You have to hold weights over your head. - Oh my goodness.
- What? - [Mr. Beast] Yep. (Chris indistinct)
- Go for it. - Hey.
- Oh, he got one. - What's red?
- You have to curl weights. - Okay. How much is that?
- That's 25 pounds. - [Mr. Beast] All right. Give that to Jake Jake, you have 10 minutes. Chris-
- Can I do hammer- - [Mr. Beast] You just have to curl? - [Chris] I can do whichever curls I want. - [Mr. Beast] Whatever curls. - [Chris] So these
hammer curls right here. - [Mr. Beast] I would go a little slower. You're gonna wear yourself out. - Is the burger good?
- Mm-hm. - Is it what you expected?
- Mm-hm. - Are you happy now, Chris?
- Yeah. - Hey Jimmy, you should give people $5,000 to try and make it across that tightrope. Hey Josh, you wanna do it? - Yep. - I don't think this is possible, Josh (intense music)
but it's five grand. - He's falling in the water.
- I'm not gonna make it. - Yeah. Just go for it.
- Hold on. Don't push me. - [Mr. Beast] I'm just making
sure you don't hit your head. - [Chris] You're like
a quarter of the way- - Oh!
(intense music) It's officially a new hour.
- Yeah. - [Mr. Beast] You both get a
cornhole throw for 300 bucks. - Ooh.
- One each. - [Jake] Oh. (Jake screams) - [Mr. Beast] All right. Now
you each get a dart throw. - Who's going first?
- Chris. - [Tareq] Ooh! - A thousand dollars.
- A thousand dollars. - Are you kidding?
- What? - What?
- What? - A thousand dollars.
- Yeah. Yeah. I get a lot of gas. - [Cameraman] Ooh, he hit another one. - [Chris] That did not- - [Mr. Beast] Watch
this one be really bad. Weighted vest. (upbeat music) - [Mr. Beast] It's been
about seven hours, guys. Only one of you are walking
away with this boat? Luckily for both of you the other two competitors were just... - Really dumb.
- Terrible. - Yeah.
- Dart. - [Mr. Beast] You really
want to. Go ahead. (intense music) - That was insane.
- What? - That's a trick shot. Sign
me up for Dude Perfect. - [Mr. Beast] Okay. Weighted vest. Throw your weighted vest on. - [Jake] I feel like this
is what you (indistinct). - Ooh.
- Ooh. - [Mr. Beast] Cameraman,
read it out to us. - [Tareq] And it says, "check your phone." - [Mr. Beast] All right, Jake, you get two minutes on this phone. - He gets two minutes on his phone and I get 30 minutes of gains. Gain city! - [Mr. Beast] You're an
interesting specimen. - I'm a very interesting
specimen. Thank you. - [Mr. Beast] Guys, it's
gonna get dark soon. - It is.
- I don't need my hat then. Whoops. Did not mean to
throw that in the water. (Jake laughing) - Well, I kind of would've
liked to keep it but... Darn.
- It's gone. - It's like a weighted blanket. I feel comfort and I feel like
my anxiety is gone. (screams) (upbeat music) - [Tareq] Guys, it's literally nighttime. - Hey, I will show you.
- That's crazy. - That's how these challenges work. - [Mr. Beast] You guys
wanna throw some more darts? - Yes.
(indistinct chatter) I got the blue ballon. - [Tareq] All right.
Let's see what he got. Oh, wait. There's still
some challenges in here. Hold on a second. It's nighttime. - What the...?
- Oh my God. - One thousand dollars again. - Oh!
- Yo. $2,000. - Two Gs, boy.
- How did you... Dude, Chris is the luckiest dude on earth. (sad instrumental music)
Jake is depressed right now. - Dude, you're both doing Cornhole. I want you both to throw
'em at the same time. (intense music)
3, 2, 1, go. - Mine would've went in. Give it back you touched it.
(Jake laughing) (intense music)
- You do have another dart. - Oh, do it.
- Whoa. - [Tareq] What if that was another grand? - Oh.
- And they don't count. This is what Chris got. - Weighted vest.
- Weighted vest. - What Jake got.
- Love that. - Curl weights.
- Curl weights. - They don't count. So we're good. - [Mr. Beast] Nope, they count. - [Jake] But you said they didn't count. - Yeah. But then I read
'em and I changed my mind. - He makes the rules.
- What is this nightmare? - He made the channel. He makes the rules. (Tareq laughing)
- That's crap! - All right, someone get this
man some weights to curl. (water splashes) Jake.
(Chris laughing) - Look, dude, I literally
picked up the weight to throw it to him and it just fell. It fell. - Jimmy, I'm not gonna lie. When I say that the poop that I took in the toilet that is not working was the biggest poop I've
ever taken in my life. I'm not joking. If you watch the footage back,
you will see pure struggle. And you'll see literal veins on my face. It's a big poop. Oh man. That's a horror poop. - [Jake] He yelled a handful of times. - [Tareq] We lost Jimmy. Thanks, Chris. (Chris screaming and cheering)
- Wait, what's going on here? (soft music)
- We're rocking the boat. I'm tired and I'm gonna go to bed. Sea water makes me really sick. (gentle music)
And when I'm really sick, it makes me very tired. So I'm gonna go too bed. I'm tired
- Chris, so that's it. (Chris indistinct). - [Tareq] (indistinct) come off tonight. - [Jake] I don't know. I
think he's pretty hard driven. So we'll we'll see.
- Are you going? - I'll probably see you in the morning is realistically what I'm gonna say. - [Tareq] How you feeling? - I'm so cold and I'm so tired. It's like 45 degrees out
here, which is cold for us. - Jake, how are you helping up? - It's cold, but I have to keep checking to make sure my left
hand is still touching 'cause I can't feel it. - Chris, are you giving up?
- Yep. - What?
- Yep. - [Jake] You're giving up? What?
- I'm gonna get out but I want to throw a dart
just to see what I get. - [Tareq] Just double checking. You sure? Do you think you're gonna... - I think this is an awesome boat but I'm so cold and I
I'm like, you know what? I'm sure Jake will let me ride on the boat every now and again. So that's better than nothing. - Wait, hold on.
- (laughs) Oh God. - Hold on. (screams)
- Jake come. (intense music)
- Oh God. - [Jake] We gotta do this procedure. - Yeah, I'm gonna get off now. All right. Boats are unsafe. Left hand off. (screams) - [Tareq] Jake, you won a new boat. (Jake screaming)
- You won a mini yacht. How does that make you feel?
- Like I'm on a boat. - [Tareq] What are you gonna do with it? I have a feeling you're
just gonna sell it. - Yeah.
- Well, congratulations. - We did it. Yeah. I mean I did it. Yay. (laughs) I'm excited. I
can take it off, right? - Oh yeah.
- Ah that feels so good. Okay. (Tareq laughing) - [Chris] I left a giant
poop in the toilet. (upbeat music)
- I just won it. So I have a giant poop in there. - [Chris] You're gonna
have to get that poop out. - Never. No. It's part of the boat now. It's one with...
