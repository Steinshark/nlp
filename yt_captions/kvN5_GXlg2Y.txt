hey what's up I'm Kim BHD here and did you notice something I've been thinking a lot about this over the past couple years of watching Apple presentations and it just became much more obvious watching their latest which was WWDC because in this presentation Apple went through 45 minutes on stage talking about their New Vision Pro headset and they didn't say the words virtual reality on stage once and just in general there are certain words that Apple just refuses to say or generally doesn't like to reference at all in any of their presentations or any of their marketing and it's fascinating to watch so what are those words and why is Apple doing this so let me start with the why now obviously I'm not Apple so this is from the outside looking in but there are two really good reasons for why they do what they do or why they don't say what they don't say and those are control and comparison so control first I've already talked about Apple a big reason for a lot of what they do is being able to fully control over everything as much as possible and that extends to PR2 or it doesn't even have to be PR it's just smart branding but if you come out with a new product and you associate it heavily with a word that the general public already uses or that another company some competitors are already using heavily for a bunch of different things then you run the risk that the sentiment around that word might actually change and might actually have a downturn at some point in the future thus dragging the whole reputation of your product down with it so here's another commonly never used word in apple presentations AI Apple just doesn't say Artificial Intelligence on stage now if you want some contrast go back just a few weeks ago to Google's developer conference just a Google I O and they introduced a bunch of features on stage in Android and in Chrome and let's just say they weren't shy about what was powering it as an AI first company ai ai ai generative AI generative AI generative ai ai a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i so I mean pretty clearly they love leaning into that but apple on the other hand also introduced at their developer conference WWDC a bunch of software features in iOS and Mac OS and they use the words AI or Artificial Intelligence on stage exactly zero times they never said it now they did use phrases like machine learning and ML and they talked about how a Transformer model is being run local on device that will help auto correct in the new keyboard in iOS 17 things like that but at no point did they call themselves an AI first company or proudly Proclaim that they have a bunch of new features powered by AI to show us today nothing like that and I think that's because clearly AI is such a big thing that it kind of has this public Persona that also has a bit of a dark side it's got a it's a bit of a controversial word in some areas we've talked about how AI art is sometimes accused of stealing from real artists I made a whole video about that I'll have a link below um and so the word is so much that if you're appleing you care so much about your Public Image you don't want to risk attaching yourself to that word that you can't control so they just don't they literally just don't say it so that's control uh the other thing like I said is comparison and this is a funny one too with Apple so if you've ever watched an apple presentation which most of us have there are some pretty common themes that you see every time you see the high production value a variety of presenters unlabeled graphs Craig's power stance but as a tech reviewer one thing I've also noticed and I think any other journalist or anyone covering these companies probably also notices to a point is that Apple just kind of avoids comparing themselves or even talking about or acknowledging other companies or other products at all they kind of just like to pretend that they are the only company in the world and they exist in this little ecosystem of just Apple stuff and other stuff just sort of Fades away now there are a few notable exceptions to this rule like they do every once in a while mention oh our new laptop is X percent faster than the most popular PC laptop or something like that they'll do that once in a while but really in general they do it far less than the other companies especially actually have watched it a lot in the smartphone space if you watch another smartphone product unveiling a lot of them will do straight up spec comparisons to others and like just number comparisons you know our folding phone has a new 4 800 milliamp hour battery which makes it the biggest battery in any foldable in this category oh our new phone has a 200 megapixel camera which makes it the highest resolution ever in a smartphone oh our new display refreshes at 165 Hertz making it 20 percent more responsive than the next best thing all this stuff Apple doesn't really like to do this type of comparison instead they would much rather name everything now I'm not just talking about the products of course they name things like the iPhone and the mac and the airpods and the software also has extremely functional names you have iOS iPad OS Mac OS wash OS TV OS Vision OS but they also like to take technical achievements and Technical features and brand them put a name on them they name everything so instead of 120 hertz High refresh rate ltpo display we've got promotion instead of an optical fingerprint reader we have Touch ID instead of a large linear vibration motor it's a taptic engine instead of the latest version of glass from their supplier it's ceramic shield now of course everyone knows the value of good catchy branding but when you brand something for yourself instead of using the term that everyone else uses that specifically makes your version a little bit harder to compare to everyone else's so while all the other companies are talking about okay we got to 120 hertz but now we we've got 244 Hertz and now our gaming phone is 165 Hertz So it's 15 more responsive than their 144 Hertz and Apple's over here like we have Pro motion and this version of promotion is more responsive and smooth than any other Pro motion we've ever had like they hardly ever use ip68 or IP67 on stage as much as they just like saying it's dust and water resistant again and there's hole punch cutouts in the top of the AMOLED display of every other phone in the store but ours with our software on top is a dynamic Island there's actually a whole page of these just on Apple's site I'll link it below just just trademarked names of things that they've put their stamp on some are programs some are features some technologies there's a lot of them clearly they're not the only ones who do this but it's just the most consistent thing about all of their presentations and the cherry on top of all this is a lot of times Apple doesn't even really like saying at all ever what the actual spec is they'll leave it to you to find out later and Tech reviewers are really digging and figure it out but when's the last time you ever saw the milliamp hour size of an iPhone mentioned in the Keynote last time I checked they just don't do that ever they'll just tell you it's the longest battery life of any iPhone we've ever made that is the epitome of control and comparison now with the New Vision Pro headset that Apple just unveiled in particular it's interesting it's really interesting I made a whole video just on I got to try it and my first impressions with it if you somehow haven't seen that yet I'll link it below um but it's also pretty clear based on what we know that Apple has future plans with this to make it cheaper of course but to also make it smaller and higher Tech and better and better to the point where the tech sort of just Fades away and you have a pair of glasses that you look through and still have all the technology and function from so they never really want to call The Vision Pro a VR headset even though it totally is because of the Ambitions that they have to steer this this vision and the control that they have no pun intended towards mostly AR stuff so you'll see all kinds of Demos in the videos of a virtual reality headset with really good pass through like when you go into that theater demo for one like you're in complete darkness with a huge screen in front of you I mean that's literally a VR headset but they want to steer you so much towards thinking of vision as an augmented reality experience and that's much easier if you just never say virtual reality out loud at all the closest they got was talking about how you can spin the digital crown and fully immerse yourself beyond the dimensions of your physical room with features called environments and there it is they've managed to Brand virtual reality with a different name so they can control it and manage what it's compared to over time they also didn't say a whole lot about the specs on stage part of it of course is because this is something that's coming out uh early next year so it's not done maybe some things change between now and then but they still didn't say a refresh rate on stage they didn't say a field of view number in degrees like they avoided a lot of the things that pretty much every other VR headset and maker out there would put in their presentation but there was no shortage at all of naming things and setting the tone for how they want us to think about this headset going forward so the next time you're watching an apple presentation or some keynote there's a lot of impressive things to pay attention to you know the graphics the transitions the Drone shots the power stances but it's the words pay attention to the words thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
