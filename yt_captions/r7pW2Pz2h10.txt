did you know that buying the fastest highest performance ethernet cables on the market is probably a bad idea the cables I'm talking about are category 8 or just cat 8 for short it's quite easy to buy them online but you'll typically pay a premium for it compared to more common cat 5e and Cat 6 cables but that's fine because according to Amazon listings these cables are great for gaming and streaming right yeah you really should take pause before dropping extra money on cat 8 just because it's the newest fastest thing out there the most obvious reason is simply because there isn't really a point to cat 8 for most home users cat 8 tops out at 40 gbits per second which is seriously impressive all other things being equal that's fast enough to download a 50 GB steam game in just 10 seconds but the fastest home internet connection in the US right now is only 8 gbits and average speeds are far lower than that you'll also need equipment at home home that can actually take advantage of those higher speeds many computers still only come with 1 gbit ethernet ports and although you can certainly buy ethernet adapters that support higher speeds you'll pay more and more money the higher up the ladder you go a 40 gbit network card can set you back many hundreds of dollars and models that are available now don't even support cat 8 ethernet cables they instead use a different connector called qsfp plus which is typically used with fiber optic or twin axial cables there are adapters you can use but none of them seem to support the full 40 gig speed over a standard ethernet connection and unless you're often moving huge amounts of data around your internal home network you're never even going to get close to using all that bandwidth however there's another really important reason you might not want to splurge on cat 8 and we'll tell you what that is right after we thank the sponsor of this video delete me okay here's an issue your personal info floating around online without your say so that's totally not cool well delete me thinks it's downright wrong no one wants scammers blowing up your phone with rooc calls and sketchy emails and delete me's here to save the day manually removing all your accounts from the web is tedious but delete me's software and expert Squad can wipe out that info in a jiffy on average they're scrapping over 2,000 pieces of data for customers in their first two years and that's some serious cleanup so if you're tired of your personal info playing hide and seek online go to join delet me.com Tech Wicky and use code Tech quickie for a sweet 20% off category 8 cables are typically thicker and stiffer than other ethernet cables you're probably used to although this sounds like it could be a good thing in terms of durability it actually makes the cables harder to bend which means they're more difficult to Route Around objects but even if you're doing a short straight cable run there have been a good number of anecdotal reports of cat 8 cables not working very well with home networking equipment with users complaining of poor performance even though the cables are theoretically compatible with mainstream routers PCS and consoles because the cables themselves are larger more rigid and require shielding terminating them that is correctly attaching a connector so you can actually plug them into something is significantly more difficult than with a more run-of-the-mill ethernet cable this is obviously an issue for people buying bulk cable and terminating the cables themselves but it's also an issue for folks who are just buying plug-and-play cat 8 cables online a good number of quote cat 8 cables being marketed towards consumers for relatively low prices are simply not being built to the actual category 8 specification meaning that problems people are reporting from trying to use them at home are likely the result of fake cat 8 cables whether it's because they just aren't being constructed well due to either bad termination or some other manufacturing issue or because they're straight up mislabeled on purpose as part of a scam so what kind of cable should you be buying depending on how fast you need your connection to be and how long a cable run you need you should be buying either cat 5e 6 or 6A just have a look at this chart for details we all love a good chart and I love a good viewer who watches all the way to the end of the video good viewer I'm sorry if you like that you can like the video If You disliked it dislike the video check out our other videos comment with video suggestions in the comments below which is where the comments are and don't forget to subscribe and follow I'm a little flustered now
