I've actually got two phones to show you at $180 the you me TGIF one which looks like crazy value for money and then the $230 looky tell k9 which hasn't actually been officially announced by the company yet and is looking like an absolute tank of a phone so let's do this first up with the f1 and a couple of things worth noting you get a little thank-you card on top you've got the smartphone beneath that and the phone comes with an 18 watt fast charger and a case that feels a little different it's got this leatherette finish and at least some character as opposed to clear silicon the inspiration from the oneplus sixty isn't exactly tough to pick up on everything from the rear material to the teardrop knotch to actually having a oneplus wallpaper pre-installed it's a little thicker than the 60 and one gram heavier but compared to that phone which has a three thousand seven hundred million power battery this guy is at 5150 and still has a headphone jack you have to bear in mind that it doesn't feel as premium as that phone it's a little plastic key and you'll notice the vibration motor is not as sensitive it's quite abrupt but then again that is an area of weakness for oneplus as well to clarify it's no Galaxy S 10 but it's a neat looking phone for the money with a 1080p LCD display which fills about 84 percent of a phone it runs Android 9 and comes with 128 gigs of storage with room for microSD cards and what I was surprised to see is support for NFC which you don't normally see on cheap Chinese phones because it's considered a much lower priority feature than having a bigger battery or a faster processor which it also kind of has the phone is powered by the Helio P 60 chip which is upper mid-range somewhere around the Snapdragon 636 or Snapdragon 664 park and I haven't found a game that it can't play it's also got a dual camera which is a little more questionable but it has the capability to shoot good photos and with a wide F 1.7 aperture you can get some nice background blur too anyways for the main event the Uchitel K 9 which is a lot like that fern vert on steroids it's gonna be more expensive with the company estimating two hundred and thirty dollars when it releases but it bumps the screen sighs all the way up to 7.1 2 inches making it the largest screen phone I've ever held it's a 200 experience obviously but I actually kind of liked it when you think about it as soon as you move a screen size beyond about 5.5 inches you'll probably have to use two hands for some tasks so this doesn't feel that much more inconvenient I'm sure my mind would have changed if I tried putting it in my pocket but you see the point battery was the even more surprising trait though 6,000 milliamp hours there's nearly 50% more battery than the s10 plus and they've combined this with 30 watt super fast charging I think lots of really solid move and when you hear all of this you think well I don't really know what you think but you don't particularly think of $230 as a price point like the last phone it'll also come with Android 9 out of the box with 128 gigs of storage and a micro SD card slot they're calling this a flagship phone and in some senses it's quite appropriate but it's not really a flagship phone in the traditional sense like the UM EDG f1 the build is still primarily plastic and you're not getting anything magical in the camera department even in terms of processor you're getting the weaker Helio P 23 which means that compared to the first device your power per dollar is much lower but it's a different kind of proposition here anyways I just wanted to show you two really interesting unique smartphones that have come across recently if you enjoy the video then do leave a comment and do subscribe it would really mean a lot to me and as always my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
