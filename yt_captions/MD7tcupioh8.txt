all right so for those that don't know what has happened in the last little bit uh effectively if you remember the previous really big rust drama which is that they asked um Shepard's Oasis um dorkus the bjorkis I what's his what's his name though I just know his Twitter handle which is dorkus the bjorkas anyways he got rejected from being the keynote speaker and it kind of came at the super weird time a big write-ups happened and all these people got upset and instead of communicating via Discord or anything and just like getting together and talking it's like everybody was yelling Into The Ether so went completely wild and that was a while ago okay that was the rust drama and it's all kind of died down but then in the last like a week people are dropping some pretty wild accusations and of course the accusations came directly after jaboy David tolne dropped a peer binary load in proc macro just dropped the load pure binary people couldn't reproduce it everyone was just like supply chain attack and he's they accused him of terrorism they I mean he's kind of been through the ringer for the last little bit and so one week later we're back at it again jaboy David talney right back in the crapper so let's see what's going on here and this is the kind of the conclusion yeah they literally said he had terroristic actions and that he was holding the community hostage for building out he has I think of the top 10 most used rust crates he has something like seven of them are his it's like Tokyo guys and David are the top 10 rust crates that everybody uses like so this is a pretty prolific Community member like this is somebody that that genuinely by himself he's the sin guy the guy that built the proc macro genuinely great engineer so let's see what happens here so David told member a t Libs member I don't know what t-libs are uh is that like a neolib I'm not really sure what that is uh has recently pointed out as being involved in the rust conf drama and his apology which the community has classified as more of a defense than an apology has started fires I won't go into details more than needed I hate drama and this forum and that's why we're gonna say it all on internals.rustling.org okay uh and this form should be only about technology but hold on I love this state this statement's grape uh which is what brings us all together however actually it's not uh clearly however we need to move forward and with David toldme being a part of the libs team this form is seen as appropriate place to discuss this the purpose of this post is to propose a series of steps to fix the mess for once and having read every post I could find about this on the social media platforms where rust is most prominent I assume they mean Mastodon is Mastodon the most popular place for us I assume Mastodon is um I will be trying to explain what I think the community thinks is right as a self-nominated Ambassador ooh always be careful as a self-nominated Ambassador because the moment you make yourself the community representative you also just get on forever and will receive private messages that are grotesque okay just as somebody who has had all those things happen it's just just a warning as such you know how many dick pics you get I'll tell you this much it's not zero okay which it should be zero just saying it should be literally zero and yet somehow it's not zero uh as such everything here is open to discussion Saturday which is primarily maintained by David tolne has become a crucial part of the rust ecosystem and I congratulate him on that with the recent events though in which he used Sarah day as a pawn to create massive outcry and move forward with his efforts to sandbox procedural macros which by the way this is a pretty intense statement to make okay to be fair his argument back was that it literally shaved like minutes off of builds doing what he did so is what he did wrong no I think that maybe he went about it a little too you know a little too fast a little too excited but to say that he was holding the community Hostage to get his way it seems like a really really really really really really really intense like reading and I just don't know if you can actually do that by the way if you can't tell uh people in my chat are just the worst people on Earth okay thank you for everything that you're giving me chat anyways so let's see what happens here okay so I'm just trying to give you the guys I'm just trying to give everyone the context on what's happened because I haven't reported on any of the recent drama because I just got so sick of Rush drama I figured that it had to stop but it just is like a gift that no matter how much you ask it to quit giving it just keeps giving it just keeps on giving and you're asking it to stop but it just won't stop and it just keeps drowning kittens and so let's find out about the next kitten that's being drowned uh let's see Saturday has become a holy grail of dependency chain attacks it just cannot be trusted by people without a good track record anymore I mean this is a fairly ballsy statement it's not the Holy Grail of dependency Tokyo is equally as holy grailed I mean any rust crate that like URL is a rust crate did you know that do you know that there is no URL object you have to go download and add URL so every application that deals with the web would have this as a package so it's like is it I really feel bad for what they've done to David like I don't know a story I don't know if what they say is true or false I I can't I have to attribute what he's done to ignorance of how people would react and not to uh malice right I think that's a generally good place to take it is I don't think people act like uh in that kind of way you know what I mean uh actually let's see hold on actually stupid to attack top level crates like this anyways yes the ones yes this is actually super good point which is everyone's gonna notice you try to attack a crate like this everybody's gonna notice uh these ones are actually half scrutiny pick a tier two or a tier three create idiots yeah this is so true TJ this is such a good point it's such a good point which is why pick the most looked at and probably uh added to probably the most engaged one whoops just defeated cyber security yeah good job TJ you gave everyone the a good idea the elephant in the room though is the rust conf drama is it an elephant which it never seems to end and refuses to die I agree so why are you why David told me instead of being part of a public apology hid that he was an integral part of the phd's keynote being demoted for three months until someone pointed their finger at him by the way when they say that which is really funny because like this whole thing that happens is that he kind of gives like his his breakdown right here he effectively says that he brought all the stuff up long before he was ever told anybody had even been decided for the keynote and so that's his argument and so if you look at all the other arguments that have been made thus far it's all I didn't realize I was actually hurting anybody I was just trying to talk and it turns out people were doing things and then David told me he's like yeah I didn't know I was hurting anybody I thought we were still talking and so therefore I didn't know that it was going to hurt anybody and then Kaboom it was just like no you were trying to hurt people like I actually feel bad for his taking on this one because I don't think it's as Fair as they gave everybody else I feel like everybody else got this really big benefit of the doubt and for whatever reason David specifically just got bust and I think it's the frustration from the binary the week before I honestly think the binary payload that he put into uh whatever proc Mac or whatever whatever it was was the reason why he's getting completely bust way more and I think that's fairly I think it's unfair uh there needs to be a scapegoat somebody needs that I mean we all know that there's so many needed to die on this one and I think they've pretty much done it uh he has since released an apology that the community has classified as a justification I'm very confused by this because again the conference organizer who rescinded the original PhD status and then the lead that was communicating with her they both released an identical identical justification saying like the guy was like I told her that uh we need to consider stuff and she ran with it she was like I thought he was talking on behalf of the team so I ran with it so it's like again he does the justification gets bust and everybody else does the same thing and they get no trouble this feels it feels very unfair for this guy I again I think it's purely the binary stuff that people are really upset about and so they're deeming him as the evil one the only way forward I can see is to potentially ask him to step down from his t-libs membership status and any involvement present a present and future in the rust project the rust Council first off the rust Council what are you guys are just a bunch of Jedis and the rust Foundation as I was saying David told me no longer has a good track record dude the guy has an amazing track record and he has built incredible technology like repetitively it's one thing to build like Harpoon and get one thing correct okay I got one thing correct but to build over and over and over again and be like 50 to 70 percent of the rust ecosystem this guy has a really good brain and one mess up this is such an intense busing and while I'm very sad too for a lack of a better way to put it throw him under the bus got the bus he has wasted his chance to apologize and make things right twice and not being anything about it would let's say and not doing anything about it would make the rush project complicit I also hate this take I hate takes like this where you can just like I think his apology is just fine I actually think it's it's fine honestly I don't see anything wrong with it because it just seems like it seems on par with everybody else's apology all right what do you guys think okay hold on am I way off here let's just let's ask you guys am I way off here I'm gonna go here because I could be wrong I'm fine being wrong I'm fine being awful let's just do a new take David uh told me uh is a bad actor or whatever you want deserves deserves the bus doesn't I just want I just wanna doesn't deserve no no no no no no no no no right pick a site or uh ambivalent right somewhere in between I did kind of precede the conversation with my my opinion so very fair that this is kind of like a bad pull I get it I I'm fairly good at data I get this but it does seem like a lot of people say no it's fine rust council is equivalent to Game of Thrones but then who's having sex with whose sister I want to know that who is it well if we're gonna do Game of Thrones properly you gotta have one ancestral relationship all right let's keep on going the PHD argues that uh this uh this all points to an entire dysfunctional rust project I actually agree with this take I think the fact that we're sitting here is that the community and the rust project and the rust Foundation are completely ran by the wrong people I think that we have bad leadership in general and I do think that would be I think it'd be great for the community for different people to to be a part of it but I can't say who are the right people and I can't say who would make a good domination and I honestly don't think I could fix the situation I'm smart enough and wise enough at this point that I don't think I'm a good representative of what the right ideas are let's see I personally want to apologize to him if this seems like a Witch Hunt it is a Witch Hunt because in some places it has been in the timing between the two dramas doesn't help at all I'm just communicating the community's concerns and proposing what I think are high uh level-headed Solutions so I don't think these are level-headed solutions I don't think these are the community concerns and then uh hold on all right so jaboy burnt sushi for those that don't know he used to be a part of the moderation team right if I'm not mistaken um is there still a rust moderation team rust moderation team right burn Sushi gave like the proclamation that the team has resigned and all that right so so burnt Sushi very like prolific guy wrote rip grip uh wrote CSV parser great guy Haskell mentioned let's go really oh just major appreciations right now for uh for for burn Sushi always tends to have a very level take too I have always appreciated his takes so disclosure I'm a member of the libs API which if David is also a member okay Community think no one uh I have seen no compelling reason to treat your words as what the community thinks I think this is a I think this is a correct take is and also by the way he puts the period inside the quotes like a true and responsible writer okay he's honestly he's he is genuinely a very nice guy and actually I feel genuinely bad he's not a part of the mod team anymore I think that I think that burnt Sushi was actually the right person for the job the people we wanted were the people that quit which makes me still to this day very sad about it honestly and I I really wish that didn't happen uh let's see it has been proposed before to have Saturday B merged into rust project like rust analyzer and this is what I propose as a solution I must have missed this entire paragraph I don't think this is generally probably a good idea as a practical matter I see two possible paths to clear uh some necessary but not sufficient hurdles one obtain the consent of Sarah day maintainers to transfer to the rust project okay or without consent convince the rust project to either forcefully take ownership of the project or Fork it as an official alternative to Sarah day in my judgment this would require nothing less than an RFC in this case I also think this would just be pure shitty right can we all agree that that that doing number two would just be like it would rust already doesn't have like the rust Foundation the rust project the rust uh leadership doesn't have like the best reflection in the community right now a shitty called it so doing this would be uh it would feel really bad right like we could all agree number two is not good in this particular scenario I personally don't foresee two happening so my recommendation would be to refocus your efforts on one as a starting point I think this is fine I think that it's fine if they wanted to do that uh the thing is I know that Sarah day isn't necessarily the most efficient you know form of you know uh what's it called of serialization and some people don't like it and blah blah blah blah whatever but nonetheless it could be it's a fine I use it all the time I actually have no idea why people don't like it to tell you the truth that's just what I've heard anyways uh edit it is plausible that too is a sufficient uh is uh is a sufficient Criterion for achieving your end the point I meant to convey is uh here is that there are concerns well beyond what you've stated for whether Saturday should be maintained as part of rust project that is concerns that are entirely separated uh from the questions of Saturday's current maintenance status the RFC would presumably need to account for all those concerns yeah I think there's a lot too because right now it feels like they're struggling under just having good leadership and so adding more to their plate technically just seems like the wrong decision and right now it's completely maintained by the community seems fine I don't know well I mean let's oopsies all right let me get rid of that uh this stream is not endorsed by the rust Foundation correct trademarked trademark uh what's the inverse of the Peter Principle called because uh the good people quitting is it yes good people the good people are truly quitting at this point which feels bad all right let's let's see what else we got here the only way forward I see is to politely ask him to step down from his t-libs membership status and any involvement present and future in the rust project rust Council and the foundation so without looking at Sushi's response again I I still feel like this is such a knee-jerk there are at least three a revelant questions to ask here was David a part of the conference organization was David a part of the conference program committee was David a part of the leadership chat I believe the answer to all three of these questions is no period in the quotations good job burn sushi on its own that in my opinion significantly limits David's uh possible uh culpability it's true if he wasn't technically a part of anything and just voicing his concern is it a big problem like I really am not convinced it's a big problem here if the extent of David's involvement is as he said I expressed forceful skepticism of the compile time introspection work which I have been passively following with great interest would achieve a state that would be suitable for a rust conference keynote in the time for 2023 conference for a lack of adequate laying uh Team iteration neither the Russ Foundation Grand selection nor the conference presentation to land well with the rust conf audience I think it would land very well with the rest conf audience no matter what because I think this is a very compelling talk it's a very exciting thing even pick guarantee you even pick where's pick pick tell me you don't think that it's a that compile time stuff is awesome tell me you want that in Haskell tell it to me I think Russ project Foundation council is a uh bad at managing things the problem is they don't have enough power let's give them more things to manage you can tell this is written by communists oh no oh it hurts oh TJ I want a daddy everybody wants it TJ damn it DJ no but but real talk it is true like they're struggling under the weight of taking like of maintaining all these things with a positive Community out Outlook so adding more to their plate just seems like the wrong move you know what I mean it just seems wrong here all right so again if you take everybody else's words as like true genuine honesty then you also have to take Mr tolnes as well and so his team's like this is a pretty reasonable take I don't agree with him I think uh I think a pal time is probably the most exciting feature of all time again I just think that uh his take is fine then in my opinion this at most warrants an apology I'm not even sure like what do you apologize for you didn't think it like you don't think it's good that's your opinion man like hey that's your opinion like I think typescript kind of sucks I will never apologize for that opinion I think the type system is just good enough to feel nice and just bad enough to be horrible like 40 of the time I'm not completely against dhh removing typescript from his project but do I think types are good yeah I'm not gonna like apologize for saying typescript sucks I'm not gonna go on Twitter and like tweet things that are like types that are like gosh typescript sucks because that would be like kind of divisioning creating right like I wouldn't do that that would be rude but at the same time I don't think you should have to apologize for that right then in my opinion this warrants mostly an apology one that I believe has been given okay so he thinks that this has been given uh moreover I find the concerns that David claimed his expressed as a extremely reasonable yes I think I think his I do think his like little RFC he wrote was actually very reasonable to be clear that doesn't mean it should have led to disinviting edit or downgrading keynote yeah I don't even think it did right like if you read the other people's takes on what happened the other community members that or the other leadership members that were a part of it it doesn't seem like that's what happened it sounds like the person leading it all heard more than one person say they don't think it'd be a good talk and then just ran with it and then the core the conference organizer was like well that person must be the authoritative person so I'm just going to listen to him and so it just sounds like the whole thing got screwed up as far as I could tell from public knowledge this ordeal was precipitated by a breakdown in communication that led to the wrong uh to a wrong uh to a wrong committed against the PHD agreed it was a wrong committed against the PHD I truly feel bad for the PHD in this situation truly truly a low blow to him uh that showed and I believe is being corrected with the formation of the council and their commitment to transparency we should absolutely do our best to avoid repeating this mistake I do not believe David's resignation would Aid in that avoidance okay uh which included holding a crate that is essential to the rust ecosystem Hostage to make a point on the dis yes see I completely disagree with this one this narrative that appears to be present as a statement of fact your honor I would like to object this was such a boom goes the dynamite statement right here let's go Sushi I really do I don't like this because you are really truly um trying to like get into his head and say exactly why he did all the things he did when it seems pretty obvious like I've never been somebody that likes to do this whole conspiracy thing where it's just like yeah sure there's a huge performance win but if you really think about it like I don't want to really think about something it feel like whenever you start really thinking about something you're almost always incorrect I appreciate your thoughts and opinions I do agree that parts of this may involved in the benefits blah blah blah blah um all right let's let's see oh when this leadership reform happened it was essential to know uh who was liable and who wasn't part of this Fiasco and he lied okay so they're making so this guy's a lonely zero is making the argument I must I I must have missed that entire paragraph somehow I'm such a good reader effectively saying that uh that David lied this is factually incorrect the mod team resigned which I was a part which I was a part and his precipitated government's reform governance reform was well underway for quite some time before this incident occurred agreed in fact burnt Sushi did the whole thing all right do we have any replies you are free to communicate any of these statements of mine that I expressed for uh derived from Community feedback and I'll apply I'll happily back them with all possible extents um however okay so he's saying no he actually is correct okay I do agree one is the way to go okay to be dynamically amicably it's not amicably this is like asking somebody to resign there's nothing amical about at this point there's nothing amical about being like hey you need to give us Saturday amicably it's like that's not amicable there's nothing amical about that right you've been appointed nothing will you give us your something now I know I pay my taxes willingly and happily let's see I never meant to force Leo let's see adopt let's see I never meant to forcefully adopt Sarah and sin it should be done with all parties understanding and grain with the reasoning behind it namely both Sarah day and sin have become so ingraded or integrated into the rusty ecosystem I think it makes sense for them to live under the rust project umbrella I actually think that like I actually agree with the statement there does come a point where you want like especially sin like you use sin anytime you do a proc macro like at some point to use proc macros effectively you have to use a crate probably just deserve on they it should just be a part of things this would allow us to have better maintained and have uh I don't know about better maintain that is that completely a subjective statement and the protections against Rogue maintainers be tightened again I don't think he was a rogue maintainer in the case of two I'm heavily against taking cerades and send crates names and forcibly pointing them to the rust project forward in my mind that'd be even more unethical than what David tolne did I don't think he did something unethical we're risking a left pad like situation here I love that left pad has become the moral hurdle in which is like set as the worst all right so either way I think you know I I don't think we need to get much further um all right actually let's do one more as a person capable of reason and empathy can recognize that sometimes a conflict is important enough that needs to be dressed I agree with a a lonely zero that this is one of those times and I agree that this forum is an appropriate place for such a discussion I do not know the correct decision okay this is foreign I'm not gonna lie to you this is like the world's most useless line that has ever been added you know as a very emotionally complete individual with capabilities of both reason and empathy I can see this is important to talk about that's all I wanted to say discuss amongst yourselves points I've made in my previous part thank you emotionally complete individual um anyways just to kind of round this entire thing up again I think that ninety percent of rust problems are the fact that they don't have like public meetings where they discuss the things they're and make it so that they're like all decision based things need to be discussed and probably just open make it very very simple right anything you discuss has to be open all things should be able to be read right people are going to have their own private conversations whatever that's always going to happen that's called politicking it's always going to be a part of things they're going to use signal they're going to use Discord they're going to use whatever they need to get around whatever but the fact that they don't just have all those public things extremely public seems very obvious and all decisions being made in public I think could have just avoided all these problems and second off uh people who didn't touch grass and go outside are in charge of what could go wrong and second I think that rust is such like rust is such an intense language like Haskell that it takes a true dork to really enjoy the language itself I like rust I like rust a whole bunch um pick loves Haskell he's a dork he also apparently something something about horses and something else anyways um and so when I hear this like I don't think people that would be into rust would make a good person to be making people Personnel based decisions and so I think that there's like this whole problem of the engineer being promoted to manage your problem oh hey there individual who's very very good at engineering come be a manager because you're good at engineering right like I think that this this happens and it always falls apart you see it happen at a billion companies uh at the end of the day I sure hope they get their crap together I hope Russ Foundation itself becomes less political I hope they're very careful about who they choose for their upcoming moderation team because I know at least one person applying for their moderation team has acted completely completely Wild on Twitter and is potentially going to be in the moderation team like that would I would lose all confidence in them if that happened and so it's you know I sure hope that they take things more seriously and just find people that are perhaps better talking to people you know what I mean maybe just maybe they could talk to people just throwing it out there the name is you gotta stop having drama rust just talk to each other just open up the effing Discord call make it public do it on Twitch just talk just make the talks just just just just just talk to each other again
