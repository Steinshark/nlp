so the story of prince yvonne and the gray wolf is one of the most famous russian fairy tales around and just recently actually just yesterday deacon nicholas kotar who many of you have seen on my channel he's the author of the raven sun series he's also been a pretty enthusiastic participant in the symbolic world blog actually his articles have gotten more views than my article and so so deacon nicholas has just started a new podcast called in a certain kingdom and his podcast is going to be looking at different russian fairy tales giving a retelling of the fairy tales and then giving some analysis as well his retellings are very beautiful and succinct they keep the flavor of the russian fairy tales with the certain literary tropes that are used that are almost like liturgical in the way that they're used so i'm pretty excited about it his first episode was a retelling of yvonne and the gray wolf so myself i thought it would be a good opportunity to celebrate this new podcast to give my own interpretation of that fairy tale which of course is one that i loved for a very long time [Music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world so in order to give you my interpretation i'm of course going to give you a summary of the fairy tale kind of give you the basic elements of course my retelling is going to be just bare bones and has nothing to do with the retelling that deacon nicholas gives in his podcast the his retelling is beautiful there's also a some compositions that were written and so there's music in the background it's very it's very very well done very professional i once again suggest you check it out so here are the basic elements of prince yvonne and the gray wolf and so the king has a tree which produces golden apples and then the king realizes that there's something which is stealing his golden apples at night there are different versions sometimes it is seen that the guards have noticed this uh firebird which escapes the garden at night and so the king asks his sons if they would be willing to try to catch the thief of these golden apples of course the king has three sons his two older sons and the youngest who is yvonne so the two oldest agree and the king doesn't want the youngest to get involved this will continue on through the fairy tale so the the first son goes in at night and tries to wait for the thief but he falls asleep and he doesn't catch the firebird the second son of course does the same falls asleep can't catch the firebird so prince yvonne begs his father and his father agrees so prince yvonne goes in and he fights to stay awake is successful at staying awake and then sees the firebird come to steal the golden apple and so prince yvonne tries to catch it but he's only able to grab a tail feather of the bird as the bird flies away so the this is successful in chasing the firebird away the firebird doesn't come to get the apples anymore but the king regrets the firebird when he sees the beautiful uh tail feather of the bird he regrets it and wants to uh to catch it and so he tells his sons that whoever catches this firebird will be his inheritor and will also get half the kingdom so of course the same thing the father sends his two older sons the younger son begs to be able to go but the father says he's too young and that he cannot so the two sons leave to get the firebird and they come to a fork in the road there are three possibilities three roads ahead of them there's a sign at the crossroads which says that if you take the first road you will you will endure hunger and cold if you take the second road your horse will die and you will live but if you take the third the third road you will die and your horse will live and so the two sons not being able to choose between the three paths decide to just give up hang out there and live an idle life and so as the king is waiting for the sons to come back they don't of course and so finally yvonne begs his father and the father lets him go to go find the firebird so yvonne reaches the sign in the road and decides to take the second road which is the one where his horse will die but he will survive so as he's going a grey wolf comes and eats his horse which leaves yvonne lost in the forest lost in the middle of nowhere walking for days and days until he's exhausted and can continue when finally the gray wolf comes back to see him apologizing for eating his horse and then of course offers him to help him there are some versions where the wolf asks uh prince yvonne to uh if he if prince ivan would be willing to give him his horse to eat which is a very interesting take on it as well and yvonne accepts and then the horse gives his help in return and so the wolf says to get on his back and that the wolf will bring him to where the firebird is and so yvonne rides this wolf through the great lands and reaches to another kingdom and in the russian fairy tales it's always amazing it's always like you know the tenth kingdom or the you know the tenth of the third ten times three kingdoms or there's always this kind of way of describing it which is really wonderful um and so yvonne arrives and the the uh firebird warns him he says no not the firebird the gray wolf warns him that when he gets the firebird he's going to find the firebird in a golden cage and that he should take the firebird but not take the golden cage so yvonne goes out gets to the firebird and of course he cannot resist and he goes to take the golden cage and these brass trumpets start to blare and the king of the kingdom catches him yvonne tells him his story and the king says why didn't you tell me that you wanted the firebird if you just asked for it i would have given it to you but he said maybe if you do me a favor i can help you out so the king says that he really would like to have a this horse in another kingdom this horse with a golden mane and that if prince yvonne can get for him this horse with a golden mane then he will give him the firebird and so prince yvonne goes to see the wolf and the wolf says don't worry i will take you to where the horse with the golden mane is so they leave together and you know the the the gray wolf brings him to where the horse is once again a similar situation presents itself itself the horse tells prince yvonne that now the horse i keep confusing the characters is not helping you the gray wolf tells prince yvonne that he should take the horse but not take the golden bridle that is holding the horse down and that you know so prince yvonne goes in and of course same situation he cannot resist he tries to take the bridle these brass trumpets blair and the king comes out they catch him and again the prince says why didn't you tell me that you wanted the horse if you just told me then i would have given it to you of course these these kings are recognizing in prince evan that he is the son of a king from another kingdom and so he would he said as as the son of a of a king if you would ask me for it i would have given it to you and so either but now the uh the king has also a favor it says if you do this favor for me then i will let you have the horse with the golden mane you need to find for me helen the beautiful and if you bring back helen the beautiful for me then i will give you the horse and so the apprentice van gogh sees the wolf of course and the wolf brings her brings him to where the princess is but this time the wolf says look you know what i'm gonna do it and you just hang out here i will get the princess for you so we avoid getting into more trouble and so the wolf goes in he grabs the princess away from his maidserv her maidservants and brings the princess to prince ivan he takes the princess on the back of the wolf and as their writing the princess and prince evan fall in love as they're going towards the king the the first kingdom when they arrive at the kingdom where he's supposed to trade her for the for the golden horse prince ivan is crying and says i can't give her up i love her and she loves me and what what are we to do and so the wolf says don't worry i will take care of it just go on your way and i will come meet you so prince ivan and the princess go on their way and the wolf goes in and he pretends to be the princess he turns into the princess transforms into her and so he's received by the king and the king uh gives i forget obviously the order is wrong he prince ivan brings the princess to the king and then the king gives prince yvonne the horse and he leaves the wolf with the king so that the wolf says don't worry there that's when he says i'm going to meet you further down sorry i'm getting the events confused so prince yvonne then leaves with the horse and the princess on his way to go exchange the horse for the um the firebird on his then when the wolf sees that he has an opportunity he escapes meets with prince ivan and they get to the place where they're supposed to make the trade but when they get there prince evan is like well i don't want to give up this beautiful horse with its golden mane what should i do so the wolf once again says don't worry i will take care of it and so he transforms into the whole horse with the golden mane and prince yvonne brings the the horse to the king and gets the firebird the once again the wolf says go on your way i will meet you and prince yvonne leaves with the golden horse and the princess and when the wolf has an opportunity he escapes meets with prince yvonne and then they get to the place where the wolf ate his horse and this is where the wolf says look this is the place where i ate your horse i don't owe you anything anymore and so i will let you guys go on your way so prince yvonne and the princess on the horse start to return to the kingdom when they arrive at the place where the three roads met they settle down and they fall asleep that's when the two brothers see prince ivan the horse the princess and the golden and the firebird so the two brothers jealous decide amongst themselves that they're going to kill prince yvonne and take his treasure so they kill prince yvonne they cut him into pieces and they leave with the princess with the firebird and the horse and go back to the king when the king is happy to receive his firebird and you know he gives the different things to half the kingdom and one of them marries the princess and it not it doesn't marry but will be the one to marry the princess the other person gets the kingdom et cetera et cetera and there is prince ivan in in cut into pieces and he stays there dead for a month in the some of the versions after a month one day the wolf catching the prince's scent comes upon the dead body the cut up body and he sees that these crows this family of crows is about to come down and to eat prince yvonne and so the wolf catches the baby crows and he tells the mother crow if you don't go and get for me the water of life and the water of death you know at the edge of the world or whatever you know what on the the 10th of 30th kingdom or whatever some some kind of you know magical really far away number then i will devour your children and so the crow goes away and brings back the water of life and the water of death to the wolf so the wolf kills one of the baby crows kind of cuts it in half or whatever chops it and he pours on the crow first the water of death which brings the crow back to one piece then he pours on the baby crow the water of life which reanimates it so now the gray wolf knows that he has the right thing turns towards prince yvonne and does the same pours on him the water of death by which all his pieces come together and join into one body and then he pours on him the water of life which awakens him and vivifies him and when prince ivan wakes you know gets up he thinks that he's been sleeping and he's waking from a profound sleep so the wolf tells him about everything that's going on and that his brother stole his bride stole his horse stole the bird and so prince ivan and the wolf go to meet with the uh the king and you know tells the whole story to the king and their version where the brothers are killed were they eaten by the wolf and somewhere they're in prison whatever that's not a big that's not the most important what's important is that prince yvonne finally marries his princess and also inherits the kingdom and has his horse so everything and everybody well not everybody but let's say some people live happily ever after and so what is going on now i would really suggest that if you know i told you this version very quickly and very summarily but i would really suggest that you go listen to deacon nicholas's retelling even maybe before i give you this interpretation you might find it very fascinating what i really need you to do first of all is to buckle up to a certain extent because i'm really going to try to give you an interpretation of this fairy tale one of the things about russian fairy tales that is amazing is just how cosmic they are they have not gone through the kind of moralizing lens that many of our fairy tales have gone through during the enlightenment where there was this desire to make them into simple morality tales which are not at their basis in this fairy tale we really get a full cosmic vision a full vision of the cosmic image and so what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to do something a little fun is i'm going to use the image of everything that i designed to kind of give you a road map to understand this fairy tale so what it's going to do is it's not only going to give you a it's not only going to help you understand the fairy tale but it's also going to help you see how this image first of all is not arbitrary that this image is meant to be a kind of map of the cosmos in in a way that you can also use through analogy to then look at the world and see the patterns that appear there of course the image of everything that i designed is not the only image there are other images of everything and they could all they could have different forms they don't necessarily all have to have the same form this is one manner in which you can represent the the cosmic pattern which is of course not with the cosmic pattern is of course invisible at the outset all right and so now the situation starts with the idea that the king has this tree of golden apples now if you notice everything in the fairy tale is golden this happens in a lot of fairy tales it has to do with the idea of them being special or the highest version of something and so the they shine with light okay and so they glow this is the notion of glowing you see it also in the firebird this idea of something which glows uh is something which is special which is like i said the highest version of it in terms of phenomena i've mentioned this in terms of the notion of um attention and our capacity to attend to things and how this the way they are special is the manner in which we notice them right as someone you know will glow more than a stranger and this glow is the glow that is um ultimately referred to not of course not the glow of a friend but the notion of meaning of fullness you know of the highest version of something in your experience of it and so the the golden tree is in a way the highest thing that the king has access to it is the fruit of you know you can imagine it as the center of his garden and so if you look at the image you see the notion of this garden this enclosed space and then in the center would be the tree which has golden fruits you know in this case the tree is more the tree of the knowledge of good and evil maybe not the highest highest tree that is that is something which comes later in the story and so this notion of this tree with golden fruit and this is also where you're going to see and this might be difficult for some people to deal with but i've often mentioned that symbolism is not moral and that some stories will take on certain patterns and will manifest them at different on different sides of the same story this is of course where you're going to see something similar you know the idea that the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil was bad of course is not true in the tradition there's this idea that god if adam and eve had been humble god would have given them the fruit okay so it's a good fruit and it's also a fruit which leads to higher spiritual knowledge and so this is the tree that the the king has you could see it as the highest insight that the king has access to in terms of knowledge in terms of understanding you can see it that way you could just see it as the most precious thing that he has it it can apply different levels of reality and so something is coming to steal his apples and this happens to be the firebird now the firebird is of course in different versions it's represented not only as a firebird but as a glowing bird or a bird of light right and it is this heavenly influence or this heavenly thing above and like i said we tend to think of the heavenly influence as something which is positive but sometimes it is also negative it can be negative in the sense that it can pick things pick seeds and bring them up into the heavens and prevent them from being on the earth i mentioned this in terms of some ideas sometimes which you know they're just floating up in the air and they never seem to land there's this idea that that which is above can come down and pick that which is below and bring it up to its use this can be seen in terms of spiritual reality but it can also be seen in terms of understanding that a king will do the same to his kingdom so the the the firebird comes down picks the king's apples and brings them up but the king goes down into his kingdom picks the best men for his army picks the best women you know like king david for or king solomon for his for his court uh and so this is one of the aspects of heaven is that it comes down and it takes the best up right it takes the first fruits in terms of the sacrifice it takes the best and brings it up into heaven okay this is how hierarchy works and so now this thing from heaven comes down something which is above the king and comes down and takes the golden apples and of course the king doesn't want his golden apples to go away especially if you understand the golden apples as something like his insight or something like his hit the best that he has and so he wants to catch the bird um here is where the story refers even more so towards the idea of knowledge and of insight because we see that the reason why the two sons can't catch that which is above is because they fall asleep they can't be into contact which that was above because they let themselves fall into death you could say and so prince yvonne stays awake remember the story of christ who's up on the mountain and who tells the disciples to stay awake at the bottom of the mountain while he prays so while he is up and communing with the heavens he asks for the disciples to stay awake so that they can benefit from what is happening at the top of the mountain this is the similar situation the prince the princes have to stay awake but they don't they fall asleep they don't catch the inside they don't receive the the positive aspect of the spiritual influence and prince ivan on on different from them is able to remain attentive he's able to remain awake and attentive and because of that he's able to catch the inside but not totally he's not completely capable of catching the inside he only catches the remainder of the inside he only catches the feather and brings the feather back to his father now in terms of knowledge i think pretty much everybody has had that experience where you have an insight but then when you try to formulate it you can't formulate it properly you don't have the words for it you you you uh you only have a pale remainder of the insight or the spiritual vision or the the the moment of of the small connection spiritual connection that you have you don't have the capacity to explain it and that is what prince yvonne staying with only the bird's feather is talking about now of course i keep i'm gonna keep moving you know at different levels of ontological reality to help you understand what this is about but notice that it's not of course just about knowledge it's about all kinds of other things but this is the best way to maybe understand it uh in this case okay you can understand it in another way you could say that you know someone who receives an opportunity which comes from above let's say a favor a king's favor and then is not able to make it uh grow is not able to to make it produce more than you know very little and so you get this thing from above but you're not able to make it worth something it kind of falls flat you know that's that's one another way of explaining the experience of prince yvonne in this moment but of course the king even the feather for him is already more than what he has access to is already more than what he can have and so he wants to get the bird because he is he is dazzled by just the feather of the bird and so he wants it um and so he asks his son to go catch the bird now you need to you need to wonder why the king himself isn't going to catch the bird but in a way ultimately you also kind of have to understand that the sons are always also an extension of the father so you can imagine the father looking at different aspects of his kingdom to see if they can capture this insight different aspects of himself different aspects of his kingdom to see if they have the capacity to host the insight to to to catch it okay so the two suns go now the thing about this is that in order this is now the place where there's actually a fall and you might wonder you know why why is it now that there would be a fall why is it that this moment throws the whole situation in a loop you know you cannot understand it of course if you want to understand it as the hero's journey as the call to adventure which is also this going down into the underworld going down into death uh all of this is what's going on here but it is also a form of moving into the world of death and of suffering in order to find the body in order to find the capacity to connect with this this first event that happened right this first moment of the the firebird and leaving of his feather so in order to do so you have to go out and you have to kind of go into death and this is what happens now here it's not necessarily seen as a fall per se it's just seen as a going out into adventure but let's say in the cosmic image that i that i've drawn it is represented of course also as it's represented as the fall but there are different ways of understanding the fall i've noticed i've mentioned in the past that for example saint irenaeus talks about adam and eve as being children something like children who although the fall was was not good we couldn't say that the fall was good but it was nonetheless a kind of pedagogical tool to get them to become more than what they they were and so this is something that you can see as well so the king's sons are going out to find the firebird but in doing so they're also going to become men they're also going to show that they're worthy of replacing the king not just by finding the firebird but by by vanquishing the very uh the very challenge that the king is giving them is also going to show how they are the ones who can inherit the kingdom okay and so prince yvonne so the two go out and they come to the result of death that is they leave the the safety of the kingdom and they face multiplicity they come to the fact that they now have to choose this is important to understand because saint maximus the confessor for example talks about how the idea of choice that we have the idea that we choose between different paths like this that is not the highest form of will the highest form of will is a will which is directly connected to reality which doesn't choose but expresses itself in pure conjunction with how the world is laying itself out and so it actually looks like you're not choosing in the conventional cell sense where it's like you have options and you choose the different options this is of course the same thing this is of course the same thing as adam and eve go down the the hill go down the or chase from the garden they will face a world where they have to choose where multiplicity will present itself to them as a as a quandary that they have to solve whereas in the garden they didn't have the prop multiplicity wasn't a problem for them it wasn't something which presented suffering let's say and here is where the choice multiplicity and suffering come together in this moment where the two sons find the sign and the three the three possibilities of either going on the road which will um which will bring them cold and suffering and then you can understand it as three roads so one in the one let's say going down straight down and then one going to the right and one going to the left okay and one is this road of let's say pure suffering which is just going down into death okay and then one of them is the two opposites so if you look at the image of the cosmic mountain on the two sides are the two opposites they're let's say the going up and going down okay you can understand the two opposites in different ways and here you can see the two opposites one is that let's say death will cause a separation of the body and the soul so the the horse of the writer is the an extension of his body this is something that is maybe difficult for some people to understand but when every time you hear of a mount in any story it is an extension of that person just like a sword or like any any supplement that is added to someone is a is an extension of themselves now if you haven't noticed for example that in the story of how to train your dragon you see this very clearly where each dragon that is becomes the mount of the different vikings is an expression of that person is like a lower expression of the person who is mounting them and this is of course what amount is it's like it's like adding body to yourself okay so you add animality it's a garment of skin you add animality to yourself and you have more power because you have a mount and you can go faster you can pull things you can do all these things because you're adding power to yourself you know you can see this going all the way to a car or to you know other types of technology which increase your power but the mount is the most prima is one of the most primordial ones and so one of them is that the body and the head will separate you know and the head will survive but the body will die the other one is the opposite where the body and the head will separate but the head will die and the body will survive and so you have these kind of two opposites which are represented in different ways if you look at the image you have the white bird and the blackbird so in one image the head survives and in the other image the body survives so it's these two these two movements and then down the middle is going down into death so prince yvonne chooses chooses rightly he's smart because i mean he's smart because he chooses the one in which his horse is going to die and so he loses his body and because of that he loses his power and he can't get he can't do what he wanted to do he loses you know he he sacrificed his his power and in a way there is a manner in which you could you could see it as a as a kind of form of asceticism um you could see it as a form of sacrifice as well that he kind of sacrificed this animal in order to be able to survive and so he suffers for a while because he kind of wanders and he can't he can't find he's like a wandering ghost let's say who can't find a body and so he can't accomplish anything he can't do anything and that's when he meets the wolf that ate his horse and now if you you need to understand the wolf also as an extension of yvonne the wolf is his mount as well but now this is a different kind of mount it is a wild mount it is a mount which has something of the of the the trickiness of the snake the power of the animal and so it's not a tamed mount like the one he had but it's a wild mount and there and it has much more power than what the other amount has but it also has much more danger so you can understand it in many ways you can understand it as this this let's say i i've mentioned this before you can imagine imagine it first of all in yourself as a more wild aspect of yourself as your more irratible nature your more passionate nature you can understand it in times of a person you can understand it in terms of a country where you know uh there's so many examples where the king will get a personal guard of barbarians to protect him because he's taking this foreign strange power to himself and it's it's adding more power than if he took his own people because of this kind of foreign element with this strange element this wild element if you're able to mount it it will give you way more power but it also has more danger that is another part of it and it's the same you know in yourself if you're if you need to tap into anger if you need to tap into those more irratible passions that you have you will see that it will give you extreme power and it's a it's a power that can make you drunk it's dangerous power but it is power nonetheless and if you have holy anger for example you can accomplish pretty much anything and so here the wolf now brings him to the first place of course in the in the cosmic image you can understand this as increasing the layers the the different layers that cover adam and eve increasing the animality in which adam and eve are plunged you can see it as this putting on the garments of skin down at the bottom of the image moving from the lighter covering which is the the leaf covering to the animal covering below but here it's more the idea of moving from the tame animal to the wild animal it's too much to go into here but you see that distinction in the creation narrative as well where there's a when it talks about the different animals it talks about let's say domesticated animals and wild animals as these two opposites or two aspects of reality and so because prince yvonne could not catch the bird which was coming from above he has to free it from an are already from a cage he has to find it in the world and he has to be able to to get it from there now there are many ways to understand this you can understand it in terms of knowledge understanding in terms of knowledge at least in my sense seems to be a good way to understand it but you can understand that if you have an insight and you can't let's say you lose it or you lose the capacity to embody it properly the best way then to recapture that insight is to look at the analogies is to look back into the world and to see if you can't perceive a glimmer of that spiritual insight that you had you look in scripture you look in the tradition you look in in in depending on what the insight is that you have you will look in the world and try to free it from another body try to free it from another place where you find it so that you can kind of pick it out right and then see it once again okay and this is what is is happening but the here you have this opposite being set up the wolf says attend to the inside but don't take the outside don't take the thing tying it down if you want the insight take the bird but don't take the body if you want the insight you need to be able to see the insight in the world but if you need to be able to also be careful not to confuse or to take just take the body as well if you want that insight you know so if i'm looking for analogies i need to not get too attached to those analogies not get too attached to the examples but be able to weed the inside out of the cage okay so you even if the cage is precious and the cage is nice you need to leave the cage don't take the cage and so because um prince yvonne takes the cage then he's thrown into another loop another loop of having to now go find something else okay and and of course prince evan now is also in the world of death he's in the world of the stranger and he's using the tricks of this of that world he's using thievery he's using he's using let's say things that aren't good to now try to find that insight now like i said symbolism is not moral and there's plenty of examples where you see this happen i talked about jack and the beanstalk there are different stories where you can see the use of thievery and trickery to try to get the uh the the insight you know and sometimes it can be justified in the story of jacob you see that that's what he does the story of jacob is very similar to these types of stories where jacob goes to la ban and in order to get his wife he he tricks laban but he also ends up taking his his livestock and he ends up you know he he's also tricked as well this is something that will happen to prince ivan also but he's engaging in that kind of behavior ways where he's stealing the thing and it's funny because the king says if you had used logos like if you if you had used the tools of meaning to get this insight then you i would have given it to you but instead you're not you're not i mean you it's gonna work in the end but it's gonna be very painful the whole process is like a fall all of it's gonna be very painful and the king is saying if you had only used the tools of light you could say then you would have gotten it but no you need to go the hard way you need to go all the way around you need to suffer and you need to to to go through the hard part and so okay fine you try to steal it you try to get the cage and now you have to go on another loop and you have to go get now the horse with the golden mane so prince ivan now you had he had to get something above right and now he has to get something below so it is he's going down okay he has to get something below which is another mount now this golden mount which is related to his horse which is related to the idea of that which is above to the mount and so he goes and the same thing happens again there is something about the the there's something that's not it's similar to the the the bird where he also is trying to get some kind of insight in the mount he's trying to get it's not the same high insight as the firebird but there's also some inside because the the horse has a golden mane um and once again he's told take the horse but don't take that which ties it down don't take that which is holding it to the world right if you want to get the most of it don't be attached to that which is around it right to its covering to its shell of course prince yvonne makes the same mistake same thing happens the king said if you'd only use the tools of light if you'd only use logos then you would have gotten it i would have given it to you but instead you go the hard way so now third way you go now the third one is to get helen the beautiful this is now becomes very interesting because all of a sudden you know i don't know if in the russian it's meant to be that but at least for an english speaker when you see hell in the beautiful you of course think of the story of the trojan war and you remember that in the story of the trojan war there is also a story of golden apples and the whole conflict starts with a problem about wanting a golden apple and a you know this competition to seduce paris between the goddesses and then uh you know the prince chooses to get helen of troy and this is what kind of sends the whole thing into a loop as well so that's just fascinating to mention it seems like it's it's referencing that as well but here the idea and this is going to sound strange to sal to some but now he's actually getting the lowest thing and now the lowest thing appears not as something negative in the sense of bad but lois in the sense of the grail in the sense of the the pristine cup in the sense of the virgin that is his last quest so he's moving down from the from the from the high insight down but then this is the the kind of the trick or the mystery which is that one of the highest insights actually is in the grail when one once one of the highest insights is in this pure container which is the pure beauty or you know unadulterated beauty the idea of the virgin the idea of the mother of god of course ultimately and so this is this is now the let's say this is in his quest he's going to now try to get that get the grail and so this is also fascinating because until now the prince ivan doesn't really care about the things that he's getting he doesn't care about the firebird he didn't care about the golden apples he didn't care about the horse with the golden mane he's just kind of he just kind of wants to please his father um and this is in a in a way as he goes down and he goes out into adventure and he goes down into death is the place where he will then discover in a certain manner his own being in his own agency you could say where he and this is like i said he's neither negative or positive but he's going to start to experience attachment and desire in his own sense and here in the story it's not seen as bad in other stories it could be seen as bad in this story it's not seen as bad where prince yvonne you know when the wolf brings him to princess now he falls in love with the princess and the the falling in love with the princess also makes him care about the other things he also wants the horse and he also wants you know he wants the different things because he he he now is in love with this princess he now is attached to the world you could say but this is also the place where the effect of death where the use of trickery will become more and more apparent and now the the thing that he desires that his irratible quality his desiring quality his mount right the thing which drives him forward the thing which supports him and his power is going to take the shape of the things that he desires and that is going to make him have access to those things right and so this is what's going on the wolf takes on the shape of that which he desires and then he is able to get it and in a manner also through an act of trickery this is of course in the world of death is where you start to see these loops of trickery so he tricks once tricks twice but that of course it's not a way to live it's you can't you can't continue that way he's entered into the place of multiplicity and this is where you see what the place of multiplicity is because when ivan gets back to the place where he discovered multiplicity the place where the paths split into three that's the place where he also dies because that's what it's been from the beginning it's been death from the beginning from the beginning of the story this whole process has been a process of death and you see it in the story you've seen in the story because it's about the water of life and the water of death but this whole loop has been prince yvonne going down into death and it manifests itself completely when he kind of comes back to this point you've seen this loop in death but now you see the you see it again you could say but to help you understand what this whole thing was from the beginning which is this relationship between desire and death and multiplicity and the desire for multiple things all of this stuff now it let's say happens to him where he is killed by his brothers and he's chopped into pieces that is of course the ultimate representation of the fragmentation of the breaking apart of the body which happens at the bottom of the mountain and so prince yvonne is killed and is broken apart and everything that he loved is taken away from him and so this is where let's say the mystery of the transformation finally completely occurs now prince ivan is about to be baptized and this is of course like i said it's not a christian story and so you can't totally see the christian elements in it but nonetheless the the the place where he is right now in the story is akin to the place where he is about to be baptized and so the you have to see the you have to see now the the wolf comes and he tells the birds that he takes the baby birds now you have to to see the black bird and the white bird as related in the story you have the the bird of light the firebird and you have the bird of death which is the blackbird and the bird of light is picking the fruits from the tree and bringing them up above and now this wolf who's at the bottom and this relationship with the bird of death is rather just pulling down or you can say right so you have this this these birds that are coming to eat the carcass not take the seeds you know the difference between the a bird that eats the seeds in the tree and a bird like a crow that eats the dead bodies on the ground okay so you see this opposite in the story these two sides if you look at the image again of the cosmos you see the white bird of the blackbird the bird that noah sent out and came back and the bird that noah sent out and now ended up feeding on dead bodies in the water according to some of the the artistic tradition so the wall and so now you're at the bottom of the mountain you could say in a way you've kind of been at the bottom of the mountain the whole time this whole thing has been kind of a cycle of going down the mountain and showing what the bottom of the mountain is in terms of multiplicity desire you know uh attachment to things and also but ultimately the mystery of the grail which is the transformative mystery which is also at the bottom of the world you could say but all of this is kind of this is what's great about stories is that you can show the story and it's because it's it shows you the positive and the negative aspects of this process that it's happening so he tells the blackbird to bring him the water of life and the water of death you can imagine it as the water which is coming down from the garden right that's flowing down which is the source which is the water of life it's the water that christ talks about the water that the living water the fountain of youth all this image of the fountain which brings life in like say in christian tradition but in in all kinds of traditions you find this idea of the water of life which comes down from above and then the water of death which is represented let's say as the ocean or the salt water which is below and which you can't drink and so he the bird brings the two waters together and this is where he will be baptized now baptism it's interesting because you do have these two like competing narratives about baptism where you have this sense that baptism is a descent into death and so you put someone down in the water and then there's another version which is the sprinkling from above which you see mostly in catholic baptism where they sprinkle the the person with water on top um if you look at early images of baptism you see that it's both together you see christ is in the water and then you see saint john the baptist pouring water on top of his head it's both at the same time it's both going into the water of death but somehow this water of death also joining or getting the the getting the the positive aspect of the water of life um and the water of death is there to bring things together into one now what why why is it this has to do it's difficult because we we don't tend to think that way but it has to do of course with the the purifying effect of water it has to do with the idea of you have a lot of stuff on your hands and then you wash your hands and so and then you remove all that is you remove the multiplicity and now here it's not so much that removes the multiplicity but that it kind of fixes them together this of course intuitively you know in certain arts you can understand that water also does that it fixes things sometimes especially cold water if you imagine imagine metallurgy where they heat the flame they heat the sword so that it becomes malleable and then they put it down into the water to fix it and so this is what's going on in the water of death where the body kind of finds itself just the body and so remember this whole thing from the beginning has been about the body and the the soul in the body or the above and the below the the separation of the head and the body all of this has been there from the beginning but now you can see the two coming together where there is a let's say a bringing together of the body and then a pouring of the water of life which vivifies the body now there could be different ways of representing it in scripture it's represented as the gathering of the dust of adam into a body and then the blowing of the spirit into the nostrils of adam now the the let's say though going down into the fixing waters to kind of fix the the shape and then having living water pour down up upon it is of course a very similar pattern um f understanding that in many ancient mythologies as well the relationship between heaven and earth or above and below was represented by the intertwining of fresh water and salt water for example in the story of of tiamat for example which is this this there's a joining of heaven and earth as the fresh water and the salt water and so this is the resurrection of ivan so yvonne resurrects he's gone through the adventure he's gone through death he has died to himself and now he's back he has let's say become more than what he was before and now he is ready you could say to claim the kingdom and that's what happens he goes finds his father and he's able to reclaim the kingdom but in order to do so he had to go through this this reawakening from sleep right and you can understand his death when he's cut apart and his sleep with the princess and the horse all being the same thing and now he does finally awake you see it of course in the story when he he comes back from death he's also sees himself as awakening and so you could understand there's so many ways you can understand it you can understand the whole loop of him going down as a kind of dream or the whole loop of him going down as this like i said going down into death uh going down into forgetting going down into desire all of these things going down into his passions all of these things make sense because the story is so versatile that it can be applied in different ways to different things and then finally prince ivan comes back inherits the kingdom from replaces the king ultimately becomes the new king and inherits the kingdom and so i hope that this was helpful and the image of course the final image and i know some people will will might be a little bit annoyed that i point of course this story is not the story of christ it is it is not comparable to the story of christ the story of christ is much bigger much wider much broader than all of this but nonetheless this the story because it is so cosmic cannot help but point to the story of christ in different ways some of them more broken than others but in the end what you see is the image of christ crucified at the top of the hill which is that you can imagine not just crucified but also let's say if you can imagine the image of the crucifixion and the resurrection at the same time or the descent into hades that's all of this at the same time this is the final image where for having died for having gone through this prince yvonne you know his kingship is higher than what it would have been if he didn't go through that if he hadn't gone through death in my brother's book he talks about the idea of space crowned with time that that to receive the crown is also to have integrated some aspect of death or to have used death against death and this is something which the whole time prince evan is dealing with and so there could be so many more things to say but i just wanted to give you a little hint of how much there is in these fairy tales just how much depth there is in these stories and so that is one of the reasons why i'm extremely excited to see deacon nicholas go on this journey into
