one of my favorite all-time videos is this retrospective look at an absolutely incredible eight core Enthusiast PC from Intel that held up shockingly well for its age today's subject is it's much stupider cousin from AMD on the surface everything about the quad father kind of checks out it also looks Flippin badass it also shipped with up to eight processing cores and it also supports the best Gaming Technologies from the time like high speed ddr2 memory and quad SLI gpus luckily for Intel that's where the resemblance ends right out of the gate it was hot slow and comically overpriced to the point where I would argue that quad FX is the worst consumer CPU platform of all time okay that's a big claim I know but I think by the time we're done here including taking the 4x4 Out for a Rip even the most Ardent of AMD Fanboys is going to come around to my viewpoint and come around to this message from our sponsor MSI MSI wants to level up your gaming experience with an epic gaming laptop from their epic summer sale let them help you check out msi's summer sale event using the link below watching AMT is kind of like those videos right where you see the kid ripping down the hill they go flying over the handlebars and you're like okay it's okay to laugh they're doing fine but speaking as an Enthusiast who cheered when AMD brought 64-bit Computing and dual core processors to the mainstream in 2006 we weren't ready to laugh yet it was a painful time first Intel jabbed with the Core 2 lineup of dual core processors that made Athlon X2 look slow and inefficient by comparison quad core versions of those same chips that left amd's premium offerings looking utterly irrelevant so what did AMD do this I mean it kind of makes sense you know you're not going to have a proper quad core offering until sometime next year you've got some room to move on pricing thanks to your mature manufacturing process and realistically speaking even if no one buys it you're probably better off paper launching some limited edition nonsense rather than leaving your competitor completely alone at the top of the performance charts which is a strategy that AMD has employed more than once the issue though is that AMD didn't just paper launch it in November 2006 AMD released not one but an entire lineup of FX 70 series processors they were dual cores of course since they were fundamentally just re-badged opterons with boosted clock speeds but they marketed them as a quad core solution because they were only available to be purchased in pairs and only intended to work in this dual socket motherboard the l1n64 series from Asus and this board has actually pretty cool it uses a one-off version of nvidia's 680 series of chipsets which gives it some unique selling points over the server boards that operons normally relied on first up it had support for regular unbuffered ddr2 which could operate at higher speeds than ECC registered dims at the time second it had much more consumer slash workstation oriented i o I mean look at this thing tons of USB got your e-sata you got your optical audio out I guess a lot of people use that 12 SATA ports though my goodness and finally it had support for multi-gpu SLI technology this is actually where our second curiosity today comes in remember how referred to quad FX as 4x4 earlier well that was one of the earlier code names and it referred to the platform's ability to run four cores and four gpus at once the name ultimately died presumably when Nvidia limited SLI to only two of the slots on the motherboard but the capability actually remains if you use two dual GPU cards mate the Asus Mars GTX 760 an unfathomably stupid product that actually came quite a bit later but just felt like an appropriate pairing for this thing we'll get into this in a bit more detail later on first I want to come back to quad effects the initial reviews ranged from optimistic that it could maybe hopefully please improve to downright scathing even outwardly mocking amd's stated intention of selling High volumes of this indefensible product but something that everyone agreed on at the time was that there could be an interesting upgrade path for users who were willing to invest in the platform once AMD started shipping true quad-core CPUs that could be slotted into this motherboard's LGA 1207 socket and that is exactly what we're going to be trying today the viewer who lent us his quad effects setup included a pair of opteron 2352 quad cores these didn't arrive until 2008 by which time both Asus and AMD had formally dropped support for the original quad but what they revised slash B version of the original board or with a clever hot bios flashing trick you could unlock the raw power of dual quad core processors operating at a staggering 2.1 gigahertz and all for the downright reasonable price of just 315.99 couldn't think of it that is pretty reasonable but I'll let you in a little secret the price says very little about amd's magnanimous nature and a lot about amd's Fortunes in the two years since this platform first hit the scene when they were hoping to get a thousand dollars per pair of dual cores fun fact by the way we've got the coolers on now you can see we actually had to 3D print apart for them which I then had to zip tie the bracket onto because the 3D printed thing didn't have a hook and that's not even the jankiest thing about this setup remember how I said that quad FX didn't need server Ram well these are opterons so they do so much for the slot and upgrade now we could have easily obtained a pair of fx74s on eBay including this delightful Factory sealed one but since I didn't feel like spending 600 on E-Waste not to mention even more on Dual Channel ddr2 ECC memory sorry I didn't do it not when I could spend the money on the new fleece-lined jacket from ltdstore.com it's a shirt it's a jacket it's both a couple more finishing touches like adding our second Mars 760. honestly just can't believe people bought either of these things like literally anyone I remember I was working sales at the time and on more than one occasion I saw orders come in for Quad effects and I actually checked the invoice called them I got on the phone with these people and I tried to sell them something different something faster and cheaper but some of them were just such pathetic fanboys but I just couldn't do anything to help them I also can't believe I hired one of them that's right there is someone who works here whose judgment is so impaired that they actually bought a quad effects in all seriousness though Gary from the lab is a tinkerer and he goes out of his way to subject himself to early adopter pain for the learning opportunities that's why he actually daily is an arc GPU as well I question his masochism but I do admire his moxie anywho time to fire up this mess oh wait no it isn't we're gonna need some power connectors imagine having the 24-pin ATX power connector there and that not being the worst thing about your platform I mean I make fun of it now but at the time I'd have given just about anything for one of these I mean not just about not a thousand dollars less than that oh it's alive full disclosure I'm not 100 sure if this is gonna boot up right now um Gary and Tim from the lab spent basically an entire day getting this thing operational they have forbidden me from touching anything in the Bios we also had a couple of bent pins in the CPU socket that Dan fixed and refused to install Windows XP so we swapped it to Windows 7 which I turn on oh also the onboard networking isn't working so we put in this pcie car oh I guess I should pluck a cable into it yes everything is working we're gonna follow a similar Playbook to last time so the first thing we're going to try and do is just an everyday oh uh uh no it is not 2001. one moment please oh wow as I was about to say the first thing we'll be doing is just generally trying to use the computer including playing back a YouTube video that took a long time to load uh we can search the right oh did you see the delay between me clicking that text box and it actually highlighting let's start with 1080p video shall we okay oh at least It upgraded to 720p but we were sucking back 400 watts before we've settled into 265 and I'm currently playing back 720p video okay what happens when I go to 1080p did it go up again oh my God 400 okay let's switch to 4K no no 4K playback season up on my CPU Chrome just Chrome I think it's time to move on to gaming Nvidia control panel uh is this supposed to happen sir screw it I'm playing no wait no wait no oh my God I mean tell me this though is the FPS as expected about 40 frames per second okay then I'm not gonna worry about oh my god oh wow that hitching though this thing's a piece why did you buy it because it was there my suspicion this card is actually defective let's go out to the control panel I do know how to configure things now because you know but you know you drop things awesome don't worry I can text him and we'll as he drops it okay fine we'll flip the cards I think that'll probably fix it uh this wasn't meant to be part of this video but hey it's a fun little lesson anyway you can have a graphics card that's just a little bit defective like say for example the memory is no longer capable of running at its stock clock speed with stability without corrupting the data and so what can happen is that GPU can still be performant right so you could hook it up in SLI and if it's not the output you can actually get a clean image and you can get some if not most of the performance scaling that you would get from two fully functional gpus but you won't really notice that the thing's broken unless you have the display hooked up to that one unless it's running as the primary GPU I've seen it a handful of times hey oh no green it could have been right hey it's running on high though I have no sound but I can do the sounds myself medic get on the point it's a really rare platform so most people don't have any context for it right but guys it's it's really really slow like in games this thing was like half the performance of a Core 2 Duo yes oh oh it has its moments oh remember guys SLI was bad enough for NVIDIA to just unceremoniously discontinue it quad SLI and the problems exacerbated by running a more demanding game which by modern standards Team Fortress 2 obviously isn't but for the setup it certainly is okay this is pretty bad I don't even think I'm gonna bother with shadow of the Tomb Raider but this is a CPU from 15 years ago with a small army of gpus from 10 years ago and it was worse before Labs managed to hack together the Nvidia and the Asus drivers for these gpus which took us from a screen Terry 60 hertz Mass to the relatively smooth operation that you just saw with all of that said there are some things that are clearly holding us back and a big one is these awful Mars gpus what a weird product I mean on the surface again it kind of made sense Asus recognized that buying two mid-range gpus and running them in SLI sometimes was more cost effective than buying a single high-end GPU but then they did the whole thing wrong 760s had only two gigs of vram meaning that these four gpus in the quad SLI configuration had 66 percent as much effective frame buffer as a single 780. making matters worse the combined card just the individual card never mind four gpus cost more than a single 780 and also cost more than two regular 760s which you could equally just run an SLI if you really wanted to I think you were there did anyone at Asus think of that what do you mean convenience you know one card it's easy oh shut up you never believed that the only use case that I could imagine for this thing is if you could run SLI in a non-sli board but then of course Nvidia didn't allow that making the Mars the kind of thing where you just go how did this ever make it out of the r d lab but nobody bought these in fact I think they were even a limited edition product so where would you be right now if you had actually purchased a quad effect setup and we're still running it to this day but with a more modern card we're going to throw an RTX 3060 on here and find out just that thing what is this pcie Gen 2 no I I think it is Gen 2 I think it's gen one theoretically it's still backwards before it's compatible look at this mouse go or rather look at it and not go look at it skip oh hey we're back uh oh why would RTX 30 series be supported in Windows 7. wait that was a Windows 7 driver there totally is a Windows 7 driver it just didn't work at all it doesn't really matter the point is the performance would suck these are dual quad core CPUs and modern games do benefit from higher core counts but their core architecture lagged behind the competition even at launch and it hasn't aged well also these are clocked a whopping 30 slower than the FX dual cores that came two years prior that is a huge problem especially in games at the time which heavily relied on single core performance imagine getting an upgrade path that is worse than nothing congrats AMD you invented Metapod and that is what makes this the worst consumer CPU platform of all time I mean if it was cheap and cheerful and had a great upgrade path I'd be willing to entertain what Pentium D maybe Prescott something in the Rambis era for that Crown but quad FX made a sucker out of everyone who bought one and then AMD promptly rewarded their most loyal fans by offering them a joke of an upgrade path so goodbye quadfather it's been an experience just like you should experience our sponsor backblaze backblaze has an easy to use cloud backup solution
