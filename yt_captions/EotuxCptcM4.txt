hello everyone and welcome we are sitting inside of the volkswagen id4 and i'll tell you something i like electric cars i really like the volkswagen eagle so i was excited to try out this volkswagen id4 250 miles of range rear-wheel drive 200 horsepower sounds like a good thing to me and so my plan with this video was to show that you don't have to have a tesla to go on a road trip and drive across america uh you know it is no longer the case that only teslas can do it that was my plan for the video uh but i was a bit disappointed with what i found out once i started actually trying this thing out for long range driving and so that's what we're going to get into in this video and some of the problems that i see with this car and many of them i think can be fixed with updates so you know the the potential outlook is good i just don't think it's quite ready yet so let me give you a little background on driving across america in an electric car now you can do it in a vehicle that isn't a tesla because there is a network called electrify america so there was a little bit of a scandal with some diesel emissions that involved a company called volkswagen you may have heard about this and part of their agreement with the us is that they would invest 2 billion in electric vehicle infrastructure and education programs because of this diesel emissions scandal and so volkswagen created electrify america which is a fantastic fast charging electric network of chargers across the u.s so you can get from pretty much any point to any other point now there's a couple states that don't yet have access but most states are covered tesla's is currently a bit better coverage um but you know this thing's expanding and it's getting pretty good and you can't actually drive across the country in a non-tesla vehicle which is exciting right i am a strong believer in that if you're going to convince people to try something different like an electric car it needs to be better there have to be advantages there's there's got to be reasons to move forward and choose this newer technology that are advantages over what you're currently using so i believe it needs to be better and also it's a good idea from a design standpoint to have as few opportunities as possible for people to make mistakes so let's talk about charging when you pull up to one of these electrify america networks you know if you're in a tesla and you pull up to a tesla supercharger you plug in your car and it starts charging you press a button on the charger it opens your charge port you plug it in it starts charging your car there's not many steps there and because there's not many steps and because the steps are simple there's not a lot of opportunity for mistakes now here's what happened when i go to an electrify america network in this volkswagen and keep in mind the ford mustang machi you can pull up to this electrify america network plug in and it'll start charging once again just as simple as using a tesla very easy process you just plug it in and it starts charging well what happens when you take a volkswagen id4 and plug it into the network that they created now yes electrify america is for all electric vehicles even teslas could use it if you use an adapter any electric vehicle can use this network uh but it was created by volkswagen it was funded by volkswagen you would think pulling up in a volkswagen and starting to charge it would be a very simple process right so you pull up you plug in the charger then you open the app on your phone you go to electrify america you find your charger on the map so you select your charging location once you've selected your charging location you select your individual charger now there can be multiple cords on each charger so in this one there was two cords on each charger you have to select your individual cord and then from that you swipe across to say initiate start charging my vehicle so you can see that there's more steps there is it impossible no can anyone do it sure but is it complicated is it unnecessarily complicated yes and that's the thing if you're going to convince people that electric cars are a good thing in the future and something that you should try out you shouldn't make this very cumbersome tedious process for you to start charging when you're on a road trip now if you never use this vehicle on a road trip and you always do all your charging at home i think it's a pretty solid car still some things i'm not stoked on but i think it's a pretty solid car but once you get into these charging networks you start to see these flaws and to me it is absolutely mind-blowing that volkswagen created this charging network and a ford mustang machi works better on it than their own car that's crazy so i imagine in the future hopefully very soon they're going to update that process so these volkswagens are just plug and charge and there's no tedious nonsense behind the scenes but for the early adopters you know if you're it's your first time getting an electric car what's your experience going to be like that plays a big role and mine was not good so i pull up to the charger first time ever using an electrify america charger the thing says hey plug it in first so that's what i did i plugged it in first well an error happened and it said unplug and replug in the connector so i try to unplug it and it won't let me it won't let me pull it out so i'm wondering you know what's the deal i go in the car i look in i don't see any way of unlocking that charging port no idea how to unlock this thing well it turns out you have to hit the unlock button on the key fob even though the car was already unlocked to pull out the charger and then reinsert it and then i went through the process of the app and then i was able to start charging but again you know it's it's not a big deal if it happens like one time but if it's that first time you're trying it out it's really going to turn some people off to this experience because it's so tedious and it doesn't need to be tesla has been doing this since basically 2012 they've had a better solution very simple solution you plug it in it starts charging ford's doing it on this network right now and yet this vehicle can't do it so that's frustrating the second time i went to the charger again there's two charging cables on each charger i selected the wrong one so it gave me an error message on my phone had to select the correct one so small little things where it's just allowing for opportunities for you to make mistakes when it doesn't need to there doesn't need to be that opportunity for you to make mistakes it should just work especially when it's the network that volkswagen created also worth mentioning while i was there the second time charging a volkswagen e-golf showed up trying to charge their vehicle couldn't get it to work looked at a second charger couldn't get that to work and then left so that is just not acceptable you can't have people show up to a charger after you're on this road trip you've got a small amount of range left and then it doesn't work okay so my first problem is no plug-in charge the second thing of course if you're on an electric road trip you're going to need to stop at chargers so let me show you how the navigation system here works and we're just going to say that we're going to drive to los angeles so we say great we like this route please drive to the root zone your route has multiple necessary charging stops okay and it says we have charging stops right which makes sense very nice that it puts in the charging stops for you so you don't have to really think about hey where do i need to stop well hold on just a second so let's click and see what chargers it shows so look at this our first stop it has us stopping at a 7.2 kilowatt charger now this vehicle is capable of 125 kilowatts and the electrify america network volkswagen's created network is 150 kilowatts up to 350 in some locations and yet it doesn't give us any electrify america choices as our first stops and the first one it's telling us to charge for 10 hours the second one an hour and 30 minutes because it's only a 50 kilowatt charger the third one another hour and 30 minutes stop so it doesn't intelligently choose which chargers to use and if you wait long enough it'll actually start updating this but for me it updated twice and it got better each time but the second time it was still showing a 30 kilowatt and a 50 kilowatt and it never showed me electrify america and the unfortunate thing is the electrify american network does exist on that path so i can look right here on my phone and see that that path is covered by electrify america and these are faster chargers and yet the navigation on the system doesn't automatically route you to volkswagen's created network now yes this probably will be updated in the future and i hope it is but it's very frustrating because if you're to get in this car and say okay i'm just going to let it tell me what to do and then you show up to a 7.2 kilowatt charger that tells you to wait for 10 hours you're going to lose your mind now are there third-party apps that can help you do this and guide you to the rect charging locations yes absolutely i still think it should be built in within the functionality of the vehicle to use its own created network another thing i wish this had was one pedal driving so you can select between a normal drive mode and a regen brake mode where in the normal drive mode if you let off the gas pedal it just coasts and then in b mode it will actually have regen when you let off the throttle pedal or the accelerator pedal has a little play button on it pause button on the brake pedal i think that's a nice touch but they don't have one pedal driving and this isn't something you know that's rare in the electric car world the ford mustang machi has it nissan leaf has it chevy bolt has it which works really well in the chevy bolt uh tesla has it one pedal driving is a very natural thing for electric cars inching forward when you're not on the throttle or on the accelerator pedal i'm going to keep calling it throttle regardless when you're not on that accelerator pedal accelerating forward slightly creeping forward that's what torque converters do but clutch based cvts don't do that dual clutch transmissions don't do that manual transmissions don't do that electric cars don't do that so i don't know why we force this unnatural habit and we don't at least allow for the option of one pedal driving i think if the option is there for to creep forward great people if they're used to that can use that but for those that don't want this unnatural thing to occur uh allow for the option of one pedal driving to be there there's also a few interesting things with the controls so you have this you know steering column mounted uh drag gear selector so drive neutral reverse park uh on this little hidden shifter that rotates this knob that rotates behind the steering wheel the instructions for it you can't see because they're hidden behind the steering wheel the touch controls on the steering wheel they have this like haptic feedback but you know for cruise control or for volume adjustment it's a bit slow and it's a bit kind of clunky there is a nice volume slider below the infotainment system here which works nicely but the steering wheel control ones are a little weird also for cruise control it's like a light touch will give you plus or minus one mile per hour and a harder touch will give you plus or minus five miles per hour but getting that touch just right is a little finicky the rear windows use the same controls as the front windows for going up and down you just select whether or not you want the front or the rear windows for those controls and the thing is the button works just fine if you press and hold but if you do a light tap a quick tap even a hard tap it doesn't actually activate it so it's a bit finicky of a little button there and it's like why not just give me all four window controls in one spot instead of having this weird switch that is a little finicky it requires a press and hold in order to switch between the two and you can't put all of them down and up simultaneously another thing i wish they offered as you can see this is a nice shade of blue but this is not the base model and the base model does not offer blue as a color and in fact the only colors you can get with a base model are gray silver white and black and so it's a complete grayscale base model which is a bit of a bummer i feel like why not you know allow for the one person who wants it out there to have some color in their life allow them to choose a fun color but you get grayscale if you go with the bass option and if you go with the upgraded option uh you can get blue the one the one actual color choice you can get there uh being blue so it's not all bad news the charging speed is actually pretty decent it is limited to 125 kilowatts however i showed up to a charger at 10 battery and it's able to go from 10 percent to 80 percent uh in my case it did it in 35 minutes volkswagen says it'll go from 5 to 80 in 38 minutes these are very similar speeds to a tesla model 3 very similar to my car um i've measured my car going from 15 to 65 percent so 50 increase in charge in 21 minutes this vehicle did that exact same thing despite its lower charging speed of 125 i did it in just 22 minutes so real world charging speed actually pretty decent on this fairly similar to tesla just slightly slower from a driving standpoint it feels pretty normal pretty normal ev it doesn't have the punchiness of some electric cars it doesn't have that immediate response even though it's in sport mode right now it's a pretty quick response but there's a slight little you know ease into that throttle uh it is rear-wheel drive which is interesting and you know 200 horsepower but this thing weighs over 4 600 pounds so despite you know a decent amount of power it's not all that quick and it's not that this is something that needs to be all that quick but because it weighs so much steel body 4 600 pounds uh you know the the acceleration isn't quite what a lot of its competitive price range electric cars offer one thing i do think they have done a really nice job with is the blending of the brake pedal so as it goes from regen initially to the mechanical brakes if you get on the brake really hard you know you don't notice that transition so they've done a nice job blending that regen with the actual mechanical brakes another interesting benefit of this being rear-wheel drive is that that frees up that turning for those front wheels so you don't have those drive axles limiting your wheel rotations this actually has a really nice turning radius it's very surprising when you use it less than 34 feet for its total turning diameter another interesting thing just on that choice of rear-wheel drive you know having it be rear-wheel drive means the regen is only occurring of course on that rear axle and so whether it's snow or you know inclement weather you could have that rear end kind of want to step out because that's where the regen is occurring and so of course they've got good stability control they can correct that but it's an interesting choice for this to be an everyday you know kind of model driver a lot of volkswagens being front-wheel drive and this one coming standard rear-wheel drive and then if you do live in areas they get all kinds of snow and that sort of thing they are going to offer an all-wheel drive version of this also a nice perk is that they offer you three years of free charging on the electrify america network so three years of free charging fantastic and electrify america is actually slightly more expensive uh than tesla's supercharger network so it can be as a guest 43 cents per kilowatt hour which is fairly steep there's definitely examples of gas cars that could be cheaper than that and then if you're a member it's down to 31 cents per kilowatt hour plus a four dollar monthly fee and if you charge at least once a month you'll make up uh you know that four dollar monthly fee so to summarize i think there is certainly potential here and future updates can fix several issues but here's where we currently sit the good news is it's smooth quiet and has quick torque delivery all thanks to being an electric car the charging speed in real world testing is very close to the tesla model 3. cargo capacity is solid with a tailgate that isn't overly aerodynamic and thus provides a more boxy space the car also has a fantastic turning radius partly thanks to being rear-wheel drive and overall the interior is spacious and offers nice storage features unfortunately there's a healthy number of drawbacks as well currently there's no plug and charge and the navigation won't automatically seek out electrify america chargers volkswagen says they will provide an update to fix this later in 2021 but for about the first six months the car is sold it will be behind on the functionality even the mach e offers on the same charging network the id4 is also quite heavy as tested weighing in at 4 65 pounds even though it's rear-wheel drive only this is about 200 pounds heavier than the tesla model y yet the model y has all-wheel drive more range and is significantly more powerful the weight is apparent in the driving dynamics which are fine for a crossover but there is a bit of side to side oscillation with quick steering inputs there's no heat pump there's also no front trunk like the mach e and model y offer there's no one pedal driving and finally we get to the price which with incentives is fairly decent in the range of thirty three thousand dollars but with the all-wheel drive id4 variant starting in the mid forty five thousand dollar price range you fall into machi and model wide territory which again offer numerous advantages so i'm happy to see additional competition in this space and i've enjoyed testing out volkswagen's latest electric car but for now it seems to fall a little short thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave
