ladies and gentlemen welcome to one of the most fun chess events of the entire calendar year the world rapid and Blitz chess championships these are two of the three most recognized titles in the chess game uh the first one being of course the classical World Championship Magnus Carlson is the current reigning defending champion of rapid and Blitz chess this is a tournament back-to-back tournaments rather that usually happen right after Christmas every single year in a random location around the globe this year the location was announced about I don't know a month and a half ago and it's in Samar usbekistan so actually a very beautiful city very beautiful very historical City and um this is day number one I'm going to take you through some very exciting games we're going to follow we're going to see the story of Magnus and other players but day one just finished and we already have chess drama I was about to sit down and record a video and then I saw this I was on social media Yan she tweeted dear feed chess and organizers of the championship as known all animals are equal but some are more equal than others very wise by the way is it fair to provide Magnus Carlson a personal Lounge where he can rest and prepare for the game using a laptop while nobody else has such an opportunity this this is a very interesting question so the way the layout of the tournament is I think all the players come down from the hotel or whatever to the area and they can't like leave between games to go on their computers and prepare I think I've never been to one of these but it sounds like they give Magnus Carlson a personal Lounge because he's the most famous player he has to do the most media he gets swarmed for the most interviews so since 2016 um he's had his own Lounge where he can hang out he can rest he can refuel you can even argue that's not fair but like look life's not really fair like if you're the greatest of all time and you're also the biggest media draw you get certain perks the most interesting thing about that point is the laptop so if like no other player is allowed an electronic device to research stuff between games not during games that that's a pretty harsh accusation I mean it's not really an accusation if it's reality but Fabiano Carana also retweeted that and said all players should play Under equal conditions so very interesting very interesting situation I don't necessarily disagree that the most famous and successful maybe Hikaru and yomi like some of these Fabiano could get their own private room so they don't get swarmed by fans that's okay this is where so we already have drama I don't even know I'm I'm eating the popcorn and I'm going to take you through the games today Magnus Carlson uh arrived to his game uh nearly 3 minutes late so we already have a good start we have um and he actually said they don't tell them when the round start oh amazing we got a tournament where you got to play five games a day and they don't tell you they don't tell you what when the I and amazing I really hope you all had a Merry Christmas uh Christmas is now over but the holiday sale continues if you want to get one of the courses 40% off get a New Year's resolution learn a new opening change your life so Magnus was playing uh tigran petran from um from Armenia and um E4 G6 you'll notice that Magnus is down two and a half minutes on the clock already the time format of the world rapid Championship is 15 minute with 10sec bonus time tigr plays his beloved modern defense he plays this against everybody Magnus plays in a very solid way so he doesn't play in a very provocative way he doesn't play like Knight C3 F4 or H4 plays very positionally very solidly and um basically you know it's a completely equal position black is able to play for a quick E5 which is what he does and then Magnus kind of turns it more into a king's Indian now it's a Kings Indian because white has these pawns developed it would only be a King's Pawn if these pawns were developed but Magnus kind of crawls forward and now uh this move F5 which is sort of the entire purpose of the black position he will play H6 maybe to stop Knight G5 he'll play Knight F6 castle and start an attack on White's position over here Magnus plays Knight C3 and immediately plays Knight G5 very interesting move um I think he's trying to induce H6 um and then I don't know would he continue like would he put the pawn there the pawn is not really capturable because white has tricks like Knight D5 like he would play Pawn takes Pawn takes then maybe Knight D5 and you can't take because then you get forked and you can't take twice because I have like Queen H5 check and Bishop takes Pawn so that that's sort of the idea so Magnus plays Knight G5 and and petan just kind of like lets him have the Knight there and now Magnus plays Queen B3 you'll notice he's down four minutes I mean he's just down he arrived late down four minutes on the clock that's what happens King h8 F4 uh Rook C1 C5 Queen A3 and now the Knight has been kicked out and Magnus does in fact justify his move and he and he plows directly into the position Bishop takes Pawn takes and then petan plays this interesting move F3 so he doesn't wait he doesn't wait for Magnus to build up a fortress petan knocks on the door says Magnus you can have the pawn but it's going to cost you the opening of your king Magnus says no thank you now petan would like to get this is this okay Magnus would like to not get mated so Magnus plays Rook E1 to cover the light squares with Bishop F1 very Nifty defensive move and actually Magnus is down upon PA he's down upon Pawn but he now goes and attacks petan's Queen side and now he has a Time Advantage so we have G5 petan trying to attack Magnus we have takes takes and basically Magnus is saying look tigran um you're attacking nothing you have no attack over here and soon your luck is going to run out and and now this is really bad this is really bad for black basically chigan just didn't know what to do and I mean who can really blame the guy he he poured all of his investment into this side of the board and he's hit a wall and now now there's a full wall built up pan tries to go here and Magnus is just arriving with the Bishops he grabs a pawn once he grabs that pawn position is going to fall apart Magnus goes from being down four minutes to up eight and a half that is Gangster Behavior this is a Norwegian Viking Chad Sigma a gangster man all right Bishop F that that was me appealing to the young audience you know there's a very common misconception about this channel like because I'm loud and I'm theatrical like the people who try to criticize this channel like he appeals to an average audience of 12 years old and I'm 77 and I don't like that I if you're actually 77 you do like the channel I I'm not trying to be aist um but that's actually not true the average commenter is younger but actually the average viewer of this channel is like in their 20s so yeah how's that for science yeah take that Rook B5 and you know tigon is trying to like sack a knight and Magnus is like I'm good it's just no attack and Magnus picks up all the pawns pushes The Rook to C7 there's going to be a trade and he's going to promote and he wins the game with a 6 and a half minute time Advantage very very convincing game which he gave a little bit of odds early it wouldn't be a world rapid Championship or a B Blitz unless Magnus showed a plate it just wouldn't even though apparently this time it was not his fault last time he was skiing now we have other players that are leading the event that had very good first days uh I'm not going to tell you who is who we have matlakov from Russia and we have arigi actually arjin Ari is in a very interesting situation if arjin ERI wins the world Blitz wins it World rapid he overtakes gukesh in the fiday circuit I made a video recently about the chess drama of who's going to qualify to the candidates if you have no idea what I'm talking about don't worry about it but if if everyy wins this event he actually can maybe make the candidates which is kind of insane I don't know how you can win a rapid event but then make it to the C I don't know it doesn't make sense not F does whatever they want okay Knight D5 you'll notice that arayi took a pawn that's the Catalan this is the open Catalan white is going to try to play on this diagonal win the pawn back and then every I he gives a check and then he says you know what you just can't have my Pawn you just can't have my Pawn now the way you exploit this with white is you try to be aggressive all right you basically say look black is a bozo he's hanging on to the the pawn but what I get for that pawn is an attack I have H4 I have the Knight I got the queen I got all of this and and matlakov plays Knight to G6 which is a very very very sexy move the idea of Knight to G6 is that if you eat the horse it's a trojan horse and and I just mate you like you literally can't stop I mean you can all right can't stop D to the like you know you're going to lose a lot of material on the way and then and and then I have a pass Pawn okay Knight G6 Rook F7 and suddenly matlakov starts like dancing around a c a different way he puts the Knight on E6 and then he puts the Knight on C that Knight has seen the world man that Knight is a medallion member on Delta Airlines please sponsor our Channel Bishop C6 he keeps attacking he is bringing all of the pieces to the party Eric GE is trying to trade everyy knows that if he can remove some pieces from the attack and the attack does in fact get gets a little bit lighter now D5 removing space queen C5 check King H2 and at some point aragi goes wait a minute who's attacking who cuz there is no more there's no more threats and I still have my pawns instant replay on the fourth move of the game he took a pawn now normally that pawn is one back by white all right uh that was me responding to my editor the video didn't just freeze as I'm making this video I'm also making a YouTube short of Magnus coming late to the game you're getting a little insight into my life here uh my recovery on my whoop today was only 60% so there you go uh I was recommended to get a whoop I've tried everything I've tried whoop Fitbit Apple watch I'm currently on a in a whoop phas I just like that it tells me that I don't sleep well uh I have a very high sleep percentage like 95% but my recovery is low it's probably because I'm stressed anyway he took all his pawns and then at some point he was like wait a minute I have pawns I got pawns you know I am Groot like I got pawns I got pawns I got pawns like he's just pushing all his pawns all right d takes C6 on P here comes the Knight to C4 attacking the Rooks he loses one of the pawns and now we have a queen trade but every guy sees the Pawn's getting to B2 it's getting to B2 and you can't stop the queen but that Rook is going to hang what is going on in this game by the was one of the most insane games I've ever seen rookie one now is required apparently rookie one and the game is equal but it's rapid you got to make Split Second decisions he sacrifices The Rook because he's going to lose both of his but make his own Queen that's exactly what happens Rook G7 check Bishop d8 you're just not fast enough Knight F1 check and matlakov resigns because he's got no mate he just doesn't have a Checkmate King H3 Queen E1 R and you just not fast enough all these beautiful pieces just not fast enough every guys he had a great day he got four and a half points so he's in first place on the first day of the tournament now let's take a look women's side of things is wild so the men uh technically the open they play 13 Rounds okay um I don't actually know if there is a woman playing in the open section but that's a conversation for another video on another topic on another day uh but there's a women section they're playing 11 rounds uh and uh there were some wild games this round including by the 13-year-old Prodigy Meo Yu from China and 10-year-old FAO Oro from Argentina so we got Prodigy watch then we'll go back to Magnus and then we're going to end with one of the most ridiculous Queen sacrifices I have ever seen so we're in good hands it's going to be a good recap maybe there will be a commercial break right now I don't know maybe will there be I who knows E4 C5 this is uh board uh one this is the last round of the day on the women's section Batu yag mul uh versus zjo from China we have a Sicilian Defense this is the Rouser variation it's a very complicated system black is trying to attack white as you can see and white is trying to say you know what let's trade the Queens hey let's trade the Queens no queens I can't get M pretty good rule of thumb takes takes Bishop C6 and the worst nightmare for a Sicilian Defense player is not to be able to attack people play the Sicilian Defense cuz they want to fight they're like hockey players on teams that are not very good but they're like very you know like they're very physical they're the enforcer you know you don't mess with them when they're on the ice they get in a fight they you know so when you take a Sicilian Defense player out of a fight they really don't like that ba now you got this weird positional game nobody's checkmating anybody but when you're when you're a sicilian player all you try to do is Checkmate so Bishop E7 it's just a matter of time J Jer is going to like double up the Rook she's going to play a3s Just meanwhile White's like o Free Pawn like No Cap as the kids say it's just no cap that's just yep you know Gap rler like that Bishop takes F7 Rook C8 Knight D5 she's trading the pieces she's like I have more pawns so I'm going to play Bishop E6 and I'm going to be in good shape black can't really do anything to me white is just the pawn up black is still trying to create threats see bringing the Knight White's just being patient Rock Solid and at some point you start realizing with white like maybe I just got to go for it with my Pawns all right maybe not Knight E4 Rook E4 we're going to an end game oh we're not we're not going to an end game Rook E4 would have been a way to suffer but Jer just tries and all of a sudden jiner is like busted here right B4 on the board she's going to lose something this is pinned so she has to sacrifice her Rook okay King A2 Rook B4 is this a winnable end game well if anybody's going to win this end game it's going to be white black can't win this end game because white has too many pawns this Pawn's not going to Queen you'll always be able to sneak The Rook back there pressure the pawn pressure this get the king leg to C4 and then slowly make progress and that's what white does white has a major time advantage and actually I think is winning here with a technique to get the Rook to F5 so for example Rook D7 it's very difficult for black to make a move let's say black wastes time um like King B3 something like this and then you you might be able to stall and zigzag your way here let's say uh if the bishop ever goes to F2 you can always play Rook E6 if King f8 you have Rook H7 that might a way to win but white doesn't white doesn't do that white doesn't zigzag and instead gets into a drawn end game okay it's a draw it's a draw white just needs to get back and stop the pawn and wait a minute who whoa whoa what's happening oh oh no this is the legendary boot this is like when when the police put a put a boot on the car cuz they didn't pay their parking tickets oh no no it's over the Rook is in jail The Rook is in jail the king is approaching and Dreer wins cuz white is stuck white just can't move any pieces white can't move any pieces a crazy back and forth game Dreer had a perfect day one she went 4-0 you know who else had a ridiculous day one it's Prodigy watch time leting versus meiu meoi is 13 years of age she's like 2300 222300 she drew the women's world champion in round one round one you sit down your opponent is J and June she Drew her now she's playing leting the person that was playing against J and June for the world championship they play uh Petro she plays D4 it's one of the lines de now black plays the sideline Queen D7 I've never seen Queen D7 never in my life I have never seen Queen D7 so clearly I don't know something and now Mei plays E6 she just gives away a pawn gives full just doubling her opponent's pawns and then she just goes for a position where black just has these really ugly doubled pawns and black just kind of has to play defense and Rook G8 oh my goodness a lot of time being spent Rook G8 I mean it makes sense because you're trying to kind of break out A4 B4 she brings the bishop right back she's being annoying the best way to win a chess game is to annoy your opponent to death castles black is just a little bit behind and development she's trying to trade pieces all right now white plays Bishop takes Pawn takes and you're just you're a moment away you're you're so close because black is just stuck on that back rank she takes because it's a forcing move now black has 40 seconds F3 how does black defend herself F3 the position is falling apart you go that way the king is Airy and you physically can't go that way because you already moved the Rook she goes like this but now take take is there something here Rook C4 she's defending she's threatening this she's going to double up maybe Queen G4 maybe B4 oh my God plethora of possibilities but Bishop A5 Rook F6 white is winning she's winning she's beating the Challenger oh my God Queen D5 B4 up the bishop is trapped she completely trapped the bishop Rook f8 she trades and she just takes the bishop 13-year-old Superstar she just drew the women's world champion and she is beating the the woman who challenged her she trades The Rook she brings the pish P white is completely winning she just to make sure she doesn't blunder a Perpetual check or a queen king F7 Queen D1 H4 and she just centralizes and now she's just going to try get a queen trade and she gets it immediately and she's completely winning it's over it's over there's no way black can play like G5 for example but it's just a matter of time and that's it black can't make any progress with any pawns and resigns meoi finished the day with two and a half I think she lost in the last round but she draws the Women's World Champ and beats her Challenger that's as a 13-year-old that is uh that is amazing we have another Superstar to watch falino Oro this this kid is 10 I just played him in a match it was a it was a I I lost by I lost in overtime I think it was 11 and a half 10 and a half he's really really good he's clearly IM level or maybe he's GM level and because I played such a close match with him I'm GM level two that's what I'm going to tell myself he made a couple of draws in day one but then he had another game where he played rudik Maran who's a 2500 level IM who's I think like 20 uh from Russia he played this line B5 very provocative line not going to bother you with the theory black gives away the B Pawn tries to hang on to this white has multiple approaches here uh and black just says no you can't have my Pawn black fights on the light squares in the center it's a very equal position you see both players spending very limited amount of time because they obviously know the theory and now white threatens mate foso doesn't get mated H4 so the young man is under attack he's 10 years of age okay he's 10 and he's playing against a very experienced like 20-year-old I think rudik Bishop C4 Knight takes Rook takes Queen B8 Queen B8 trying to Target White's Center trying to Target White's file over here white takes on D5 and now they get into a tactical Skirmish Queen E5 check the Knight blocks Rook C8 the bishop is completely hanging but Bishop F2 wins a queen so he gets out of the way but now Bishop A6 how's why going to Castle how's why going to he can't Castle through a check the only way now is to take a deep breath realize your fine and play H5 just go for it but clearly rudig did not like the position so he offers a queen trade he offers a trade of queens and he forgets that 10-year-olds are tactical snipers and in this position fatino Oro sacrifices the Queen Bishop to what a move Bishop B4 leaves the queen completely hanging it also hangs the bishop but it opens the door and he justifies the bishop preventing the king escaping off the back rank this is a gangster move Bishop to B4 you can't take the queen because this is literally made in one move you can't take the bishop but you have to because Rook C1 you say what's the big deal Rook D1 I'm safe no you're not your king walks into a check and the only way to defend yourself is to put the knight in front and he and he well I spoiled it but he was obviously completely winning I'm not going to restart the video because of that although I hate when I do that I'm pressing the right arrow key and then I press down well the Knight has to block the rook and he just attacks the man imagine getting attacked by a 10-year-old how many 10-year-olds would it take to physically beat up rudik Maran it only takes one in chess Queen C3 Queen G2 he's picking off the pawns one by one he picks off all the pawns rudik tries to play H5 but it's too little too late and at this point he could even go to an end game all end games are winning it takes slightly over 40 moves but falo hunts and hunts and hunts Rook D2 picks up the Knight what a game what a game winning with the black pieces against against a super experienced player with Bishop B4 is nasty he sacked the queen and a bishop in one move what an absolutely amazing win for him uh we go back to Magnus Magnus was in uh in good form on day one and then like I told you I'm going to cover some other games hey if you see games that are really good and I haven't made a recap yet like if tomorrow round 678 Etc there's good games put them in the comments of this video all right I'm going to check them be like Yo God day two you got to cover this this I'm trying to cover big names and and big matches like if you have a favorite Grandmaster but your favorite Grandmasters like two out of six sucks for you because I'm not going to cover that unless he's Hans nean like if Hans nean is you know then then then yeah I will cover it because it's the biggest name in the sport one of the biggest names right now so oh I'm not showing you this game yet no spoilers param maklu Magnus Carlson this was a very fun game it was this line now Bishop E7 Queen's Gambit declined very traditional line very traditional boring stuff uh Magnus actually had this a lot when he played white in the world championship against Fabiano Carana Knight C6 this has all been played many many times Rook E8 and now Magnus plays E5 and D4 very very very well-known line white plays Knight to D5 putting pressure on the pin Knight black backs up Bishop F6 Bishop D3 all of this has been played many many times before because you see Magnus is not spending any time now Magnus spends four minutes Magnus spends four minutes here because he goes this position is really hard to win like you can't play the Queen's Gambit decline with black you can't play any top level opening in chess with black and try to get a win unless your opponent gets kicked in the head by a donkey or you take risk so he plays Bishop F5 he takes a strategic risk he opens up his King a little bit all right now parhan play takes like this trying to mess up magnus's Pawn structure Magnus say no not yet Queen C3 and now something very interesting Rook D2 something happens here param makes a very big inaccuracy param did not want to open up his King so instead he keeps the tension and now he has to open up his King cuz if he castles he hangs his Queen so he goes here to set up castles oops oops now you can't castle at all because Knight F3 and you can't take like this cuz your your Rook is going to hang you can't take like this cuz it's illegal so suddenly bam has to play King a you got to play King F1 that's really ugly four and Magnus is taking over baram has made a big inaccuracy and Magnus is just cooking he's cooking he's got 30 seconds versus 6 minutes Rook C4 he's up a pawn now Queen E6 is a fascinating move he has a big Advantage he should keep the Queens on Magnus gave an interview to chess base India afterward he said he traded the queen a because he wasn't feeling particularly sharp and he wanted to just win a a quick end game so he started marching param down it's over uh he locks in the king the pawns will score away from queening but all of a sudden wait a a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Rook e 3 wins Rook e 3 Knight F4 Knight F3 is lights out that completely good night Magnus doesn't find that he goes Rook C3 loses a pawn goes for the promotion and we have an end game where after everything we have this position and this is a draw like stockfish draws this I think with white against any human in fact what ends up happening in this game is the players make one final pawn move F5 okay one one uh excuse me not F5 uh one final pawn move a little bit later let me see F4 and G3 so now there are going to be no captures and there are going to be no Pawn advancements and if that happens for 50 moves it's a draw so basically Magnus is going to try to hunt the Knight he's going to try to hunt the Knight he's going to try to get in with his King to check the king away and win the pawn that's the only way so watch as this game goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and he's just jumping around with the Knight and jumping and jumping and jumping and Magnus is trying to find a way in and he's trying to be tricky but there's absolutely no way to be tricky and they both have very limited time uh-oh what happened Rook A7 and now Knight D6 is a big mistake it's a big mistake Magnus tricked him param should have just kept going where he was but Pam was like o wait a minute I'm going to go after the pawn Rook D7 you can't take the pawn because now your knight is trapped you have to go here which allows this and this and that is the that is what you were trying to avoid you're trying to avoid getting oh my goodness parham's Knight is now trapped it is completely uhoh oh it's like literally trapped it's actually literally completely stuck and and he gets his Knight trapped on the edge of the board and here he tried to claim 5050 moves he didn't try to claim he asked for how many moves were made this is move 86 the last pawn move of this game was made on move 47 so it took 39 moves it was 40 moves that they played like this param could have survived 10 more moves and it would have been a draw in fact if this was the 50th move already he could have made a draw he could have just said well we made 50 moves with no you know do you understand 50 moves no Pawn captures and no Pawn advancements no no no captures period and no Pawn advancements uh but uh yeah Magnus win not you know not the prettiest game but a funny game and he ends the day with four and a half and now we have cherina versus Ricard report a very very exciting match up two very very interesting players with a very interesting line D3 this is like the meta right now at the highest level against the carocon it's kind of cancerous Queen C7 we have takes and from the early opening we get a position that I've never seen in my life very Bishop F3 gives up the bishop Rock Solid though Bishop D6 and then here report says H6 G5 uh-oh that's very unpleasant H6 G5 Rook G8 uhoh uhoh uhoh uh oh the king's going that way and there's a major attack brewing and white is down four minutes white is actually down nearly five and a half minutes now Bishop D4 and right now the best move for a report with this Knight hanging is to danger levels put the Knight right there you're cooking up some good stuff you're also cooking stuff that way to bring in the queen oh that's really uncomfortable H5 always anchors in the night you're castling in a move but for some reason report hesitates plays Rook G6 and now this and now if you try to play G4 guess what Dink and that's really bad because you're going to lose material you're just going to you're going to lose this it doesn't matter if you check may have King H1 or King F1 I think King F1 is better um Queen needs 2 Bishop E5 report still kind of going for it and now my man chov says hold up Queen Rook King on the other side Rook like this sacrifice the Knight to open the center what a move that is a crazy move the idea is just to open up the file look at this he takes the Knight he just gets a pawn he just gets a pawn and on Bishop takes D4 he lost a knight and a bishop right he lost a knight and a bishop and he just takes a pawn and the element of time is fascinating here black can run away but then I sneak in even closer and then I'm just winning now I'm just winning Rook D4 Bishop F7 it's a really really bad position what a crazy tactical sequence Knight D5 bulldozing straight down the middle this is what you got to think about when your opponent's king is on the opposite side and you're fully castled all the pieces Bishop D4 D E6 report says you know what you want my my Bishop Bishop takes F2 I clicked really emphatically but there was an alternative move that I just covered so Bishop takes F2 but this is losing this is losing because Queen F2 now I have 19 points of material barreling down DF I have this pointed at A7 I have this I have this I have this Knight C5 and now the game ends in style in this position Ivan chipino plays Pawn takes F7 just justifying his absolutely shredding open of the of the position King f8 and now he attacks The Rook The Rook gets defended and in this position chip plays a gorgeous final sequence first it wouldn't be a recap if we didn't see a sacrifice of The Rook Rook T8 the idea of rookie 8 is to disconnect The Rook from the f8 square and now you threaten a promotion and if you play ni 8 you block the f8 square I make a queen somehow I sneak in a second queen and I win Rook E8 is a crazy move but I don't understand what if the Rook just takes if the Rook just takes then you sacrifice the queen oh Queen takes F6 and whichever piece takes I promote to a knight it doesn't matter if you take this way or this way they [Music] both oh my God and if you T like this well then then I don't know I could just Queen h8 and then I take oh my goodness that is absolutely that is so Savage this man played rookie eight Merry Christmas rard report Ivan chiarina what a win and these are your standings after day number one it doesn't really matter cuz we've only played onethird of the tournament Magnus arigi the yui vidit guti four and a half out of five very big day for the Indians uh tomorrow we have vidit versus Carlson it doesn't matter we have so many games to go women's side we have Z junor and we have theil salova I did not cover any of sova's games not because I have a vendetta against her they just last her last couple of they were a lot of long end games and in the last round her opponent just blundered but if she plays like a really exceptional game I definitely will cover it she's 4-0 but like I said it doesn't matter cuz tomorrow everything's going to get shaken up World rapping in Blitz is well underway Magnus is arriving late to games people are tweeting about the organization and the unfair practice and treatment of players it's a beautiful end to the year and I will see you all for day number two now get out of here
