ladies and gentlemen today I'm going to be exploring a cave and I'm going to be taking all of you with me now that may confuse you because this is a chess Channel and every time you click on one of my videos we talk about Chess in some form or another now lucky for you that's exactly what I was talking about I will be taking you to the deep dark cave of 100 ELO chess the way this video will work is I spoke with chess.com and I set up a little account with a big Gotham chess profile picture and it's rated 150 ELO at rapid and Blitz anybody who I beat in today's video by accident because I'm not going to be trying is going to get their ELO back and anybody else will just get famous and take some points off of me now I I really enjoy this video concept because I saw a video by chess nuke some months ago and it was fun to see the blunders at that level but I gotta Tell You Folks the lowest bound of Chess is still really really good like here my first opponent is literally rated a hundred join three days ago wow let's see what we're gonna get I don't know I I have no idea what's down here opponent plays Pawn to E4 uh I guess I'm gonna copy because that's what 100s do uh plays Knight F3 um all right I guess I'll go Knight C6 all right four nights so far so good got absolutely no idea who we're going up against that like I said oh my God Bishop to B5 that's a very normal move I'm gonna go here uh developing you know like a good beginner would okay Queenie two defense the bishop let me Castle my king how is this person 100 this is literally the lowest ELO in chess and this person hasn't hung their Queen yet they've developed all of their pieces like normal I'm gonna ask them in the chat do you watch Gotham uh they took my knight uh I'm gonna take back like this because this opens up my queen and my Bishop so and I'm also waiting for a chat response I have wow Queen C4 this is crazy it's a good move it attacks my Bishop uh well let's let's see if they can follow up on that I'm attacking the queen do they even oh oh no no I I but I but okay all right damn that was such a confident move I mean I I thought they were okay well I was trying to set them up for success they they still can can go here they could still do this and again the oh now they disconnected oh oh no I didn't mean it I I can take it wait can I resign wait I'm gonna resign oh oh yes I resigned white one by Russ okay okay I gave them some points okay because I listen I just felt really bad that's not how I wanted to start today's video I I didn't want to make anybody Rage Quit um this person just started their career in chess wow okay and they ran into they ran into into Gotham chess 150 ELO that's very funny um what if I play a rapid game I mean I'm certainly someone's got to be there you know in in in in Rapid right um all right let's take a look who who do we have anybody in Rapid I'll take Blitz too anybody in Rapid or Blitz all right my friends I'm ready oh we're playing oh playing a 201 that's not what I wanted but I'll take it I am bad 300 okay no problem I'm also bad 300. um I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna copy so far so good we're both developing our Knights to the center all right what's this 201 gonna do now that's not a great move because you're not developing your Bishop I'm not saying you have to play the London but you don't want to block in your Bishop but I'm gonna copy because like he's really smart so you know Gotham chess 150 ELO B copying all right this is this is excellent stuff let's develop our Bishop the joke there is that that is hardly a development okay please don't take Bishop for night a lot of newbies do this they they just take because they can you shouldn't give up the bishop for the night unless you have a good reason now I should take with the bishop but I'm 150 I'm gonna ask this person do you watch Gotham chess we're going to be asking this to every opponent okay I I this is not a bad move it's bad for long term like push push you already move the pawn so you don't want to move a piece more than once in the opening uh unless it's like under attack right so my opponent should try to make some progress but there's nothing wrong with the move E4 um I'm gonna take because I can this is not a good move because now I've left myself with kind of a ruined structure uh let's play me attack horse again not a great move because I'm weakening my king a little bit I'm creating what's called a backwards Pawn a backwards pawns neighbors abandoned it and it can't move forward because every you know the square in front is controlled so I can capture this but again uh that that trade is maybe not not the best thing ever so I'm just gonna develop my knight I mean so far this 200 is playing exceptional level of Chess this is this is really good um this is a fine move castling developing the bishop sensei okay now is this person gonna gonna take both Bishops into both my Knights maybe they just hate Knights yeah they hate Knights I'm gonna develop oh well I took with the pawn last time now my opponent can make me lose my right to Castle which is reasonable and now my king will be a little bit in the center um this this put the Knight here Castle a lot of good moves for white let's see if the 201 I mean this person's username is I am bad and this is a oh my God they're not they're not bad at all will they see that I'm attacking their Pawn like I slid my Rook over now I I did lose this by the way the oh my God Rook takes Pawn do they see this what okay they didn't but now I can take this but I'm allowing a rook infiltration which is very very scary I I am definitely losing here but let's see if my opponent very reasonable move uh I'm gonna bring my king up to F7 now getting the knight in here would be would be lethal absolutely lethal by white and that's one of the only checks by the way because the other one loses the Knight if they spot this I'll be impressed maybe they were going to bring their Rook down this is excellent stuff here by the 200 rated player I mean my God maybe Rook E1 Rook B 95 just don't rush don't do anything crazy don't don't lose the pawn yeah eight minutes here to figure this out I mean I did you could find this move ah okay so the the rule of thumb for noobs is like eight times out of ten nine times out of ten in any given position going backwards is not the it's not the right move um now I'm gonna play uh uh will my opponent see that I'm attacking the Knight backwards by the way I've been ghosted twice I said do you watch Gotham chess and my opponents have not responded to me which is just really sad but maybe they're scared because I have Gotham chess in my name I don't know a rook B7 wow what a move what a move and now after take take the Rook is in here that's crazy that is crazy okay uh let's play Queen threatens mate now I'm not gonna do it it's just a test if my opponent hangs mate I I'm having too much fun great move oh my God great move now my queen is close to the king so traditionally you would think I have an attack I don't have any attack here I don't have any attack because on the one hand you can say oh the king is in danger he's not in any danger you gotta think can anybody actually help the queen no right now it's actually white who still has a big Advantage like white could jump the night out take the bishop and bring the queen bring the Knight over here bring the Rook I hope my opponent doesn't overreact I'm actually having a great time because truly like it from the bottom of my heart I I enjoy teaching people I I don't always want to roast and you know make jokes and all this uh my Bishop is hanging um will my opponent spot the night jump that they missed last time this is crazy like I don't even think I'm playing like a 150 and this dude is just crushing me like I don't think I've played that poorly this person is playing way above the level of 200. all right rookie one they're still not finding Knight E5 will they see that I'm attacking their Rook it's just a lot of like tactical little threats and as long as they're paying attention Okay that move is officially the beginner uh beginning of some blunders beginner uh beginning of some blunders I'm gonna take was that was that their idea or did they okay now I'm I'm gonna go here because it looks like I'm creating an attack I can open up the H file my plan is if my queen and Rook were connected I would be getting in so I'm pushing my opponent should bring their Queen that's the only piece they haven't touched they've moved the knights they've moved the bishop gotta avoid one movers here let's see can the 200 can I lose to a 200 ELO player all right D5 not not a crazy move I mean I don't exactly know what the follow-up is they have this and if I take they have a fork and they probably have more than a fork I feel like they're getting in if my opponent plays Knight D Knight takes D5 I'm gonna take I'm gonna take out of respect for the idea I mean a 200 spawning a night sacrifice to open up the king is uh deserving okay they sacked The Rook okay but what's the follow-up is the queen Coming is the queen gonna come in that is the question do they spot no why why are you losing all of your pieces if I take you you just it's not check anymore and I have mate now all right I'm gonna give you one oh did they see that the backwards night move come on backwards knight move Fork backwards knight move Fork backwards knight move Fork backwards knight move Fork come on do it do it do it do it do they see it it's this or this oh okay I'm gonna move my rook and attack the Knight they got it they gotta use the queen these I'm trying to get him to find the winning idea Queen D6 don't go Queen D5 I'm gonna lose my mind oh my goodness Queen to be one my opponent just doesn't have that killer instinct Rook uh d8 I want the open file but I hung my Rook does do they see always sees it instantly all right now I'm gonna run my king my opponent's gotta get in here with the queen but there's back rank problems okay Knight C6 so what I'm not afraid I'm attacking the night Bozo what are you gonna do you think I'm afraid of you Knight D5 so what like my my king is safe I wonder if I can force a draw you think I can get a stalemate what if what if I just like try my goal now is is that was made in one but I don't see that I wanna I wanna get a stalemate by force I don't know how I'm gonna do it I think I'm gonna get my king stalemated and and then that's still made by the way um how do we do this G5 I think I gotta get rid of all my pieces and then get stalemated I think my opponent just does not want to beat me I mean I'm doing everything I can get to my king use the knights use the queen back rank mate is still there it's it's been there for a minute I mean the game review is gonna look ridiculous on this one of course you should play rookie one in a game if you see it you you know you shouldn't mess around I've just I'm I'm trying to there we go Maiden won please Maiden one so close now there is no Maiden one if you go there it's King takes you go here it's a good move it's the best move this is still okay but uh now there's no mate by the way oh okay we're making progress oh oh I'm feeling a little bit squished luckily there's no mate okay come on knock me out I don't know how you're gonna do it Queen here how you gonna do it finish the game finish the game finish the game let's go Queen D5 go go go go go go go go go come on Boss you got it I believe in you I believe in you I believe you God and queen D5 Queen C8 bring something bring it down now you don't um now I I'm so close okay check and I'm gonna pre-move this because I want my pawns to no longer have any moves remember my goal is stalemate like if I that now that's made by the way that's made because the King has cut off all these different ways to spot checkmates my opponent should do some ah then Queen takes Pawn I mean it's it's a very dicey position with Kings this week you gotta give checks if my opponent goes here I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna allow oh my goodness just no no sense of urgency no sense of check and and I'm gonna go here all right and I'm I've I got I got ideas I got I got a lot of different I had made but I'm I'm trying to get my opponent that's not even a I don't know what to do you know what you know what I think I'm gonna force a draw if my opponent doesn't want to win I'm just gonna force a draw by Perpetual check here that's it to draw can't do anything check check check and we're gonna make a draw listen you don't want to win the game I don't want to win the game either all right I'm doing a YouTube video I'm I'm doing my best here all right it's gonna be a three move repetition of course I have a lot of different ladder mates [Music] 16 blunders according to just to come listen 200 level player playing like this is ridiculous I mean this person was really really good 200 this is what 200s are doing nowadays this person was like plus five I did not even play that poorly then they stopped the mate but what they refused to do in this game was use their Queen okay they made a couple blunders but and then the sacrificing but even here's something Like Queenie too I was gonna go here I was gonna hang a mate they just have to find Queen E6 and queen E8 double anchored by the Knight or like Knight D6 or something I mean listen that was uh the only reason my opponent uh did not did not have success in that game was because they didn't use their Queen the right way they just played a very passive Queen game and then you know they they hung a lot of mates but I'm not in the business of taking anybody's uh ELO so um all right let's play a three minute game again let's do a little faster one all right that's letter gibberish uh I'm gonna play Queen's Pawn this game I'm 126. let's play a London we learned this in a Gotham YouTube short okay mm-hmm [Music] that's what I did last game but again don't block your Bishops does my opponent see this beginners often have big blind spots in the center okay let's see how long we can leave this Pawn hanging here this is a very common be I mean right on cue all right which one is are they gonna take okay will they take this because they just did that that's got to be the next follow oh my goodness I got two pieces hanging here all right it's definitely gonna move his Knight her Knight their night black is gonna move this Knight for sure or maybe not maybe but like I told you beginners have a lot of blind spots in the opening okay Knight takes of course I should take with the bishop now will they see that our Queens oh okay very nice and what happens when I bring my queen out do they see that oh oh okay now we have to throw it do you watch Gotham chess all right I'm over two on getting a response to this question so I'm gonna give them a check now I'm gonna I'm gonna type the question I type the question I'm over two I haven't gotten a single it seems like I'm gonna be over three by the way they're not responding to me this is crazy by the way the queen can take will they see that or are they gonna cheat okay that's not what is this what if I attack the queen only thing I have going for me here don't give me a check don't give me a check the night's Gonna Take Ah they did not they didn't defend their Queen I that was the whole point of my move you know all right now do they see the bishop do they see that okay they do not you see it's a very common also beginner mistake I attacked the Knight but I could have taken it um just like last game I'm gonna follow up with a question mark man nobody's telling me if they've watched Gotham chess this is extremely sad I mean it's a little bit of an ego thing but you know all right I'm bringing my Rooks all right I'm trying to activate my Rooks what if I no they they move they gotta see that right um let's go night night night I'm gonna do it do they see that the pawn can take good move good move what can I say Rook takes now what I definitely should not do here is trade pieces okay a beginner usually will move a king out of check even though they don't have to do they see this while I attack the bishop crazy oh my goodness this 100 is cracked now they gotta mate me can they put me away can the 100 ELO put me away it's a fork do they see this or are they gonna move the king same exact thing as over there incredible stuff absolutely now never resigned here you never resign in a million years what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna put my opponent to the pre-move test I'm just gonna pre-move I am going to pre-move the rest of the game can they mate me can they meet me I'm gonna celebrate Ponto H4 I'm just going to pre-move I am not going to spend any more time will this 100 ELO player defeat me King H3 King G2 the rest of the game they're making a queen so since they're making a queen I gotta make a run for it with my king right I gotta make a run for it okay they gave me a check my King's up right now I'm gonna H6 might be a mate H6 is made Pawn mate they missed it pawn to H6 was was a Checkmate every move I'm going in I'm going in oh my goodness I there's a brick wall here I ca I can't break through oh but I'm getting to G7 oh no I'm not getting to G7 because the queen covers that's crazy every move here with black you got to make sure that white has no legal moves I think they're gonna Checkmate me because I'm sealed off I can't actually cross over here that this is a really unfortunate situation that's mate do they see it they missed it I'm alive I'm still alive stuck on the edge of the board don't stalemate me don't stalemate me don't go here don't go here Knight F6 check King H4 and then oh my goodness I am terrified 37 seconds time is taken King H4 oh that looks like mate but it's not can I get the now I'm escaping I'm just I'm gonna take the Knight I think I'm gonna take the Knight oh my goodness I've escaped I'm in the center of the board I'm dancing 30 seconds on the clock 30 seconds on the clock where do I go where do I fight for shelter 27 seconds on the clock they're gonna make another queen how do I find shelter here I can't I'm trapped in the center of the board can I take the pawn I'm gonna sneak around that's made on E7 by the way do they see Queen E7 mate I'm running over here they missed it King G5 oh my goodness 17 seconds on the clock where is the Killer Instinct do I take the pawn I'm gonna hide next to the pawn so I can dance around the pawn I don't want to go here though oh it's it's so close to a ladder it's so close to a ladder I guess I gotta take it's made a million different ways and there it is 27 points of material and my Blitz rating is down to 111. all right that was uh that was a good game this person had really really good tactical Vision Big Daddy super I'm gonna play the sodium attack this game which is Knight to A3 good move now we're gonna play normal do they see this okay what if I go for a Scholars mate how's the uh how's the scholars mate defense right now at the 128 what's the scholars mate meta do they see this that's how many have they been hit with this yet is that good do they see it from the other direction how's the how's the meta at the oh that's I mean they're escaping I'm gonna do it just to punish because you made the mistake but by a miracle of God it's not checkmate I mean you you kind of defended yourself again don't go backwards don't go backwards with pieces but what is black doing black only has one legal move he does black think this is mate you gotta go here hello is he trying to take he's he offered me a draw why did he offer me a draw does he think I don't want to draw does he think it's Checkmate what is happening let me ask this guy do you watch Gotham chess if he responds I will give him a draw how about that he's not he's not making the only legal move in the position he he's only got this hey what what is going on I what is happening I hello I'm scared I don't he he waiting we'll Auto resign okay I guess I have to offer him a draw I've offered a draw he has three seconds to accept it one zero no I'm all for four on that question not a single person will answer this oh my goodness I don't want another game with white can I can I get a game with black please I I I'd like to play with the black pieces because how do I I can't choose that can I I feel like Let me refresh I've played every game with white I had like one game with black there we go all right Juan you're gonna be the last person I play today your account was made of some months ago let's cook do you watch Gotham chess oh Auto aborting oh my oh my god did you see that his internet just like died that was all right I get I'm playing with white again this is not I don't want I don't want to play with white I want a game with the black pieces give me a game with the black pieces I want to see what they're doing nowadays with the black pieces there we go Vestas all right uh I say do you watch Gotham chess I want to develop my horsey my opponent wrote gibberish back they didn't they they did not write they did they they did they didn't write they just okay well that I I think that still counts as a no all right well we're gonna see what okay solid Pawn in the center two Pawns in the center is preferable um that's not a good move because you block in your Queen spawn okay I'm gonna develop my my Bishop my elephant it's called Sloan in a Russian language um okay so far so good this is a pure 100 ELO player I mean listen development is good night is night's coming out gotta get the bishop out somehow all right this is called the wandering horse Gambit I'll also do it he's wandering I'll wander our horses go for a walk uh okay I don't really know what that does um so I'm gonna go B6 I I feel like at 100 ELO it I mean it really is just like air hockey at an arcade oh he went back okay well if he goes back I'm going back I mean he came home I'm coming back to the barn too I'm gonna move the same piece he moves the rest of the game Bishop Bishop Knight Knight okay Bishop Bishop Knight he could take my queen but then I take his Queen Queen Queen if he moves this night I don't have a knight oh he moves his night okay I'm gonna I'm gonna play night night check he's gonna move his King I'm gonna move my king right because he moves his King I gotta move my king okay if he moves his queen I'm gonna move my queen if it moves on I don't have a bishop though so that that'll be kind of tragic this is this is okay he moved his Pawn so I'm gonna move my Pawn he's gonna move his he moves his Pawn so I'm gonna move my Pawn interesting he moved the pawn oh so I'm gonna move my Pawn oh I'm a genius he moved the oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no oh he took my queen okay now can the game end please okay okay that did not work out that he he spotted that um oh gosh all right I'm I'm down I'm down a queen flora and a bishop for a rook pawn pawn can I get stalemated that's what we're gonna try to do now we're gonna try to get stalemated I'm gonna move all my pawns so there's no more legal moves and then and and then I'm gonna try to get stalemated I I don't know how I'm going to do this I'm really I'm going to try my darndest okay I just gotta move this Pawn and maybe oh thank God okay uh I I have to make sure there's no legal moves left I mean this is I'm running okay he's trying to attack my Rook that's not good if if uh how do I how do I do this that's a check that he's dude he's really good he's I think he's gonna mate me oh I got it I'm gonna take he's gonna take this rook and now he's gonna take in his stalemate still Mateo in the video yeah yes the stalemate comes through clunch to end the hundred ELO video oh my goodness oh my goodness I did it I I've been I've been saving this up I had to make sure none of my pawns had moves I had to make sure that none of my my other pieces had moves oh okay we were like oh for six on Gotham viewers um honestly the hundreds were pretty damn good this is a 101 rated player and they played okay they played some silly things but the opening was good the tactics were on point I mean they were like they were taking free pieces they spotted this and remembered this and I mean didn't I mean that was this was a fun video I mean 100 elos are are actually pretty damn good at chess which is terrifying because he can't go any lower than that so I think over the last few years the the floor of Chess has gone up and I think a lot of people are actually quite strong uh even at totally totally low ELO so you could be stuck in Elo hell and you're actually not a bad player at all um let me know if you enjoyed this video I might do more like day and you know spending a day at 500 or a thousand or something like that uh and I'll see in the next video get out of here
