we're out here on the Savannah today and I think 
I just saw with my own eyes a real life programmer   still using Technologies from 2021. these 
programmers are hardly seen nowadays they're   so rare to find stuck back in the past of the 
Technologies let's go see if we can catch it   I'm too cool I will never ever let AI help me with 
programming I will be stuck in the past forever   laughs all right you do not want to be a techie 
that is stuck in the past like that person was   and because of that today we are going to talk 
about the top five chat GPT plugins pause there   if you haven't if you're living under a rock 
you which I'm sure none of you have been uh you   need to know that chat GPT recently announced 
that plug-ins are now available to anyone with   the subscription plus membership and of course I 
got sucked into paying for the subscription Plus   Membership so I'm going to take you through the 
top five plugins that will help you code better   be more productive all with your fingertips as 
a quick side note one thing that has come up is   various companies not allowing certain AI tools 
to be used at work these tools that I'm listing   these plugins that I am listing they are a great 
way to utilize to learn how to code whether you   are starting out your coding Journey or maybe you 
are further along you're learning a new language   building a project or business or also to maybe 
you're not a coder and you want to just focus on   the productivity aspect understanding what some 
technical tools are doing these are for you as   well companies may be banning or having limits 
around the usage of AI tools right now but what   I know will happen or what I see will happen in 
the near future is they will come out with their   own version of tools for this AI or for these AI 
tools that these employees can use it will not be   that employees are not allowed to use AI tools 
in the near future it's very impractical that   way and in turn what will happen is AI will 
merge very closely with different roles and   work alongside them alright that's enough that's 
enough of that intro let's get into it [Music]   I feel like we need some light in here it's better 
that's better right a little bit more light it's   a really rainy day here the first plug-in that I 
would do a disservice to this video if I didn't   list and go through now that I have access to 
it is code interpreter I recently did a video   covering code interpreter I wanted to share with 
you what some other people are building with it   this is probably for me the biggest plug-in that's 
going to change a lot of things this is going to   significantly help data analysts data scientists 
it's going to help developers so essentially this   plugin has the power to help you write python 
code not help it will write python code for you   so what's the difference between this and chat 
apt when you prompt chat gbt I write a python   script for me it will spit it out for you right 
but what code interpreter will do is it will allow   chat GPT to write and run the code so it's a huge 
difference you've seen a lot or I've seen a lot   of use cases where someone inputs an Excel sheet 
and then it outputs a form of data visualization   for that all right code interpreter is being 
it's acting up a little bit for me here so   instead I'm going to share with you on screen here 
some more examples of things that people have used   with code interpreter it's crazy like look at 
these things and it's one of those things that   it's really good with visualizing data but also to 
helping you write better code this next one might   be no I'm not going to say that again I feel like 
for every tool every plugin I keep on saying this   is the best one but it's because they all are 
so helpful I really took time to research and   find the best ones for you which is craftful so 
what exactly is craftful well it solves a problem   that when you're going ahead to start building 
a product maybe you have an app idea a business   idea it can be very overwhelming you're like where 
do I start with this what steps do I know to take   and craftful will essentially walk you through 
each step it refers to itself as the product   development coach and it pretty much is so you can 
use it to ask questions about building a product   Source the industry's best practices and have it 
provide feedback on the products you're working   on so especially if you are a freelance developer 
or wanting to get into freelance development this   tool I think would be so so helpful for you to 
when as you get stuck or you're not certain about   the next steps as you're starting out your 
freelancing career you can rely on this to   help guide you all right so what I did here with 
craftful is I literally just put in share with   me the best way to improve retention of keeping 
users on a website so this is pretty generic but   depending on the product you are building you can 
get specific and it will literally share with you   sources and outline these steps needed to keep 
users on a website this is super handy too as a   value add-on when you are freelancing think of 
all the things you can tell your client hey by   the way I really took these extra steps to ensure 
that users stay on your website the next one is   called prompt perfect and this is essentially 
what it says it does you can tell it what kind   of prompt you are looking to give maybe you're 
not a prompt expert I mean there's already so   many job listings for prompt Engineers this is a 
real skill set that people are developing and it   isn't something that people naturally have just 
as when you are learn learning how to code you   have to learn how to Google they say now you're 
learning how to prompt so with this prompt plugin   you essentially can write something as simple 
as say summarize uh what the python script X Y   and Z should be able to do right and when you 
use prompt perfect it will rewrite your prompt   to be longer more detailed so you can get a very 
specific answer from AI this I put off for so long   I thought oh this is kind of cool but is it really 
that helpful when I started playing around with it   especially in the technical space whether you are 
a technical person or even if you are not and you   just want to understand some technical Concepts 
which by the way nowadays who doesn't with tech   literally taking over every industry or immersing 
itself in every industry and it's a really great   way to be able to learn very fast because you are 
learning the way that works best for you by having   things explained in that way next on the list is 
called show me and it does exactly that it creates   diagrams for you in a simple visual away so this 
is perfect if you are looking to learn something   that's very complex technical more Theory based 
as well it will actually spit out a diagram of   what you are looking for and I've actually 
seen examples of people using this when they   are using mermaid.js inputting some of their the 
prompts or code for that and then at outputting   it in a very nice format and obviously mermaid.js 
creates visual visual visual oh my god let's try   that again obviously mermaid.js can visualize data 
as well but this just reformats everything but I   think the main thing it can do here is really show 
you in a visual way what you are learning in graph   format and this is something if you start talking 
about system design it's very interesting or how   systems are built it gets pretty fascinating 
let me show you all right for show me what I   did was I go create a diagram for me of Netflix 
system design but you can think you can do this   really with anything I just wanted to see what it 
would produce and it was super accurate you can   see here user request load balancer Etc and then I 
also really like about this is that it explains a   bit about the process as well down below and you 
can also edit the diagram which is really cool   too so you can think of how much this could come 
in handy when you are writing documentation or   when you are just trying to learn something new 
and visualize it and the fifth one the last one   I want to talk to you about is called ambition 
and this is for all my job Seekers out there or   people who are interested in seeing what other 
maybe you're not fully job hunting but you're   curious about it and it is called ambition and 
ambition do I always say it's called ambition   I did I need more coffee ambition essentially 
lets you really customize the job search so you   can get really specific results nowadays I find 
there are so many different job postings and job   communities online that can get very overwhelming 
as to what is good quality what is junk this will   actually combine all of these job postings into 
one place curated so it's very specific to you   so it's much more efficient and you can apply for 
jobs at a much quicker rate quality jobs all right   this is using the plug-in ambition so you can see 
here I said find for me software engineering jobs   that have one year experience required tell me 
where you are looking for these jobs and you can   see here the plugin is enabled I'm going to say 
I'm looking for these jobs in let's say Toronto and now you can see it's using ambition to 
provide us with these results it's pretty cool all right as this is generating on screen 
something else that you could really get   specific with is the pay bracket you're looking 
for different if it's remote different things   like that this is pretty generic prompt I gave 
it but you can get very specific widget with it   which is very cool also too I really like that it 
links it out to these job postings so this is so   handy all right it's great with all these tools 
but at the end of the day if you don't have the   right skill set or not building or learning 
with the right skill set to utilize these   tools or build with these tools what good is it 
it's like giving someone what is that old saying   giving someone a hammer and nail who doesn't know 
how to do construct that's that's not the same no   it's not all right to take away from a bad joke 
check out this t-shirt I uh changed for you eat   sleep compute what more do you need in life 
all right let's go through some courses that   I've been having my eye on some that have actually 
taken not only building with chat GPT but also to   utilizing open ai's API this is I've seen so many 
job postings for this skill set intertwined with   developer roles or intertwined with uh product 
management roles it's kind of feeling like it's   all coming together right now and having these 
courses these certifications on your resume is so   key especially nowadays with AI sifting through 
resumes being able to include these keywords on   it Game Changer the first course that I want to 
talk about is called chat GPT masterclass build   Solutions and apps with chat GPT now what this 
course will cover is not only will you be able to   build full business applications with openai's API 
and chat gpts AI but also to integrating chat GPT   into several business platforms such as Outlook 
teams Excel so you're not only learning how to   build this technology but also to implement it 
into other Technologies other things that stand   out about this course here are some of the key 
things I always look for when I'm checking out   if I want to commit to taking a course one is 
the time how long is this course sometimes long   courses if they're broken up in the right way can 
be very beneficial but for me personally I know my   learning style I don't like to spend 50 hours on 
a course I like to kind of know that I can spend   a weekend on it and move forward and this course 
is six and a half hours so it's a perfect I mean   you can complete it in a weekend three hours 
Saturday morning three hours Sunday morning and   then you have this to put on your resume which is 
amazing also too I look at the ratings I love that   udemy always is very transparent about the ratings 
so not only does it get a 4.5 but it's out of over   1300 ratings so that means 1300 people came 
in here and overall it still has a 4.5 which   I think is pretty cool also too I'm going to link 
all these courses down below it'll be very easy   for you to access and check out alright the next 
one on the list that I really want to go through   is the complete guide to chat GPT and open ai's 
API so similar title to the last one but you do   learn different skill sets in this one what 
I like about this one is it also focuses on   mid-journey which I mean is an incredible uh AI 
tool that you see so many amazing projects coming   out of and for this course I like how it's broken 
down into different sections so not only are you   getting you're kind of getting the Best of Both 
Worlds meaning you are getting some development   uh courses in some development sessions in this 
course but you're also getting things such as   uh how to build automated AI tools how to focus 
on prompt engineering it kind of covers a wide   range of skill sets and things you can do with AI 
which I really like because then the course isn't   limiting you to here is how you as a developer 
can build with these tools but also to kind of   flexing some other skill sets as developers as 
techies whatever role you are in you need to   be open to continuing to evolve and being aware 
of other roles and other tools out there to use   which this course dives into is a great way to 
really get that experience next one is one that I   am actually in the midst of taking because if you 
know me you know I have been obsessed with python   as a recent recent meeting like the last while 
really actually it's not really recent and being   able to use Python skills Python Programming 
with chat GPS honestly a game changer it is   I feel like when Chachi PT came out and I started 
using python with Chachi PT to build faster and   more efficiently my creativity just blew up I 
got so excited I felt like okay what business   opportunity do I see what app do I want to create 
there's so many things now because when you were   developing and you are one person whether you're 
freelancing or building some projects on the side   outside of your day job I think one of the biggest 
frustrations why so many of us always stop working   on side projects is because it takes so long or 
you get stuck on a bug that you just cannot crack   for so long you're just like it's not worth it 
and I really found with using these tools that   it really helps resolve that and this course here 
I've been really enjoying so far being able to   really merge the python skills and knowledge with 
chat gbt and also it's three hours long I think   I'm an hour and a half in I've kind of just been 
puttering around with it but I highly recommend   this course as well all right the last one I want 
to talk about is for everyone in any role but but   anyone who just wants to have a side hustle or 
make some extra income which I think is all of   us at this point and it's called chat gbt and mid 
Journey so it's 23 ways of earning money with AI   and I was kind of skeptical about this course at 
first I said is it really going to is there are   really going to be any uh differentiators that 
I don't know about or that the public doesn't   know about but they give some really valuable 
tips throughout it it is at a 4.7 it's at one   of the highest rated chat GPT courses on udemy 
and it has over almost 2 000 students thus far   it's a newly released course it was just updated 
a few days ago actually which I really love as   well they're staying on top of AI That's moving 
so quickly and it really goes through different   ways that you can use chat GPT to make money 
things that you wouldn't have thought about from   copywriting email marketing video scripts sale 
funnels website content and I think this again   is just another way to really if even if you are 
more on the technical side integrate some of these   skill sets with that while you are building to be 
able to generate income from what you are working   on all right we have gone through a lot I hope 
you found this video very valuable and helpful   as a reminder I linked all the courses down below
