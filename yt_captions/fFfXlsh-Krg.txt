welcome to my new series called talk tech with 
tiff where i am sitting down with industry   professionals to hear about their career journeys 
and current roles i created this series to hear   from people who are established in the tech 
industry so that we can all learn what these   individuals do in their day-to-day jobs and the 
type of opportunities that are out there okay   let's get started today i'm sitting here with 
ak who is a software engineer at shopify hi ak   hi tiff how's it going pretty good yourself 
it's going good i'm trying to stay warm with   the weather but other than that good nice nice 
i'm sorry i'm sorry it's pretty pretty brutal   out here i know i'm really excited to have you on 
today because there are a lot of people who watch   these videos who want to become essentially what 
you do a software developer or software engineer   so i know there's going to be i have a lot of 
questions here for you but before we really   get into it tell me a little bit about your 
current role as a software engineer at shopify   uh okay um so i'm a backend developer so i guess 
focus on the back end so a lot of the work i do is   uh really to love the api development at 
shopify so that's like connecting about   the different services between uh i guess jump 
flying like all this multiple different like uh   avenues of sales yeah nice and you've been there 
for just about two years you said right yes a year   and eight months and are you still do you feel 
like you're still learning something new every day   of course like i think there are so many amazing 
people that you gotta meet every day so it's like   you cannot not learn uh something new every day 
it's like different problems every day is kind of   like something new which is what the reason why i 
love the place too because it's like it's not the   same thing every day it's not like the same like 
there's no step process you got to follow every   day it's kind of like uh oh what's going to happen 
today yeah that's such a great way too because it   keeps your job super interesting and then you're 
also continuing to level up your skills yeah   that's awesome so i know you are a computer 
engineering graduate how did you know software   engineering was what you wanted to pursue um 
pretty funny sorry actually about this right so uh   right on right up until applying for university 
i was gonna be an architect like that was kind   of like my goal like for the past like four 
years or three years of high school it's like oh   i'm going to school to be an architect 
all right unless you're the last like   the day i was like looking to school to apply 
my dad and i just started talking i was like oh   should consider uh computer engineering like you 
know you're into this kind of stuff anyway like   and then we're just talking about how like 
where the future was kind of moving towards   it was like this is actually like a great 
idea and also multiple ways you can use your   love for design which i kind of loved 
as well for architecture yeah into uh   computer computer engineering computer science so 
i was like okay why not and i ended up applying   just for engineering in general okay with the 
mindset of you know what like let me see uh   where it's going to go and then eventually i was 
like yeah that was a no-brainer at that point   after i kind of did my research wow so when you 
started your engineering uh degree and you were   in engineering in general did you have leading up 
to that or even in your first year of engineering   have had did you have prior coding experience or 
was this completely new as you went along with it   it was it was pretty new like i had friends 
who had been coding for the past yeah three   years four years like had personal projects i went 
there like knowing like i've done very very very   basic yeah uh work so it was very everything 
was new to me like learn everything every day   yeah but you never look back you're never like oh 
i wish i would have gone the architecture route   i don't because i don't think it's gone 
you know i still think i can find ways to   you know get involved in that field and i still 
plan to though so yeah yeah that's one i think one   of for me anyways one of the best things about um 
coding in general and that skill because it's you   can apply it to any industry and whether it's to 
start your own company or move to a company where   it's focusing on design or architecture or 
whatever it is you can do it with coding yeah yeah   not like i i tell a lot of my friends about this 
too like i have a lot of friends from different   who study different things was law whether it was 
like chemical engineering who kind of like just   end up switching over and like you could still 
find a place within the chemistry in the chemistry   industry yes with with the tech background so 
it's like it's very versatile like that and   i agree it is it's really cool it's it's i don't 
know it's i think everyone should learn how to   code because it's just such a powerful skill not 
necessarily continue their career that way but   just at the very basic level like we learn 
math or science or anything like that but   so i get asked a lot on a lot on my channel uh by 
my subscribers how does one get experience before   landing your first job so you're in school how 
do you gain that first experience uh i feel like   i said multiple different ways usually right i 
guess the most common is usually like internships   but the issue of internships is like it's a 
these days with like big tech companies it's like   to get everyone in into these companies the whole 
like it's like you're applying to the it's like   applying for a new graduate anyway right so i 
guess the kind of way i went about it was um   because i started computer engineering so my my 
work wasn't necessarily focused exactly on like   campsite right so it was pretty like broadening 
the amount of things i did it was very like   wow i was just soft focused so i ended up 
like during my spirit time i always kind of   worked in a project side project like uh i love 
hackathons like i did a lot of hackathons like   i drove to i drove to new jersey like uh no way 
or a hackathon had so many fun stories which was   like fun memories i looked back on to as well too 
so those two are like pretty big ones too and i   attempted startups with friends too like someone 
still going to today some sadly i've fallen off   too and yeah just a lot of personal development 
on your side yeah i feel that's the biggest thing   you cannot rely solely on like the work you're 
doing from school it's so true and when you were   building you mentioned building different kind of 
side projects were those projects things that you   were passionate about or what how did you decide 
on what projects to build i feel it was initially   more like what interested me like i guess the 
passion came later was more about like oh how   does this work you know like i'm kind of curious 
how like how does the website do this or how does   my phone do this like how can i get an app that 
does this thing right yeah so like that kind of   interest and that like uh learning that peak of an 
interest in this particular software was what kind   of dragged me to find out how it worked after that 
you kind of figure out exactly what field like you   know you're passionate in because i guess there 
are billion different like parts that you cannot   you can go into so yeah exactly uh going back to 
hackathons a bit i want to touch on this because   i've actually never been to a hackathon 
and it's mainly because well not now but   when i was first starting out they seemed 
so intimidating and everyone who's been is   like no tiff it's fine just go and i'm 
like so what was your experience like   going to your first hackathon is it really 
as intimidating as i feel like it would be   um i'm trying to think back my first one was 
i think my first one's actually at queen's i   guess which was my university uh so i feel 
that was different because i guess it was   my i was just kind of like still at school so 
but i do understand the intimidation in there   because it's like you hear the project we're 
working on like and you're like oh these are   industry level projects right i couldn't imagine 
myself using this like when i'm trying to build a   website i did this simple oh what's the weather 
you know and you have people like doing this   complex project with the ai i'm actually learning 
it's like i can see the motivation there yeah well   i feel it's more about kind of just like i said 
before what interests you you know when you start   off with like if you start something else pretty 
hard like you lose interest because it's hard   right if you start with something like you're more 
really into like more something very like you know   just interested then the passion would grow from 
there you know exactly i totally agree and okay so   you've been to a bunch of hackathons it sounds 
like what is is there a memory that stands out   like one that was really fun a hackathon that 
stands out to you yeah that's a big one right   so it's a whole there's a whole backstory 
to it yeah right so it's a i don't know like   probably like what 20 i don't know some 20 maybe 
2018 november like middle winter right it was   cold out like i had plans for uh was princeton 
hack princeton's hack uh universe uh university   hackathon wow right my friend and i were actually 
to go then we cancelled and then last minute at   like 6 p.m which which was way way too late hit me 
up i was like okay she wanted to go for this and i   was like you know why not so like 6 p.m we drive 
to new jersey like just pick out things up and   just drive up there and like going through like 
i see yeah i see rose literally oh my goodness   then we kind of get there and then like you know 
what let's just do what we can we end up like end   up sleeping in the car that night actually 
wow then the next day we're just gonna run   to the motel and just kind of like hacked away 
because we just didn't want to be on campus i   don't know why i can't remember why though you 
want to be on campus yeah it was pretty funny   because we just had a whole harry potter marathon 
playing while we just kind of hacked away for like   a whole day and a half wow and then the best part 
was we ended up winning the hackathon which kind   of just was iced on the cake literally because and 
everyone's gonna love that project too which is   like the best thing it was it made everything 
just well worth it it was very yeah very like   spontaneous and then it was like oh [ __ ] like 
we actually went through this like we drove like   how was it how many hours was there six or so we 
drove up there and then we actually kind of ended   up bringing something back so it's pretty pretty 
fulfilling though so that is and i love how to it   was the things you went through to get there you 
know from the icy roads to sleeping in your car   and then two ending up winning it when you weren't 
even gonna go yeah literally it was that the day   of we kind of just like uh just took time let's 
just not do this anymore and just like yeah   6 p.m we go to like we go there like 1 a.m or 
something wow wow congratulations by the way   that's really cool so what what to expect for 
people who are still in school or considering   a career in uh software engineering what to expect 
your first few weeks on the job is it i think some   people get nervous that it's going to be the first 
day is you're going to build the next facebook   or something like what is it actually like the 
first few weeks i feel people expect to know what   they're going to do yeah i feel a lot especially 
if you're hired off out of university like   they know you don't know yeah you don't know what 
you know you can't just pull up the next day and   like start coding for them right yeah i feel sorry 
like they kind of hide you know that you can learn   at least that's what shopify does anyway they 
hire learners people are trying to grow yeah right   it's the first month or so for me was literally 
just learning shopify tools and services like   literally i didn't do anything professional any 
like actual work contributing to actual shopify's   services up until the second month yeah the first 
one was just straight like learning like ruby on   rails like learning how to develop a shopify like 
learning different tools and servers and how to   maneuver my way around the code base yeah so it 
was very like it took the time out a whole month   that's a whole month right and i got paid for the 
whole month too right yeah so to actually just   let's get him actually comfortable with the work 
he's going to do yeah and then moving on you can   like slowly get let in so i feel like that fear of 
like oh i'm going to go in there i'm not going to   perform off the first month it's like it's just 
most companies anyway like would put in the work   to actually teach you before they actually like 
throw you in the deep end yeah i think most good   companies yeah that's so that's the right way yeah 
good companies yeah i heard somewhere i don't know   if this is true or not but i heard somewhere that 
on average and i guess it depends on how senior a   person is but on average it takes three months for 
a person uh to get familiarized with a code base   and i know that can vary based on the size and all 
that but it makes sense like a big big code base   it takes time oh definitely i've been supply 
for a year eight months i'm definitely not fully   yeah i mean yeah it's just it's it's yeah it's 
huge it kind of depends what you're working on   right if it's if you're sold you're so proud and 
on that code base and yeah it could take yeah   it's it takes quite a while exactly but you get 
more comfortable in it yeah definitely the more   you work on it the more you kind of yeah ease 
into it well speaking of that you know getting   more comfortable and all that what do you do when 
you get stuck on a problem do you have someone uh   do you have kind of a what is the word a routine 
you know for example i google and then i talk to   my rubber doc and then i go talk to someone or 
what's your problem-solving process what is mine   um let's see let's see i feel like i'm a music 
guy i don't know i don't i don't usually code   in music but i don't know when i want like 
some kind of like just it's kind of reset   i just kind of just step away and kind of play 
something and just kind of like listen to that   for a minute and then go back to the problem 
like that's just one of the many i guess like   having a rubber ducky is also like very 
nice too just you know someone talk to him   talk to kind of help you get past the problem as 
well i don't know my goal to you just kind of i   just do something else yeah because most times if 
i spend like two hours on problem i can't figure   it out the best thing they're just gonna like 
do something else i know i totally agree like i   have projects where like i'm on an issue and i'm 
like i just say okay tell my teammate i'm just   gonna do something completely different for the 
next day just kind of like reset yeah exactly but   it's easier i don't know if it's just maybe it's 
just me but it's easier said than done i often   find myself like knowing that's what i should do 
but i'm so frustrated i'm like i just need one   more hour and i'm going to get it and then it's 
like tiff if you just stepped away gone for a walk   you know it's just you just need that like reset 
that's the reset sometimes yeah yeah i like that   the music thing for me i'm a walk person you can 
just go for walks and like walk it out and i love   walking too i don't know i've never tried it in 
between projects usually but yeah i love walking   as well as a big thing for head clearer definitely 
i agree i agree how do you keep up so as you know   tech is changing so quickly and and different 
uh frameworks and languages are coming out or   different updates to them so how do you keep up 
with the ever-changing tech industry or do you   um i'll say a lot of blogs okay i feel like 
maybe a lot of people say that too it's like   a lot of blogs i use twitter a lot too so i'll 
say just kind of have like full lot of blogs   kind of just like every day every day is like 
news articles kind of seeing what is new yeah   but actually keep in touch like keeping 
updated like on my skill level it's like   it's it definitely gets tough because i guess 
everything changes like in the past five years   like so many things new technologies 
have come out that it's kind of hard to   say okay i'm keeping myself to the top level of my 
industry yeah i know i feel like to try the best   i can right if i'm focusing this oh i'm working 
on like i don't know graphql just kind of like   straight keep working on that thing and getting 
better the more new the more updates come out it's   kind of focused on one thing if you try to like do 
everything yeah it's kind of like you kind of get   lost right exactly becoming focusing on certain 
things versus trying to what is the word become   a generalist and focus on everything yeah yeah i 
don't know there's a as a model like i think it's   called a t model something like that where like 
you learn a little bit of everything it's going   to have your base like knowledge and you kind of 
pick what exactly you want to focus on and then   you know you go straight for that too i like that 
and it's so true i find with with many careers in   tech and and i think software engineering as well 
like you kind of when you're learning you learn a   little bit about everything and then as you grow 
you realize what area you want to specialize   in as you continue to have experiences yeah no 
definitely definitely and you can always switch   after it too anyway exactly which is such a good 
thing so you don't feel like you're committed to   one area forever yeah and i started off as a more 
in the front end focus like that was a lot of the   work i did yeah because i was like more you know 
more interested by like the websites and web apps   and whatnot and then eventually literally like 
the last year of university i switched to more   back end and then eventually i'm going to try 
out production engineering soon too wow good   for you that's really cool so how did you know i'm 
just really curious so you went from front end to   more back end things how did you know it was 
something you wanted to try or was it just through   experience um i feel um i wanted to because i 
started doing a lot of projects my myself right   i usually i guess to build a whole project kind 
of need a whole flow of like going from like   how it looks yeah i actually function on the 
back and then like you know how it's going to   like scale right so it's after doing a little 
bit of that like focusing on the front end i   was like i actually want to get better in the 
back and actually build project projects solely   back in focus without actually the front end you 
know to kind of strengthen that skill specifically   i think this kind of goes back to the whole team 
model right i'm trying to learn a little bit of   each things per se yeah and then i kind of decide 
i don't feel like i've decided right now yeah like   even though i might be i've been doing back for 
the past two years i don't feel like i've actually   decided what exactly i want to focus on though i 
think that's a good place to be because that means   you're open-minded and just continuing to try out 
new things yeah definitely definitely gonna have   to exactly and it's still you know there's still 
so much time um yeah some uh yeah i guess i'm i'm   pretty young so i guess yeah yeah yeah i gotta 
go exactly so what would you tell last question i   have for you what would you tell your younger self 
what advice would you give to your younger self   let's see just like so imagine 
quite quite a lot i guess   i don't keep keep trying things man like life's uh 
i guess life's short as they say but i don't know   keep exploring that's so much thing to like start 
early you know don't get too comfortable yeah i   feel like that's where i'm at right now it's like 
i guess i wasn't comfortable back then but like   i was kind of set on oh i'm gonna do 
this one thing and i just kind of like   close out all my auto options right but like 
just if i told myself you know what like i'm   young now let me just try everything whether it's 
like sports where there's like different different   like uh what's what's it called different careers 
not as a career but like different like industries   you can understand a little bit of both like right 
now like i try my best to kind of like learn a bit   of things out there and i say like the whole like 
not obviously i'm not like going to the career   but like learning about politics a bit about like 
finance like just kind of have those little skills   and everyone's useful as well too so exactly i 
like that stay curious exactly that's awesome   yeah aka it's been really awesome 
to sit down and chat with you   uh i know i gained a lot from just sitting 
here and i could continue this conversation   for a long time so thank you so much likewise 
thank you for having me awesome thank you
