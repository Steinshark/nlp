what do we have here huh little Vim is not good I'm gonna hate this aren't I I'm I'm literally GNA hate this yo what text editor do you use uh me yeah I just use vs code it's okay gets the job done what about you oh me yeah I use a Jeet brains editor you know it's a little heavy and clunky but I I can already feel that I'm going to hate this I already am hating this I'm hating this experience okay I'm hating the experience it gets a job done and there's a lot of features built into it yeah I get it I understand hey what about you dude I'm sorry did you say you use vs code and Jeet r yeah I remember when I used to do that when I was first learning how to program then I started using a real text editor like them only based based based this is so based that is just I mean it's not my fault that it's accurate what you you want me to complain that the sky is blue next real developers use Vim no one uses anything that requires a mouse I'm a keyboard only type of guy uh you know we created the mouse for a reason right yeah so people with skill issues can feel like they're useful got them cope such a cope my goodness the guy the man the man has coptis over here yeah yeah yeah it doesn't matter why would I want to use something like a mouse to point to exactly what I want to click on and type on when I can instead just use my keyboard and just go up and down by pressing a bunch of letters and random character combinations that I need to memorize to by the way I was really following this guy he should have done a little bit more research and at least got some like good vimms in there right because no person using Vim would say press a bunch of keys in random combination right nobody's going to say that right actually okay actually if no Vim person says random they would have set an intuitive set of fast moving keys to be able to get to where I want to be when I want to be there okay that is what a vimer would say okay actually guy tough guy and also just to be fair we probably we we probably wouldn't even be talking to you guys because we're still trying to get video and audio working on our laptops okay it's not my fault I still have screen tearing okay fine we're going to do a little story we're going to do a short story okay we're going to do short story it's over yeah it's just a short it's called a short it's not called a long buddy okay this is this isn't shaft okay this is just the tip that's what these things are used to be known as they were going to call them just the tip but then they realize it doesn't sell as well okay okay this is not full shaft content this is just tip content now I'm going to be real for a second on this story okay we're going to do a little long story here I absolutely love Starcraft when I was younger and I wanted to get so good at it I remember the first time really where it started was Warcraft 2 and I really wanted to get good and I definitely was all about trying to get good on Battlenet and trying to get really good on battl net and trying to braze up my stuff and I realized how bad I was and I didn't understand why I was bad until somebody told me hey are you using the mouse to select your to like click all these buttons and I said yeah I am and he said no you can't do that you have to you have to use like all the shortcuts in Warcraft 2 is really where it hit me when battl net first came around someone chatting with me on battl net because I couldn't figure out how to get like into the you know high enough into the ELO that's what I realized like how much I've been just hamstringing myself not using you know not using the tool well you know I knew how to use the tool I just didn't know how to use the tool well and so that's really where Vim started for me you know if we're going to be real here after that of course when I saw Vim for the first time I thought Vim was for losers honestly I was I was just like all these guys I was I I thought Vim was for losers I don't know why that is why does everyone start off when they first see vim and think it's just for losers what is that what why is that they're scared of it I mean I was scared of it I I thought it was awful it's ugly and unpleasant exactly I mean per this is perfectly accurate I genuinely thought Vim was stupid thought it was for that certain generation I thought it was just the worst you know it so this is if you're wondering why I'm always so curious about every piece of technology and I'm able to really argue a case for and be excited about something like gleam and which I'm not going to use is really the reason why I'm always so excited about Technologies and stuff it is simply because of vim and the reason why is that I thought Vim was stupid I thought it was absolutely the worst thing ever I thought there was no way that anyone should actually use it and then I AC became like the biggest Vim proponent in the universe by accident reluctantly and what I realized is that I often make snap decisions about tech without actually any real understanding and my biggest career mistake of all time was not being open-minded about tech and exploring them and exploring tech for the sake of exploring Tech to see if there is something better or more useful you know like that that's honestly probably my biggest career mistake uh and I did that for quite some time I did that for quite a few years now I I I just explore I just explore Tech regularly like I try to set aside at least an hour a day to just go read about new tech and and and to see things because it is it it's something that I could be completely sleeping on or thinking is completely nonsense and yet it could be actually super duper awesome and so you know just kind of like a little word word of the old of an older folk to the younger folk don't be too closed off to things you know at least try things try things and get good enough Adam that you have a really a good understanding don't be on the don't be on the peak of stupidity and don't end in the valley of Despair get somewhere into it you are just 20 years older than me and don't call yourself so old I mean I'm old enough that I've been in a career I mean to become a master back in the day it took about 30 years right so I'm not a master yet um I still have a little over a decade to become a master at Minecraft and so you seem 30 I'm I'm 38 or I'll be 38 here soon and so I really want to be a master at like what I do and so I'm very very very excited 10K hour rule to be pro at anything I know they say that but that's like not the case with programming right I've probably put in 30,000 hours of programming maybe even more than that and so it's like to be really really really good at something it takes a long long time okay grandpa um it's ever evolving yeah and so I'm excited about that and I'm excited about the ability to keep on being better and seeing bigger pictures and I I do I I do attribute most of that to my jump between not using Vim to using Vim that was the jump for me when I stopped being so uh closed off to things it's really when I realized just how wrong I was that was actually the that that was my my leaving of the red part of the Dunning Krueger curve where my perception of myself and what I actually am was really r that that just made the top come down I still sucked but I just realized that I quit thinking that I am um like I'm I'm great at things honestly efficiency is key to skillups at this point in my career that and learning regularly uh like you're describing was Vim the biggest increase again Vim wasn't the biggest increase it was the mentality that just came with it the fact that all of a sudden I had to be on my command line more I got exposed more to different ways of thinking uh you know you start to imagine things much different when you see different ways to do stuff just like that you know that c article that we looked at earlier when I looked at that c article and I saw different ways in which people kind or in different ways in which the cace was programming I realized like it is so much different than how I would have approached that problem it was actually a really cool experience I actually really whether we like it or not and whether we thought that guy was awesome or not honestly how he wrote this little linked list I've never seen before uh just cuz I don't ever do see and this inversion of how it was done made me really think it was super cool like now I'm like oh that's pretty cool that's a pretty cool way to do something like I was able to take something out of this because I came in with an open mind as opposed to being like oh this guy just writes such complicated ass code I can see the benefit now this I can see why you'd want to do this I can see even why you'd want to do this not saying that I would do this but I can now see why people do this and so that's like that's I think that's the that's the biggest benefit I've got the name is the prime engine
