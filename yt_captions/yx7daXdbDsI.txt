do you like money do you hate spending big on TVs well come on down to skyworth electronics we've got LG OLED panel TVs for hundreds of dollars cheaper than the competition you can fit so much TV in here the only question is how's that even possible what's the catch and who's our sponsor are you running into poor quality video meetings use glassware and instantly see what apps are wasting your bandwidth during your meeting and block them get 25 off today using offer code Linus at the link in the video description [Music] this TV retails for anywhere between 1400 and 1800 US Dollars which is actually more than LG's based here A1 OLED TV the difference though is we've seen the skyworth 55 xc9000 on sale for as low as 950 US dollars that is considerably cheaper than an LG even though it contains what is as far as we can tell exactly the same OLED display panel as an lga1 but how could that happen How could a third party buy a panel from LG display who manufactures literally all large format OLED panels right now and then undercut LG Electronics on the price well there are a few factors at play here one is that while LG display and LG Electronics are obviously related companies they are not the same company and they have very different goals LG Electronics is in the business of selling premium consumer goods for high margins that means they don't necessarily want to compete in the lowest price brackets LG display on the other hand is focused on high volume manufacturing and will happily sell to non-lg Brands if it helps keep the manufacturing facilities running at Full Tilt the second major factor is political going back to my days as a product manager for an Electronics retailer my goals were twofold one was to make money obviously but the second was to generate hype and excitement around our store and one of the best ways to achieve that is to heavily discount a popular product but believe it or not it's not as simple as just marking down whatever you want most people have heard of manufacturer's suggested retail price or MSRP but what you probably didn't know is that many major brands at least in the us also have a second lower price called map or minimum advertised price and this exists for a number of reasons but the most relevant one right now is that it protects the manufacturer's brand you see in the long term nobody wants to be RCA a once popular electronics brand that now scrapes by selling cheap Android tablets and refurb projectors but it's a snowball effect that can happen very easily much more than you'd think consider this scenario without your knowledge your partner retailer one sends out a customer newsletter on a Saturday with your product discounted to an unprecedented level retailer 2 sees this and immediately reacts by matching that price to ensure that they're not going to lose out on valuable weekend foot traffic when you get into the office on Monday you've got two things to deal with one is the big restocking orders from your two major accounts that's fine on the surface but the second is the email from retailer 2's owner to your boss complaining about the unfair advantage that you gave to retailer one I mean you didn't do anything wrong retailer one hit that crazy price on their own but retailer 2 won't care and usually they'll be looking for you to make it right in some way and they'll demand anything from and after the fact rebate on the units they sold over the weekend to a lower price on their restock order to a special deal on a different product so they can hit back at retailer one on the following weekend often they'll ask for all three now you can refuse but you'll probably miss out on that order that's sitting in your inbox and in the longer term you're going to risk damaging that relationship which could incentivize retailer 2 to give up Prime shelf or promotional space to your competitors so you give in to their demands even though it means that you've lost money on the transaction the good news is that as a one-off it's not the end of the world businesses lose money all the time the bad news is that now that customers have seen that price once many of them are going to hold off on their purchase until they see that price again so now your Retail Partners are putting pressure on you to Discount again to help them sell the slow moving inventory on their shelves and then the really bad news is that you don't really have a choice because you've got somewhere between three and six months worth of inventory usually that you have already paid for that's on a ship ready to hit the port and you've got to sell it so your choices are suck it up and sell it at a small loss now to generate the cash flow that you need to operate your business or wait for people to hopefully forget about the promo and risk not being able to sell it at all because maybe one of your competitors is going to come up with a killer product that totally blows it up the water so you strike a deal with retailer one and two fine you say take the darn things at the promo price but don't expect to make a ton of margin on these things because it's your fault we're in this mess in the first place they take the deal they're happy they've got a wonderful promo item that they can ride for the next few months and you've solved your cash flow and your inventory problems but now you have an even bigger problem if your products can't really be sold at a profit you're going to have a really hard time attracting new top tier Partners to carry them which means now you're stuck with those idiots at retailer one and two which means that this whole mess is probably going to happen again eventually the only way to return to profitability is to cut costs on your product which usually means that your quality suffers which reduces the desirability of your products which forces you to cut prices which forces you to cut costs and so on and so forth death spiral one that will never come by the way for LTT store because our products are great and our pricing is consistent buy a beanie or a water bottle today anyway coming back to TVs you know what this video is about LG Electronics has no desire whatsoever to go back to the Lucky Gold Star days so they're going to carefully maintain pricing in the channel so that it's profitable for them and for their Partners but retailers still need products that can be deeply discounted without stirring up a bunch of drama so LG display is happy to participate in that space indirectly by supplying panels to other brands and then letting them duke it out Brands like Skyward let's talk about who these guys are for a moment founded in 1988 skyworth is a relative newcomer to North America but according to Andy they're extremely popular in China and they are actually one of the top three Global providers for Android TV so that means that the Deep discounting we're seeing here can mean one of two things either they are halfway down the death spiral or they're a scrappy newcomer who's looking to buy market share from the incumbents like Samsung LG and Vizio and their intention is to eventually raise their pricing and their brand perception later now right out of the gate I am really happy to see that it runs Android TV natively not the most responsive Android TV experience I've ever had oh wow you really got to point that boy another unusual thing is that out of the box the TV seems to be configured to go into screen saver mode after just one minute and then go into power saving mode where the screen turns off entirely after about another minute that's extremely aggressive and we have to assume that skyworth is trying to preserve the lifespan of the panel now one of the things that Rob from AV rant noticed about this TV is that as you scroll through content it's not the most responsive Android TV experience that we've ever seen and that stands to reason we were talking with Tyler from portrait he said it's pretty common for these budget TVs to use lower grade socs than ones from the top tier Brands and this can affect any number of things from the responsiveness of the interface to actually the quality of HDR tone mapping and HDR processing so while the xc9000 series does support HDR including Dolby Vision it might not be the greatest HDR experience and another thing that's going to affect that is the peak brightness of this set we measured it at 500 nits but that was only within a 10 window so this is on the low side even for a basic OLED there could be a couple of reasons for this one is that maybe skyworth is trying not to drive the pixels too hard and wear them out which could generate returns but I think the more likely one is just that it's using cheaper electronics and it cannot provide that kind of power over a sustained period of time in a dark room this is still going to look freaking outstanding to be clear it's still an OLED you still get those those perfect blacks but you know these specular highlights look nothing like they would on say a C1 or a G1 one thing that's not as visible to my eye is the inaccurate colors though because while an average Delta e of 7.9 and a maximum of 16.3 is not impressive for artistically rated content like films it could just as easily have been the director's intention you know although I do see a little bit too much green and it's especially noticeable in the scene like this one of the other things Rob pointed out is that oleds in the first place have a little bit more trouble with judder or that like kind of appearance to panning shots like this one and particularly more inexpensive sets tend to handle it worse and that's definitely the case here the last big thing to note regarding picture quality is that while there are a number of picture modes available the only one that seems to save any kind of user preferences is the user mode so that's probably the one that you're going to end up using and if you calibrate it should be noted that another feature of Cheaper socs is that they tend to have smaller lookup tables for calibration let's fix this up a little bit here okay here we go maybe we bring down the green gain a little bit wow a lot better let's bring it down a lot boys oh my God that is like immediately noticeably way better there are a couple of immediate things that we want to note for gaming one is that this is a cheaper set it is locked at 60 hertz in fact it only has HDMI 2.0 ports so even if you hooked it up to a PC and you've tried to overclock it to 65 Hertz we guarantee you will not have any success with that the second is that while the TV does have a game mode it doesn't appear to do anything in terms of reducing latency or changing the processing that's being done so don't expect to get any sort of bonuses from that oh right the TV sorry I was playing video games I mean the TV is good enough that I forgot that I was supposed to be evaluating it and started playing video games so that's a plus man it is not very bright another innate characteristic of oleds that you're going to enjoy as a gamer is the low pixel response time so as you're panning around whipping around it's not as noticeable it doesn't make as big a difference as if we were running at 120 FPS but it definitely means you see additional Clarity in the image as you're as you're panning the camera compared to an LCD and that's just an inherent characteristic of the tech one other bit of good news is that even though game mode doesn't seem to do anything the input lag on the TV is respectable even outside of game mode so we saw about 60 milliseconds of click to Photon latency in CS go running at 180 frames per second remember this is a 60hz TV so that's not too shabby CEC seems to work correctly so we powered up our Nvidia shield and boom now we're looking at The Shield's Android TV interface boom okay so plugging in an add-on device HDR Dolby Atmos there you go but on the subject of audio there's some kind of weird quirks of this set if you're using the built-in Android TV so the built-in apps you can pass through Dolby Digital Plus or Dolby Atmos to an outside receiver using Arc but if you plug in an external device we had trouble getting Dolby Atmos to pass through to an external AVR so it's getting kind of lost in the mix somewhere it'll still work as long as you use the kind of poo poo integrated speakers but not from another device to an AVR to your surround speaker setup the good news is that I don't think most people who are going higher than sound bar or you know home theater in a box are going to be making this TV the centerpiece of their setup so I think it's one of those problems that is unlikely to really crop up in the real world especially because audio pass-through does still work it's just limited to two channel PCM or vanilla it'll be Digital or DTS leaving only one major question should you buy this thing over an LGA one at the listed retail price absolutely not but if it's on sale and you're not a huge video file but you want to jump on the OLED train it's honestly not the worst buy out there just maybe keep it in the basement because it ain't that bright ask for where to get one skyrift might not be a tier one brand just yet but until they become one you can pick up your 55 xc9000 at fine retailers
