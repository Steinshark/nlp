hi friends okay today is a little different video i actually have to send a friend a video recording of how to exactly contribute to open source as i'm so proud of them they are learning how to code and want to get into open source so i thought what better thing to do than while i am recording this video to send them about open source and how to contribute to it and make your first pr to take you along with me before we get into it though make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech and coding related videos and before we get into it i also want to say thank you so much to vidcast from webex for sponsoring this video vidcast is a video messaging tool that makes it easy to record and edit short form videos it allows you to share this content then with your team members your friends your family and get quick feedback on the content so it's really a great way to save people or teams time by being able to record yourself or your screen and get quick and easy feedback from your team members as they watch it okay let's get started okay also i like here you can see how long you've been recording for finish pause or delete so as i mentioned i'm currently trying to show a friend how to uh submit a pr for an open source project that they are helping out with the first thing i'm going to do once i have signed into vidcast is go to new video and this will allow the opto hello you can see this will allow the option to a film me or also to film my screen so if i go to camera off camera on there's options screen off screen on entire screen window chrome tab so there is a lot of different options you can navigate through okay let's start recording it will not be will not be this few and i'm going to pull i believe it's this one here no it's not give me a sec here okay so this is the project that they are working on um i think i have an example of what it looks like i mean we'll we'll see very soon here anyways but the first thing we need to do is to fork the repository so i'm logged into my github and as you can see here in the top right hand corner it says fork so just click on that and then what it will do is it will change actually the url from github the project name to github what your github name is and then the project name which is pretty cool okay now what we can do is open up vs code i'm going to drag it onto here and open up my terminal new terminal first thing i'm going to do is cd into my desktop i feel like lately that's been where i'm putting all my projects so if i showed you my desktop right now you might just have a heart attack but that's past the point next up we need to do git clone so we can clone the project and when we are using git clone we're actually going to use this one here for the project not the actual uh project the original project and this is so you can just as it sounds like create a clone of the project for you to work on [Music] okay you can see here we successfully cloned uh dev hub onto our local computer but once we've cloned it it actually doesn't open just back up in vs code so we need to do that you can either see do that through terminal or i'm literally just gonna drag and drop it okay there we go i just dragged it back into vs code and you can see now we have everything that the project entails for dev hub so then what i usually do next is go to readme there's a lot of great advice and insight in read me as to what the project entails how to get it started etc i want to show you the actual uh project and what it looks like give me a sec here okay you need to sign in to see it but here let me pull up this which they sent me as an example of what exactly it looks like so as you can see it's a web as well as desktop-based project developed for managing github notifications and activities so it's pretty complex i think it's a really cool project and i'm happy to see others working on it and especially people i know that i can maybe help them with this process so now let's go back to vs code and i'm not actually going to make changes to this project because the point of this video that i am recording for them is simply to show the process of submitting a pr for an open source project which for me was one of the toughest parts and that's really why i wanted to make them a video okay now we need to create our own unique branch that we can work off and to do that we go get checkout make sure you're in your project though here i'm in dev hub and b and then the new branch name so this branch name is um what could it be let's do styling header updates i don't know that's probably a horrible name for a brand but you get the idea switch to a new branch styling header updates so at this point i'm going to make some changes to the project just so you can see what i guess to continue on with the entire what is it the entire process so let's go to some js and i'm simply going to change um what should i change here let's just change this to tiff and tech and then don't worry i'm not actually going to do a request for this but then what you can do is get status to see the status and there you can see the files that were modified so any files that you modified will show up here so next up you want to add the changes you made and to do that you just add git add and star star symbolizes you want to add everything next up we need to add a commit message and for that it's going to be updated the github url okay there you can go you can see one file changed one insertion and one delicious deletion sorry okay the last step we need to do it is really that simple is we need to let the maintainer of this project know that we made some changes and to do that all we need to do is get push origin and branch name which was style you can see it here styling dash header dash updates now at this point i'm not going to actually press enter because i don't want to bother this person with my ridiculous change i made but that's as simple as it is okay the last thing i would do at this stage is simply go back to your github and there you will see changes that have been made so make sure to refresh your page and the changes you will see are that there will be an option now where you can click on what is it compare and pull request button once you click that your changes have been made your pr request was sent and now it's all in the project owner's hands to see if they want to review your changes and also merge them it is truly that simple i was so scared for so long to make an open source project out of fear of am i going to break something is is something going am i going to be embarrassed i don't know i just there was all these thoughts and honestly contributing to open source is one of the best ways to really get up to date with code and feel like you're part of this community you can get really invested and involved in open source projects and it's really fun okay now that we have completed our tutorial or i've completed my tutorial and done it through vidcast i want to show you just how easy it is to share with you the project so back in vidcast as you can see here is my project and all you need to do is click on that link and then you can choose who you want to share it with share with anyone can view or you can get specific people for example another thing that's really cool is if you go copy link and the users say this is someone else that you sent the link to to review the video they can leave comments they can share the video which is pretty cool okay another cool thing you can also do is back when you go to videos and click on your video you can also trim the video which i love that you can do that directly within vidcast you don't have to export it and then trim it you can do anything if you you know maybe start a little later start filming and then want to cut that first part out or end part all you need to do is click the scissors and you can trim whichever part you want which is pretty cool i'm not going to trim in this case but you get the idea okay another really cool thing you can do is add a description and chapters so for example to start with always zero zero introduction next one is at 0 50 for me where i go into github and then the next one i go where is it that i go in the code base that is around 219. you can see here the chapters already started i want to add more 219 open up vs code and there you go it will take you right to wherever your chapters are which is really cool thank you all for watching this video i hope it was very valuable on just how non-intimidating it really can be to make your first pr on open source project i linked the open source project that i went through in this video down below so make sure to go check it out also i link down below vidcast from webex so make sure to click on it and check it out it's an amazing tool to use for really any kind of video messaging thank you all for watching and i will see you all soon thanks everyone
