so hello everybody i'm really excited to be here with uh with deacon enoch again enoch is of course uh an ethiopian christian tawedo christian he also has a youtube channel uh called the philosophy of art and science so you can look that up and find him he's also on the thesis network where he is doing several things with different uh different types of orthodox uh discussions and everything so i'm really excited to have him on because we're going to uh to talk you know there people can't get enough of talking about ethiopia and uh and the particulars of their traditions and so we're gonna look go into that together this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] thank you so much jonathan for having me on the program i'm really happy you know it's funny because when i noted i mentioned that on the podcast i said uh you know i kind of said for people to to reach out if they wanted to i got so many messages suggesting you and then i realized that even that before that i actually got messages from people suggesting you like the first time the first moment we did the first video i had people talking about you but i get so many messages that sometimes it just becomes like noise that i don't i can't totally pay attention to but then when i after i asked that then i remembered i said i think i think many people have been suggesting him for a long time it's so funny that you said that because i've gotten a few people to comment and you know they think if i just reach out that they will it'll happen but the podcasting world for people to to know behind the curtain doesn't always work like that especially when you have a large following the way that that you've said and i've actually been following your work for years and i know you were surprised that i had already known you from your breaking down of kanye as the fool to watch out for the stuff you've done with jordan peterson and father andrew as well like i i had been following your work and i've been sharing your artwork on twitter whenever you you would post you know the the cosmos and and everything like that so it's really great and then when richard reached out to me it was funny because richard and i were already facebook friends but he's kind of pseudonymous anonymous i didn't realize how many facebook friends i had him and i were already friends on facebook that's funny yeah so a nice confluence of things kind of coming together so maybe tell us a little bit about yourself i know you live in the u.s uh maybe tell us a little bit about your your involvement in the church and kind of the way that you see it also as an american ethiopian american yeah so i love the anglo-saxon saying but for the grace of god go i and it's very true my service my ministry is sometimes inexplicable to people outside of you know the holy ghost or anything to that effect um i was i am born and raised in los angeles california and i am the son of two immigrants who came to america one year before the fall of emperor hilas allahis regime which if you go on the conservative estimate was about a 700 year uh orthodox christian monarchy and depending on if you want to say it's continuous or not some people like to throw the number 3000 year regime including in the early days pagan but beginning in the 300s a.d orthodox christian kingdom so according to their official records it's one lineage all the way back to solomon basically that that's right and there are a lot of people you know depending on if you're uh a member of the symbolic world or if you're one of the academic historians how you want to count it but the most conservative estimate would bring it back to 1270 a.d that's which is which is really even if it's 700 years it might still be the oldest like uh maybe except for like china like you know how they had these super long uh dynasties or japan or something it's probably one of the oldest dynasties in the world it's super old and i didn't realize a lot of these things until i was an adult because you know part of it is is trauma that people in my parents generation faced and part of it is things that they did but basically their generation was involved with marxist leninism some of them would like to claim that all they wanted was feudal reform and and i mentioned this not delve to delve too much into politics because it's so much of what makes up my being and where i am and so ethiopia's pivotal moment was 1974 when communism took over and all the former institutions were were shattered and it wasn't that it happened in a day it was kind of a long process of of decades that also involved the west and not just russia yeah and um interestingly enough we had ties with the tsarist russia too so it's funny that we had later ties with with communist russia and so the the elites were a number of them were executed by the communist regime and another of them were drained from the country during during a time period of like 20 to 30 years and so my parents left right before all of that took off and then a lot of their friends were in the midst of that so i grew up in a milieu of all of these people who were ethiopian elites drained from the country and then who were living abroad and just trying to focus and and you know assimilate to american society so i assimilated very well both of my parents were trained in british schools so you know they knew english before they came to this country but they also were very strict about me learning the amharic language which is the official language of of ethiopia and for me i was raised really nominally christian i was baptized i went to all the high holidays but i was never a sunday christian and i went to various you know schools i went to a lutheran middle school i went to a church of christ which is part of the revivalist american tradition 1800s college which made me confront the idea of christ and so in adulthood i came to the church start off pouring holy water they realized i spoke on heart so they made me sing even though i couldn't really sing so i became a chanter then they said oh he's uh he knows how to teach so they made me teach in english then they pre-started having me sub for them teaching in amharic at funerals and other services and then they said you know it's really weird that we have this unordained guy that would call mr enoch and we can't just call him mr enoch so let's uh throw this deacon title on him so i have a little bit of a windy path and a different path you know most people in the ethiopian church become deacons between the ages of like 8 and 13. i became it at the canonical age in our tradition of 25. so it's uh it's been about five six years and uh it's it's been a great train and i i predominantly focus on on scripture and liturgy but i have a little bit of uh competency and knowledge of some other parts of the church as well so are there formal trainings or is it all kind of imbibed into like within the church like do you take have you taken classes or is it just this so in ethiopia there are formal schools there's the traditional school it's called abnet which actually means fatherhood which is great and it's uh you know it's if you think about it from the educational models in the united states it would drive you know educators here insane because what they do is you know i'll give you one example the administrator of my church who's a monk he's a hyrule monk he left his house at age 10 and he decided wherever he wanted to go throughout the whole country and you have one school of poetry you have one school of the main liturgy which is the eucharistic liturgy you have another school which is the non-eucharistic liturgy and then you have another school dedicated to scripture and patristics and he went to and fro to whatever school he wanted without anyone watching him and he was a deacon at age 10 at 22 he decides to be a monk and basically you know he got all of his church education between 10 and 22 and you can say it's like a hyper humanities program with you know indigenous phds but you know he he couldn't do multiplication you know because they don't study even the basics of arithmetic all they focus on are church teachings it's amazing and so there are different schools so it's like you go to one school to learn one aspect again the one that really fascinated me was poetry poetry yeah so it's called kenny uh which is uh which is the liturgical language and the the language of the right kenny means to submit and so the idea is you create poetry that submits to the lord and glorifies him and then also the saints through whom which he is glorified and there are a million different categories i don't even know them all but the two main ones the two most important because they have to do with communion time one is called kibriyti which means she is honorable referring to the time which is the moment in which the communion descends and is being distributed to the people and that is poetry that is reserved exclusively about christ and christological themes and then you have the anamoger which is like the something like the um i don't know the full translation but something like the the rising incense where you're allowed to speak of the cloud of witnesses of all the saints to glorify god which is after the beginning poetry is so people study the poetry in advance they're not allowed to write it down they're supposed to memorize it and then they perform it in the church one time and then you know they move on from there that's it one time one time so there's original g is poetry being created by tens of thousands of clergy every day that is amazing whenever people tell me this is a dead language i say hogwash but that is astounding and so they perform it during the liturgy they perform it every sunday during the liturgy at um you know there are three different types of parishes let's say small medium and large every medium and large definitely every large parish will do it if it's a basic church where someone's not trained in the poetry where all they do is the main function of the liturgy they wouldn't perform it there for example at my church we don't have a poetry master we have a couple priests who studied it a little bit so we do it only on the high holidays but they'll have to take them longer to prepare like they'll prepare their poem and everything exactly but there's a master at it at a parish for example that a friend of mine attends in san diego they do it every sunday and which is the tradition in ethiopia that's astounding and so are there some poems that are so that have been kind of so intense that people remember them let's say yes and they're written down there's um there's a different books like what they'll say freilig allent which means the the fruit of the sages or yelikaantkani which is the poetry of the sages and they'll write them down in in famous books actually the administrator of my church who i mentioned to you earlier he's uh unique in that he learned this poetry although he didn't master it he learned this poetry from a nun named mahoy gallanish and she herself was the student of her father who was a master it's rare for women to to enter these fields especially at the highest level especially to become a master and then to be teaching you know all the boys coming up in in the faith but you know there's one famous one where i i'm gonna butcher it people could go to my channel where a friend of mine who studied for about a year to two years he performed it on my on my channel but it's it's something to affect where speaking about the digits of of christ there are a few different layers to the poetry one of the layers is that it has to hit a certain rhythm because it's not just read aloud but it's it's poetry that's sung it's chanted basically chanted so it has to meet the the rhythm and the melody of the chanting and then it has to have a basic meaning known as the wax and then underneath the wax is the gold which is supposed to be the the christological meaning or whatever other religious meaning and so there's there's a saying about how the thumb is greater than the other fingers and how both uh jesus and nicodemus were rabbis but they weren't the same type of rabbi you know jesus was the thumb and nicodemus was one of the other digits so this the same way in which the thumb guides the the other fingers separating us from other creatures jesus is separated from nicodemus that's like one example of something they would do and they would you know they would yell it one person would yell it in and then the person would other person would stand in front of them and would sing it before the congregation oh okay so this the person performing will have a chanter will then redo it will actually sing it yes and usually the person who is speaking it is usually more learned than the person who's just singing it because the the fundamental basic levels are just repeating like you said famous poems of of the sages or of the scholars and then singing it singing these famous lines whereas the actual construction of the original poetry will take a while yeah that's amazing that's astounding i mean i'm sure there's so many things like that that that people don't know about that are just like an entire tradition of poetry that's recited one time in church we have nothing like that i mean one of the things people complain about in the the orthodox church in the the greek russian church is the stifling a little bit of the stifling of the of hymnography where we feel like there isn't a lot of room for modern day poets or modern day people to kind of enter into the tradition and participate in this this pattern of glorification you know and rising up the saints and rising up god but you but these your tradition seems to have this balance of you know the normal liturgy but then at each liturgy there is a moment where but and it's not just like kind of i don't want to be insulting but it's not like just like improvised hands in the air you know screaming a thing it's an actual form that has pattern and everybody recognizes as as this poetry tradition it's just astounding to me yeah and they're recognized usually as the most intelligent people and usually they will not let you study scripture or patristics unless you've spent one to two years in the poetry school like that's a requirement at many of the scripture and patristic schools yeah you wish they had that here all those bible scholars if they could just study poetry we'd get a lot less like a lot of lot less his critical historical nonsense that we get that we get now so i have a big question for you this is my big question because i'll be honest with you i think that both richard and i when we did the three episodes on ethiopia we were obviously a little nervous because we're talking about something which in a way is very far from us and we're also talking about how when we look at ethiopia and tradition the christian traditions and because it's related to the ark and all of that you've learned you've heard them we talk about about the stories and everything it's kind of this extremes going into extremes and so my my question from the beginning was how would someone who lives in the church and worshipped in the church would would how would they interpret the way that we we saw it well i will tell you i'm i'm biased in a little bit but i'll tell you all the sides of it and my bias is that while i am firmly rooted in the church and you know i mean my my father's side of the family are basically levites you know several generations of of clergy even though it skipped his generation um i i grew up in the west yeah so i have you know a native fluency in the amharic language intermediate knowledge of goods and i've been serving in the church over a decade however there are still some parts of me which are western so one example i can give you is that any sort of deep conversation about the ark begins to make ethiopian orthodox nervous it's almost as if the mystery is cheapened whenever you talk about it and so you'll see i think another aspect that's unique about ethiopia everyone has kind of like holy drapes or holy clothing and covers that you put on items the ethiopian church almost to the point of like secrecy or gnosticism hides everything uh one thing i could tell is we're in communion with the cops and the cops have their clergy commune and finish the rest of communion in front of the entire audience uh without getting too specific to freak out the ethiopians i'll say the ethiopians don't do that and yet we're in communion so there's something hidden there where nobody sees the clergy taking communion actually in our tradition and it's like the arc there's very few things spoken about it my bishop actually was the bishop of southern california beginning in the 90s began preaching explicitly telling people what's physically written on all of the tablets and a lot of people freaked out but it's it's absolutely normal in terms of the elites who have always known this information it's just this balance of is this information only for the elites or you know are we on youtube now and hundreds of thousands of people will be hearing about it and talking about it but i think both of you were extremely respectful um i told you before we kind of hopped on i have two kind of minor maybe three minor points of contention but overwhelmingly you were doing it from a place of love and i think both of you were very well researched the idea on a serious note of the extreme edge and the inclusion of the of the outsider i mean the gentile par excellence it's like it's not just a gentile but a dark-skinned gentile like that's what ethiopia is always in scripture and and the arc language that you all used as the container i think was i think it's going to be very informative for very uh for the english-speaking ethiopian world for the diaspora ethiopian orthodox i think it's going to be very enlightening and illumining uh as well like the the whole monster on the lake story that you told the fact that you asked the guide and he was reluctant and then he talked about that i was crying on my way to work while i was listening to that episode because it's it's so true that some of the more secular tour guides wouldn't want to talk about that because they think something like that is embarrassing but a sabbath honoring monster is definitely noteworthy yeah it's definitely it was to me it was like i felt like i was in a like i was in a fairy tale i was happy about it i was like i feel like i'm in a world of of magic you know i mean there are so many when i was in ethiopia there were so many kind of magical moments my my guy knew the old guardian of the ark you know because they're they're they're the one that was actually serving and then there was the one who was kind of retired but couldn't leave the the precinct and so he said you know would you want uh to meet him and i was like yeah of course i want to meet him like i can't even ask that so he's like okay he's like i just want to tell you we'll go there you know i'll knock on the door i'll say if he wants to meet you um but he said don't ask him about the art because he's sick of hearing about that like just don't ask him about that uh and so i'm like okay cool so we go there he goes down you know it's like another door on the side down at the bottom of the building and he knocks and he talks to the guy and then i see him come out this old man you know covered in his in his cloth and i i mean i don't know what to do i just kind of smile and say hello and and just kind of kind of bow a little bit and then he asked me he says is there something you want me to bless and i was like oh and so i realized i remembered that i had brought one of my very early carved icons like when i was in africa i was living in kenya i carved this little icon so i'm like yeah i have this icon in my bag so i go in my bag i take out my icon so imagine like i have one of my very first icons that i carve i hand it to him he looks at it and my guide was interpreting for me and he says oh it's modern like only an ethiopian man could look at one of my icons and say like oh it's a it's a it's very modern like it's very you know it's not very traditional yeah so he he so he looks at it and he says words that i can't understand and he spits on it several times and it spits and says and says the words and gave it back to me and so i still have it obviously i'm going to keep it forever i'm never going to get rid of that icon it was one of those amazing yeah this is just these kind of amazing magical moments that i had in ethiopia um so have you been to ethiopia do you have you traveled yes i've been i don't know exactly how many times but something like 12 times if you add them all up it'll it'll probably be two years but it's one month three weeks two months at a time throughout my childhood it's been a decade since i've been but throughout my childhood i went every other year and that's i think what strengthened my my ties to to ethiopia one of the things i left out of my short bio in the beginning is that with the fall of the regime in ethiopia the last vestige of this 3000 year dynasty is the ethiopian orthodox church it is the only thing that is still standing that preserves that and so my parents weren't very outwardly pious i would say they were inwardly pious in the way you know jesus often would recommend throughout for example the gospel of matthew the sort of sermon on the mount life of not doing things for people but doing things behind closed doors and like i said they kept the structure of it for me but they never imposed it upon me and it was really a love of ethiopia just being a proud ethiopian that made me assess the situation and realize that the the strongest institute of ethiopia is the ethiopian orthodox church so going back home uh i mean you see that like i didn't grow up in the church so i remember one of my earliest memories as being in ethiopia at my grandparents house both of whom lived on the same street my grandparents had passed away the the fathers but the mothers were there and the priests would come to your house randomly you'd feed them and you know they'd do the house blessing so he's doing the house blessing and he puts the holy water on my face but you know it's a little forceful because they expect you to to have you know the cultural competency that i did not have they expected to know what to do like you didn't know what to do yet i had no i walked up to my mother i think i was about 10 or 12 years old and i said if that guy comes and throws water on my face one more time i'm gonna beat him up so you better warn him you know and to go from that to you know where i am now where i have that that understanding that that's a blessing uh because again none of it was explained it just like assumed that everyone knows you know what's what's going on and especially diaspora kids do not always know so one of the questions i have too is for example in in the west and in the the greek russian world you know the eastern orthodox world are there we have patreon saints right we so we have the saints but the saints are also end up being localized somehow but also localized like parishes are named after saints and and we have a sense in which also people take on the names of saints and and have their own kind of personal patron saint so is that a tradition which ethiopians also have so um one of the minor points of contention is something that a lot of british writers have written about and you know it's it's really helpless but the the most recent biology has shown that we are not seban so they compared our dna to saudis to yemeni to levantine to egyptians to sudanese i mean they're really trying to find the quote-unquote non-african component everyone comes from africa but you know all of eurasia left africa 60 000 years ago so the quote-unquote non-african part of ethiopians particularly the amhara which is you know the ruling class for this time period we're talking about is found to be closest actually to the minoan civilization and to tunisian jews okay uh and and so um that that part of the biology i think goes to the hybridity that a lot of you were talking about and so um you know the patron saint culture in the west or you know in the east if we could call you the east and us network as you all joked about in the east and the west versus the orient is this predominantly i think more individualized society and us being this hybrid of you know tunisian jew minoan uh adjacent which is our eurasian side has this individual component but we also have our east african side which is more communal and so the patron saints are more regional than they are individual i don't know if anyone who really has an individual patron saint and there's no real formal process although some people may do that but there are certain institutions i would say the capital city is a little different but historic ethiopia in the in the various regions would venerate the saint that's from their region right up in their region you mentioned who's the saint who let the bird drink out of his eye he's considered an egyptian but he is uh particularly for example not venerated in this region called wedjam because in his story it is said that the evil eye was found there so those people don't like to have him as a patron saint whether you're an individual there from not um who's the one with wings that he meant like the seraph he is from a region called shoah and so while he is because of other political reasons also venerated in egypt and in eritrea and other places the the main place where he's venerated is a region called shoah which is where he's from another saint whom you mentioned one of the nine greco-syrian or so-called roman you know eastern roman rumi saints uh he was you know greco-roman you know like but his where he landed is modern tiguarai and so the region of tigrai and parts of eritrea modern eritrea is where he's venerated the most so it's super regional in addition to that like i said if you live in the capital city maybe your patron saint is whatever church parish you grew up at where the capital city would be different than the other historic regions another thing we have i don't know if you have this tradition it's called the sawamaibar which is the cup fellowship so people will choose you guys joked about uh you know how we uh a medieval emperor introduced monthly holidays and additional to the biannual ones so these cup fellowships will meet every month for the holiday of whatever saint they choose and it's up to this group to decide it could be two people it could be 15 people could be 30 people and what they do is they feed the poor in the name of the saint and then they feed themselves and they they act as a sort of mutual aid program as well for each other if there's a wedding or a graduation or a funeral they cover each other's expenses as well all in the name of this saint and so in that sense it's like a a regional patron saint and then these small cup fellowship patron saints but other than that there's no real individual patron saints in this yeah but the way you describe it it seems like it's very embodied like especially in these cup fellowships where people will actually kind of let's say see themselves as a communion of love where they help each other and they kind of support each other and in the under the guides of a particular saint obviously ultimately under the guise of christ but kind of through the patronage of a particular saint so i mean that's very interesting because it sounds like it's also a kind of social net like a kind of social net to help to help uh palliate for for tragedy and for suffering i gave you the idealized version you know sometimes that the institution breaks down sometimes and there's only a social event you know but but when it is good you know it's it's a charitable organization that also takes care of the people within and with and without interesting definitely and so one of the things we didn't talk about but i wanted you to maybe explain a little bit or uh talk more about is that for example it seems like we have christmas right we have the defeat the nativity uh but it seems my perception is that that ethiopian christians they have uh they have tim cat they have the the the feast of the of the the baptism of christ but you don't so much have a feast of nativity or do you have the thesis oh we have the feast of nativity okay huge all right particularly in an area called lalibella where the monolithic churches are i don't know if you had a chance yes yeah of course i went to la bella yeah that that is christmas and they say christmas in nalib allah okay so nativity there and then you go to epiphany or theophany or in in gander yeah yeah well that's where they have the big huge pool in gondor right where everybody jumps in and and then aside for my tolkien fans in the audience i i still stipulate although i think people will contradict me that i think both roja and gwandar were named after tolkien's knowledge of ethiopia because there's a city called roja which is the old name of lalibella before it was named really and then you have the city of gwanda and these are the two cities that we're talking about and those are the two human city-states and love the rings right those well those are real places in ethiopia and i think that's too much of a coincidence yeah well for sure for sure gondor i remember hearing when i saw the name i thought well this is way too close he's way too close to lord of the rings there's there's gotta be some kind of alibaba interesting so there is so so people celebrate nativity in people celebrate nativity and typically nativity is uh that period each season of the calendar has its own name that that period is called stereo which means the era of revelation or or being made clear or manifestation and so christmas is usually thought of as being celebrated with epiphany slash theophany at the baptism of christ and that that whole season is considered one season and people are uh the hymnography of the church is is the same you sing baptism and christmas songs like every day throughout that i don't know the exact period it's like two weeks or or something and of course there's a there's a fast right before christmas yeah and there's a one-day fast uh that that's like a 30 40 day fast it's called the fast of the prophets and then there's like a one day fast usually in the middle of epiphany theophany celebration and there's a monthly merry holiday during that time too and they call it like the manifestation mary holiday and then people usually think it has to do with the manifestation of mary but no it's actually manifestation of christ but it's the merry holiday that lands within that period of the church cycle yeah that's symbolism i think it's still there we still have it in in our churches but it seems like it's very strong in in your tradition the idea of understanding the incarnation and also the baptism in all this imagery of light right as this kind of shining forth of the revelation of christ you know and and so i think that that's just it's a very powerful symbolism especially for people today as we we kind of we come back to the story of christ and the way that i'm trying to help people understand it that it's the pattern of reality right it's not just it's just a story and so the idea of the incarnation is being this light which actually shines upon creation and helps us see it in its proper form it helps us see you know what everything is kind of moving towards what the what the what the reason for all of this is ultimately something great to your tradition there's something called which is the hidden teaching and it's it's one of these extra biblical writings which are performed you know there's a interpretation of it but then there's also the text itself and a friend of mine who studied it intensely has told me it's it's closest in the in the greek orthodox communion to the mystagogy and that's one of the things said both at christmas and at the baptism of christ or theophany okay interesting so it's called the hidden teaching basically yeah it's called the hidden teaching uh that's that's the name for it uh but it's related to uh the mystagonji in the greek yeah yeah well i mean you see these the mystic ideas you'll also see them different mystic ideas as exactly kind of revealing the secret of what christ is basically you know it's almost as if now for us it's become so tame to say something like he's god incarnate like as if that's not a big deal so it's not the most crazy the craziest thing you've ever heard especially that he dies on a cross right it's like all these things are so are so uh mysterious that that they're to remember how even in in the early centuries they almost had to whisper it or they had to wait until people were baptized before they revealed like the fact that we're eating his flesh and blood like you know it was very it's almost like you can't just say this out loud or else you know they're going to kill you the catechumens must depart exactly the catechin is about the port depart so one of the big questions i have is is the man like is the kind of mystery of lalibella and so for people who don't know lalibella is you've seen everybody seen pictures of them but these rock dog churches that are kind of networked together uh in the city of lalibella um and so how do you what is the function of lalibela let's say theologically historically what is it what is the functions of it well i first because of the history channel have to say it's not aliens i have to first say that that greek guy he's and the fact that he's greek i'm like come on man you got orthodox in your family at least you should know he attributes it to aliens what do you agree with lali bella the aliens yes okay yeah on the history channel okay of all places yeah man um because it couldn't be angels and humans in collaboration um which is what the ethiopian story is which is much more beautiful yeah and the story of lalabella goes back to what i was saying earlier about people who nick pitt at the nitpick at the 3000 year history of ethiopia so there's a clear start of a specific dynasty in 1270 a.d and the dispute is whether that is a restoration or something totally new and the reason why that dispute exists in the first place is because aksum as we know it at the the great ancient civilization runs from about 180 to 380 pagan and then 300 a.d to about 900 a.d as an orthodox christian kingdom and that regime falls and is replaced by something called the zagwe dynasty and the typical zagway story is that they are descendants of the ministers of the queen of uh of of queen of sheba who intermingled with the ministers of king solomon so not directly of solomon and sheba but of the ministers and all those people and so that regime lasted about 200 300 years from around 980 to 1270 aad when it fell and that was the kind of interlude and then whether aksum and 1270 are connected that's for different people to have their opinions on that people say that in 1270 it was a restoration of solomonic dynasty that happened basically that's the song that's that's the tradition and part of the historical tension is that pretty much all the information we have is from that solomonic dynasty yeah so people say it's biased it's yeah that it is condensed and i have my good friend who knows about the hidden teaching he's a big fan of that that zagwe dynasty that that intermediary 300 years it's kind of um there's a very specific the ethiopian church is an amalgamation of three things of antioch of alexandria and of itself of axon and we always have the aksum element but the coptic element sometimes when people paint the story it's like oh we were coptic till the 1950s they don't realize that that coptic connection was very feeble and there's little historic evidence for it for sometimes like a thousand years you know sometimes they are said to have said a muslim to be our archbishop really yeah sometimes it goes 23 years 100 years without sending a bishop and people are like well what happened in those intermediary years well what happened is antioch is still right there and there are some stories sometimes in the 1200s sometimes in 10 uh like a thousand a.d where sometimes they say at one moment there were a hundred syrian bishops and it's like why were there a hundred syrian bishops what were they doing there you know what was uh going on my friend also believes that sometimes the the arcmand rights that people describe as archemandrites may have acted as sort of indigenous bishops in these intermediate years there's a lot of lack of clarity but anyway all this is context for lalibela or roha in in which case that period uh including lalibela who's a king are a series of like four or five priest kings and so they're both priests in the ethiopian orthodox church and they're also kings and emperors of all of ethiopia so when is this again between 900 and 1270. okay so that's i'm sorry to say but that's do you know the legend of professor john do you know about yes that sounds exactly like that's just what it is that's like they're that's why oh my goodness yeah that's and that's what they were that's what they were and and you know most kings grew up in monasteries uh to hide them so that they don't get slaughtered as potential claimants to the throne but you know at their some of them leave when they're eight some leave when they're 15. there are various accounts i i spoke recently about um emperor teodros was one of emperor theodore one of the famous very famous uh uniting ethiopian kings of the 1800s and one of the most pivotal moments in his life is he was raised in a monastery and at one point he's like 12 or 15 i forget his exact age marauders come and slaughter everyone in the monastery and this is like this is not a hagiography this is the guy's chronicle and he's the sole survivor oh my goodness and and so he became a little bit of a political realist after that he still you know had the the lord's name on his lips but you know some of his actions people thought of him as a brutal guy but he's a little traumatized slightly traumatized ptsd uh yeah imagine you live in a monastery and that that happens to you but so anyway king lalibella at this time i think it also kind of coincides with the rise of islam and uh at various points ethiopia controls kind of modern-day yemen parts of india and that whole red sea route through which we saw in the past year in in modern times that uh you know if the suez canal is blocked people got to go all the way around africa and you have to realize ethiopia ruled that controlled that that that seaway and so that 900 to 1200 is the receding period where the empire contracts and it's more local and so the trade routes we had been pilgrimaging since early on i don't know 4th century 5th century to jerusalem yeah some people say that the armenian alphabet was made by an armenian monk or priest who met up with an ethiopian one in jerusalem and used because they have an indo-european language of its own branch it they used the the script from the ethiopians but they had totally different sounds really i'd never heard that before so they would think that like the guest script is what influenced armenian script absolutely and look at the armenian script and look at the ethiopians and now that you say it now that you say it i'm like i mean not an expert but now that you say it i'm like they're a lot like that than ours yeah and armenia is in our communion as well so these trade routes to jerusalem which had been around for centuries get blocked because of the rise of islam and the changing geopolitics and so king lalibella uh it was also a priest father as well and a saint in the church he decides to create a new jerusalem which is not to be confused you know the heavenly jerusalem but a new kind of physical jerusalem in ethiopia so that people don't have the pilgrimage to jerusalem anymore because those trade routes were cut off due to geopolitics and so that's what that whole lalibela enterprise of the series the main church is georges or george and st george and then there are several other churches around it built out of that that monolithic structure and so yeah so the idea would be that it's like it's is it but does it map on to jerusalem like is is there some people tried to kind of find analogies between the actual city of jerusalem and and you'll find like engravings of the star of david and uh for for that matter uh imagery that later gets associated with a particular german regime but that also has a much more ancient symbol uh we won't get the yeah and when i saw the craziest things i've ever seen which is crusader crosses and like you said you see stars of david with crosses in them and and like and so that's i mean it's you feel like you're looking at this puzzle that you can't completely understand because you know some of those crosses definitely look like hospital hospital or hospital hospital or crosses and so i was like man there were people crossed a lot of people came through here and the you know the the crossing of influences and the the discussions must have been pretty pretty vivid yeah it's a it's a what people don't understand about the empire is the way in which it was extremely exclusive but also inclusive and you and richard talked about the biblical canon and how open it is and people got to know you know it's it's the west that has a closed cannon the greek communion and our communion the aphrodite communion have technically opened canons so at any moment the holy synods could decide to add books to the bible and you know that's that's their right you know that's their apostolic right uh but in any event you know we just got books and writings from everywhere one of the things from our monastic tradition which i always point out to people is that we have um uh aragawi manfasawi who's a different aragawi the spiritual elder who i think his name is john sabah and then we also have marisak who's isaac the syrian yeah and these are two of the three this is two-thirds of what we call the book of monks that every monk is supposed to read in our tradition and they're post calcidonian members of the church of the east which only affirms the first two councils and i know isaac the syrian is venerated in your tradition as well and i i often point to that as like it's not even like one book it's it's it's it's the majority of the monastic tradition the texts they have to read are from the church of the east yeah and you also talked about um this liturgical rite that includes on good friday the thief on the right well we have that as well and we actually have the expanded version there's a whole play i've seen on youtube of the syriac version which is like 15 minutes our version is like an hour and it's it's really hilarious you know the cherub berates the thief is like you're unworthy you're wicked you know you're ugly you know who are you to come here before that and all the but eventually you know he lets it he gets in wait so these are like these are what like kind of liturgical plays or kind of yes it's a literature so that one the thief or the outlaw on the right that's performed by the clergy on good friday um but the the monastic books are just sort of writings that are supposed to be studied by all monks and so we have john saba the spiritual elder and we also have isaac the syrian yeah because isaac the syrian how can anybody deny it like he he's so amazing like what he says is such pure gold that that's why i feel like even if even even if for us like in maybe in practice he was supposedly a heretic it's like he says nothing heretical that and and he's so inspired that i i think it it just kind of uh how can i say it it soothes over whatever whatever uh distinctions existed you know absolutely and i'll point if there are people you know who are in your audience in your tradition i point you to the book on isaac the syrian by metropolitan hilarion which is a fantastic book and it it it talks about how him uh along with one of the gregory's i always get them confused you know they get into this you know that all should be saved that and that is considered officially in the orthodox church a heresy and and he but he explains why he's thinking in that way and that minor thing doesn't take away all of the great spiritual advice on silence on how to read the psalms one of the pieces of advice he gives is that the way you should pray is you begin by reading the psalms and you don't say oh i'm going to do a chapter a day or a million chapters a day you just begin reading and then when your body collapses that's when you stop you know and that's what he says if that's if for you if that's a sentence good that's that's your two-year spiritual benefit but if it's three chapters for you then so be it and if you do the psalter all night also so be it that's amazing yeah for sure for sure some amazing things so people so do people still see lalibela as a kind of pilgrimage place absolutely okay absolutely as i said earlier christmas is the largest one celebrated there but pasca is also big in la balla interesting so we want to go there for any holiday i mean yeah exactly the amount of learned people in that area is ridiculous like the ratio of learned scholars i mean in the diaspora we have to beg for you know one or two learned scholars per church but there you know you see like hundreds of clergy you know people what people don't understand is the large churches i said there were small medium and large churches in ethiopia especially in the capital city because that's where you can make some money on a more cynical note but the large churches in ethiopia would have 300 clergy trained i mean it think about what a service is like when there are 300 you know and sometimes they have shifts so they're working at at different times the administrator the hyrule monk at my church he always tells me funny stories and he told me there's a a tradition of saint jared or saint jared and it's a book called a part of the prayer of his books called zayinankis which means god's reign or god is king and so when your parish gets big enough you can hire a zainagus chanter so the job of this zayina gist chanter is between the hours of 3 a.m and maybe 4 30 a.m every day whether there are a thousand parishioners or whether no parishioners arrive is to pray and chant this prayer and so all the large churches have this guy where you can go any day of the week the church is always open and you go in at 3am and there's somebody there exactly and the idea is to you know um ethiopia unlike other members of our communion was never fully conquered you know we could say we conquered ourselves internally but we were never fully conquered by another outside force yeah so our christianity was not a christianity in hiding it was a christianity if if anything with too much prosperous ease which is time to really develop these traditions and so these large parishes try to resemble the angels and to try to keep the watch so that at every hour of the day there is some sort of prayer going on and with a few meal breaks that that's very true especially if you go to the monasteries i imagine if if if they're doing that 3 a.m prayer in just like a regular town church i mean the monasteries must be completely insane one of the things that really distinguishes also ethiopian christianity from from let's say the greek russian communion is the drums and the rhythm and so i'm curious to know how like at least what are the traditions about that because i mean do people see it as coming from all the way from solomon or is there other traditions about the use of the drums and the rhythmic instruments it's a very great question and this goes to the african side of our hybridity we are uh i mean the cops can argue a little bit but nobody can argue like us that we are the the african orthodox church and so you better know we're going to have some drums but yes they have an asterisk next to it and the asterisk is that they certainly seem very ancient and again it depends if you want to go with the mainline narrative of the church or go to what the historical evidence says the main line of the church yeah will tie it back all the way to the time of judaism the the people searching for more and more evidence don't really see evidence of the drums before medieval times and that doesn't mean that they weren't there but it does mean that the tradition was less elaborate before there and we're still searching for evidence so there is um i believe it was father mandorff um was a professor of of a friend of mine who went to saint vlads and he told this story which i will tell again that you know in your communion the liturgy has this balance between byzantium right and the palestinian right and the byzantian right kind of baptized or christianized what was the pagan theater before and so the elaborate elements come from that whereas the more monastic tradition of palestine was more interested in kind of a simple psalter and and maybe a somebody plus that but not much more and we see the same thing within ethiopia so one of the extra liturgical or non-eucharistic liturgical schools is called aqua and the aquaculum tradition is where the drum is beat that's where all the drum beating comes from uh historically in ethiopia that has centuries of evidence and then you have a more minor modern amharic tradition which is established from about the 70s till now okay we and we could talk about that but there's this whole so you're saying it developed in a particular place within ethiopia like it wasn't something that was universal before it was it was not i'll tell you my grandfather and a lot of his ancestors are buried at a monastery called walterba which is in the middle of the land of which the civil war is going on right now and waldeba is southwest of aksum but northwest of gundar so it's kind of the halfway point between the city of guandar and the city of aksum which were two major cities yeah a long time and two former capitals of the empire so while deba is square in the middle of that it's a fifth century monastery and they view the drum as worldly all right okay so the drum is forbidden at that monastery and that monastery doesn't even acknowledge that whole aqua tradition which is this drum beating and elaborate uh swinging of the staff as well yeah the staff yeah they don't acknow they use the staff just to hold themselves up and they only believe in acapella worship similar to the rest of the orthodox church and they do the main eucharistic liturgy and they do the liturgy of the hours so what mind boggles many ethiopian christians which many even i would say ethiopian deacons don't know if they don't know the tradition writ large is that if you go on pasca the feast of feasts expecting like the craziest drums if you go to that monastery you're not going to get that what you're going to get is the liturgy of the hours followed by the eucharistic liturgy and that's the same thing that they do every day of the year oh okay so they don't they don't even have kind of festival liturgies and they yeah interesting i mean that could be like the monastic like just like all these monks even in in the our tradition there are these stories of these monks that wouldn't chant melodies like they thought melodies were worldly so they were just basically doing monotone just so there wouldn't be any variation in their in their chanting you know no well these ones will definitely not be monotone they'll sing but they only will sing the acapella things right yeah uh they have this view for example my bishop who i mentioned earlier he used to love hitting the drum when he was a monk and that's rare for monks bishops are forbidden from hitting it standing up they can sit down and they could hit it during the slow part but any sort of fast melody while they're standing the bishops are forbidden and he's antsy because if it were just up to him he would love to still hit it but it would scandalize the entire church for him to hit the drum that's amazing which is itself a holy instrument used to praise god but it's just it's seen as kind of beneath the position of of a bishop and it's rare among monks it's usually a married priest or deacons or now also choir members who could be men or women and just would hit the drum well when i was in aksum i i had a very strange meeting where i met three scholars from tel aviv three jewish scholars from tel aviv um and all three of them were kind of experts on ethiopia especially experts on ethiopia trying to find the jewish connection like trying to see you know how how close a jewish connection is and one of these scholars told me that in ethiopia they use what's called a system right which is a a staff and and it has like a it's hard to explain it has i mean i'll post a picture of it it has these little metal uh parts inside that move and so you shake it and it sinks right it sinks like uh and he said that systems were common in ancient worship they even they exist in egypt they exist in all these ancient cultures in the menomination as well oh okay so what they're described in scripture in the bible it talks about systems in the psalms like part of the instruments that were used and he said right now he said in ethiopia is the only place in the entire world where they still use this instrument and for him it was like a connection frame was like a way to connect ethiopia to kind of ancient hebrew worship because he said it it's the they still have this tradition from like thousands of years ago and and they need it needs to be almost like a continuous tradition because you you just saw it just named in the scripture you wouldn't know what it was unless you had actually had one in your hand and seen what it looks like and used it so there has to be this kind of continual uh physical transmission of the instrument for you to get to now and still go to church and see people chinking this instrument i'll tell you a funny story i have a lot of secular family and we were at a secular christmas celebration which is funny enough and they had a system in their house and we're playing charades and so my family members you know my parents age and they know what it is but their child has no idea what it is so i wrote it in amharic which is is called or in english the system and plural systra like any sort of latin plural and i wrote it in english and amharic and that poor boy my little cousin worked his best to try to charade what it was he had no idea what it was and when they saw what i wrote they said how mean and unfair are you and i said look you have this object in your house you're venerating it by by having it there as a cultural prop so we're gonna we're gonna use it but yeah it's a general eastern mediterranean thing so it includes the jewish culture like you said pharaonic egypt and the minoan civilization if you look at the the remains of their their artwork which is uh from the island of crete the the that was there before you know it was uh the during the bronze age before that bronze collapse so um all of those civilizations had this very ancient instrument yeah and that is part of the the school which is it accompanies the drum it's never by itself it's always accompanying the drum and it also is related that tradition has blended in with the poetry tradition so it's used with the poetry as well what the drum and the system are never used for and i always have to make this explicit and this is every ethiopian church is that the eucharistic liturgy is totally acapella this is for post-liturgical celebrations like hymns that are done or pre-eucharistic liturgical hymns and just use the word kidan when you're talking about the hagiographies the full term is kalkidan which means promise or covenant so there's the kidan which is the prayer of the covenant which begins the eucharistic liturgy and in the eucharistic liturgy there are i think three to four i think four places where a bell is rung to signify different things when hallelujah or hallelujah is said to begin the liturgy a bell is wrong when uh the lord have mercies are said a bell is wrong when the communion descends uh a bell is wrong and when the catechumens are told to depart that's not in order saying it off memory but at those four points catechum uh beginning of the liturgy uh catechumen departure which is the halfway point when after the gospel is read the uh sayings of the lord have mercy and the descent of the communion and those four points a bell is wrong everything else in the eucharistic liturgy is purely acapella mouth alone is the instrument but before that period in a in a certain specific time and after that period you're allowed to bring out the system and you're allowed to bring out the cabaret or the drum and you're allowed to use that to make music but again it's not compulsory and some of the monastics don't like doing that yeah yeah so we've been talking for a while so i'd have one last big question for you i guess and then and then we'll call it we'll call it good although i i could talk about this forever like i could just keep going i know but i don't want i don't want to abuse people's like attention as well um so in in the in our podcast one of the things we presented was this this uh byzantine tradition actually syrian tradition but but accepted by the byzantines of the the apocalypse of pseudomethodius right and so and in this tradition you have this idea uh and it's present in other byzantine traditions as well the meeting of alexander in ethiopia right the the the idea even that that alexander's mother uh was ethiopian and then the idea that the roman emperor will hide in the in ethiopia right i don't know if you follow that story so the idea that i did that the last roman emperor will hide in ethiopia whatever that means and that at the end of times will kind of rise out of ethiopia and that will be like ethiopia stretching your hands out unto the lord and that will kind of signify the basically the end of the world is what what it seems to be and so i don't know if there is something i like i don't know if there is are some traditions which are akin to that in ethiopia or or at least like what you thought when you when you heard that that that description i had never heard a tradition like that in ethiopia that doesn't mean it doesn't exist i just haven't heard that i think it's in um matthew 12 right that the queen of the south will arise in condemnation of this generation that that's prophetic language from the bible as well yeah um i have always heard this in politics who is the successor of rome because i'm interested in in the study of empire and you see you know nobody in byzantium called it byzantium they thought of themselves as rome even though they were conquered by rome and became romans they were the eastern part of the roman empire so you see the geographic rome shifts from rome itself to byzantium which thought of itself as rome yeah and a lot of people nowadays ask like who's the successor and there are some people who look at the current modern russian state that has exited communism and is got some sort of amalgamation of of different ideas of when to intervene when to not and you know that that military cathedral that they built has this archaeo futuristic vibe to it where it's like super you know powerful representation of the state but also of the orthodox church a patriarch kirill has also commented a lot on ethiopian situations and oh really yeah oh yeah he's supporting the current ethiopian regime which ousted during the the reign of donald trump it ousted this regime that was backed by the us for a long time and donald trump you know love him or hate him his nonchalance towards ethiopia allowed ethiopia to kind of rule itself instead of being guided by the the global american empire and and so a lot of people think that russia will be this prophetic you know russia is the successor state to rome for many reasons because of the connections with byzantium which connected to the original rome but as you said it may be that from the extremities of the world from the ends of the world the queen of the south may rise again and there are many people i am myself an ethiopian restorationist and there are many others who are uh elite in the diaspora i always noticed a lot of the people involved with the beginnings of saint vladimir's were some of the people tied to the russian elites who were expelled out of the country yeah and i think not enough people realized that and the same thing has happened with the ethiopian situation and i'm hopeful something like that for happened i don't know if that's going to bring about judgment day only the lord knows when that time will be but i do like you and like richard uh would say that perhaps ethiopia i'll say it that way perhaps ethiopia has a role to play yeah that's for sure i'm i'm sure that ethiopia has the role to play but i i i think that we're all kind of fascinated to see what what what that is and kind of i mean i think that's been a fascination for mine forever and you know my intuition which i now see is just not an intuition at all you know i since we did the podcast i've had several people write me because i said things like ethiopia doesn't just have the ark ethiopia is the ark and i've had ethio now i've had ethiopians write me and say yeah that's what everybody thinks like you're not coming into some great enzo they didn't say it that way but they're basically saying that all ethiopians think that ethiopia is the ark and i'm like okay yeah well well yeah you have to you have to be careful we we ethiopians can buy i don't know how the greeks and the armenians are maybe us three can compete to who has the most hubris and love uh the whole country and patriotism but yeah they're pretty up there if you say nice things about ethiopia we love there you go well i'm happy to know that i'm loved by some ethiopians i'm sure that'll be that'll be something that will that would be very useful to me one day i'm pretty sure and so this has been really wonderful i really enjoyed it and i feel like it could go on forever so what i'm going to do is we're going to put this out and we're going to see the comments we're going to see what people say see what people ask and if you have questions if you have things because there are so many roads we could have gone uh write it down in the comments and uh and who knows well maybe we'll just do a second part and go into what people want to hear about so thank you for your time thank you for having me
