ladies and gentlemen scamming has been around for a very long time so has speed running but I'm happy to say a new sport may be emerging here nft Speed Run scamming is now here thanks to John Wall let's begin start the timer now John Wall said on September 15th I'm hopping into the nft wave what are some projects I should look into oh boy ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar Studio I'm your host coffee Zilla and today we're talking about the nft scam speedrun guys I told you it's a new sector so we don't have a lot of established times here the timer is hopefully going right now uh but John Wall is putting in first place right now it only took him an astonishing seven days to go ahead and create his own nft project after telling everybody that he knew nothing about nfts this was announced a week after he said I'm hopping into the nft wave he took seven days to study the market and rely lies what everyone realizes which is this is just ripe to give a Fiverr artist a few bucks and then go ahead and launch your own scam so look at this proud to announce my very own baby Ballers us nft raising 100 000 to give to charity and my Ballers community and then we see the beautiful artwork that is going to going to uh launch them to the moon now I want you guys to all take in this glorious piece of artwork and ask yourself have I seen any part of this before and if you're thinking yes you'd be correct that is in part because um well people notice this looks almost identical to the boss baby but also that his background is ripped straight from fortnite ladies and Gentlemen let's give it a hand for the speedrunner John Wall this is an impressive level of um copyright infringement and just general laziness you just steal your background from fortnite fortnite nfts guys and of course it's a basketball court I guess because John Wall is a well basketball player you guys know how it is when you're a basketball player or a rapper or an influencer there seems to be some kind of a compulsion to get into every kind of money grab you can is it crypto is it nfts I mean it really doesn't matter as long as you're taking money from your fans um and as blatant of a way as possible that's really the goal now I want to point something out here which is basically that of course I don't believe all nfts are scams but what is going on here ladies and gentlemen it's just the laziest most blatant out there I'm just gonna take your money scams right now these people couldn't have even read the Wikipedia definition of an nft before they launch their own projects and people's about Buy It Now interestingly now that he's been caught um doing this with the fortnite background he's removed the background from his tweet never addresses it never talks about it it that he just got caught red-handed with stolen content uh yeah I'm sure they're gonna blame it on their designers oh and it looks like they are already here's from their Discord I joined it of course I had to had to check it out uh they said we've heard the concerns with the community regarding the realization of the fortnite background used on the banner and in the pieces of marketing content firstly we'd like to apologize as the team did not notice this once the marketing designs were made guys the designer's fault I'm sure John Wall had no idea you couldn't create a piece of original content in seven days from learning you had what nfds were and then I love this post which all of them say please understand we have no plans of making this the typical celebrity cash grab that is sometimes seen in the community do you realize everybody says that every celebrity cash crap all say this ain't your typical celebrity cash grab that's what all of them say it's like saying this isn't financial advice that is almost always preceded by Financial advice I mean I can't believe anyone within their right mind would believe this but then again there are people who are still interested in cryptos who after realizing it's Adobe stock images so I guess these people exist but if you want any more evidence of just how sad it is how desperate people are to make money both the nft creators and the people flipping these type of nfts these nfts I guess you'd call them uh just celebrity-backed you know garbage products like this look no further than the various channels they have within their Discord do you guys see um this right over here this says Shilling template and yes it is what you think this Discord see John Wall is no idiot he knows that he has to get people marketing and so what he created was not only a fortnight background for people to buy but there's also a shilling template for the people who are gonna promote this thing because basically they they financially incentivize you to shill this product to your friends in like a pyramid scheme like fashion so in order to do this you got to pay attention here they created something called The Early Access role and so basically you have to shill this product to three of your friends and if you're those three of your friends join you then get a bunch of uh what they call Daily giveaways apparently they're gonna give away ethereum and mints I guess of uh other baby Ballers so basically they say look if you join our little pyramid scheme you get three friends those three friends get three friends all of you guys are gonna get free money basically what's happening I'm a distributor Charlie for a revolutionary new product that changes lives and so this brings us back to the Shilling template here you go this is so basically say you don't even have to think about how you're going to advertise this to your friends we've created this for you and it says nft baby Ballers collection you just copy and paste this total of a collection of 4 000 minutes available hundred thousand dollars there blah blah blah Discord your link here this is how you promote it and then um I guess you send them this atrocity which I guess is supposed to get them to like the project I'm not sure exactly if somebody sent you this if they would join the Discord or call the police I I honestly think calling the police might be a a better thing to do if somebody sends you a bunch of cartoon children I don't know I I don't think the first thing you're thinking of is this is an nft project worth getting behind but anyways assuming you're dumb enough to get yourself reported to the FBI by sending a bunch of people um pictures of a bunch of little cartoon babies then you can get uh the proof of Shilling server that's where you go next where you basically tell the mods that you've done your due diligence as John Wall's little servant and you now are eligible for I guess these giveaways whatever you you've entered the pyramid scheme you're a beautiful person look at all these people doing it I mean my gosh everybody's interested in joining even after the fortnite thing and so yeah that's uh basically how this thing works I mean all in all I would say a pretty unbelievable scam to be created in such a short time John Wall definitely uh well we can stop that timer now John Wall definitely deserves the title of number one fastest nft speed run scam never seen it before it's just the fact that not only did he start an nft so fast he didn't even know what nfts were it'd be like if you didn't know what a cell phone was and then seven days later you're trying to start the next apple that's why I created the freedom phone I mean I'm not gonna say it's not gonna work I'm just saying I wouldn't line up to be the investor anyway that's basically it I hope you enjoyed it more madness in the nft world we will continue covering it because to me it's hilarious anyways I hope you enjoyed it thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
