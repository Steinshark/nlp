one of the most difficult things about 
being in tech or breaking into tech   is trying to keep up with all the tech trends 
there is so much to learn it seems like every   day something new is coming out something new to 
learn and it brings you to the question how am   i ever going to keep up with all this today we 
are going to be talking about some ways that i   keep up with the latest tech trends before i get 
started though make sure to hit that subscribe   button for more tech and coding related videos 
make sure to give this video a thumbs up and   also leave in the comments other videos you 
want to see as you know that's really how i   make these videos is based on what questions 
you have and what topics you want me to cover speaking of tech trends you know i have been 
putting a lot of my time and energy into learning   blockchain development it is something i have 
a huge passion for and am very interested in   alongside that i always try and share with you 
different resources and tools that i find along   the way so that you too can check them out and 
continue learning with me speaking of i really   wanted to share with you about kudos which 
is a blockchain based distributed computing   network that allows users to rent different 
uh computing power to and from the network   in exchange for cryptocurrency or fiat 
currency kudos empowers users who have   access to excess computing power and creates an 
economically superior green alternative to aws   and other cloud computer providers think of 
it like the airbnb or uber of computing i   also thought it was really cool how they are a 
huge green alternative to aws and other cloud   computer providers not to mention they have a huge 
community online which i think is really amazing   to continue to learn from and engage with others 
in the community so i've linked down below both   their telegram and discord channels so make 
sure to click on them and go check them out keeping up with technology can feel like 
a job in itself you're working full-time   in the tech industry whether you are a designer 
qa software engineer any role really and you're   trying to balance both your day job probably have 
a side hustle of some sort if you work in tech   and personal life it's just so much how are 
you expected to keep up with the latest tech   trends you can hardly keep up with work itself 
or maybe that's just me anyways i have found   there are a few ways that really help me stay 
connected with tech trends and different things   coming down the pipeline without having to 
feel super overwhelmed the first one being   joining some newsletters i find having some tech 
newsletters that come into my inbox whether it   be weekly or monthly a really great way to easily 
keep on top of tech trends coming down i'm a part   of a few newsletters and one thing i notice is as 
there are hot tech topics coming down the pipeline   you really see a trend where it be different 
newsletter headings or titles in it or topics   in it and they'll kind of all be to some degree 
the same topics because it's what's trending   from there if a topic really interests me that's 
trending i will start doing my own research but   if it's a topic that's trending and i 
don't really have any interest in it   just being aware that it's trending and what it's 
all about by reading you know a paragraph on it in   the newsletter is enough for me okay one of my 
favorite newsletters that i really like is tldr   which stands for too long didn't read and i really 
like this pretty much as you can guess based on   the title it's short snippets of interesting tech 
that's coming up and keeps me informed another   newsletter that i really like is called the hustle 
it gets delivered to me and it's a really short   newsletter that covers a lot of different business 
and tech uh trending topics in under five minutes   so it's a quick read and once again if there are 
headlines in that newsletter that really entice me   i'll go and do my own research okay next thing i 
do is i am a part of a few online groups so some   slack groups or some discord groups i'm definitely 
not active in them meaning i'm not participating   in the discussions or even sharing different 
resources i find just because of lack of time but   i'm very thankful for the people who are 
active in them and share different resources   i'll link some slack and discord channels 
down below and it's a great way if you are   interested in engaging with the tech community a 
little bit further and seeing what other people   are working on or maybe reading about to stay 
connected in a tech community even if you are   like myself working remote which can feel kind of 
isolating at times having these different groups   to be a part of is a great way to feel connected 
to the greater picture the bigger picture okay another way i always stay up to 
date with tech trends is social media   and some of you i know either love social 
media or don't love it and that's totally fine   i am someone that i think i'm a huge believer 
of if you are following the right accounts   quality accounts that are providing what you 
are looking to hope to get out of social media   it can be a really positive place to be 
for me i use social media obviously for   tiffin tech to share a different tech and 
inspire others to break into tech but i   also use it to see what other people are working 
on what's trending and how i do that is ensure i'm   following different tech accounts that i really 
love i'm going to link down below some different   tech instagrams that i'm a huge fan of one of the 
more recent ones as you know i've really dove into   as i said multiple times in this video 
uh blockchain and cryptocurrency and   and really web 3 as a whole and with that comes 
the metaverse and one of the instagram accounts   that i'm obsessed with currently is called the 
metaverse and i think they're almost at a million   followers and they post two to three times a day 
different news about blockchain cryptocurrency   virtual reality and they do it in really 
nice snippets so you just get like a   i don't know under 30 seconds of what's going on 
and it's a great way to stay informed and i find   also too inspired to see what other people are 
doing another way i stay up to date with tech   trends is to learn to dedicate x amount of time in 
my week even if it's 30 minutes to an hour a week   to learn about the new technologies as a 
software developer it's my job to ensure i'm   up to date with best practices and standards and 
that requires taking time to learn you really need   to prioritize learning and carve out time because 
i know we all are so busy and there isn't enough   time in a day to do everything so you need to make 
it a priority and understand just how important   it is when i learn new things i find that it's 
a great way to a learn about a new technology   but also too it shows me what is trending 
out there even if you spend a week learning   different very high levels different parts of the 
technologies whether it be cloud or whether it be   as i mentioned blockchain or a little bit 
more about a specific you know programming   language you don't need to dive into it to become 
a professional but just spend a few maybe an hour   a week on a different technology and see which 
one kind of sticks and which one you really enjoy   because then maybe you'll end up being really 
engulfed in that engulfed is that a word engulfed   taken let's say taken by that that topic and want 
to kind of further your knowledge with that okay   the last way i stay up to date with tech trends is 
talking to my friends even if they aren't in tech   i feel like a lot of the tech trends recently 
have touched every everyone's so fascinated by   technology and reading about it online and maybe 
it's just my friends but i think it's pretty much   everyone nowadays and being able to talk about 
what's coming up and what technology companies   were in the news or trending on social media and 
just having conversations with people that are   in tech and also equally if not more important 
conversations with people that are not in tech   to get their perspectives on it as well because 
i find it can be so different from one person to   the next that it's just really important to get a 
lot of perspective on it by speaking to different   people i really hope this video will help you keep 
up on tech trends just remember the most important   thing is you cannot keep up with all tech trends 
once you realize that and accept that i think it   makes being in tech a lot more fun and a lot less 
pressure we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to   know it all especially as technologists and 
have it all figured out but at the end of the   day that's absolutely impossible so find ways to 
just get these snippets of information at a very   high level and when something interests you then 
dive into it further thank you all for watching   this video i hope you found it very valuable
