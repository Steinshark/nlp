this might seem really other blue but Spotify and Apple have actually been going at each other for the last ten years but only just got very real I mean the things these two companies are saying to each other are brutal it's like a really serious version of a rap battle so what's going on also with this video is sponsored by cyberghost VPN 2008 is where the entire thing kicked off it's when Apple introduced the app store and Spotify became a thing the way it worked is you could download the app for free and then if you'd like tipped by the premium version for 10 euros of month with an in-app purchase and it kind of seems like everyone's a winner here Spotify gets to put their app on the App Store getting exposure to all of these new iPhone users and then Apple gets this killer application that makes iPhones more desirable the problems all kind of started when Apple decided to introduce a 30% fee for this in-app purchase so that would mean that every time someone on the iOS Spotify app wanted to upgrade to premium roughly 3 euros a month was going to Apple and that's only the beginning so understandably Spotify the initial reaction was something like no way we're not paying 30% if we pay 30% we'll have no choice but to raise our prices and we want to keep them low for our fans yeah they call their paying customers fans which is already a little weird there was a bit of back-and-forth but eventually it Spotify accepted and so because Apple was now taking this cut Spotify raised its price to 13 euros a month and its customers weren't happy but it uh she gets worse Apple music is at the center of all of this and it's very similar service to Spotify you pay a monthly fee you listen to unlimited music but because Apple doesn't have to pay their own 30 percent fee they managed to undercut Spotify and released at 10 euros a month which made Spotify look unreasonable and greedy so at this point Spotify had kind of had enough they pulled the plug they said to Apple we're not going to be a part of your inner purchase scheme anymore so they brought their prices back down to 10 euros but it meant two things customers could no longer upgrade to premium through the Spotify app and Spotify was no longer allowed to freely communicate with their iOS users now this is where he gets serious Spotify launched a fully fledged ad campaign with an accompanying website titled time to play pher they're calling our Apple for misconduct and are accusing them of using their power to give them an unfair advantage there are two sides to this story and some people are actually saying that Spotify the ones causing the problem but let's hear them out first if we head to this website they've made Spotify claims three issues with what Apple is doing number one Apple denies consumers true choice they add roadblocks to Spotify services like not being able to email promotions and deals to their customers when Apple music is allowed to number two there's this 30% Apple tax for in-app purchases which means that Spotify supposedly can't afford to offer the premium upgrade within their app and the third issue is that Apple violates the law apparently Apple doesn't give Spotify a fair chance you might know that with Google Assistant on Android phones you can control Spotify directly with your voice on Apple's Siri you can't and it actually got worse when Apple released their home pod arguably one of the best platforms for Spotify because there was no original support for it so this seems awful and the fact that Spotify has made this entire PR campaign about it is a big deal they are publicly attacking Apple but then Apple clapped back and you can tell they're not happy but I'll let you decide whose side you're on here so first of all yes Apple's 30% fee is a lot bearing in mind that Spotify has to pay royalties to every single producer on the platform their profit margins are probably not as high as you'd think but hey let's rewind ten years when people had to physically walk into a store to purchase software the retailers that would put software on their shelves would often take as much as 50% of the money thus their fee for providing the platform where customers can find that software and when you think about it the App Store is just the virtual equivalent it's the platform that allows people to discover and download Spotify and it kind of looks like Spotify wants to still take advantage of this alongside Apple's software development tools as well as their secure payment system without paying a penny to Apple it also turns out that Spotify completely didn't mention the fact that Apple's fee is only 30% for the first year after what your falls through 15 and the fact that the rules that are being applied to Spotify are the exact same as the ones being applied two other apps in the same category number two is that Spotify complained about Apple not supporting Spotify on Siri and home pod but Apple doesn't really support most third-party services they're a company with a reputation for wanting to control the entire end-to-end experience now I'm sure that in itself is upsetting to a lot of companies but the fact that it doesn't only apply to Spotify means it's hard to prove that Apple is actively discriminating against them and then Apple who you can tell they are mad at this situation have pretty much outright accused Spotify of playing the victim to manipulate the consumer on this time to play fair website and Spotify is making themselves seem like the one being bullied whereas Apple's words were underneath the rhetoric Spotify aim is to make more money off other's work and it's not just the App Store that they're trying to squeeze it's also artists and musicians and songwriters they're referring to how Spotify recently tried to sue content creators who complained they weren't being paid enough yeah Spotify also called their customers fans which in itself could be considered manipulative by doing this it's making it seem like these people need Spotify and the Apple is some sort of villain for denying these poor fans the right to use Spotify but in reality they're paying customers and if Spotify did increase the price many of them would just switch to a different service and still be just as happy so the whole situation is a mess but which company would you side with
