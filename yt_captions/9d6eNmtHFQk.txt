YKK three letters on your zipper what do they mean Yoshida kogio kabushki Geisha which roughly translates to Yoshida manufacturing company is one of the world's dominant zipper manufacturers they did not invent the modern zipper yet somehow YKK now owns some 90 of the Japan market and 40 of the World Market by value in this video we're going to look at the Japanese king of zippers YKK but first I want to remind you about the newsletter sign up in the newsletter to read the full video scripts hear about podcasts I am making or to just keep up with things the sign up link is in the video description below I try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show a zipper it can also be called a slide Fastener but I will stick to zipper is a device used to join and bind the edges of two Fabrics with comb Judson awesome name invented the modern slide Fastener in 1891 ostensibly to remove the tedium of buttoning and unbuttoning High button boots Judson was apparently an engineer who spent much of his life focused on pneumatic systems for public transit the Zipper was essentially his side project imagine that something you do on the side becoming the thing you're most remembered for his business partners quickly saw the product's potential and developed a company to sell it this company eventually went through a series of ownership changes and transformations to become Talon Inc the original zipper company twenty years later Talon hired a Swedish American electrical engineer named Gideon sunback sunbach became their head engineer and eventually married the daughter of Talon's plant manager he spent years working on the Fastener design in order to improve both his reliability and manufacturability in 1917 he patented a device called the hookless number two this Fastener had all the characteristics of the modern zipper with the interlocking teeth structure we see today just as critically sunbach invented a machine capable of efficiently producing this Fastener design being able to actually produce the Fastener at scale was a critical factor in helping it become the dominant design today at the start Tallinn struggled to get textile companies to adopt their product the Zipper was used in soldiers belts life vests and sleeping bags during World War One it also found a little niche in tobacco bags we didn't start calling these Fastener zippers until 1923 when b f Goodrich used it for a rubber boot product of theirs this boot changed the course of fashion history less than 20 000 zippers were made between July 1918 and March 1919. after the boot hundreds of thousands the factory had to stop making its other products and concentrate production on zippers alone Goodrich apparently meant the term to refer to the boot as a whole but people quickly linked it to its hookless Fastener produced by Talon Inc Talon was not super pleased by this new moniker Zipper was a generic trademark they could not control in the 1930s they ran ads saying call this slide Fastener Talon in an ultimately fruitless attempt to persuade people from using the term the rise of the zipper happened slowly and over time even with the success of the zipper boot Talon struggled at first to get garment manufacturers to put zippers into their clothing zippers cost more than buttons they lacked the same color options and manufacturers were worried that they would be too heavy and difficult to integrate into the workflow Talon started with girdles for women and work clothing for men they included zippers into Home sewing kits hired a sales force to push sales to trouser makers and held zipper themed fashion shows for women gradually over time these efforts paid off Talon grew steadily through the Great Depression and by 1939 they produced over 200 million zippers up from 80 million just three years earlier now our story travels across the Pacific Ocean to a small City in Japan tadao Yoshida was born in 1908 in uazu city in the Toyama prefecture it is a beautiful city surrounded by stunning mountains it borders Toyama Bay a spawning ground for thousands of glowing Firefly Squid apparently a pretty cool tourist thing Tower semiconductor I guess Intel now also runs a 65 nanometer and 45 nanometer Fab there producing analog and CMOS chips also a tourist destination for those of you who are into that sort of thing anyway Yoshida was the youngest of four children he grew up in a happy family but like many others of their time they were quite poor in order to help with expenses young tadao would set up little businesses for pocket money one time he sold little birds and fishes so that he could buy a fishing net he used the net to catch even more fishes tadao did well in school but could not afford to continue his studies after the age of 15. so over the next five years he worked at a rubber boot shop and spent his spare time studying in 1928 at the age of 20 tadao moved to Tokyo he had just 70 yen in his pocket a gift from his brother he remembers saying I want to go to Tokyo and do big business I'm sure that I would be successful if I go to Tokyo Yoshida found a job at an import store named Furia shoten selling Chinese Ceramics operated by someone from his hometown he impressed everyone with his diligence but then in 1931 Japan and China entered into war after the Manchurian false flag incident importing Chinese Ceramics was no longer possible so the store switched to selling slide fasteners unfortunately this failed to save the store and they still closed down fourier's owner the eponymous Viria told Yoshida to consider doing something with their remaining zipper inventory thus in January 1934 the 25 year old Yoshida started a store called San s shokai he took over furia's zipper inventory struck a deal with another zipper maker in Osaka an open shop back then most zippers were very poor quality over half of them were defective so this became one of the first things Yoshida focused on it was not uncommon for him to hit the zipper with a hammer to test its workmanship for better quality control yoshida's shop started producing their own zippers building a metal Factory to do it but unfortunately in March 1945 Allied bombing burned the factory down forcing Yoshida to dismiss his employees and close the business for a while after Japan's defeat Yoshida returned from uazu City where he had evacuated to and there he met an American who was considering exporting Japan made products to the United States Yoshida showed the American a sample of his best produced zippers and quoted a price of nine cents per piece but the American replied the quality is not as good as our Fasteners and the price is very high we can't trade with this let us take a pause to discuss the zipper's parts and how they work together zippers have three major components the tape the teeth and the slider the teeth a more technical term sometimes used as elements are the parts of the zipper that mesh together to open and close the whole zipper when the elements are all meshed together they create a chain called as such because it resembles a bicycle chain but sometimes people just call it the teeth and that is fine the slider is the part of the zipper that moves up and down engaging with the elements to lock or unlock them sometimes the zipper will have stops at its end or bottom to keep the slider from falling off the tape is the fabric part of the zipper it is what the teeth are attached to a zipper might cost a few cents 88 of that cost comes from the main materials and labor which is a bit unusual for a product Linings fastenings and other accessories make up the rest to create a metal zipper you start with wire the metal wire is pre-made in a y shape it is often made from copper zinc alloy for rust to reasons copper shortages during World War II gave Talon a lot of grief they introduced Victory zippers which ironically often deteriorated quite quickly anyway we then Shear a tiny chip off the wire's end this will eventually be our element after that we make a tiny hook like protrusion into the element this process is known as forging so does that mean we called the guy who does this a forge master anyway we need the protrusion I've heard people call it a scoop because it catches the teeth as we zip up the zipper helping keep the teeth together while the zipper is closed finally we attach the tooth to the tape by bending the elements two legs this process is known as attaching or bending obviously mechanical automation is necessary for this process to be done economically and effectively a zipper that is too tough to zip up or breaks its teeth can ruin the usefulness of an otherwise perfectly good garment so we use a chain machine to automatically and accurately attach the teeth to the tape Yoshida saw these American-made Thirty to forty thousand dollar machines as essential to achieving the zipper quality he so desired no other company was willing to share the cost with him so after a great struggle he managed to get an import license and a 12 million yen foreign exchange loan from the industrial bank for four chain machines in 1949. the imported chain machines which arrived in 1950 granted YKK an incredible competitive Advantage you can now do the work of 160 workers with just six Yoshida immediately commissioned a Japanese machine company to produce a hundred replicas delivery of this massive order would take two years however these chain machines had limits the most notable of which was that they attached at a continuous rate necessitating the use of spacers on the tape to ensure a consistent spacing these spacers had to be taken out afterwards slowing down manufacturing so in 1953 YKK improved the machine so to have it attach at regular time intervals obsoleting their spacers and greatly speeding up the process the new design was rolled out to the hundred domestic chain machines over the next two years further improvements were made to make the machine easier to run for a single person as well as to increase each machine's production volume Yoshida and YKK strongly believed in vertical integration in 1954 Yoshida started work on an integrated campus kurobe Factory for producing everything from the metal for the wires to the textiles for the tapes they would later carry this philosophy overseas a trip to the YKK USA Factory found the company melting its own brass creating its own polyester and weaving its own zipper tapes Yoshida received pushback for doing all of this in-house but reason that having control over raw material production gave the company advantages in producing new products ykk's automation prowess their ability to produce the machines that produce the zippers and finally their control over the whole supply chain gave them Market leadership by 1958 YKK was producing enough zippers to encircle the entire Earth the proximate cause of towns decline in ykk's Rise happened in 1975. that year the company and its trade Association the slide Fastener Association failed to get the American government to restrict foreign zipper Imports Talon's share started declining in the late 1960s but it accelerated throughout the 1970s they had 70 percent of the market in 1971 and that went to just 35 percent 10 years later in 1981 but it would be a mistake to entirely blame the American government for this decline for one thing YKK was already producing zippers in the United States by then they requested entry into the U.S market as early as 1955 but failed so in 1960 they began importing zipper Parts into the United States assembling the final product on American soil finally in 1974 a year before Talon's failed petition YKK opened a factory in Macon Georgia a vertically integrated plant that took in raw materials like cotton polyester chips and metal and spat out zippers this Factory remains still in operation and actually saw a recent expansion which is nice YKK zippers since then have been marked as being made in the United States YKK has followed textile manufacturers as they traveled out of America to various low-cost labor locations around the world today they have factories in 71 countries building locally to overcome tariff barriers ykk's control of the entire supply chain gave it the nimbleness and versatility to bring down the American Giant the town itself helped things along too in 1968 the industrial conglomerate Textron acquired talent for 200 million dollars Talon's new owners were not textile experts they were brand managers and lacked the on-the-ground experience needed to keep the company ahead of its foreign competitors starting in the late 1960s Talon lost share in industrial garments increasingly their only profitable business was their traditional home sewing kit Niche which declined as more women entered the workforce and bought their own clothes they also failed to adapt to new fashion styles emphasizing Freer and more colorful clothes made from stretchier synthetic fibers YKK on the other hand offered new zippers that took advantage of these Trends the first was the concealed zipper which hides the teeth by blending into the Garment this invisibility feature has long been asked for by garment manufacturers second was the introduction of plastic injection mold zippers which can be dyed into flashy vibrant colors that appeal to the flashy vibrant Fashions of the day why am I suddenly thinking of disco anyway Textron eventually sold Talent after destroying a lot of shareholder value the company has since then bounced around between various private Equity owners a Hong Kong company called tag it Pacific Inc owns them now and they mostly produce in Asia today the zipper Market is split into three sections High middle and low end the ultra high luxury zipper markets are largely occupied by European Brands like Switzerland's Riri and Italy's lamppo the low end is dominated by random manufacturers in China or India competing exclusively on price so YKK makes his bones in the middle to high-end fashion markets about 80 percent of the company 6 billion or so annual revenue is made here but in recent years YKK has seen a substantial competitor in this neighborhood from China fujan SPS Zipper was founded in 1984 as a zipper Factory in the city of jinjang in China's fujian province founder and chairman Kang started off much like Yoshida himself as a middleman hitting other people's zippers with a hammer to test their quality but he quickly expanded into production and from there the company has aggressively charged into selling cheap but high quality zippers to mid-fashion garment manufacturers like Zara Target and Michael Kors they make about 2.2 billion RMB today or about 300 million USD far less than the Japanese giant but they also present a direct Challenge and YKK knows it in response YKK has sought to produce higher quality luxury zippers while also building aggressively in China hitting back at SBS on their home turf one might look down on the humble zipper but the product's evolution over 100 plus years is a demonstration that manufacturing can be has technologically sophisticated as any slick web app immense work and r d had to be done to produce advancements in the field which we often take for granted I for one certainly did and after doing this video it will be harder for me to see the zipper as a trifle anymore all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the Channel
