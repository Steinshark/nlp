player begins a run of Ninja Gaiden 2. but this isn't just any speedrunner this is Jimmy poopins the world record holder for Ninja Gaiden 2. and the Run he's about to perform is going to go down in speed running history see Jimmy is more than just the record holder he is by far the most dominant Runner this game has ever seen in fact at this point he might be more dominant than any other NES speedrunner for years Ninja Gaiden 2's world record was in the 10 20 to 10 30 range but when Jimmy came along in 2014 the world record started to plummet and for the last year he's been on a mission to lower it as much as possible his current record miles ahead of everyone else is 10 minutes and 11 seconds his goal is a sub 10 10. this is barely on the outskirts of what's humanly possible for anyone else a 1009 is Unthinkable but for Jimmy it's just Within Reach it would be his ultimate speedrun and as he opens up a one-second lead after act three this run looks like it could have a chance but after his fastest Act 4 Ever Jimmy is suddenly two and a half seconds in the lead and he keeps gaining time in level after level with time to save at the end this is exactly the Run Jimmy had been looking for it's the best Pace he's ever had and the pressure is mounting but he has to hold it together an unreal world record after being on the pace of his life Jimmy had clutched out the ending and broken the 1010 barrier by several seconds his massive lead had just become even bigger but what was Jimmy's reaction to this record it's done we killed it Jimmy felt that he had killed the game that the world record was dead well Jimmy's 1007 may have looked unbeatable but in speedrunning the limits are rarely what they seem to be and what unfolded over the next few years nobody could have expected this is the quest to beat Jimmy poopins [Music] thank you and now a word from this video sponsor display this plates are really cool they're metal posters that you can mount on your wall

why was this run considered to be unbeatable well here's one thing the final time was 1007 Jimmy's sum of best was 1005. over the entire Speed Run he only lost two seconds over his best seven individual acts added up in other words two seconds off of a literal perfect speed run that is unreal optimization for a game of this length so given the strategies he went for Jimmy had a nearly Flawless run but how difficult actually were these strategies well they were extremely difficult Ninja Gaiden 2 is a pretty accessible run for beginners but it's a really challenging speed run at the top level nearly every act has multiple tough tricks and we could sit here going over them all but instead here are a few of the most brutal toward the end of 3-2 you're supposed to walk along the ground then jump up and climb to move to the next screen but if you instead hesitate you can precisely time a jump off of a crescent projectile to land on the wall once there you can repeatedly jump slash to make your way through the wall and hit the screen transition from the other side this was found by jorf Ninja Gaiden 2's second place Runner and saves about a second Jimmy nailed it in this run 4-2 has a similar trick you're supposed to walk on the ground and climb up the wall to continue but if you do a precise jump off the edge then jump slash just enough to enter the wall without falling through you can make it across without having to drop down this trick was discovered by Gus Mancini and duckfest and was one of the hardest in the Run Jimmy only had about a 30 success rate with it but he went for it in this run and once again he nailed it but the hardest trick in the entire run is on the act 5 boss the ashtar quick kill several of the boss fights in Ninja Gaiden 2 have quick kills that can save a few seconds some of them can be quite tricky but the act 5 quick kill is leaps and bounce harder than the rest there's a brief period where you can damage him before his projectiles come in during which you cannot damage him it's possible to just barely kill him before this happens but your inputs need to be perfect involves precisely spacing out Firewheel shots while canceling animation so you can shoot again quicker for years this trick was thought to be Tass only but in late 2015 Jimmy was able to pull it off for the first time and ever since then because it saved four and a half seconds he knew that it was going to be an inevitable trick despite a consistency rate of roughly one in four with a lead of over two and a half seconds Jimmy knew he had to go for it in this run and guess what he executed it perfectly so now you can see why this was such an amazing record but did he make any mistakes well he had one here it was Jimmy was supposed to jump and slash to boost off the enemy but he missed and had to go up the wall it cost him one second beyond that the only time losses were frames here and there for movement this one mistake was all that Jimmy had to show for concrete time losses that's why Jimmy's official run submission said game is dead that's why his twitch highlight of the Run said world record game is dead and that's why upon completion of the Run Jimmy said these words it's done we killed it he was 16 seconds ahead of second place and in full honesty none of these guys had the skill to beat him it was a reasonable assumption that unless Jimmy wanted to play again his 1007 wouldn't be beaten and as the months began to pass that's exactly what happened thank you [Music] this wasn't the first time Ninja Gaiden 2 had had a long-standing record back in 2009 hodorubi set a 1041 that stood for over three years and in 2013 ohon said a 1025 that stood for over a year and a half until it was beaten by the current second place Runner jorf so Ninja Gaiden 2 was no stranger to long-lasting records but this one was different Jimmy was so far ahead of the rest that even though the community was active nobody had any illusions of taking his record and a great illustration of this is the Ninja Gaiden 2 tournament in May 2016 Sinister 1 organized a tournament for Ninja Gaiden 2 featuring most of the game's top runners guess who won yeah of course it was Jimmy poopins but it's not just that he won it's how he won Jimmy poopins has swept the entire top eight to become the Ninja Gaiden 2 Tournament champion congratulations to Jimmy in the best of five finals he won three to nothing including getting a 10-17 that beat the fastest run anybody else in the world had ever gotten this man was simply on another level so with his run sitting at the top of the leaderboard and nobody else close to him time began to pass see despite his massive skill Advantage Jimmy also had no desire to continue running the game he'd gone through one heck of a grind to get his 1007 and now even months later he didn't want to play anymore as 2017 came around his world record remained on top but other Runners did inch a little bit closer Gyarados arcus and ND all moved ahead of dwarf although all three were still comfortably behind Jimmy but one Runner stood Above the Rest he wasn't yet on Jimmy's level but he was improving rapidly after a series of PBS in mid-2016 he moved into second place for the first time ever someone was putting actual pressure on Jimmy meet Becco oh my God oh my God two seconds away from Jimmy's world record who was this guy how had he gotten so good Becco is a high level speedrunner across multiple games pretty much any game he touches he immediately gets a good time in and his list of World Records is impressive he's held the top spot in Mega Man 4 5 and 6 and has dominated the leaderboard in other popular games too he began running Ninja Gaiden 2 right around the time Jimmy got his 1007 and within weeks he was in the top five after taking a break for a few months Becco was ready he was going to make a push for the world record with his 1009 he moved Within Reach but people had tried and failed to even get close to the 1007 before how could he save time over such an optimized run well Becco held two distinct advantages over Jimmy the First Advantage Becco was willing and able to go for New risky strategies most of them were in act seven the last couple levels of the run in 7-1 it's possible to clip through this wall with slashes similar to the trick in 4-2 this had been known for years but Jimmy found it too risky to go for in his 1007. Becco committed to going for it and as a result was able to save half a second another Wall clip can be done later in the level going through this wall rather than having to go down and around this one is even more valuable saving about 1.3 seconds he also had new strategies on both Jackie o1 and the Act 1 boss together saving close to two seconds so when combining everything Becco could potentially save nearly 4 seconds on new strategies alone but he also had one more distinct advantage over Jimmy it's one of Ninja Gaiden 2's most beautiful mechanics if performed optimally it's something that separates the good players from the great players and Becco was amazing at it this is wall climbing [Music] in Ninja Gaiden 2 rather than climbing normally it's faster to ascend a wall by doing a series of small jumps up the side the inputs to wall jump are quite precise you jump off the wall with a up and right then move back to the wall quickly with B up and left the shorter length of time you hang Off the Wall the more time you save ideally you're only off the wall for one or two frames before moving back Becca was super talented at wall climbing even compared to Jimmy he was able to both sneak in more wall jumps and perform them more optimally he only saves fractions of a second in each section but across the run his faster movement added up to a couple of seconds so overall Becco still had to do the same hard tricks as Jimmy the ashtar quick killed the boosts and the clips but the new strategies combined with faster wall climbing meant becco's floor was a lot lower he could potentially get a run of 10 minutes flat a year ago this seemed impossible Jimmy's 1007 was unbeatable and nobody was close to him but now reality has set in Becco had ascended the mountain and he was in position to take Jimmy's record [Music] wow [Music] oh my God it had happened a new world record by roughly half a second Jimmy's 1007 had lasted for 14 months much less time than most expected so what did the new record look like well it started by bleeding a bunch of time Becco accidentally got knocked back in Acts 2 and had a slower boss kill in act 3 he failed to boost up at the end of 3-2 and once again lost time on the boss these mistakes cost him five seconds combined he was way behind Jimmy's 1007 but then his faster movement started to kick in he had much quicker wall jumps in Act 4 and cleaned up Jimmy's lone mistake in Act five going into Act 7 his deficit was down to three seconds and that's when his big time saves came into play Clips the wall climbing opportunities the boss kills when all was said and done Becca would save 3.3 seconds in act 7. enough to push him in front of the record and achieve a 1006. well congratulations poured in Becca wasn't satisfied with this record he knew he'd bled time early and in theory a run down to 10 minutes flat was possible both Becco and Jimmy were skilled enough players to take the record there but Jimmy wasn't interested his Ninja Gaiden 2 days were behind him and he was perfectly satisfied with the legacy of his 1007. Jimmy poopins had retired from Ninja Gaiden 2. but Becco on the other hand well he was just getting started [Music] foreign [Music] after more than a year of grinding after a constant stream of World Records this was becco's magnum opus he had completely taken over the Ninja Gaiden 2 leaderboard there was still a big gap between Jimmy and the others but now there was another big gap between Becco and Jimmy 10 minutes flat was a remarkable run it was a culmination of all the new tricks and strategies from the past year he got the new boss kills and clips and his movement was better than ever but what's fascinating is that even though Becco did so many things well there were still a number of mistakes he got knocked back in 3-2 got stuck on the wall in 4-1 and his jackiel 1 kill was a bit slower with that much time loss how was the run so fast well during becco's grind his sum of best started to plummet as he implemented small new time saves and his movement became even better he began to gain time in new places after months of grinding beko some of best ultimately settled at a 954 now this wasn't realistic for a full game run but it showed how much the goal posts had moved and over the past few months Becca would come to realize that a sub 10 was indeed possible if he could get a nearly perfect run from start to finish despite a huge gap between himself and Jimmy beko kept pushing to get the sub 10. he was no longer competing with anybody he was testing his own limits and challenging himself to take the run under 10 minutes he just needed to clean up one or two mistakes Becco continued playing for weeks but eventually he fell into a slump after a series of Rapid improvements suddenly he found himself unable to save any time it was as if he ran into a wall and the sub-10 barrier was his limit so Becco moved on to other games the sub 10 would still be there when he was ready it was time to take a bit of a break over the following six months the top five remained exactly the same while players were still running the game most of them were lower down on the leaderboard nobody with a shot at the record a few months later things heated up when a new Runner Wang Dao entered the top five he improved quickly getting under 1015 and then becoming just the third player ever to get a sub 1010 but he wasn't quite world record capable his sum of best was just barely below becco's time after a long and steady grind he topped out at a 1006 in May 2019 still a decent chunk away from the record meanwhile Becco himself seemed to have no desire to return at this point A year had passed since his last grind and through all that time sub 10 was still sitting right there the other top players simply weren't capable of getting it Becco had to be the guy but he didn't want to play Ninja Gaiden 2. despite being just one second away so if Becca was out and the rest of the top five were out there was only one hope of getting the sub 10. [Music] Jimmy hadn't played the game in over three years but in mid-2019 more out of boredom than anything else he decided to give it another try he had no aspirations of getting the world record or a sub 10 but with all the new tech and strategies he did want to beat his legendary 1007. after years of inactivity what type of player was Jimmy could he still compete with Becco well he knew there was one place where he was definitely outmatched wall climbing Becco had revolutionized the game with his wall climbs and it helped him pull away from Jimmy back in the day if Jimmy was serious about lowering his time he needed to improve his wall climbs so he began to drill wall climbing trying to optimize them and squeeze as much time from them as he could if Jimmy improved his wall climbing combined with the new strategies he knew that the PBS would start to pour in [Music] close yes yes [Music] that's it we got a frame count to see if that's faster than that goes Jimmy's skill hadn't gone anywhere this run wasn't the world record but it was just four frames away less than a tenth of a second it had some slowdowns early especially in 2-1 but he kept it going through the middle acts and a solid act 7 let him pull ahead of his personal best few small movement mistakes were all that prevented the sub 10. in the past beko's wall climbing separated him from Jimmy but those days were over Jimmy had officially caught up and he was a fraction of a second from getting the first sub 10. seeing Jimmy get this close Becco decided he had to come back so in the summer of 2019 beko started up The Grind again for the first time ever Becco and Jimmy were playing Ninja Gaiden 2 at the same time the race for the sub 10 was on both players were feeling the pressure this was a milestone that could only be achieved Once In A Game's history they played for weeks and each had their share of promising runs but the sub 10 still remained elusive until finally on September 7th 2019 one of them did this [Music] yes yes yes oh my God yes oh my God even after a three-year break Jimmy won the race to sub 10. it took a really clean run from start to finish with the one strange exception being act six this is usually the easiest act in the game with two easy stages and a simple boss kill but Jimmy got knocked back in 6-1 and lost a second beyond that the Run was fantastic he picked up time over the record in Acts 2 and 5 and had one of his fastest act sevens ever to gain two more seconds now Becco had put up a good fight for years he was completely dominant but the return of Jimmy was a bit too much to overcome there was still room to lower the record but Becco decided to stop his attempts and move on once more Jimmy had won the battle he was the first to get the sub 10. but this was just one moment in Ninja Gaiden 2's history there was still plenty of time left to optimize for the next year and a half the world record remained stagnant [Music] Becco and Jimmy were satisfied to leave the game alone for a while throughout all of 2020 neither of them speed ran Ninja Gaiden 2. makes an enormous effort to lower your time at this level and you have to be mentally ready for a long grind you're probably gonna have to play for months just to have a realistic chance at getting a PB and it's not like anybody was close to passing them Becco and Jimmy stood Head and Shoulders Above the Rest during this year and a half there was practically no movements on the leaderboards nobody knew entered the top five and nobody approached the sub-10 barrier no if this record is going to be improved it had to be either Becco or Jimmy and sure enough in early 2021 after a year and a half off one of them got back to the Grind it had been over a year since Becco had last played the game and three years since he last improved his time he had some unfinished business to take care of Becco still had to get his sub 10. his last grind had resulted in Failure as Jimmy beat him to it now was his chance to finish the job he wasn't going to go for many new strategies there was still time to save around the edges from Jimmy's 959 his movement was good but there were minor slowdowns that could be optimized especially in Acts 2 and 4 plus the knockback in Act 6. without anything new there was room to pick up at least a couple seconds on the record on March 4th 2021 just a few weeks into his grind Becco had a promising run thanks to a beautiful Act 2 and 4 he saved over a second and a half losing a little in act 3 due to a missed jump onto the wall with nearly free time to save in act 6 from Jimmy's knockback Becco suddenly had a two-second lead into act 7. if he could hold on for one more act this was gonna be a sub 10. just weeks into his return Becco had taken back the world record a clutch performance from start to finish and his first world record since February 2018. but still Becca wasn't quite satisfied he had that mistake in act 3 and lost a second over Jimmy's act seven there was also a faster strategy he could go for in act 1. by jumping in a four-frame window tapping left for one frame and getting lucky with hit detection it's possible to quickly grab an extra clone it's a faster route through the stage but also allows you to do a faster boss kill combined it can save over a second bottom line there was still room to improve and Becca wanted to keep going but by taking the world record he'd also gotten the attention of someone else [Music] having left his record untouched for a year and a half Jimmy was more motivated than ever and to force himself to stay motivated he was gonna stream every single day sick days and holidays included until setting another personal best he claimed his goal was beating his own 959 not caring about becco's 958 but the title was masking his true intentions Jimmy wanted the world record back he didn't know how long it would take but he was gonna stream every day until it happened while Jimmy committed to his Daily Record attempts Becco kept playing too not every day but enough to put more pressure on the record these guys both knew 958 wasn't the game's final resting place they both wanted to be the one to take it lower for weeks Becco and Jimmy grinded the game hard each having their chances at the record But ultimately Becca would be the next one to strike [Music] this run had the one second time save in act 1 and made the frame perfect jump on the wall in Act 3. it had a chance of being a massive record with a two second lead into act seven but he fell down going through the wall in 7-1 got knocked back in 7-2 and had a slower Jackie of three it finished a tenth of a second ahead of the record but this wasn't the Improvement that Becco or Jimmy was looking for still if you could get a run back to act 7 you could save multiple seconds at the end and crush the world record both Runners continued hoping to get that ultimate run and just three days later Becca would get a golden opportunity he bled a bit of time early he failed to grab the wall in act 3 and had small movement time losses elsewhere but he nailed the ashtar quit kill something he'd been doing more often lately thanks to a new method from cartina Cal Jimmy didn't like it as much but Becco credited it for making him much more consistent and as he played through Act 7 the time saves continued was this the Run Becca had been looking for [Music] [Music] this incredible run came just two months into Becco and Jimmy's simultaneous grind Becco got the extra clone in act 1 and saved three and a half seconds in act seven while the middle acts had only minor time losses this is exactly the type of run he was going for Becca was done and Jimmy on the other hand well he had yet to beat his 959 despite 60 consecutive days of streaming three records in a row from Becco including a killer 955 while Jimmy was stuck at 9 59. This Record was good enough to make Becco stop playing there really wasn't much time save left but Jimmy doubled down he changed his stream title to reflect his current goal getting the world record back he wasn't stopping until he did it no matter how long it took May passed without any improvements then June passed and then July Jimmy had been playing for over 100 consecutive days and still he couldn't beat his 959 the situation was getting desperate he was tired of being in second place but then in August that changed oh my God what is this what is this what is this is that it is that something and clunk we did it we got the subject I don't believe it what a grind what a grind it's time that was it we just got a sub 10 in Ninja Gaiden too and just like that Jimmy poopins was kicked out of the top two the guy to do it was Arcus a speedrunning legend the same man who'd set 16 consecutive Ninja Gaiden One World Records it's no surprise that when he put some effort into Ninja Gaiden 2 he was able to ascend to the top of that leaderboard too and after a month's long grind he beat Jimmy by a quarter of a second now in all honesty these two players weren't on the same level arcus's son of best was 956 slower than the world record while Jimmy's was in the 940s but by going for more consistent strategies Arcus was able to get more runs with a chance at sub 10. there was no way he was beating beko but a 959 was just within his capabilities and he got it Jimmy poopins was now in third place well one thing was clear this strategy wasn't working for Jimmy he'd been playing for months straight and had only moved down on the leaderboard he was still committed to playing every single day but maybe he had to rethink his approach he could stick to more consistent strategies like Arcus did and try to whittle his time down that way but no that's not who Jimmy poopins is five years ago when he set his legendary 1007 he did it by going all out by leaving no Stones unturned so rather than play it safe Jimmy decided to do a deep dive into the game he was going to look for optimizations everywhere he could a screen by screen analysis to save as much time as possible and the end result hopefully would be a new and improved version of Jimmy poopins [Music] first Jimmy took another look at his wall climbs he calculated exactly how many jumps he needed for each section trying to squeeze out extra ones wherever possible his goal was to have a game plan every time he had the wall climb rather than hoping for the best he'd say I need exactly five jumps on this wall three on this wall and four on this wall it helped his consistency and the extra wall jump save time too he also looked to remove uses of the Invincible Firewheel in Acts 4 and 5. this weapon makes you invincible for a short period helping make sections of the Run much easier but to activate it you have to stop moving and press up and B which costs about two frames avoiding the Firewheel across all of Acts 4 and 5 saves a few tenths of a second but it does make the stages more difficult since Jimmy was going all out he committed to it hoping to get that small time save every run in 3-2 he was going for a new strategy related to the Crescent Jump by slowing down with up and B you can get the Crescent guy to rap to the other side of the screen you can then boost off of his Crescent making it to the wall much faster than the old Crescent boost and also avoiding any frame perfect or random jumps and on jackie03 Jimmy started using slash cancels where you end the slash animation early by Landing or jumping by doing this repeatedly you can get more slashes in and ultimately kill the boss faster so after months with no results Jimmy had a new game plan this was going to make the run harder as a whole but it could pay off in the long run at least nobody could say he wasn't trying he continued on with his Daily Grind and once again weeks passed without an improvement but then on day 183 of the grind Jimmy had this run [Music] thank you finally man it wasn't a world record but it was something his first Improvement in two years Jimmy was back in second place the Run failed to capitalize on some of the big time saves but had excellent wall climbing and three fast jackieo fights after six months of non-stop grinding Jimmy finally had something to show for it this run reinvigorated Jimmy his deep thought if it paid off and he was playing better than ever if he could clean up a few mistakes the world record was right around the corner and a short while later he got more help courtesy of tool-assisted speedrunners from China a couple new wall clips the big one was in 4-2 you have to tap right for only one frame 1 60th of a second then immediately switch to left but it allows you to clip through the wall rather than going up and around since it saved close to a full second Jimmy decided to commit to going for it things were looking up Jimmy was playing at his best and he had new strategies to boot it was time to make one last push for the world record his daily streams continued but the results weren't there weeks went by without Improvement and then months his daily counter was in the 200s the clip in 4-2 was killing a lot of runs and he wasn't able to capitalize on the rest logic says he probably should have just skipped the 4-2 clip but he refused eventually the counter passed the one year mark and still no world record Jimmy's confidence had plummeted he was rarely ever on record Pace new strategies and all he couldn't beat Becco he was close to giving up but on day 407 Jimmy got a glimmer of hope it was a beautiful Pace he had cleaned up an Act 2 mistake and kept it going through act three he got to the clip in 4-2 I and nailed it this was one of his best Paces ever into ashtar it would be a good time to get the quick kill [Music] we're having that problem one damage short and it cost him four seconds run over right [Music] [Music] a miraculous 957 Jimmy had just lowered his PB for the second time in over 400 Days had he gotten the ashtar quick kill he would have crushed the world record his grind was finally starting to pay off despite being a very small Improvement Jimmy took a huge leap forward with this run he had essentially played a better Speed Run than the world record now he just had to finish the job the job that started 407 days ago [Music] it was a good looking run right from the get-go he kept it close with the record and was only very slightly behind thanks to a missed boost in 5-2 then it was time for ashtar and as the Run progressed suddenly it all made sense this is why Jimmy had been at the grind for well over a year this is why he refused to budge from his hard strategies he didn't just want the world record he wanted the best run he was capable of getting [Music] it was a test of his own limits and when it was all done Jimmy didn't know how to react a 453 day Journey had suddenly come to an end what do you do [Music] I don't think I've ever cried on stream before but I'm like I'm at that point it only takes 453 days [Music] my new lucky number Becco is a great rival but it wasn't just his quest it was also Jimmy's quest to beat Jimmy poopins thanks for watching [Music] thank you
