as you know we're currently crowdfunding Snow White and the Widow Queen a beautiful storybook uh written by myself and illustrated by Heather pollington and I thought it'd be a great time to feature some old Patron only videos that interpret fairy stories and so the last one we put out was Jack and the Beanstalk which talks about hierarchy and moving up and the seed and I in contrast with that I had also done an interpretation of The Princess and the P which is related to Jack and the Beanstalk might sound strange but uh go ahead and enjoy and you'll see how it is that those two stories are related [Music] this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] so we're going to talk about the Princess and the Pea The Princess and the Pea is a fairy tale which was written by KRON Hans Christian Anderson and usually I don't like to interpret fairy tales that are and have an author you could say that are written by an individual but uh because this story has an interesting relationship to Jack and the Beanstalk which I interpreted last time I thought it would be uh it would be a good way to show people how these themes connect to each other and how they have surprising links between stories story of The Princess and the Pea is very simple most people know it very well a prince is looking for a princess but every princess that he meets he uh he doubts whether or not she's a real princess and so he goes out on a trip and he travels all the different kingdoms around his own kingdom to find a real princess but every time he meets a princess there's something off about her you know she's too tall she's too pretty she's not pretty enough she's uh she has certain faults which means that she is not able to see her he always has doubts on whether or not she's a real princess and so he comes back to the kingdom disappointed that he wasn't able to find his real princess and one day a strange woman comes to the door knocks on the door of the castle they let her in she's she's drenched he's dripping wet and all she can say is I'm a real princess and so the prince is astounded to hear her say something like that but they don't know whether who she is they don't know where she's from they have no idea whether or not what she's saying is true and so the mother of the prince uh devises a test to find out whether or not this is true she places a p at the bottom of 20 mattresses and 20 uh blankets and the princess you know dries herself gets dressed for the night and then she sleeps on these 20 mattresses now the next day when they wake up the the mother asks the princess whether or not she slept well and the answer is of course no I didn't sleep well there was something keeping me up there was something hard in the bed which was preventing me from sleep and through that that is how they recognize that in fact the princess is a real princess and the prince and the princess get married and they live happily ever after now the story might seem very strange at first glance uh but oh there's always a a question we need to ask why these stories persist why they continue to to uh gain our attention um and a way to look at the manner in which there's meaning in this story is to see it related to the story of Jack and the Beanstalk I talked about the story of Jack and the Beanstalk in my last uh interpretation of a fairy tale in that story the mother is a widow and she's very poor and one of the characteristics that she has is that she is when uh Jack presents her with the magic beans she is incapable of recognizing the value of the beans you could say that she's incapable of recognizing the seed and there's a relationship with her being a widow not having having lost seed having lost the the the the man in her life having lost the father of of Jack um being adrift you know and also not having access to meaning there's a relationship between that um and her incapacity to recognize the seed to recognize the the being that Jack presents with her now in the story of the princess you can see that it's the opposite the way to recognize whether or not the woman is the princess is her capacity to recognize the seed is her capacity to be sensitive and to discern the seed even though it is very far away from her and under all these different mattresses in the structure you can also see a very interesting idea which is that the mother is a poor Widow so she's down below and she can't recognize the scene uh so the so Jack has to climb up above and get it from the hierarchy in this story it's the opposite the princess is up above on the 20 mattresses and the 20 quilts and she has to be able to recognize the seed which is below she has to be able to find in the uh the the potentiality that is below below the Earth you could say she has to be able to discern the the seed so the symbolism is very much related to the masculine feminine symbolism in in fact you could say that with the princess has to show is that she is what we could call The Good Earth in the parable of the sower you see there the the story of Christ in the parable of the sower Christ throws the seed out uh on the ground some seed Falls next to the path and so it can't find its roots uh and and so the birds come and take it away another one Falls in these rocks and so it's not the right type of Earth and so the seeds aren't able to have good roots and so when they come up they die um and so and and some of the seed you know Falls in The Good Earth and the sea that falls in The Good Earth is able to produce a tree and is able to produce the uh the fruit of the of the seed and so you could say that the The Good Earth is the earth which is capable of recognizing uh you know being a host to the seed and we can see that there's a relationship in in all of that because the prince goes out into the world he goes very very far away he goes on this journey to find the princess and and there's a relationship between that going out very far trying to find good potential you could say out in the world and the stranger who presents herself to the door and so the stranger has the relation has this idea of being this potentiality this unknown potentiality which presents itself to you uh you know this this this kind of dark possibility you know she's she's wet she's covered in water and so there's this relationship also between chaos she arrives during the storm so there's this this strange unknown potentiality which presents itself to to the prince um and the prince has to discern whether or not this potentiality is the uh the the right potentiality for him so imagine this is this is just something which is related to everyday life so you know you have some possibility which presents itself to you some opportunity a job opportunity someone uh you know comes through your door and and talks to you about something that they want you to get involved in and the question is you know you have to now discern whether or not this is a good potential a good potential for you whether or not this is the right job whether or not this is something you should get involved in because there are all these ma all these things always present themselves to you and you have to find a way to know whether or not these this is the right possibility and the way that you know whether or not it's the right possibility is the capacity of that possibility to recognize your seed to know to be able to connect with you in a in a in an almost sexual manner in order to to give forth some fruit in the in the future for it to to produce fruit something like that um and so the princess herself with what's interesting to know is you can notice that in the story there's a this idea of memory I've told you about memory in other talks this idea that memory is what connects you to the center to your meaning even though you move far away so you have some core some identity something which uh which uh is the most important thing about you something which uh makes you something and as you move further and further away you know you're always in a danger of forgetting of not being able to stay connected to that Center and in the story what you're seeing is the capacity of the princess to discern the seed from far away and so you you have these layers and layers and layers imagine them as as these multiple garments of skin that I always talk about these multiple garments that are added and added and added and the the question is are you able to still stay connected to the center even though you're far away and the story presented in a very very intelligent and subtle way because it is it relates it to sleep now sleep has to do with death has to do also with distraction I told you before the story of the disciples Christ uh comes to mount Gethsemane and he goes up the mountain and he tells the disciple as Christ is leaving them you know moving further away from them he tells them you know stay awake do not fall asleep stay awake and pray but as he leaves them they get they've they get distracted and they fall asleep and so this is the story of the princess on the top of the mattresses the idea is that she's incapable of being distracted she's incapable of falling asleep because she is so sensitive that she is able to discern the center discern the P from very far away and so she she doesn't forget she's incapable of forgetting and it's funny because in the story it's almost it almost seems like it's a um like she's like she's too she's too difficult you know she's so difficult that she's capable of sleeping on these 20 mattresses but that's what makes her the princess because even though she's very she could be very very far away she's this strange possibility which presents itself to them you know this this chaotic potential it she is capable of being connected to the seed even though she comes from far away she's able to not forget to to not be distracted by death by Sleep by all that imagery of of moving out moving away from from your core from your identity and so I think this this can also be related to the notion that even of fidelity the idea of a the idea that the princess will remain uh will will remain true to the prince because even though she's very very far away she will not forget the seed not forget the meaning not forget her her connection uh to to that reality to her it to her wedding with the prince and so all of these things are kind of in implied let's say in the story uh in the story symbolism so uh so I hope that this can help you understand how this story relates to Jack and the Beanstalk but also relates to our very existence and how this notion of The Good Earth or the good potential is capable of recognizing meaning capable of being connected to meaning even though it comes from far away or even though it is something which is moving away from the center [Music] thank you I'm Jonathan Pedro and I'm

decades we have watched many of our stories our fairy tales our myths become completely exhausted by efforts to deconstruct them to reinvent them and sometimes to even invert their original meaning it
