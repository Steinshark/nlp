you don't have the attention span to last for two chess games that says a lot more about you than it does about my content I'm just going to say that by the way book back there pre-order links in the description UK y'all get 25 off right now it's in Spain as well and it is definitely in the US if you're in Europe check it out on Amazon D4 from the jadabasa versus Fabiano caruana and then we just we have an absolute Banger of a matchup coming up after this I mean my God Knight F6 Knight F3 D5 and in this position against Magnus Carlsen played the dreaded the feared the notorious London system but not in this game in this game the Jada boss have went for a Queen's Gambit he played the move C4 which is really weird why he starts with this move order like he he could just start with this move order but he really likes to play Knight F3 because I guess it makes his opponent commit one of the Pawns if Bobby plays E6 we have a queen's gamma Decline and now it's up to White to decide what you're going to do in this position are you going to play the two knights are you going to play the Catalan what are you going to do you're going to play the Catalan okay Bobby thinks for a little bit plays Bishop E7 you will remember that Fabi played something against uh Prague do you remember that no you remember anything that's fine don't you don't have to remember anything he played a really sharp line against Prague in the classical chess portion and then he uh and then he was like uh better and then it was it was a good game uh Bishop G2 castles castles now DC so Fabi actually plays the exact same thing and the Catalan meta is that black can either keep it closed or take and say do your worst and white is basically saying if you take my Pawn I'm gonna try to win it back with a variety of different you know approaches uh I will put my pieces in a way that will restrict you I also have the opportunity to take the entire Center or utilize my very powerful Bishop basically a long Battle of will white proven opening advantage or is black mega mega mega Giga Chad as Grand Masters say Asics the first idea if you take right away B5 long time ago this has already been proven to equalize for black but there is absolutely no Advantage here whatsoever for white so the meta nowadays is to stop B5 by playing A4 and now the meta is to play Bishop D7 and Bishop to C6 uh or Rush that process and play B5 right away there there are a bunch of crazy lines where actually black is equalizing after the move uh B5 right away as well um but okay Bishop D7 is the move chosen in the game by Fabiano and now Bishop to C6 this is the same exact approach that he uh he took against Prague now Bishop G5 uh in that game I think Bishop F4 was played and then Fabi played Bishop D6 and then it was like Queen C1 and he like tried to and and basically Fabi took here and then put his Knight on C6 it was a it's kind of kind of a weird position it was like not exactly this but kind of this it was like Knight C6 and if you play E3 there was like a G5 in there very very weird opening uh but nijad plays Bishop G5 so we're not going to get any of that we have Knight D7 Knight C3 now Fabi asks where the bishop is going the bishop goes back to that desired uh F4 Square you may ask why white when here inducing this move now the pawn on H6 could potentially be a Target so you you could use the pawn as a battering ram that's called a hook a pawn that's left in front of an opponent's territory that could you you could use as an entrance Point by either trading or sacrificing is called a hook Bishop D6 played by Fabi and now the queen drops back to the D3 square and Fabi trades and plays A5 uh you'll notice that fabi's really not thinking neither is nijot uh nijot has played 14 moves without thinking whatsoever now at this point Fabi could play Queen E7 or Knight B6 or try to get developed this exchange uh simplifies down the position white gets doubled F pawns but could potentially have a powerful attack Brewing over here uh and maybe maybe it was time to strike right away because after for example take taken Knight takes B5 which looks like a free Pawn uh black is creating some very meaningful pressure on the queen side that is probably just going to lead to equal uh equality which is what I said is you know the meta but uh Fabi plays A5 which is kind of a slow move and now ninja plays King H1 so he spends five minutes and he goes here listen when a guy plays King H1 he's he's got one thing on his mind okay uh and uh and it's it's very nefarious he's you know men men are only interested in one thing and it's mating checkmating King to H1 Rook to G1 and and I mean fabi's potentially gonna come under Fire now as you see from the eval the attack is nothing right now and now fubby takes um that's a big decision and that's why he spent four minutes okay clearly Fabi didn't like something I think Fabiano was like look if nijot gets this and then you know gets to play Knight E5 we're still gonna trade Bishops but the way we're gonna do it is I'm just gonna help him so rather than helping his Knight get to E5 why don't I just get rid of this and by the way remember I just showed you he did that against Prague as well he took on F3 so it's clearly a common idea in the position all right that didn't happen in this game but instead he took the Knight like this and basically said I'm gonna block out your light squared Bishop uh and the job played Rook G1 uh nijot has played 17 moves and he hasn't spent a whole lot of time and now Fabi plays King h8 stepping off of the g-file now multiple moves exist uh you could try to take the center you could probably double like I would probably play Rook G2 uh but the job plays E4 also not spending a huge amount of time black could play something like Knight C5 but as long as you don't take and hang your queen you know you're gonna be in good shape now it's fabi's turn to think of how to deal with the incoming Avalanche but clearly he set this up because he knows what he's doing Queen E7 uh but now Rook G3 so the best move here for black was apparently Knight G8 I mean that's and the idea is here the Knight goes to E7 white doubles black plays rigid and basically just sits there and uh says I'm not losing and Fabi plays Queen E7 very simple approach here by white which is doubling the Rooks on the G file which is like the entire thing that he did and now Fabi plays Rook G8 and the chocolate Z5 so I mean like White's position is playing itself now Fabi has to retreat the Knight he Retreats it toward the king to meet F5 with you know Knight G5 and also Knight E5 which is why nichot plays this move enabling the move F5 now Fabi can play F5 himself uh he can also potentially play Queen before to put pressure on this and if y tries to bulldoze you just take and if white plays something like Bishop H5 attacking this you you can go here it's ugly but it does the job um but Knight B6 is what Fabi chooses nijap plays Bishop to E4 I mean it's very clear what nijot wants uh he would like to you know put a lot of pressure here and now now Fabi needs to respond I mean he can play a five if on pass on Knight F6 if he doesn't on pass on there's not going to be an attack or Pawn to G6 or even you know Queen D7 attacking the pawn uh from this angle but Fabi goes here and suddenly he realizes something the threat of the bishop on the night was not to take it it was just you know to enable this but actually it was because as it turns out that allows the Knight to go to the middle nijat does not have to protect this Pawn if this Knight G5 is the Killer if King h8 Knight F7 if takes the king is walked into the center of the board well center of the action and Checkmate it Knight to E4 and Fabi has to play King h8 he he can't find his bearings plays Queen E7 and ninja just plays F5 this was one of them and Fabiano resigns the game he resigns the game because this opens the door for the queen and after Pawn takes there is just Knight F6 check and if you take you get Queen sacked and you get mated ladder made it in the middle of a game with no queen or no night what F5 EF5 leads to Knight F6 check and you can't even take it and if King h8 the same problem and Rook G8 is made after you take with the second Rook Fabiano caruana just played like four or five moves in a row completely underestimating the attack and and ninjag has still oh sorry has still only lost to Magnus Carlsen he just beat the number two ranked player in the world who is now the number three ranked player in the world I think because of the ratings but oh my God who is this man this is ridiculous he just beat fobby like I mean Fabi I I think it's just first of all I think it's hard to play a third place match like you know you you already made the candidates they're not even playing for anything because technically the winner of this match would make it to the candidates but they're both gonna make it to the candidates because Magnus isn't playing the candidates he told me he DM me it was like bro your hairline is terrible also I'm not playing the candidates so nijan abasav takes a one to nothing lead and Fabiano has to win tomorrow here it is ladies and gentlemen this is the main event of the evening any UFC fans uh fighting out of the blue Corner we have probably not that I I don't know how much he weighs or anything like that uh this is a huge match once again let me read off a couple of Statistics to you last year went viral for beating Magnus in the online rapid tournaments uh he is not the he is not the number one ranked player in India it's gookesh but he is probably the most popular young chess player in India uh which is uh which is saying a lot because India carries over a billion people and and over like 120 000 people were watching this match Live on YouTube uh on one channel combined probably in the two or three hundreds um Prague is the youngest World Cup finalist ever at 18 years of age Prague is now the third youngest candidate player ever because he qualifies for the candidates behind only Bobby Fischer and Magnus Carlson hopefully he ends up more like Magnus than like Bobby um and uh and this is Magnus Carlson's first ever World Cup final so like you I mean it's like you know it's like mbappe versus Messi not really I don't know who is who but you know that's what it is Prague plays the move C4 so it's gonna be a banger of a game uh it's gonna be a banger of a match and uh gukesh could not beat Magnus so let's see if Prague can beat Magnus this is the battle for the future of Chess we have an English uh Magnus actually spends two minutes on his first move he wasn't late he just was trying to kind of get into the zone and probably the other thing is they've also trained together Prague has trained at magnus's training camp there's photos uh Magnus gave Prague a pat on the shoulder after he knocked out Hikaru like he respects these these young Indian players he respects Prague I don't know if he's done any training with gukesh I'm sure he respects gukesh but um so we have a four nights and now white has the option to play E3 or G3 or E4 or even A3 um and he plays G3 now you will notice Magnus is actually thinking a lot uh in this position he probably could have gone for E4 uh which is this kind of new edgy Gambit with Ponto C6 uh it's a very very sharp line and I think it was simply too risky uh there was this kind of very goofy line here H5 and and black is trying to equalize while gambiting a pawn but instead we have Knight C6 D5 which is the most principled move of course here you can also Play Bishop to B4 and Magnus plays the sharpest way um and now Bishop G2 and now Magnus plays a weird move uh he plays a really weird move so in this position the most common move by far by black is to get out of this sniper and play Knight B6 F6 Bishop E6 Bishop E7 very very solid line and then it's up to White to kind of instigate on the queen side and try to prove an advantage um or you can play Bishop C5 that's also gotten very popular nowadays the move that Magnus plays in this game I have never seen in my life because I feel like it's just a stupid looking move it's obviously not I'm I'm saying it looks stupid he goes back to the square where he just was they say okay well what's the difference between reaching well the difference is why would you do that why would you develop take the center and return to where you like you're not even going there where you can at least you know fight for equity on this in the center with the other night and maybe this is fine I don't know you know maybe this is really not that bad you don't need to fight for the squares on the queen side in fact Magnus has played this once before in the year 2020 against yanypomdishi and hero white can play D3 castles blah blah blah blah a3b4 Prague plays B4 right away that's gangster that is a gangster move in fact he plays B4 which has only been played two other times and one of them was against Magnus in the year 2020 Yan yipomnishi played the move B4 against Magnus to try to instigate with the move B5 and if you take with a knight I get this I open up my Bishop your knight can't return home and if you take with the bishop I take the pawn I open up the bishop the Knight can't return home because if you take Queen A4 check and I actually win back my material like this and black structure is very bad in that game Magnus played Asics he prevented Yan from playing B5 and then it was like A3 Bishop D6 Bishop B2 blah blah blah I don't remember the game I just saw it before I made this recap uh in this game Magnus allows the move B5 he says you know what Prague go ahead do your worst Pawn to B5 instigating against the Knight now the Knight can move because the bishop guards the center pawn and Prague plays Queen A4 you'll notice that proc has not spent much time he clearly knows this position this is somewhere in his notes uh putting a lot of pressure on the Knight here so it has to take think about the fact that black has now made 10 moves one two three one two three sixty percent of Black's ten moves have been with knights and one of them doesn't even exist anymore I would say this is a win black is still trying to prove equality he plays A6 because if Pawn takes Rook takes is a nice approach by black prod plays D3 getting this bishop out you can't take because of the pressure here the bishop is gonna have to develop at some point H6 first let's stop Prague from developing his Bishop to the active Square so he goes the other way goes the other way tries to trade off that Bishop the Rooks are gonna come here play on the B and C files and he's gonna you know you'll notice that Prague has now spent all of his time advantage on castling and all of this so Rook B8 proc takes Magnus takes with a c Pawn interesting not with the queen brings a helping hand here maybe wants to take a center majority also wants to use the open C file prop plays Rook B1 Magnus takes and basically the the imbalance here is these two pawns if they get traded it's gonna be a draw pawns on the same side d e f g h Queen B6 pro golfers of Queen trade trying to move forward if you take I have pressure here very unpleasant for black Black's gonna have to kind of counter attack so instead of that Magnus seals the pressure now if you take like this then I'm going to take and if you take like this I'm actually just going to win your knight so that night like you got to be careful you gotta uh lpdo loose pieces drop off I think Daniel narodiski says that lpdo uh Queen d8 Rook d8 take take now we have this position to work with Prague house and outside pass Pawn so the funny thing is about this position is that if I saw this end game and I was like oh Magnus is playing white oh he's gonna win you know my doggy is snoring behind me you can't hear it but it's very adorable he's running in his sleep his like arms are twitching so cute uh get a dog it'll change your life seriously like I it was so hard to raise this puppy and now I don't I would get a tattoo of him like of his paw or something because I love him so much anyway you're not here for the sentimental stuff into G2 white is going to try to win this game by advancing his a pawn putting pressure on the pawns here but let's not forget if Mac 's playing Black this is playing for a win whatever color he is playing like uh Rook C1 and now now D5 and I got news for you like if Prague doesn't act you know if prog just like Magnus actually has more pressure here than Prague uh as long as he doesn't walk into any checks can't take because of the pin but um why is that like why is black actually playing for win and outside pass Pawn is only powerful if it can go forward if it can't go forward you're just gonna kick out its Defender and win the pawn so it right now it's actually still a liability like it's to be determined if this Pawn is an asset or not and Magnus has a very powerful Central Clump if he trades one pair of Rooks the other one is going to laser beam here so Knight D7 kicks The Rook out and now we have a threat of a repetition right like the players could repeat moves but I got news for you if that were to happen Magnus would probably put his Knight here and then bring his King and then Advance with his pawns and try to win using his Central Armada so Prague undevelops to be one Magnus centralizes his Knight and now here comes the pressure on the C file all proc can do is play against magnus's weakness Knight B1 the Knight is hanging and so is the pawn behind it the night moves the night goes here temporarily delaying the capture on C6 because actually if you rush with that capture then uh my attack is much faster on these pawns all right so you got to be real careful doing all of this so Knight to D2 Knight F3 Magnus goes here and tries to give away his Pawn to damage Prague structure but product says no thank you I'm not going to double my pawns Rook A2 Knight E3 and uh the players agree to withdraw after 35 moves nothing to choose between them three pawns three pawns Rook Knight Rook Knight Prague makes a draw with the white pieces against Magnus after a interesting opening idea Pawn to B4 but we don't get much from this one it's all gonna come down to tomorrow can Magnus Carlson defeat Prague with the white pieces to win the World Cup or will they make another draw and go to a tie break or will prog win Prague could win if Magnus overextends I'll see you tomorrow get out of here
