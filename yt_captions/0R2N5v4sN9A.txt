today i'm i'm i'm reading an author whose name is maurizio ferraris he wrote the book just recently several years ago uh by the time the title is manifesto del nuevo of realism realism meaning that we're we're finding the ontology again and and and trying to avoid mixing or irresponsibly ontology and epistemology that's the kind of the base of his of his argument where post-modernism kind of perpetuated that confusion between ontology and epistemology okay that's that's it well it's great to meet it's great to meet everybody um and so i i am mostly an artist that's mostly my job i'm a icon carver and um but now i through my coming to icon carving you could say part of it was also rediscovering an ancient language we're discovering of an ancient visual language uh that bubbled up and developed in christianity i always say that if you know in the time of dante maybe a little bit before but i would say even still in the time of dante if you had been in a church pretty much anywhere in the world whether in italy or in syria or in constantinople or in france you would have seen essentially the same thing there was a patterned language which had come up and this pattern language had become a universal language and so it was in part in discovering this pattern language also discovering the pattern language that was in scripture and the pattern language that was in architecture and in liturgy all of these things together is what slowly led me to another aspect of what i'm doing which is to talk about symbolism and to try to show people the underlying patterns of stories which i believe to be the underlying patterns of reality itself um and and i think that to the to to uh franco's point this right now in this moment in the historical moment as a lot of scientists are focusing on consciousness and there's a lot of scientists that are hitting a wall we could say hitting the wall of consciousness the problem of emergence and complexity all of these are bringing us back to the question of pattern and how pattern participates in the way the world reveals itself to you the way the world appears right so the world appears to us as patterned and this is something which it can help us by looking at the old stories it can help us rediscover these these patterns again which are really the pattern of reality and in dante this is dante is one of the masterpieces of this showing participating helping us see the pattern helping us see how this pattern that he draws which is basically a u-shaped pattern right the descent and ascent is not only the pattern of the cosmos in the largest way and i don't mean scientifically it's really important to to always remember that i'm not talking about the way that science describes the world but the way that we experience the world the way that we are able to perceive meaning in the world okay and so this pattern that he draws of this descent and ascent um of this hierarchy of being you would say it appears at all the different layers of reality so it's not just a cosmic pattern right it's it's the pattern of your day it's the pattern of your story um but it's also the pattern of a thought or the pattern of a breath you know that that just breathing in and breathing out follows that just rhythmic that rhythmic pattern okay um what's fascinating about dante is that he is able to show us this pattern of the mountain you would say or the descent of the ascent the low and the high um and he does it in a way where he connects all the levels of reality together while he's giving us the pattern and it's such a genius it's such a genius work obviously it's not doesn't stand alone it's it's based uh it's connected to other works of literature that are there before of course homer and virgil but also you know there seems to be very strong similarities between dante's comedy and uh uh ibn ibn arabi's el isra there's there was a flowering of sufi mysticism at the time just a few centuries before and uh there there seems to be a very very close connection between the way that the comedy is described and the way that ibn arabi talks about his own dissent and ascent he wrote a book called el isra which means the nocturnal voyage and is also mapped on to muhammad's voyage muhammad's voyage up the heavenly spheres the levels of hell everything is very very similar even the beginning of the tale where dante encounters animals is something that you see in in arabi's work um and it's so funny because it has brought scholars to say that dante copied arabi and that it's a work of plagiarism the dante's work of plagiarism all this you know we've been we've been seeing in the past century you know they're just this anti-kind of anti-christian desire to destroy everything uh but that's the wrong way to look at it it's really the wrong way to look at it because dante's work doesn't just connect to something like araby's descent and ascent but it also connects to other stories that have been told forever um if you've if you've never heard of sangre of nisa's life of moses for example sen gregor of niece's life of moses follows the exact same pattern as dante's a descent and ascent it's not as detailed it's not uh as explicit in terms of of levels but you can see in in um in san gregor nisa the idea of moses crossing the red sea so going down through the red sea and then ascending up the mountain to receive the revelation of god is of course the the the same pattern there's also a book in the 7th century just before the advent of islam called the latter of divine descent i don't know if you all of you are aware of this book it's a book written by a a monk let me show i'll show you a picture of it of the icon which has become famous um oh i forgot i need to share screen all right all right can you see okay right so this is this is a 12th century version of an icon but which was based on the book by saint john klimacus in the seventh in the writer right at the beginning of the seventh century um and it's the latter of divine essence his book is a mystical treatise on the manner in which we are to be deified the manner in which we are to become to become god by participation um and so you can see that the world is presented as a ladder as a as a series of steps or a series of levels and the monks are ascending the ladder up above you can see the choir of angels and down below you can see hell you can see that they're kind of in flames and usually it's harder it's harder to see if you look at the very bottom of you see where there's a monk falling down and he's kind of falling into something he's falling into the mouth of something it's like the mouth of a monster and usually in other icons this will be represented as a kind of monstrous head and of course the entire pattern itself is there in the story of christ himself the story of christ is a descent and an ascent the death and resurrection of christ in the tradition is presented exactly as this descent into hades uh whereas in christ's case it's a little different than in dante in dante he's he's almost like a voyager who who travels and sees whereas in christ's case he conquers he he goes down into hades and he conquers um let me show you let's pick one okay so okay so this is a this is an icon of the anastasis which is the descent into hades and uh and it's based on the gospel of nicodemus which is an apocryphal gospel but this detail of the of the of the story of christ has been taken into tradition and so this icon is a fully the orthodox icon it's a fully legitimate icon and so we see christ going down into hell and he breaks the doors of hell so you can see these two things here these are the doors of hell and then down below is uh hades who is being tied down sometimes there are two characters sometimes there's the devil and and death and most often it's just death so death is bound and christ is now getting ready to go back up and is ready to ascend into heaven and to bring with him um adam and eve so this is adam and eve and the patriarchs are there as well the the people who died before christ's resurrection um right so let me just show you this before i get back into dante i just want to help you to get a sense of how this pattern is really a no this is not good all right let's see what's the best one right so can you see you can i mean can you see the icon here it gives you a sense so yeah yeah okay so the world so the entire this is this is now the entire cosmos which is represented again as a hierarchy um so you know in dante what happens is you have you have hell then you have purgatory and then purgatory kind of comes up to the garden of eden and then from the garden of eden then there are the heavenly spheres which go up to the prime mobile where you reach you know the infinite or you reach the non-duality contains like that or something like that um and so the icon of the last judgment has that pattern but the bottom of the icon here is the garden of eden so it's already the top of the mountain you would say okay so the garden of eden is here and you see all the saints are gathered into the garden of eden the souls fall down into tartarus down into hell and you can see this big mouth here the mouth that i told you about is down here and then the saints are organized in choirs of saints which ascend all the way up to the highest sphere where you have christ and you have the mother of god and saint john the foreigner um and in here see down here next to are you seeing my cursor when i move it okay so this is this is adam and eve okay and so this is happening you could say right after the anastasis right after the descent into haiti so christ takes man and woman you know takes humanity itself takes the the the forefathers and so the the seed of man and pulls it up into the highest sphere and so this is the ultimate this is the same moment you would say as dante's uh apotheosis dante's reaching you know the prime mobile and encountering god probably not totally though because dante's dante's last moment is is above the icon it's not it's not represented because the last the last encounter uh both uh ibn arabi and dante their last encounter is a is a is a non-personal encounter right it's a peeking into the divine nature you could say it's almost heretical like it's a it comes right up to the the non-personal transpersonal aspect of the divine where he sees and that's why at the end it's almost like it's it's these abstract you guys you haven't read it so yet but it's it's like these astrak ribbons that are kind of pulling the the the mystic the mystic into this divine light or this over this over light san gregory nissa he talks about the divine darkness that the the darkness which is so the light which is so strong that it is it is blinding and so that the first so the first thing i wanted to to to show you was mostly the idea that the the pattern that dante uses so the pattern that dante uses is really a pattern which is not limited to dante right it's it has a long history right right away from the the ancient stories ancient myths and then it has several you could say several brothers and sisters in storytelling including people like saint gregory saint ephrem the syrian also very important in this structure from the syrian wrote a book called the hymns on paradise which many scholars see as one of the sources of the quran and the hymns on paradise are this beautiful it's just such an amazing text it shows you this mountain of paradise and it talks about it shows us the fall of man and the effects ontological effects of the fall but also the ontological effects of this going up the mountain and reaching into the top of the of the mountain so the importance in terms of dante's pattern what's really important to understand there are a few things that i think are the most important one of the most important is uh what franco mentioned before is that dante wrote in la and didn't write in latin he wrote in italian he wrote in common italian this is something which to a lot of people seems mysterious but it's it's not mysterious once you realize that the gospels were also written in in the vulgar greek the the gospels were written in coiny greek which was the common the common language of the day and it has to do with the desire to span all aspects right to go all the way down to to be able to show that everything is connected right if you can express the highest aspect if you can express the nature of the infinite in a common language then you are actually connecting the levels of the latter together right you're you're not you're not and it really is it ends up being like a christian message in the sense that there is a sense in which all of this is really connected and that all of this is able to express this pattern like this this powerful pattern um and so then what he does in the story is that he then shows you that the pattern this pattern of the mountain or the pattern of paradise the parent the pattern of the hierarchy is a it's a fractal pattern so so what do i mean by a fractal pattern it means that the pattern of dante's comedy is happening in the story itself it's also happening in his cosmic telling of the story that is the entire cosmos is resolving itself into the top of this hierarchy but then it's also happening at all the different levels that dante is talking so dante has a cosmic aspect which is the entire creation how it participates in this pattern up to the angels in all of this then there's a specific christian pattern which is to connect the story of christianity so as he ascends he reaches different he encounters different prophets different saints different um different angels and ultimately he sees the mother of god in in one of the highest fears as this ultimate image you know of his beloved being transformed into this universal this universal thing um but there's also other stories there's also his own personal story is also going through that like i said the fact that beatrice becomes doesn't literally become but is replaced at some point or is transmuted into the the mother of god is showing how his personal story is being connected to the universal story he's showing how his personal transformation how his passion for this young lady which was strange let's be honest uh can be transmuted into something higher right can be transmuted into a love of something which will bring him bring him higher and so it happens at his own personal level but it also happens at different national levels like he has a historical aspect to his story where he encounters historical figures and he places them historically in the hierarchy so what he does is he creates a hierarchy of beings and in this hierarchy of beings he places people in the hierarchy at different levels but the type of people he places are on the one hand mythical figures biblical prophetic figures historical figures and then also personal figures right so the so all of these levels are being connected together and what he's what's being shown is that the the pattern of the comedy this descent and ascent is happening at every level of reality right it's not just happening at the cosmic level all right does that does that does that make a sense to you guys a little bit like it can help you to understand also why like i've said i said before we started it makes the the comedy on the one hand an amazing universal tale which is one of the most universal tales that have ever been told but it also makes it one of the most personal tales that has ever been told at the same time and it makes it very difficult to read the comedy because sometimes he's referring to some obscure squabble that he's had with a noble and you're like you can't understand what he's talking about unless you have massive notes in your text you won't understand but the reason why he's doing that is because he's trying to show the connection of these different levels and i think that that's really it's important because one of the problems we've had in in modernity is on the one hand we fetishized the particular right and on the other hand we've also fetishized the universal like we have this idea you know you you talk to people who are spiritual but not religious right you talk to people who are who who feel almost as if being connected to something particular is almost like getting dirty right they have to transcend all the all the particulars but what dante shows us is no no you have to express the universal in a particular there's no other way to do it he has to express the universal pattern that he encounters inside the christian story inside the roman story with that's really important because that's one of the things that dante really does he creates an amazing he creates the most perfect synthesis between paganism and christianity that has ever been accomplished and so he he needs to tell a christian story a roman story uh you know a story of his city and then the story of his own of his own problems you could say of his own love of his own you know uh his own passion for this this this woman um but also not just that you know the fact that virgil is the one who appears as his guide is related to his own personal story as well as a poet so so this is really to me and anyway this has always been dante reading dante has been one of my most profound lessons to understand that there is no other way to live the universal you have to live it through your particular story your particular story your nation's particular story your religious story your history all of this it's not about denying this but it's rather about inside that story seeing the pattern and making it live right making it live again making it something that is um enchanted once more okay and that's part of the this idea of the re-enchanting we talk about re-enchanting everybody talks about re-enchanting the world right now but you it's not an arbitrary thing we can do it a little bit through fiction and and i think that that's useful i talk about fiction all the time in my in my uh in my on my youtube channel but dante's work is not a work of fiction at least not the way that we understand fiction today and that's extremely important to understand he is not like coking making up a world which is perfect which is very well and coherent and beautiful like i love toki and myself there's nothing wrong with him but that's not what dante's doing dante is connecting his personal story to his religious story to his nation story right to rome's story to the cosmic story that's what he's doing right and so because of that it like i said it becomes a key for us to see how it is possible to re-enchant the world one of the one of the important aspects of dante which i think mark him as a transitional figure uh elizabeth mentioned this at the beginning she said that francis schaefer had identified dante as one of the key figures in the the beginning of the breakdown or the fragmentation in the west and i think i think this is key i think that he among others is a he's a he's like a hinge right he's an he's a hinge between the medieval synthesis we could call it right the great medieval synthesis and what is coming the renaissance the enlightenment and modernity and the the slow graying of the world like the disenchanting of the world and it has great aspects like the modern world is great i love i love medicine and i love cars i have no problem with the technology but there's a side effect which came along which is this kind of graying or disenchanting of the world and so dante stands on the on the hinge and so as he stands on the hinge he actually offers us i think some keys to this re-enchanting of the world one of the things that i that i have been promoting is the necessity of re-entering the body let's say of re-entering our experience you know of seeing the world through your experience and that is really the way dante is doing it dante dante presents himself basically as the as the center of the cosmos in his story like he everything kind of is around him you know and and there's a there's a certain extent where that can be egotistical and can be nefarious but there's a certain extent to which that's true because you don't have any other experience besides that experience you only have one experience and that experience is the experience of you as a conscious being in a body looking out on the world you you you don't have another experience and we can let's say we can abstract that through modern science and this idea of objective knowledge which there's no i don't have a problem with that but we always have to remember that we're always a being experiencing the world through consciousness like you you can't you can't abstract yourself from that yeah and so may i add something yeah go for it um i think that's one of the main problems with with society today where people basically live through screens in such a way where they live someone else's life like they vicariously feel their feelings and they have all these experiences from their own bedroom but it's not their own you know like they don't own it through uh through a particular sense or anything it's just uh yeah it's a fragmented sense of being yeah the drama the drama youtuber and the drama instagram uh influencer that's what it's about exactly um like the the depth of experience is what i'm trying to say by going out and conquering their own their own demons and you know finding their own path and so the and so the one of the problems we've had right now one of the problems that we've had in terms of religious in terms of kind of spiritual religious ideas that we our whole world has been made gray through through kind of materialist thinking like we everything has been deconstructed right all the causalities have been broken down right because you know what if you go up up there there's no prime mobile if you go up in a spaceship you're not gonna encounter the heavenly spheres right if you go up in a spaceship you're gonna run out of air and you're gonna die and if you don't have enough air right that's what's up there in terms of mechanical causation okay uh and and we need to first be aware of how that has broken our entire system of of meaning but with galileo has basically basically evacuated our entire system of meaning once we took galileo seriously he evacuated everything we still use remnants of it we still say you know he has a higher position he has a you know uh he's really low today we use all those expressions but it's we it's a it's a schizophrenic use if we if we fully accept this the cycle the let's say the the scientific reduction then all these expressions are are they're they're schizophrenic right you know i always joke with when i talk to priests and and priests that are really really keen on wanting to show me the historical this and that and historical this or that and i i'm like like why do you raise the chalice up like what are you raising it towards are you trying to catch the wi-fi signal like i don't know what you're doing because in the purely materialistic world that doesn't mean anything it doesn't make it it doesn't doesn't have any meaning but what dante offers us is rather he offers us in his in the fact that he's a hinged character he offers us the possibility of kind of reentering i think the the world of experience and discussing uh the world through that being and then the meaning can appear again right the meaning can take its shape i want to read you two quotes that i love from um from kanto 29 let me just so the first thing dante does is that he unites the cosmic vision you know the this idea of these heavenly spheres and the planetary spheres and the prime mobile you know as just a let's say physical description of your of the cosmos the way the ancients described it he unites that with a neoplatonic vision like a a clear neoplatonic vision he's not the only one who does that other people have done that as well but he does it very beautifully um and so he says so this is beatrice who talks him and he says order was concreted and constructed in substances and summit of the world where those were in the pure act was produced pure potentiality held the lowest part midway bound potentiality with act such bond that it shall never be unbound so you have to think of his structure again okay you have to think of his structure so you have pure act above and you have pure potentiality below so let's say you have pure act in the prime mobile you know in the heavenly nature or in the heavenly being then at the bottom you have pure potentiality this chaos that's right at the bottom and he says in the middle so what's in the middle of his cosmos in the middle of his cosmos is that place at the top of the mountain right at the top of the mountain is the garden garden of eden and in that place is the place where they join together where act and potential join in that spot in a place where he says that will never be unbound now that's it right that's the pattern that's there in the bible as well right it's not it's it's the in the bible you have heaven you have earth and then you have the garden of eden i always keep having to remind people that the garden of eden is a mountain it's not a it's not a it's not flat the garden of eden is a mountain and people always forget it's a mountain because it doesn't say that in genesis it says it in the in ezekiel that the garden is a mountain but traditionally really you have to understand the garden as a mountain or else it doesn't make any sense so the garden is a mountain you have heaven and and earth you have pure essence pure potential and the place where it meets is the top of the garden where the tree is but also where man is ultimately where the cross is right ultimately where the crucified one is so you have to understand that the top of the mountain in dante's paradise is the top of the garden but it's also the top of the golgotha as well it's also the place of the crucified and you see that abundantly in medieval literature in medieval representations where the tree the the cross is represented as the tree of life or the tree of knowledge or both at the same time uh the tree of life and death you see all these representations in uh in um in medieval representation and so that's the spot right that's the but that's also the spot where we are called to be like that's the spot where we are called to be as those that unite meaning and potential right name and the fragmentation that's at the bottom right and this is something that is not when i talk about the fractal structure of reality this is something that is true of all levels of reality right that is i always use the same examples but any anything any object right you know a chair for example is a meeting of meaning pattern and potential right it has a bunch of parts it has legs and colors and all of this right and then it has a purpose and so for that that comes together in a place which is the the chair and we play a part in that we play a part in consciousness plays let's say consciousness is better consciousness plays a part in connecting those two together that spot where meaning and potential meet and dante talks about that as being the very pattern of the cosmos like his whole pattern that's what he's that's what it is it's potential act you call essences he says sub they translated as substances but probably better to say essence let's say essences or i or ideas or names and then potentiality at the bottom chaos at the bottom and this comes together so you have a bunch of you have a bunch of stuff you have paint and you have you have pieces of wood and you have a piece of leather and then you gather it together you gather all this potential this multiplicity you gather into us into an identity which is the chair and then you have a chair you need both you need the pattern and you need the gathered potential all right does that make sense yes yes yeah you get so you get a lot more of that if you read also some of the other authors that i mentioned if you if you look at saint gregor nissa and saying that from the syrian you really get really get that all right so last last quote that i really love it's good for us today because of our our science problem or because of our deconstruction problem um so beatrice explains to dante that when he's standing at the lowest level of heaven and he says that because dante encounters these souls at all the different levels of heaven right all the heavenly spheres and she says that the souls showed themselves here not because allotted this fear has been to them but to give sign of the celestial which is least exalted to speak thus is adapted to your mind since only through the sense it apprehendeth what then it worthy makes of intellect on this account the scripture condescends unto your faculties and feet and hands to god attributes and means something else and holy church under an aspect human gabriel and michael present you and him who made tobias whole again so the idea is he says okay so dante cove and he ascends the heavenly spheres and he encounters these beings and it's as if beatrice is warning him not to have like a science fiction interpretation of of what he's going through right because we have that right now all the marvel comics nonsense of gods as aliens living on other planet like thor lives on another planet and all this kind of mormon nonsense right and so you have that possibility a lot of people talk about that or they say silly things like that spiritual beings are in other dimensions and they just mean by dimensions that they're other equal dimensions that are just invisible but that are on the same like material exist i don't know like i don't totally understand it but what dante is saying is like okay so you have this experience of being at different levels of the hierarchy of beings and you experience them at these different spheres of heaven and she's like they're not really physically these fears of heaven but they're not there this is a condescension of heaven towards you for you to be able to understand things which are beyond the physical world right and so and he talks about like so we represent angels as having bodies but angels don't have bodies right we represent god as having hands and feet and walking in the garden but god doesn't walk anywhere god is not a physical being right and so this is this is where i think that we can recapture our experience because the experience of hierarchy the the idea of something which is above you and something which is below you is the best experience that you can have of these transcendent truths they're not arbitrary there is is no better experience than that right light comes from above light comes from the sun and so of course when we talk about the light of god we're not talking about physical light but it's the best image you can use is the sun that's the best image and it's not arbitrary if you understand how the sun engages the world then you can understand how the essences which come from the divine encounter light the world and make things appear out of darkness right bring order out of chaos all of this imagery you know um so if you ascend a mountain like if you do what dante says and you actually physically ascend a mountain you will have an experience of hierarchy you'll have an experience a spiritual experience right might that you might not have the insight to make it as profound as you should but as you if you're on the ground on the bottom of a mountain right let's do it even more let's put your face on the ground right put your face right on the ground and look around you all you're going to see is a is a few blades of grass maybe a few bugs if you're unlucky uh and some dirt right you're going to see very very particular everything is going to be very you're only going to see a very particular thing now now get up start going up the mountain and the more you go up the mountain the more you see right all of a sudden the multiplicity the particularity of the multiplicity is slowly going to start to coalesce into bigger identities so what you at first saw where the the five leaves of the tree are going to become a tree as you ascend as you're further up and then the different trees are going to become a forest as you ascend and then as you ascend you see more and more you encompass more and more all the multiplicity is under your feet and you're able to encompass it in your gaze and as you reach the very very summit of the mountain that's an experience if you i'm sure anybody you've had that experience reaching the summit of a mountain is amazing because right until the very moment that you reach the summit of the mountain you do not have a full vision but at the very second i think it's a matter of seconds once you reach the top of the mountain all of a sudden you have a 360 vision you have the whole world under your feet right and it's like it's a jump it's a jump from partial to a universal scent of the world and and so that experience that is that's the that's the hierarchy but that that's it right that's how multiplicity comes together whether it's a chair right like when you have all the parts of the chair they don't they're not a chair until you've ascended the chair right until you've reached the very top where now all the pieces are together and you understand the purpose of the chair then the chair appears fully in its purpose and its reality but until you're there it's just a bunch of parts and that's the same thing in terms of of your experience of ascending a mountain and so that's why i think that dante offers us the possibility of recapturing the meaning through experience of saying yes i know that the sun that the earth turns around the sun yes i know that's true but your life is still based on the fact that the sun comes up in the morning and you just can't get away from that like try to get away from the fact that your life is pattern on the rising and setting of the sun and you're gonna go insane right it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna pull on your mental uh your mental uh health quite strongly if you try to pretend as if that truth is not a real truth of experience and so if we and so that's what i mean it's like we understand that it's a condescension we understand that the reality the truths like beatrice tells dante the spiritual truth are condescended in the experience of the world that this is not really what it's talking about it's pointing up towards transcendent truths but that's the way to do it there's no other way to experience these this is the best way to experience these is to encounter them in our experience so that's what i think that's what i think mostly dante has to offer i would say the the greatest thing that dante has to offer to us is this this capacity to join personal with the universal to join his story with the universal story and to do it through different levels right to do it through the different levels of his you know you could say your family your community your your history your religion all of these things are the vehicle right uh in in the in one of the cantos it talks about how the higher beings you know see the footprints of god below and so that's such an awesome thing it's like yes the purpose is to go up but you see that that god's footprints are below that that that's how god touches the the world is through these particular forms right the particular forms are part of the pattern they're not they're not uh we're not gnostics at least i'm not enough as a christian i'm not a gnostic i don't believe that that that that particularity is evil particularly is the place where the universal finds its its its ground so so if anybody has questions on my my little understanding of dante i will let you guys speak for now jonathan with a a lot of things that you're saying especially the especially the part of the this particularity and the universal you know how we've lost that unity and dante is so much part of of unity you know he's trying to connect it all and in some ways he's giving us that line to have that experience one of the fascinating things that i find and it's a simple thing that dante is never ever letting his reader forget that he is in the flesh and that he's uh oh all the damned from hell or the the purging ones in purgatory and even in in paradise there's always something or some sign to indicate that dante is completing this journey while he's still alive and this is very interesting because through my studies you know first you you laugh about it you say how interesting you know he casts a shadow he moves stones in the damned are all indicating this and saying oh what are you doing here you know you're you're alive you're supposed to be dead but you know it it has also some comic effects but it it's it's very interesting that throughout the work he's always reminding me about this and i've asked myself this question why why is he doing this i know you know you don't need to repeat but yet he finds it important to do this you know as if to say that the journey is here and now don't forget that and purgatory is all about that it's possible no matter how old you are no matter what your experience is that the forgiveness is there and change is possible if you recognize the error because one of the things in the passage from hell to purgatory is that dante seems it seems necessary dante and virgil come into contact with the body of lucifer why isn't there just another tunnel to go around lucifer and you go to purgatory no he found it necessary to come in contact with the hairs and the body to go down that almost as if dante is saying if you don't recognize the error and look it in the face there is no change there is no change that can start there is no purging if you don't recognize it once you see it then it's traumatic but you have to believe that there is that margin or the the possibility of growth because if you don't you just default back into the fixity which is hell hell is fixity and lucifer being so fixed into that ice is the epitome of no change there is a pride brought to an extreme where there is no growth sterility at its best there right and uh i find it interesting that dante is in his journey he's always indicating how difficult he is you know he'll faint he'll have doubts he'll need to be pushed on you know and he's he he communicates it's not a simple thing you know to actually grow spiritually and a firm life which is paradise you know i remember listening to a professor giving the sum of of what the the divine comedy is for him you know he's saying if if hell is fixity and there's no change purgatory has to be the consciousness of knowing and identifying the air and changing and growing and education you know and then paradise finally the affirmation of life dante becomes self-mastery you know he can decide and he has power over his will and uh yeah that kind of he summed it up that way i thought it was interesting the fact that this fixity that then in purgatory becomes this pilgrim who uh so humbly and the humility you know having pride as the very first terrorists almost at the base that all sins kind of branch from pride and humility as being all the virtues are kind of condensed in humility dante um really stresses the humility part where you really have to kind of put that ego in check if there is going to be growth in change i just wanted to add that that's interesting yeah yeah um one of the it's it's that part where he goes down and he kind of crawls across lucifer's body basically or it almost looks like he's being defecated by lucifer like as he goes down it's hard to yeah he goes down the body that's really it's not you see that in other stories in uh for example like in jonah when jonah goes down in the fish and he goes down into the into death like down into where he sees the sees the pillars of the earth right down at the bottom of the world um when he is when he comes back up it says that he was vomited by the fish right that there is almost like it's almost like you have to go all the way to the bottom and it's as if death like vomits him out or like he's defecated by lucifer like he goes all the way really to the bottom and then it there's this turn this flip right and it's the flip of it's the flip of uh of forgiveness like you said right it's it's the it's repentance that's really the flip at least in jonah's story uh it really is that's that's the flip it's like when you there's a place in jonah's poem which is very powerful where he talks about you know he's at the bottom of the water he's in this fish and then he says i like i remember right i god has room i think he says i remember the temple like i remember god's house and it's that that memory which is the flip and it's the it's the the flip from death to life you know and there's this sense in the story like i talked about this idea of the ladder of divine ascent and there's a sense in that ladder if you look at the icon that i showed you you can see the monks going up the ladder and they fall from any spot on the ladder right so you're going up the ladder and it's any time you can fall down and it's this idea of direction that and humility is part of it right the idea of the willingness to change means that anywhere along that hierarchy you can have access to the ascent right anywhere anywhere in your life like any at any moment in your life if you have humility and you you have repentance then it can change and that's pretty amazing and it's actually there's this sense that it's actually better the direction you're facing is better than the place you are in the hierarchy to a certain extent because if you're that monk up on the ladder and you're all the way near the top and you fall down because of pride you know you're it's better to be that monk at the bottom of the ladder who's close to hell but he was looking up you know right and so there's this sense that yeah so so anyway so i think that that image of crawling down to the bottom and this turn because even geographically it's really that that moment in because almost as if the world turns right so what is the bottom now turn so he goes to the bottom and it's like the entire cosmos turns and then he ascends from that low spot right geographically we can almost can't you can't represent it if you try to make a drawing if you are to represent because the mountain starts at the bottom of the pit so you have the pit and then you have the mountain starting at the bottom of the pit but but if you understand it that way you're like yeah that's exactly it right if you think of it rather it's going at the bottom of the water and then this turn and then all of a sudden you're going back up uh remembering you know remembering and and uh repenting so yeah thanks for that that that i that was a great uh i think that that's a good a good yeah the other the other the other thing the other thing i would add is one of the things uh that are often forgotten is that dante starts his journey with a false start and this in my in in my teaching i've also brought in pinocchio the story of pinocchio also which starts with a false start you have master chiliecho who starts to make a puppet and this piece of wood speaks and so he gives it to gepetto so there's a start then a false start meaning that he won't make anything out of this wood he he won't use it he'll give it to gibeto who in some ways is a different position you know uh a piece of wood can't speak a piece of wood can't but in in in geppetto's position there is the mystery and the mystic still very much alive whereas mastro chilejo is the materialist a piece of wood can't talk there are not possibilities but with gepetto there's the possibili creativity there is the creation then there's the whole connection and the symbolism with the creating of adam right yeah with dante the same kind of thing happens where he's starting to go up that hill he knows where he's supposed to go but then you have the three beasts blocking him there's a false start there you know he knows he's trying to get take a shortcut to some place that for which there are no shortcuts and virgil somehow like in that robert frost home you know uh the the the the road less traveled is the one that brought to virtue and that has made all the difference it's as if if dante you really want to learn and grow you have to go another way you have to go and come in contact with lucifer himself if the change is going to be real and long-lasting and authentic so there are no shortcuts it means i i think you know and dante seems to want to underline this even in the in the second kanto of of the inferno there is that kind of false humility also where i'm not anes i'm not saying paul who am i you know he's being a coward that's the false humility you know and he seems to make that that because then the humility at the beginning of of of purgatorio is the right kind of humility which doesn't mean that you shrink yourself towards life you take on the mission you go and with affirmative but you put your ego in check you know you become creative and affirmative yeah i think you're i think you're bringing up pinocchio is a wonderful image because in a pinocchio you really do have this it's almost that if somebody wants to understand emergence you can understand in through this idea of pinocchio like you really do have this problem like you said it's such a cra it's such an interesting problem to say a piece of wood doesn't speak you know and it's like uh i don't know i mean do you know what a chair is if you knew what a chair is you would know that a piece of wood is actually can't speak like a table all the things that we give meaning to in a way have a voice that that of course we participate in that voice but material world does have end up having meaning as it is brought together into into into something um but in pinocchio you really also see this this problem of the you know trying to make pinocchio a good boy right try to make him a good boy by following these rules do this do that but it he has to go he has to kind of go down and plunge into the madness and the chaos and the and the you know the the his even even his own passions ends up taking him and but it's down going down finally and when he finally does go down and ascend that he becomes uh that he becomes a real boy yeah he he he very much like jonah in the whale you know he ends up in the fish and uh he uh by the end of that story what i found very interesting is that the fox and the cat will try to tempt him again after his whole journey but he'll brush them off with a few proverbs you know he's ready he's self-mastering now you know and uh the pinocchio dante you can really do some work there the parallels are there um even the animals like you said the tempting animals the animals that end up being the cause of his fall you know if you see dante coming up to these beasts that stop him from going further and then you have these beasts that pull you see that in let's say in the in this hierarchy of beings that i talk about in terms of santa from the syrian you have this beautiful image for example saint ephrem says that there were no animals in paradise um we always have this image of animals you know the garden with animals and everything but it's if you follow the logic he says there were no animals in paradise and adam went down the hill would come to the gate of paradise and then that's where he would name the animals by coming down to the limit you know saint grigor of nisa talks about how when moses ascended the mountain to go up to the glory of god that animals were not allowed to touch the mountain right and you can see that the israelites stay at the bottom of the mountain and what do they do they make a bull out of gold they make an animal a golden animal right so this idea of animality at the bottom or at the uh the limit right your animal aspects of yourself in in scripture they talk about the garments of skin right god gives adam and eve these animal garments around them kind of fleshy aspect of us which which has a tendency to pull us away you know it's not evil but it has a tendency to pull us because it has its own volition you know we have all these desires that pull us in different directions and that you know you have to in a certain manner deny the animal you know in order to ascend up the mountain um san gregor nissa talks about removing the sandals where moses has to remove his leather sandals in order to go up to have the epiphany at the at the uh the burning bush you know and same thing like leaving the beast leaving the belly of the beast in jonah and like in dante uh it's not as it's not as clear but the fact that he has these animal block his way and he has to go down and around them basically to finally ascend there's something similar going on there as well mac did you want to say anything about what franco and jonathan were discussing in terms of the dissent and the meeting with lucifer and because we were just talking about that actually in our last session we were all fascinated with kanto 33 and that descending down the hairy shanks of lucifer and trying to understand why it was that actual image i think it's really important to understand that like meeting your own your own lucifer is the only real way to humility because you have to recognize that that's part of yourself and like climbing up it or climbing down it um that's the journey where you're like accepting that that is part of yourself and like traveling towards the core of it in terms of that that hellishness um and that it's okay but now you need to start uh working towards that the the journey of change right with forgiveness and and what franco was talking about when you recognize your own faults which are the work of satan in this context right um and ultimately try to integrate them into uh assets and and building towards like a life that you live with you know values and and a system of belief that respects other people and uh you don't have to go to those lower pleasures like we were talking about in franco's lecture last time um and ultimately once you realize that like um breakdown leads to the awareness which leads to the capacity to change then you're ready like that's that's the point where you're ready and for me it took a lot of uh mistakes to get to the point where i'm like i have to own this challenge it's it's difficult but the only way forward is to have proper guidance and to have proper accountability and to not um take shortcuts and and you know act on those those uh those very alluring desires right because there's a lot of trickery in the world and i run into it every day and people always try to pull you down to that animalistic place because that's where a lot of people reside and i think to ascend past that i need to sort of have people who who've been down that journey tell me how to get to the point where uh i don't need to like mingle with those kind of people you know and and ultimately ascend past the point where um where that's fun anymore because i don't think the never changing life of you know lower pleasures and and seeking uh the ultimate fix if you will i don't think that ever gives me a paradise whatsoever and the only way to go there is humility for sure because in my experience um i needed to lose every sense of pride that i had every sense of accomplishment like i had to be nothing in order to inherit the earth like it's kind of like that uh the meek will inherit the earth thing that jordan peterson was talking about where uh it's not really meek isn't weak it's it's meek is in basically stripped down and ready to inherit the earth like the truth of everything only comes when you lose the constructs that are false like there are our own perceptions that are false and um i just what are the spheres of heaven that was pretty cool because i made a thing to perception and like as you evolve as a person then your perception changes and then you can see through the spheres of heaven is that close at all all right are you asking me well i've the spheres of the heaven are the spiritual spheres right they're the non-physical let's say the the intelligences or the essences as you see in the in the uh the quote that i mentioned where it talks about above you have as you ascend you have more pure spheres or pure patterns you could say it that way something like that and as you descend then those patterns manifest in actual beings um so that's the so the way like saint maximus the confessor who is he's definitely recommended if you're interested in these these ideas or these mystical ideas he talks about let's say like i said like the christian vision is that as you ascend in a platonic very similar to a platonic sense where you you you suddenly see the patterns or you experience the pure patterns of reality right then you also notice like i said the footprints of god below and so say maximus talks about how as the mystic ascends and the sees these patterns these pure patterns of reality he also notices that that phenomena is not actually different from it right that it's actually those those two are actually joined together in phenomena when dante says that bound in a manner in which they can never be unbound which is that that the unity of the pattern and the multiplicity of of the world are bound together in a way that that is not that cannot be completely unbound right so the pattern of something needs its instantiation um so sorry if that's a bit abstract but uh yeah the other i i i would just add to that that in those spheres what's interesting is that they correspond to those seven liberal arts that form dante and the tone of the language will kind of reflect those uh liberal arts but the the people or the the figures that he meets very interestingly in paradise are people who actually did something about something yeah they they're they're not their purging they're they represent like saint francis of assisi's or the same dominic no they they founded orders they did something you know dante's great grandfather who fought in a in a crusade you know dante is giving you people who actually did something about something and we're affirmative of it you know and many of the examples will correspond to something like that right because one of the tragedies in the italian school system over the years and i think it's slowly changing is that very little space was given to paradise or purgatory and everything was i just read inferno you know you know we like to joke about it you know these people they're all trying to justify we can relate to that somehow uh purgatory to some degree you know interesting because people are actually they're they're purging we can identify with that you know flawed people who have seen their error and their purging but paradise seems so abstract and today the reading of many professors is no no it's like you're you're missing the whole point if you completely discard paradise you know you're condemning yourself to a life of no change you know so paradise actually has paradise now is is seen in a whole different light and i and i in my of course in my first readings of course i was into the inferno the paola francesca and all these these characters that seem so full but over the years in reading it you see how empty and and how you have to have pity uh for the characters in hell because they're they're they're in that they're living the same day over and over and i say that intentionally because one of the films that i sometimes use in my teaching is is the film groundhog day with bill murray if you've ever seen this film i would really suggest it because he is living the same day over and over and over yeah and also he follows a you he goes down because he gives himself to his passions at first and he's like oh here's a chance to do everything i ever wanted and no consequence yeah yeah then he kind of goes down and then he's like okay what's the point of this then he purges he gets bored he tries to become a better person until he can capture the beloved like it's very similar yeah that that film is fantastic because at some at some point he gets so bored that he he starts committing suicide in so many different ways and then he figures it out and when he does the next day comes so people in hell are living the same day over and over yeah mac i wanted to say something just in terms of what you talked about you know one of the things also that that this pattern that dante let's say draws is also the pattern in the of the of the church and so this descent into hell is also baptism it's difficult because in the catholic tradition the let's say that the diving aspect of baptism has been a bit lost um but traditionally baptism was dying right it's a it's a form of dying and if you read the let's say i'm i'm orthodox if you read the prayers at baptism they're amazing they're just amazing prayers because it talks about the monsters and the dragons at the bottom of the water and and and that there's all these creatures that are waiting for you um and so you go down into the water right you go down into the water and then you leave the the super the superfluous constructions that you talked about like all your in theory the idea of baptism is to drop the garments drop the animal garments drop the guard leave the garments of skin in the water and then ascend that's why the uh the um the people who would usually that like the tradition would be like they would wear black garments and then remove the garment go into the water and when they came out they would be given white garments to be like these garments of light that you received as you as you ascend um and the baptism was traditionally also done at the entrance of the narthex so the narthex is like this transition figure in the church it's like limbo it's like the limbo in dante's uh structure and so you have this intermediary structure for example in orthodox churches in the narthex we often paint icons of greek philosophers uh because they're just like in dante's limbo there are these marginal figures these in-between figures that aren't completely taken up into the story but are there they have to be there somehow because you know what what are you gonna do you can't have christianity without plato's language you can't have christianity without the language of the neoplaton it's like you just can't but they're not totally inside they're kind of like in this buffer zone in between and so this idea of this buffer zone and then you're baptized and when you're baptized and you enter into the narthex and then the narthex is the place of struggle it's the place where we work out our salvation right so it's purgatory nate narthex the the nave is purgatory and then the holy of holies the altar the the sanctuary is the place where the divine meets the human it's the top of the the top of the mountain right the paradise that say the place where earthly paradise points up towards the the higher spheres um so the the structure of the comedia is also the structure of a of a physical church like physically the structure of a church yeah i agree i agree fully with that uh there there have been studies on the number system in in in the the divine comedy and some scholars have found a cross in each of the kantike across through the number system across an inferno just like a medieval church formed as a like a cathedral uh built on the shape of a cross so and people like charles singleton he did much of this work and uh i if you if you get into that you're amazed you say how did he do it how did he do it even you know the italian it will show you the the rhyme scheme and how dante's terzarima connects each of the verses which is lost in translation but it's difficult to think that someone would actually sit down and and work this out and yet he did you know it's uh amazing the things that they find in the in the numbers you know the seven the three the one and the three the twelve all very like in the bible the old and new testament these numbers the trinity and the three dante has created a work uh so systematically organized on these numbers yeah it's a it's an it's a really an amazing thing i mean i think that i think that it becomes less unbelievable if you believe if you think that dante's journey that he describes is something that he actually experienced like if dante experienced that which he describes you know then it's less surprising that he could write something like that you know that somehow some of it is revealed like i wouldn't say revealed the same way that i would say uh bible is revealed because then i'll get into trouble but that it was probably something of a mystical experience that also informed his his writing and so therefore the pattern would have been so intuitively grasped by his old being that it would flow out of him as he was writing it you know um that's the only way i can understand it because like you said it's so dense and so and so worked out that you think oh my goodness how could somebody sit down and mathematically work out this whole thing it just seems impossible yeah so jonathan just a few comments on what what is what's the end result movie or what is the what is he looking for to happen in himself or in other people who read this or travel on the journey i don't know if that's a i would say deification i don't see any other i'm sorry it just seems like we're just talking like in the world i don't know i haven't i've i haven't been deified i don't really totally know i mean you have glimpses of it you have glimpses of it which is to fully realize not not just in thought but in being to fully realize the integrity of everything right to fully realize how everything is connected through this this hierarchy and that we participate in that connection and we are called to be joined as much as is possible with the source of of all of it right i think that that's that's the point is that dante is ultimately joined with god um i don't see i don't see another and it's hard to say because like i am enjoying with god so i'm not you know i don't want to i don't want it to sound like i'm being presumptuous but it seems like that's what he's talking about like he's talking about illumination he's talking about liberation whatever religious type word you want to use nirvana i don't know like he's talking about reaching freedom from manifestation but also the fullness of of everything i don't see i don't i that's what i see but it like i said it's and it's interesting it's interesting that that franco woody when he talked about how we right now we're just obsessed with uh with hell like we're just obsessed with inferno because that's our world like it's not surprising that that that's what we're obsessed with like that's the the things in inferno are the things with preoccupy preoccupy us in our society those that so that's where we are like we are in inferno uh and so you know i don't know i um it's sorry i i i i agree the the thing about you know the the the depth experience that dante's talking about and uh the the infinity you know i think it was a lecture i i heard of the father robert baron he he did a lecture on purgatory and uh he was he he made this comment on uh i think it was something like this that we're we're we're wired we're hot wired for infinity yep and we we look for it in finite goods which will never respond our desire for infinity and we won't get it until we find god put simply right and dante i think stumbled upon this you know when he talks about his experience with beatrice that experience evolved into something that doesn't happen with poets like guido cavalcante for example his friend who was uh at the korean and the atheist no and it's very interesting dante will dedicate vita nova his experience with beatrice to cavalcante to make the point to say cavalcante this is what you're not seeing right because to make then be a tricia a vehicle towards the spiritual is the big innovation for dante that's how we distinguish him from the dolce steel novisti poets that i studied no where he brings in this other element and the mortality the death of beatrice does it he ends that work saying i have to say something else but i'm not ready so he takes 10 years to read boethius saint augustine and then finally when he's he he starts writing it and his his exile they say really did it dante went through some pretty tough uh situations he was at the head of his political uh reality in in florence and having lost that some some people say that the exile was a blessing in disguise that all the energy needed to stimulate him to do this was in that experience of the exile you know like boethius in the consolation of philosophy who loses everything and from that uh you know it comes this this this work what do you hold on to when you've lost it all right yeah i had a very similar exile actually like the same structure of exile wherein i had uh a reputation i had a certain amount of followers if you will in this addictions counseling journey of mine and people look up to me and then it was all stripped away in an instant and uh really knowing what was at the core of my being was the only thing that got me through that like understanding that i was worthy of rebuilding a life that i was proud of and taking responsibility for that really got me through that exile so i feel like plummeting from that high place which was false pride looking back it was entirely based on false pride because i wasn't all that in the first place um it gave me that sense of uh of realness and just becoming a person who's part of something like integrity i love the fact that you mentioned integrity because that word is just so powerful like the full realization of integrity is like i am part of the world and i have a responsibility to be part of the world responsibly like i i have a higher calling to be someone who acts integrally to the world and i thought that was really interesting too jonathan i have a question are are you at all familiar with um uh kabbalah the ancient jewish mysticism and are there any correlations that you see with christianity i know numerology is a really big part of that as well i'm just curious about thee well i think that's true it's a little difficult because the word kabbalah is so is so big and so it's a twisted word because it means all kinds of things for all kinds of people um i think that i think that there are some aspects of mystical judaism let's say it that way there are some aspects of mystical judaism which i think are actually quite uh powerful and very close to and can help us understand uh christianity can help us understand uh kind of our spiritual journey and i think there are other aspects which are less so and so the word kabbalah is complicated because they're because they're different there are different strains for example you know if you look at lyrionic kabbalism there are some aspects in lurianic kabbalism which are difficult for us because they posit the world as being let's say almost as if the world is fallen in itself right and so luria posited and lurianic kabulism is probably the most known form of kabbalism right now and so luria posited this idea of the what he calls the broken vessels which is the idea that the world cannot contain god and so when god tried to create and put himself in the world then the vessels broke and shattered and that's the fall the fall is a cosmic fall before before it is a that's a it's a fall almost at the point of creation you know uh so it's not totally gnostic in the sense that it's not an evil god that created an evil world um but it's the idea that right at the instance of creation the world fragments and falls apart because god cannot the world cannot contain god and so then the rest of creation the story of creation is the restoration of those broken vessels right right right so i think that that that kind of thing is that type of thing is problematic in terms of at least in terms of in terms of understanding at least it's not the christian understanding of of the world like the the christian understanding of the world is that all is good that the world is good that the world is not bad it's not it's not uh and that like like when we talk about dante it's rather that all things can participate in god to the level at which they are right and so the world is actually full of god's glory the world is full of his glory but the problem is only when we tend to want things to not be in their place right so pride is the is the reason for the fall not not a cosmic accident or not a cosmic uh mismatch uh but it's rather pride so it's things that don't want to be in their place that's that's what causes the fall so it's just i'm just giving you a little example just to say that kabbalah has been has been in a way kind of deluded in popular culture as this just basic thing but it's not it's just it's it's a really complex and so if you read so if you read let's say very very very abstract texts uh it's it's different from let's say more magical kabbalah that is more practical and more based on spell so if you read the zohar in the zohar you find spells on how to do this and that and this and that you know but if you read the the the so i forget the name of the forget the name of the book which is horrible it's gonna come to me but if you read the more abstract text then it's different it's just a different thing um so so i would say that yeah i would say that one of the problems is that it's just been deluded in culture to a point where i don't know when people use that word what they're referring to okay because i know that a basic tenet if you like of judaism is that concept of tikkun olam which is repairing the world and if you help one person you're you're really connecting to make the world a better place but that sort of in my mind kind of resonated in what you said about um action and then and what franco said about needing to act to actually do something i agree no i i think that the idea of restoring creation i think that is true that that's also that is our function and so in a way maybe in the end the acts that we pose in terms of of restoration and in terms of love like in christianity we would say love we would say that that the world exists through love right and love is the manner in which multiple things exist in unity without dissolving their multiplicity right so multiple people exist together in one let's say a family that loves each other but that unity doesn't destroy the the different members of the family it doesn't suck one into doesn't suck the multiplicity into the unity so this balance between multiplicity and unity is them is the way in which god is revealed in the world it's through love and it's the mode of being of god um so but so like you said so maybe in the end the actions that people will pose will will resemble that through this through this this gathering of the vessels it's possible it's possible but i also don't want to i don't want to gloss over the differences like i don't want to gloss over the idea of of an ontological fall right like a fall which is at the very root of of the of creation which is something that we that at least as christians we we we don't we don't want to include in our system that that the reality at the outset was fallen i don't that makes sense what i mean the difference let's say yes maybe it's just the language because yeah but um judaism doesn't believe in the concept of original sin for example but the tree of knowledge has great you know symbolic meaning in terms of awareness of the duality of life and good and evil and and then the concept of free will versus the patterns of reality that you expressed or you know that that um you know that's always been a fascination for me how those two things can coincide and how much do you need one or the other right yeah that makes sense that relevance of free will and predestination or whatever words you want yeah the will of god let's say and the will our individual will how those join together in a dance of some kind some kind of symphony of of different levels of being that that kind of play together and interact together um i think in terms of the in terms of original sin you might find it surprising that the orthodox also don't believe in original sin so it's not all christians who believe in the doctrine of original sin not in the sin not in the sense of sin being transmitted like through the line now this idea that we inherit the sin of adam is something that is not it's just not present in in orthodox thinking we we there's an idea of inherited death that we inherit the the we inherit death through adam but we don't inherit sinfulness so we don't have uh so the orthodox don't have a doctrine of immaculate conception for example because we don't we don't need it like we don't need this doctrine that that let's say mary was born without sin because we don't believe that you're born in sin that you're born with sin let's say
