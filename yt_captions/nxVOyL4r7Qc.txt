hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about mazda's very cool 2.5 liter turbocharged engine it won a ward's auto 10 best engine award in 2017 in the cx-9 and it is also used in the mazda6 now if you haven't yet checked out my video talking about why downsized turbocharged engines aren't always efficient in the real world i would highly recommend checking that out first as in this video we're going to be talking about how mazda's kind of overcome some of the negative consequences that may be associated with using a downsized turbocharged engine and so how are they able to make it both powerful and efficient is what we're going to be talking about in this video and it's going to come down to two ideas here the first being exhaust scavenging and the second being cooled egr or exhaust gas recirculation so first off talking about exhaust scavenging so here we have a traditional four-cylinder turbocharged engine and you can see we've got cylinders one two three and four our firing order is one three four two and you've got your exhaust manifold here then dumping into the turbocharger you want a short exhaust manifold because you want to maintain all of that pressure and get it into the turbo as quickly as possible so that you can use as much energy to keep that turbo spooled up have good response but the negative consequence of using this four to one exhaust dial is that the pressures are going to overlap and as they overlap they trap some of the exhaust gases in the previous cylinder so for example after cylinder two fires we look at our firing order here two after cylinder two fires one is going to fire so two is finishing up its firing uh cycle while one is then beginning to start its firing cycle then finishing it its exhaust valve opens two's exhaust valve is about to close but not yet closed so one is open that exhaust gas comes out pressurizes this exhaust manifold and some of that pressure forces the air that's still trapped within cylinder 2 to remain in there it doesn't allow for all of the gases to escape so you trap some of those hot exhaust gases in that cylinder and as a result you know you're going to increase your likelihood for knock because you're trapping hot gases in that cylinder you're heating up the cylinder which you don't want to do if anything you want cool dgr if you're going to have egr going in there and so the strategy that mazda takes here is to have a 4 3 1 exhaust and so you'll notice that these exhaust gases as they're coming out they don't always line up next to each other so cylinder four fires and then cylinder two fires and you can see these aren't right next to each other so what mazda does in order to change that to make sure that the cylinders are always right next to each other is this 431 design so cylinders three and two are paired together and so they all come out in a straight path next to each other so you're firing order one three four two you'll see one three four two one three four two so you're always going you're just going back and forth across and you're always firing right next to another cylinder and they're both coming out in this vertical direction with each other so with our same example here with two and one so cylinder two is finishing up its stroke and then cylinder one is just opening up that exhaust so cylinder one opens up the exhaust the exhaust comes out and it helps to pull the remaining gases from cylinder two this is called the ejector effect because they're side by side and facing this vertical direction as it comes out it starts pulling air from that cylinder next to it and then exhaust and that just passes down the line here so it goes you know one three four two and they're continuously next to each other the cylinder that fired last is next to the cylinder that's currently opening its exhaust stroke and so as a result you have this ejector effect continuously helping to scavenge pull out as much of that exhaust gas as possible so that you can have the next cylinder fill up with full fresh cool air and fuel unlike here where it doesn't overlap so you've got cylinder 4 firing that's going to then pressurize cylinder 2 you know so you've got it where it's not always overlapping correctly versus here it's set up in a way that allows you to have that scavenging effect now i have a separate video going into this in more detail and how it also allows for you to not have much turbo lag so if you'd like to check that out and you'd like to see more detail on this exhaust manifold design i'll also include a link to that in the video description so the first thing mazda's doing to have both power and efficiency is this scavenging the second thing they're doing is cooled egr and so how does this work well if we look at our cylinder here so here we have that exhaust we're just kind of flipping this around so you can see the exhaust coming out going into our turbocharger you've got the intake so you have your turbocharger intake here it's going to send air through this in blue this is this intake manifold into the cylinders but you also have this egr route and so after those exhaust pass out of that 431 design you're going to have you're going to tap into that and you're going to have an exhaust gas recirculation route and so you can open this port in order to allow some of that exhaust gas to go through then an egr cooler and then from the egr cooler that's an air to water cooler you'll see that mounted on top of the engine this is going to be cooled with the liquid before then passing into the intake manifold so you're going to add some air into the intake manifold that's been cooled from this egr cooler but it's an inert gas there's not oxygen in it and so it's not able to combust so you're putting in this cool inert gas in addition to the air that's being passed in with the engine the fresh air that's coming in and so you've got less oxygen overall that means you're going to have lower combustion temperatures because you're not going to be burning as much fuel but the egr that you do add is cooled so you're not adding this hot gas or trapping this hot gas like a traditional engine may do now because you're adding that cooled egr that inert gas you can actually use more boost and then you can use boost to compensate for that inert gas and you can create more power depending on how much you want you just simply add more boost but you don't have to worry about knock because you're using that cooled egr in order to regulate the combustion temperatures keep the combustion temperatures low and that way you don't have to worry about knock and you can still use higher air fuel ratios so that's the real kicker here how this is able to be efficient and powerful is using these higher air fuel ratios so how does this engine have both power and efficiency at the same time well if we look at a graph of torque versus rpm and so here up at the top we have the peak torque that is possible for this turbocharged engine and as we talked about in the previous video about downsized turbochargers there's a relatively low load a low amount of torque a low amount of throttle that you can give it and still have an ideal air fuel ratio a air fuel ratio of about 14.7 to one so above that in order to make more torque you have to actually decrease the air fuel ratio so use more fuel inject more fuel in order to bring combustion temperatures down and therefore avoid knock but mazda on the other hand what they do instead is use this cooled egr and by using that cool egr they can increase the peak torque you can create while still running a 14.701 air fuel ratio so you're using a much less rich air fuel ratio than other engines would be in these high torque high boost scenarios without you know you're not sacrificing fuel economy as much because you're not using as much fuel so you're able to create the power very efficiently using this cooled egr so that's the really neat thing about this engine uses cooled egr in order to increase the level at which you can still run a stoichiometric air fuel ratio and produce a lot of torque all right well if this is such a great idea why doesn't everyone do it and so what mazda says is that by running this cooled egr their epa fuel economy numbers are not any better so the fuel economy cycle that this car runs on keeps it low enough keeps most cars low enough that they don't actually get into these higher load scenarios and so you don't see on the epa ratings you don't see the benefits of doing this and so what mazda is doing is they're designing this they're putting money they're investing in the customer getting real world good fuel economy that they don't necessarily see on the sticker or it's more accurately represented on the sticker so it's an interesting idea because from a selling point they don't get to say they have any better fuel economy than you know what they would have without using this cooled egr and yet in the real world you're going to notice it you're going to notice you're getting better fuel economy even in situations where you're demanding power demanding peak torque from this engine so the engine producing 227 horsepower 310 pound-feet of torque all on 87 octane gas so very cool that they're able to achieve very high torque numbers very high efficiency numbers all in the real world and all using 87 octane gas regular pump gas because they're involving this cooled egr system so you don't have to pay more for your fuel and you still get the benefits of a turbocharged engine and it's actually efficient so a very cool design from mazda very clever what they've been able to do with this if you guys have any questions or comments of course
