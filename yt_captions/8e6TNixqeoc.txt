hello everyone and welcome in this video we are going to talk about the clever engineering of mclaren's roof scoops and we're also going to talk about the clever engineering of this vehicle right here this is the mclaren 620r which is very much so a track car that you can legally drive to the track so it was designed to be a track car but also designed to be road legal whereas you know many cars they try to be road legal and also operate well on a track this is kind of the opposite it is purely designed for the track oh and hey you can drive it on the road legally so you can get to that track now as you can see i drove all the way to los angeles because i heard the weather here was dry and i wanted to test out a 300 000 sports car and some nice lovely warm dry weather and so it's cold and wet fantastic so let's talk about this roof scoop first of all what is it well this is an air intake not all vehicle roof scoops are going to be used for an engine air intake but that is what it is for this mclaren 620r so intake for the engine and you can actually see as you go inside of the vehicle what's interesting if you you know follow this roofline here and follow that back to the engine wait a minute there's a disconnect so you actually still do have a rear window there and the way they do that is here you can see the intake right above your head as a driver and then it splits left and right for the two banks of the engine so this is a v8 engine and it passes that air back down through here into your air boxes before moving over there you can see the throttle for each individual side there's your intake manifold before it passes into the engine after traveling through that engine on the 600 lt you'll remember there is a top exit exhaust here it actually comes down and comes out the back and you don't have that exhaust interfering at all with this wing back here so this roof mounted intake here is standard for the us market 620r and it replaces the intake which is going to be mounted behind the driver's side window on both sides you'll have the air intakes mounted about right there so replacing it putting it up top in the center so what's the purpose what's the advantage of changing it from the intake back there to the intake right here right above your head you can see that carbon fiber very cool so what's the actual advantage of doing so well really the true reason why this is done i got to speak with mclaren 620r chief engineer and discuss this vehicle in great detail and the reason why this is done is purely for the driver's enjoyment i mean it's to be loud have loud intake engine sounds right beside your face so you know i think today a lot of people kind of cringe it like piping in artificial engine sounds or using the speakers to create artificial engine sounds and in this case mclaren's saying oh you want to hear your engine we'll put the intake literally directly above your head i mean look how close this intake is to my head so you can get all kinds of engine sounds now just because the main purpose is for the driver to get some nice sounds within the cabin doesn't mean there actually isn't some very cool engineering that goes into this so there are some advantages of moving the location uh from over here on the driver's side to up here above the roof and one of the big advantages is that you can get very clean air and so it's not really dependent also on the yaw of the vehicle meaning as that vehicle rotates and turns out on the track you've always got that clean direct path for airflow whereas these on this side right here can be a bit dependent on the car's rotation as it goes into that airflow so here you're ensuring you always have a direct path right into the front of the car for that airflow and also as you can see it's slightly elevated and it's pushed out forward a little bit from the vehicle and so this is ensuring you know as the air gets closer and closer to the vehicle that air speed gets closer and closer to the vehicle speed meaning the two don't have relative motion between them so you want really fast moving airflow meaning airflow that isn't influenced by this vehicle as it's driving through and so you get that by elevating it up and sticking it out a little bit so you can get that direct clean air flow uh always and not have to worry about that boundary layer attaching to the surface of the vehicle and slowing down that airflow as it enters now for naturally aspirated vehicles for example like the mclaren f1 when you have a roof scoop like this you can actually use it as a ram air effect and essentially give yourself a bit of free turbo charging where you get a bit of increased pressure from forcing that air into this intake as you drive through the air at a high speed and as a result you increase the pressure within that intake and you give yourself a bit of free boost meaning you get a little bit above atmospheric pressure within your engine and so you can create additional power now this of course is a turbocharged engine so it's a 3.8 liter twin turbo engine meaning here you're not actually relying on that ram effect as you drive through the air actually you're relying on those turbochargers to suck in the air so you have a suction occurring right here rather than ramming that air in however it does give you a bit of you know less resistance by traveling at a higher speed you've got less resistance towards sucking that air in because you're driving through that air and forcing it into that intake but main purpose being you know getting that sound within the cabin because regardless of whether this intake is mounted up top or mounted here on the side the engine is going to be making the same power that's ultimately limited by your cylinder pressures and those cylinder pressures are going to be you know you're going to have turbochargers that maintain that exact ideal cylinder pressure for peak performance for the vehicle which isn't dependent on where do we put this intake the aerodynamics involved are also pretty interesting so as you can see it kind of contours to the roof here and it has that teardrop shape as it comes back and kind of just disappears into the roof line and so ultimately the goal is if you're going to put the intake up top you want to make sure that you don't change your drag coefficient all that much and so they're minimizing their change on the drag coefficient by giving it that shape that just contours along that roof with that teardrop and as you can see from the front actually it's wider at the base and then it gets narrower towards the top and you can see it has this really wide flat shape so ultimately you're going to have some area that you want for intake to go in and you can create different shapes it could be tall it could be a circle it could be a square and so the reason why it's this wide flat shape is so that you have the same frontal area but you minimize the drag coefficient so if you had a really tall intake right here you'd increase the drag coefficient of the car and you'd worsen the aerodynamics of the car so by keeping it wide and flat close to the car you keep that drag coefficient very similar now you might wonder is that roof scoop going to impact your downforce is it going to impact the aerodynamics of this rear wing because now you're putting this object uh higher above the car uh and so actually you know between the two models the one with the side intake versus the roof mounted intake there's not really a difference in downforce and the reason being is because this wing is so elevated you can see it's raised up quite a bit and so it's raised up above that dirty air that could be coming off the back of this and ensuring that it's within clean air because it's so high up off the back of the vehicle to maximize downforce and give you the full use of the entire wing now on the 600 lt you actually had top exit exhaust and then the wing itself was a bit lower and that lower wing the center portion of the wing actually wasn't doing much for your downforce and that's because the roof of the vehicle uh was you know much above it and so you didn't really have clean air flow for the center of the wing you had that clean air flow on the sides of the wing from the shape of the vehicle and how that airflow came back to it on this one because it's so elevated and you also don't have those top exit exhausts influencing the airflow back here at all you have downforce across the entire wing and this produces significantly more downforce speaking of aerodynamics this has very similar downforce to the racing version of the car the 570s gt4 and so this is producing about 408 pounds of down force at 155 miles per hour you can also see these front dive planes so very similar to the racing version except these have a rounded edge so they're a bit more pedestrian friendly and then also to keep it road legal and allow yourself to drive to the track they incorporated a brake light within the rear wing now on a wet day like today you might wonder what about rain and debris and so you know you do have a nice direct air flow uh for that rain to enter directly into that intake and so there's a couple things to mitigate any problems here first of all they've got a grid within this in order to catch anything like leaves it might get pulled in or you know it for the rain itself there are going to be drain holes as that water works its way back and so actually you know rain is a challenge regardless of where you mount that intake so you've got it up top you're going to have that direct rain going inside and then if you have these intakes actually you'll have the water moving along the body of the car and then passing into those intakes so either way you have to incorporate those drain holes to allow that rain to escape out from the intake now don't worry i didn't forget to ask the important questions so you could call this a roof scoop or you could call it a snorkel so what is the fording depth of a mclaren 620r and is it better if you use the roof scoop versus the side mounts well unfortunately it doesn't make a difference actually the limiting factor if you're trying to go through some deep water is actually the underbody because it has such a flat underbody for aerodynamic purposes as you were to approach some deep water basically just picks up the front of the vehicle because it has that flat underbody turns it into a boat you hydroplane you don't have any steering no good so yeah you don't want to go in deep water with this vehicle yet that's what the world wants me to do with it i mean look at this weather what am i supposed to do this thing's on trofeo ours and they're supposed to be nice and toasty get a little grip now one of the things i love that mclaren does is they put a very large emphasis on weight reduction so i mean you can just see the exposed carbon in here look at that tub underneath uh you know this is look at these seats right here these bucket seats these carbon bucket seats so it's a fairly stripped out interior you actually do have a six point uh racing harness as well as the standard three point you know seat belts for road legality you do have an airbag of course and that airbag you're not going to be able to deactivate it but it won't impact your safety out on the track so the overall curb weight of this vehicle including fluids uh we're at a little over 3000 pounds and this is making 611 horsepower so incredibly quick 0-60 in 2.8 seconds but i think more impressively zero to 124 miles per hour or 200 kilometers per hour in 8.1 seconds so lexus lc 500 going you know zero to 60 in about five seconds versus this is going from 60 to 120 in about five seconds in that same amount of time so wildly quick uh just keeps on pulling thanks to being really light and having quite a bit of power now if you were not convinced that this is in fact a track vehicle that is also happens to be road legal i present to you the interior this is your storage right here that's all you get there is no cup holder when was the last time you're in a vehicle that didn't even have one single cupholder pretty wild so i will close this out giving you some interior noise driving around so you can kind of get a sense for what this intake sounds like thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
