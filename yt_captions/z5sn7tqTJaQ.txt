ladies and gentlemen the mittens chess bot has returned this is not April Fool's April fools was yesterday today is April 2nd 2023 at the time of recording this video it's April 3rd 2023 in many places in the world mittens has returned now mittens looks a little bit different and if you don't even know what mittens is mittens was an extremely popular chess bot that skyrocketed chess.com's popularity in December January couple of months ago and in this video I will be playing the new mittens bot now the new mittens bot is called mittens a niche that's because Grandmaster nichiri was recently appointed chess.com CEO and there are other Bots as well such as Anish Carlson this is what would happen if Anish were to remarry Magnus uh Anish remarry Anish is married uh there is just giri there is high society giri and they're a CEO now we don't care about those other ones although if you want to make a video playing myself playing this guy uh look folks uh we're here because mittens a niche is about to catch these hands uh mittens Anish plays Knight F3 now if you remember the mittens bot was rated one ELO and was a destroyer of worlds well mittens Anish says things like I saw how popular this cat got so now I'm a cat and if you know what it sounds like he would say no that I saw how popular this cat got so you know uh meow you must not fear fear is the mind killer all right 903 um I'm gonna play D5 principle principle move G3 is the ready system from the bot I will develop my knight to F6 probably white wolf and Kettle the bishop and now I have a big option the move Bishop F5 is not a bad move uh it's the reverse London it's a good move for uh about 99.99 of the rating ladder but the drawback of moving the bishop out is that your queen side is destabilized alongside this diagonal so white might play things like this trying to put a little pressure on your pawn and this diagonal and try to bring the queen out to B3 now the truth is even though mittens and Niche is rated one I actually have no idea if this bot is truly rated one so I'm gonna play Bishop E7 and I'm gonna try to Castle my king very common idea is to also go Knight H4 here to try to get my Bishop against C4 I will play Rock Solid which is the move C6 and um there it is the bot does in fact play the move Knight H4 now I I think I'm gonna go back I mean I'm I'm probably gonna have to give up the bishop I think probably the most compact way to give up the bishop is to just bring the bishop back to G6 and then after Knight takes at least I have H takes although taking with like this is also probably okay but I want to keep my Center solid so I'm going to play that all right there's Queen B3 now normally you want to meet the queen like this you don't want to play B6 you don't want to play B6 because it destabilizes this Pawn it's not make no mistake at 99 of the chest levels if you play the move B6 you're gonna be fine uh but I I prefer Queen C8 I don't want to over commit my pawns uh opponent does in fact take I am a tiger and you are in the jungle mittens Anish calls eternity okay he he no problem uh HG so we see I have a very solid light squared setup this is not a particularly scary move I'm considering castling I'm also considering Knight D7 and Knight A6 uh I mean I I honestly I can't see the difference with any of those moves uh maybe I Castle maybe I play Knight t7 White Once Knight D2 or Knight C3 followed by putting the Rooks in the center that that that's what I think white wants I I don't see any drawback to the move Knight bd7 I thought about that yep I thought that now now the bot already committed the pawn to D3 but it does this because it's a traditionally good move anyway and it stops both of my knights from coming to these two squares um okay again I never really want to capture because I'm opening up the position for mittens or Anish or mittens so I don't know which one is which and I guess now I will go here right hmm kinda also want to play a5a4 maybe we just play principal and Castle I mean I do have an open Rook but I'm not I'm not too hyped about what's going on over there now I think at some point E4 will happen I wonder if I should play rookie 8 to enable the movement of my knight that's definitely an idea I think it's important that I'm able to actually take back okay H4 is a very very bot-like move um wow okay I'm thinking A5 maybe Queen C7 Queen B6 Let's uh let's do A5 indeed and I mean I guess A4 right that's that's that's why we did this we're gonna try to dislodge the queen okay Queen C3 this is not really a threat uh I'm considering maybe dancing out that way all right this this is sort of justifying my play you'll notice that neither side wants to take white doesn't want to go here because I can always break this I don't want to take because I'm opening the bishop and they don't want to take because then they're kind of sealing in their Bishop for good um now do I if I if I move my knight out of the center E4 becomes very strong so I'm heavily contemplating the move Queen A5 and also Queen B6 inducing the move C5 I might do that Queen B6 putting a little pressure on everything and kind of yeah so there's a reason the bot hasn't played this move right like a move ago like white just isn't playing C5 and it's probably got to do with the fact that I can do something if the bot plays C5 like what if I play Queen A6 maybe I should have went back but I'm I'm okay so that pawn has now moved also which has me thinking do I take take try to get my knight to D5 that doesn't that doesn't look half bad yeah I'm gonna take I really like the hole that's being created here and I can put my knight on D5 whoa Queen C4 mittens is not taking the pawn back so if I take I guess the Knight is getting in but even if the Knight is getting in I mean I think I'm pretty solid also there's nothing really like I don't understand I could just play Knight T5 or something I think I probably should play 95 95 but should be seven rookie seven but if Knight T5 the Knight is coming to D6 right that's that's sort of the idea um maybe E5 to try to take advantage of the fact that like my opponent didn't take the pawn back um also Bishop f8 could be interesting to just get out of this completely I might do that I might play Bishop f8 the point is I don't want to trade off my Bishop now I I have to fight for the D6 Square okay we're trading Queens interesting why is the bot trading Queens with me the light that burns twice as bright Burns half as long mittens in each sense is an end soon I'm getting trash talked by a bot uh well now I'm definitely gonna trade because now that hole is uh plugged I'm not really I might just go here and like I mean this this D5 thing is I gotta Tell You Folks I I'm liking what I'm seeing over here on on D5 uh I mean Bishop B7 looks pretty good to me what Rook C4 Rook B4 is a thing do I play Rook A5 Rook B5 or what do I do uh maybe yeah I mean I don't why would I not just put the Knight on D5 it looks so good there and then maybe just Bishop E7 I I mean I'm I'm trying to figure out like as a human I'm terrified right what about A3 maybe there's Bishop D5 and then I'm pinned like what if I just unpin myself like this my knight looks fantastic whoa It's actually taking but this is crazy damn I don't even know which way I'm gonna take back C or E if I take with the E Pawn huh I mean it all looks okay I I really I'm perplexed I'm gonna do this I'm Gonna Keep My structure together I'm not really worried about C6 and uh I can play F6 and King F7 I can also play Rook C8 I can also play Rook C6 I don't know which one is better maybe blockading the pawn is better maybe A3 is also a good move okay uh Rook C8 this is not a good move yeah I I think the bot has just ran out of ideas which is a really welcome sight for me now I'm bringing my king this is very important in the end game to bring the king forward I don't know where the Rook is going if I'm being honest is it going to A3 Play Bishop E7 it's maybe getting my Bishop out a little bit oh B4 interesting okay I probably have to take oh man that's annoying B5 what if I play B5 I'm just trying to lock the position seems to have been locked by the way Rook C6 and don't I just have like a defensive Fortress here um rookie eight bishop d8 or something okay Rook h8 the second The Rook moves there yeah I'm just gonna come here and then Bishop D6 I'm gonna take I think is that what I'm gonna do uh I'm so scared folks I'm like so close I think to drawing this stupid bot yeah I can just play this and just go back and forth okay it's it's trying to just like make progress but I I don't think it can okay it's still trying which is very scary uh rookie shade F4 F5 I think is the key can I just play F5 by the way just play it right now just like completely on my own volition just play F5 whoa oh no I'm so scared what did I just do Bishop F6 oh God this Pawn oh no I've have I lost stability oh God oh my goodness what have I done H5 do I have to play Rook H6 he's gonna take and take and then get oh my oh my oh my this is devastating um oh this was the only trap that it had wow I was so close if I take it takes and it's it's getting through I think if I take oh man it can take and it's getting in somehow or is it is it just gonna take my pawn and sneak over here if I go up Bishop E5 looks if I go up I think just FG maybe Rook H6 Bishop B5 King G6 Bishop oh my goodness ah yeah and oh is there a G5 what wait oh I think I see it folks Rook G6 Bishop H4 King F7 Bishop E7 here and Rook div oh but then I have Rook G4 wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute oh I made it oh oh oh that was so good for so long I I was doing so okay oh that's so heartbreaking I'm gutted oh this stupid bot played at 92 91 accuracy oh yo this this thing estimated me at 14.50 yeah I I guess I was just Rook hate was a bad move apparently the bot missed the win here but ah that was not bad all right I gotta play with white now give me a game with white you stupid stupid animal all right uh E4 Carl Khan against me do you know I invented this opening uh I'm gonna play the Fantasy variation what is the bot gonna play against the fantasy variation all right E6 huh can I play a cool Gambit against the bot I'm gonna play Knight H3 against the bot this is a super cool new Gambit I I mean it's probably gonna know everything and it's gonna like execute me but the idea is that after this I have Queen G4 what wait wait I think this is like a huge mistake by the bot oh God am I blundering something um what take here I I swear the bot is getting its Queen trapped like could this really be a thing oh my goodness folks Bishop D2 is also possible and then I do this I got I gotta go for it right I mean the video is long enough you've been watching long enough all right what king F2 here King D1 also doesn't look half bad I kind of want to go King F2 but then my my and then maybe bishop D3 I don't know what's better folks where's my king better huh D1 or F2 I mean how do you even do this this is so this is brutal I'm gonna go King D1 I'm giving up my Rook I'm sacrificing The Rook and I'm doing it for the content Bishop C4 or what what are we doing here maybe I go back to G4 and I try to get the pawn on G7 maybe Queen E5 Queen G4 huh what's uh let's do this I'm hitting G7 how do you guard it you gotta either sacrifice the right to Castle oh my God it just kept it castled into my I mean this is this is bogus what are we even what all right there's a Checkmate on the way you're gonna get mated you're gonna get Maiden mittens bot thing you're gonna get mated I mean wait do I have a Greek gift how do I not have a great gift Bishop H7 Queen H5 Knight G5 Queen D4 uh just Queen D4 and it's check yeah I don't have that wow I guess you don't try to Checkmate a bot you know I I guess I guess that's sort of the uh the motto here I mean I can also bring my Rook I can play Knight G5 but I guess Queen D4 yeah oh that might even be more brutal folks I I gotta I I mean this is this is tough this is uh this is heartbreaking it's it's just gonna just gonna go there and now I'm gonna lose my Center Pawn it's not even take it's not even taking my it's going for my other pieces oh my God I kind of wish I had put my king on F2 because then it would have been out of the way of all the rest of the attackers all right I'm getting my last piece in the game but I don't think I'm fast enough ah this is tough oh my goodness it's just blocking me I got I got nothing I I got nothing I can do here I mean I just don't oh my God ah this is not a good move it's just gonna go straight for my king or that yeah I can't even take it I can't even take it I mean I I check check you you idiot I'm sacrificing the bishop for checkmate ah let's check I can't even do that um Bishop B3 oh it blocked my only idea [Music] let me win let me win oh my goodness the backwards bishop move to hit the queen and block the check oh if I come back it doesn't even take it's gonna men's uh I'm maybe I'm gonna get the safety oh no I was just taking my Bishop I don't have any more pieces did I really just have no chance it looked like I was so okay I don't what are you doing what is it doing what what is that move I just take a pawn I don't understand oh now I can't go there now I I get mated I get made it in the I mean this is this is uh this is crazy ah knocks Queen on the floor come on mittens yo mittens it's it's not that serious just like come on dude you know I really don't think the position was that awful was I really just like not even with I wasn't even better from the opening are you kidding me come on I should have went Bishop wait oh that wasn't a good move I guess I was just losing this was just the whole thing was losing I hate chess dude I I really really thought that like this was some cool light oh this is just not good I should have just won Bishop D2 huh Bishop B2 Bishop D2 is bad Bishop D2 is bad I should have went here and then this oh and then this and then check oh all right well mittens is back is the story um and it's here to terrorize us for a limited time only and it's also cosplaying a human so mittens has snuck back into the chess.com headquarters and now it's about now it's a it's a niche Geary so enjoy get ready to never win
