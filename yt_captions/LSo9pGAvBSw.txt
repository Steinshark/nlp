in the 1990s western scientists were allowed to study a series of fossils from a dig site in west the outing china what they saw would blow their minds one of the most famous fossil beds ever discovered in history a finely preserved slice of life from 120 million years ago and within this treasure trove a unique creature a dinosaur that would make headlines around the world i've been a dinosaur fan ever since i was a kid i am excited to dive back into the field once more in this video we're going to look at china's contribution to our understanding of the dinosaur theory of birds but first i would like to ask if you might be interested in the patreon if you like what this channel does you can support the work by joining the early access tier early access members get to see new videos long before they are released to the public the backlog is quite significant so head on over to the patreon page and take a look i deeply appreciate anything you'd be able to sign up for thank you and on with the show if you're like me and the rest of my generation most of us have not really read up on dinosaur literature since the first jurassic park movie you should dive back in a lot has happened since then like a whole lot one big thing that has happened has to do with the dinosaur and bird connection birds are now dinosaurs feathered theropod dinosaurs and the only living ones left on earth which i am still getting used to to be honest it's the pluto thing all over again the journey towards this understanding takes a long and winding road the wikipedia article on the origin of birds is very well documented and a good place to start if you like dinosaurs then i recommend that you check it out but let's do the quick rundown in the mid-1800s the discovery of archaeopteryx until a few decades ago the earliest known bird sparked debate about the connections between birds and reptiles thomas huxley biologist and a contemporary of darwin proposed the animal as a transitional fossil between the two the theory though lost steam in the 1920s after denmark's gerhard heilman wrote a book called the origin of birds in this titillating tome heilman concluded that though there were many similarities between birds and dinosaurs the former did not descend from the latter the primary reason for this was because that scientists at the time believed that dinosaurs had reduced insignificant clavicles while birds did not i.e they had wishbones heilman like many others at his time believed that evolution was not reversible thus he had to conclude that birds and dinosaurs were cousins sharing a common ancestor rather than having a direct link hallman's work stood as the generally accepted theory for four decades then in the 1970s two broad shifts in the academia helped revitalize the bird dinosaur connection the first shift began with the work of john ostrom he discovered and described a new family species of dinosaur dionycus this large powerful predator forced scientists to revisit their assumptions of what dinosaurs were and how they acted for instance whether they were cold-blooded or warm-blooded the animal similarities to modern birds and archaeopteryx especially in the four limb bones revitalized the dino bird descendant hypothesis this work came along at a time when the academic community started to adopt the classification methodology called cladistics this groups together species using their derived traits with the idea of discovering the most recent common ancestor together these kicked off the dinosaur renaissance support for the dinosaur bird theory continued to grow over the years but scientists waited for a piece of evidence some special fossil to finally glue it all together in the 1700s during the qing dynasty the ruling manjo emperors would escape beijing's searing summer heat at a beautiful mountain resort in the city now known as changda not to be confused with the city of chengdu in the situan province chengdu has pandas changda has dinosaurs the manjo had conquered the area prior to their conquest of the ming dynasty the resort took 89 years to build and is today a tourist attraction after the fall of the qing dynasty in 1911 the republic of china created the special area out of the region which literally means hot river because the area's rivers at the time did not freeze in the winter was romanized as jiho later on in the 1920s the roc government upgraded the special area to a full province the jihol province it was around then that scientists first began to notice that jehovah's lands yielded some excellent fossils the american paleontologist a.w grabow proposed the jehovah series of fossils in 1923 on the basis of a lycoptera fish fossil he discovered near what is now the city of lindgren when the japanese empire illegally annexed the jiho province in 1933 an act that would eventually lead to the second sino-japanese war their scientists also noted this rich trove of fossils their findings however were lost during the chaos of war the republic of china recovered the province after world war ii only to lose it along with the rest of the mainland shortly thereafter after the founding of the people's republic of china the government reorganized the provinces jeho was abolished and its land was divided amongst the modern day provinces of hebei the owning inner mongolia and tianjin in 1962 chinese paleontologist gujjuei would propose the existence of the jehovah group or the jehovah biota since the fossils included plants the jehovah province no longer existed but the name hearkened back to the 1928 discoveries for the next few decades only chinese scientists were allowed to study the area's fossils then in the 1990s china opened up to the rest of the world and western scientists were granted the opportunity to scrutinize its treasures and what treasures they were the fossils in the jehovah biota are of animals living during the mesozoic era an era that can be further subdivided into the famous triassic jurassic and cretaceous periods the era is known as the age of the conifers better known as the age of the reptiles yet better known as the age of the dinosaurs today the jehovah province has cold dry winters and warm humid summers 125 million years ago in the early cretaceous period the whole area was covered with forests streams and fresh water lakes volcanoes to the west would occasionally erupt throwing huge plumes of ash and chemicals into the air analyses have found these plumes to be made up of hydrogen fluoride hydrogen chloride and sulfur these hydrogen fluoride plumes would suffocate huge bunches of animals and cause them to fall into the water in mass die-offs in some areas as many as one animal for every one to two square meters then the streams would gently wash the corpses into the lakes where the falling ash quickly buried them instead of been almost a thousand feet thick the sudden universal nature of this event means that animals died without being scavenged in ideal preservation circumstances scientists have described it as a mesozoic pompeii and i have to agree fossil traits include feathers skin muscles eyes and even the ovarian follicles of birds fossilized melanosomes allow us to reconstruct the coloring of certain animals even stomach contents were preserved giving us a glimpse into what these animals hunted and ate thanks to these fossils we now know for instance that large mesozoic mammals shrew like things three feet or one meter long eight baby dinosaurs and the biota's diversity was stunning scientists have found fossils of mammals insects plants fish salamanders frogs crocodiles lizards pterosaurs clams snails and turtles but some of the most impactful fossil discoveries have been of those of both early birds and feathered dinosaurs in 1993 chinese paleontologists hold the en received a fossil from a collector the collector had found it at a local flea market in the town of shikha in the locality of bay piau they determined that the fossil belonged to a series of early birds not just a new species but a whole new grouping of species or genus they name this genus after confucius confucius ornis the chinese name is kong zenyao literally confucia's bird for the sake of my sanity i am going to refer to this grouping from now on as the confucius birds confucius birds existed about 130 to 120 million years ago its bird ancestor archaeopteryx lived some 30 million years prior they look like ravens and generally are about the size of a pigeon we call it an early bird but by this time confucius birds already shared many traits with today's birds it is likely that by then such british traits have already disseminated across a wide variety of similar species families the animal had a beak without teeth and had toe pads and scaly skin on its feet and there are great similarities in the wings though confucius birds like archaeopteryx probably did not fly likely glided down from trees confucius bird fossils are common in the jehovah biota and there are over a thousand existing specimens belonging to many different species they probably flocked in large groups in the area interestingly enough many of these fossils have been smuggled abroad to be sold to private collectors since they were the fossils of birds rather than dinosaurs i reckon they did not fall under the protected import categories okay so now we have the bird fossils but as i mentioned earlier confucius birds did not predate archaeopteryx thus though it is a very interesting fossil its discovery did not really contribute all that much more to what was already known about the origins of birds supposing that birds really did descend from the dinosaurs burdish dinosaurs should be out there they needed something more and a few years later that something came about in 1996 two scientists from the chinese geological museum of beijing published a paper about a fossil found by a farmer again in the town of shiha the fossilized animal had feathers feathers down its spine and sides unlike the aforementioned confucius bird though the writers of the paper did not call it a bird rather it was a dinosaur the first ever found with feathers and declared to be a transitional species between dinosaurs and birds this dinosaur would be named cynosauropteryx in chinese they call it donghua long nao literally meaning chinese dragon bird sinosauropteryx was a compsanathid theropod a classification of bipedal dinosaurs with hollow bones and three-toed limbs compsonathus were portrayed in the movie jurassic park the lost world in that movie they were the size of a chicken but today scientists believed them to be more like the size of turkeys the sinosauropteryx fossil even preserved the animal's stomach contents they had recently eaten a lizard and some eggs they were also able to extract information about its coloring the dinosaur likely had raccoon-like facial markings and dark light counter-shading characteristic of open environments not only did the discovery show that feathered dinosaurs can exist it also helped the prevailing rebuttal against the dinosaur origin of birds up until its discovery all the possible theropod candidates for avian ancestorship lived in the late cretaceous period but archaeopteryx lived in the late jurassic period which caused a time paradox sinosauropteryx helped significantly close the gap pushing back the dino bird transition by millions of years the dinosaur made the world news and suggested that the lands that would later become china were a center of bird evolution almost immediately after the announcement however opposing voices emerged to challenge the dinosaur feather conclusion they vociferously argued that the fossilized markings were not actually feathers or even protofeathers but rather degraded collagen fibers basically something like a frill that you might find on a lizard the authors argued that people calling cynosuropteryx a feathered dinosaur were engaged in wishful thinking the debate went back and forth for about a decade but an influential paper in 2017 settled the matter for the broader academic community the authors re-examined some of the comparison evidence the pro-collagen camp had used to make their argument and concluded that the comparison had been made erroneously what we had thought were collagen fibers on ichthyosaurus were scratch marks on fossils the community has largely accepted this though the debate on the origin of feathers and how they had been used continues it is now generally accepted that sinosauropteryx had feathers the shiha fossil site would yield many more famous feathered dinosaurs these would provide the most significant evidence supporting the dinosaur origin of birds a bevy of early bird and feathered dinosaur fossils notable examples include and i'm really going to mess these names up prot archaeopteryx robusta cauditerics zoe bapiosaurus inexpectus and more the discovery of the jehovah biota fossils represent a significant paradigm shift in our understanding of dinosaurs and is rightly recorded as such in history the area continues to yield excellent fossils for many species and today the site is now the location of the china shikha extinct organism fossil exhibition a museum is being built there to commemorate the groundbreaking science that came out of its lands all right everyone that's it for tonight i hope you guys enjoyed if you want more content you can like and
