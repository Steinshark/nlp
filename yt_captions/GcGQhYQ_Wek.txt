why do speakers hiss it doesn't seem like too much to ask that they just stay quiet if you're not trying to put any sound through them at the moment but too often you hear unpleasant static if the volume is turned up with nothing playing is there a single cause of this like a malevolent Spirit haunting your home theater it turns out there are lots of reasons for the familiar hiss so we're going to explain some of the more common ones first off let's talk about issues with the amplifier the component that takes an incoming audio signal and well amplifies it up to the point it can drive your speakers without an amplifier your speakers wouldn't generate noise but unfortunately many amplifiers don't just amplify The Sounds you want some cheap amplifiers produce hiss for two reasons one they're amplifying electrical noise at their input even if you're not playing anything at the moment and they're adding their own noise this can be easy to hear for yourself on inexpensive speakers with built-in amplifiers these are the ones that might have a volume control on the speaker itself and although when something is playing can be too quiet to notice but you often do hear it if you turn the volume up when nothing's playing typically you can reduce or eliminate this kind of hissing by switching to a better quality lower noise amplifier although a separate external amp and a pair of passive speakers can be a relatively safe bet there are active speakers with built-in amps that are also very good at staying silent you just have to make sure you're buying good quality Equipment so be sure to read reviews unfortunately most manufacturers don't give a clear spec showing how much noise to expect at a certain distance but a small handful do another common source of noise is called a ground Loop and this is not an organic cereal that tastes like cardboard now this can happen when you have two pieces of equipment plugged into separate wall outlets then you connect those two devices together with a single cable think an audio Source like a computer connected to an external set of speakers that signal cable effectively closes a loop between the speakers and the audio source as you can see in this diagram once a ground Loop is formed it's easy for electricity to start flowing through it in some undesirable ways due to the magnetic fields generated by the building's electrical wiring and this can manifest as an undesirable hum in your speakers I have had this it sucks fortunately there's a fairly easy way to make ground Loops far smaller to the point you probably won't hear any noise try connecting everything to the same outlet with a power strip but unfortunately there are other common sources of noise besides these two and we'll tell you about a couple of them right after we thank GLI net meet the Slate ax router your ultimate travel companion whether you're a remote worker or a frequent traveler keep your data secure on public Wi-Fi in hotels cafes

check out the GLI net slate ax today at the link below even though lots of of consumer grade audio products are shielded against radio frequency interference this can still be a problem if the shielding isn't done quite correctly the input and output connectors can be especially vulnerable to RF interference which can be generated by everything from Bluetooth devices to dimmer switches with the latter being a famous source of interference for home theater enthusiasts that wasn't my problem though solving this kind of problem is a little bit more difficult as it might take some trial and error to find the problematic piece of equipment that's either creating interference or receiving too much of it sometimes you can fix the problem simply by placing separate pieces of equipment farther away from each other and there are also RF filtering products you can buy if the problem is really bad like you have an inconsiderate neighbor with a ham radio but now we're going to talk about a wonderful kind of hissing that can happen even if there's nothing physically wrong with your setup although we're used to listening to music digitally These Days vinyl is making a comeback and I know plenty of our older viewers still have a cassette tape collection these media tend to be physically noisy format so you'll hear many of the small imperfections in the tape or the vinyl record itself and though some listeners prefer the warmer sound of vinyl many dislike how much crackling or hissing they can hear when listening to old school audio you can even hear this sometimes on Old recordings that have been digitized because this extra noise is a natural consequence of playing back vinyl it's very difficult to eliminate completely but wellmade equipment that isn't loose or wobbly and is kept clean is a great start and if you're talking about turntables using anti vibration pads is also helpful if you really want to try and cut down on additional noise there are postprocessing solutions out there that try and clean up the signal though of course these use digital algorithms don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water and speaking of out we're out of time but we know there are other things that can make for unwanted speaker hiss such as electrical noise inside of an older PC so go check out our other video on external DXs and amps and leave a comment if you've ever had some kind of unexpected interference make your speakers sound like they were possessed by demons
