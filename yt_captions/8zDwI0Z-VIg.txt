ladies and gentlemen if you clicked on this video then you are either a chess fan or this is the first chess video you have ever clicked on because of the YouTube algorithm so welcome to the world of Chess regardless of which of those two cases you fall under you associate certain names with chess whether you're a new fan or an older fan some of those names obviously Magnus Carlson hikara Kamura maybe Gotham chess maybe Fabiana Carana maybe it's a local hero from the country that you're from like vishan Nan for example or prag Nanda but there is a new character who has actually returned to the game and his name is Wei Wei is a Chinese Grandmaster and his story is fascinating absolutely fascinating a massive amount of Chess fans got into chess and particular particularly chess content from 2020 to 2024 and in that period Wei has basically been absent from the game aside from some tournaments here and there that he has played in China people have hypothesized that it's because he went back to University maybe he's pursuing a full-time career in some sort of Walk of Life but waye just won the first major chess event of the year which is called T Steel and in this video I'm going to give you a spotlight into his career and how we got here and hopefully we back and he's back to stay because he is a gem of a chess player so here's a couple of fascinating statistics about weyi weyi is the youngest ever chess player to get to 2700 ELO younger than Magnus Carlson and younger than Ali Resa fuja who is the youngest ever player to get to 2800 so Wei had him beat at 2700 now this is according to the Fay website this actually happened in 2015 early 2015 when he did it at the age of 15 years old he's born in 1999 he's a 24y old player who feels like a veteran of the game for nearly a decade he has been rated 2700 and then he sort of stagnated he went down to 2690 he's been as high as 2750 but most of his career he's been around 2720 2730 and then obviously the pandemic happened but now he's back he just won a tournament and he's 2750 and top 10 in the world for the first time in his life this is absolutely incredible and in this video I'm going to show you what they call the modern Immortal chess game wayi played this game when in in uh 2015 the monster year that he had but it was later in the year this was the year that he broke 2700 he was the youngest ever 2700 and he played this game when he was 16 years old this was a super tournament held in China and they were inviting a bunch of strong players uh from all over the world and his opponent was Lazaro brone who at the time represented Cuba so for reasons of accuracy I'm putting the Cuba Federation there now Lazaro actually represents the United States so he he's moved to the United States I think he lives in the United States this is the modern Immortal game Wei is a dynamic fiery personality who we have not seen in many years compete at the top level so here's a throwback to his game in 2015 and hopefully he's back for good he plays E4 C5 is played by Lazaro which is basically the first thing that you need to get a fun game with E4 you need a sicilian I mean you can get a bunch of other stuff you know that but but this obviously gives black fighting chances on equal grounds Wei plays Knight to F3 black plays Pawn to E6 and after Knight C3 which is just a little bit of a I don't know like generally you play D4 and then you trade and and then you play Knight C3 Maybe Knight C3 is to try to get his opponent to commit to something like maybe Wei doesn't have enough information on what his opponent is going to play I don't know I mean generally speaking you know you you could just go here and you will get the very same position but he plays Knight C3 black plays A6 and white plays Bishop E2 so Wei is just postponing this move I guess he's trying to get his opponent to put a knight on C6 which he does and I guess the idea was that if he had rushed then Lazaro might have played like this and never put the Knight on C6 which is just a slightly different way to play this opening so Wei does it like this he does it in a very subtle way he in he indefinitely postpones the move d4 until his opponent commits the Knight to C6 and now he's forcing his opponent to play a Time mon of Defense it's a lot of intricacies right like you the major difference is that black has not yet committed this move which is meaningless to 99% of you because you're beginner intermediate or even Advanced players who can't understand the difference Frankly Speaking I also can't quite understand the difference I'm sort of inventing it as I go uh but I think that's the reason right I think in what I showed you black does not have to go Knight C6 he plays Knight C6 and now we are in a position which is known as the Timon of Defense which is when you take on D4 In the Sicilian and you commit your pawns like this black puts the queen on C7 to snipe on the dark squares wee plays Bishop E3 We are following What's called the main line Main Line meaning these are the most popular moves that occur at this level at all uh you know like they're the most commonly played moves now there's a fork in the road no pun intended Bishop B4 or Bishop to E7 uh Bishop B4 is more aggressive targeting the Knight trying to destabilize the White Center uh and it is the most common move however the second most common move is to play a little bit more passively with just putting the bishop on E7 because generally if the bishop is going to go to B4 it's going to perish and maybe black just wants to keep the Bishop on the board he's going to feel a little bit more comfortable having somebody controlling and fighting for the dark squares considering you've put so many pawns on light squares Wei plays F4 idea of f4 is very simple he wants to play E5 he wants to play F5 also with this move you activate your Rook right your Rook wasn't AC of a move ago so you get your Rook potentially into the game and you are creating a samide attacking possibility black plays D6 plays D6 to prevent E5 if he had castled white would have went E5 shove the Knight backwards and then would have had free clearance in the center to go on an attack so black plays D6 and now there are many moves okay uh we plays still playing by the way thousands of games in the database King to H1 the most common move in the position King H1 is useful for two reasons number one you get your King off of this diagonal uh again at 99 level 99% of levels of Chess you won't even reach this position cuz it's going to take a lot of different twists and turns but King H1 is basically useless for like a 1700 they don't quite understand it um but you get your King off of this diagonal in the future and also you can use your G Pawn to attack you're not going to use your G Pawn to attack if the king is on G1 but when the king is tucked away in the corner and The Rook can be behind the pawn you will so just a generally useful move and now Queen to E1 another side effect of playing the move F4 so I said F4 is useful to attack with the pawns to get the Rook here but also it opens up this diagonal which is a very nice transfer point for the queen so you kind of see how at the top level every move flows together the subtle differences of opening up diagonals right like hidden openings and hidden spaces and things like that very very subtle very interesting stuff now the second that white destabilizes his Knight black captures black captures because the side that is about to be under attack or the side that is slightly behind in space which black is both wants to trade pieces the more pieces that you trade the less powerful whites attack is plus this kn move opens up the queen and now black plays B5 all of this has been played before which is why it is very much in the balance now waye plays Queen to G3 there are many ideas here already you can play A3 stopping B4 you can attack the center with E5 or you can play Queen G3 justifying your little Queen maneuver and queen G7 if you had x-ray vision would be Checkmate but right now the Knight is blocking the way okay Queen G3 B4 here is possible but the counter shot of E5 is strong and allows the Knight to get here of course this is totally lost for black because of mate so for that reason black plays Bishop B7 and white stops the move B4 with A3 okay both sides have now made 14 moves the position is still equal when is we going to go to work when's this Banger chess content going to happen right around now we we has made the necessary preparations to have an attack the sides are about to Clash black is going to smash the center with D5 or E5 and white is going to try to attack the King right both guys are making Necessary preparations Wei brings his Rook so his Rook goes from the corner it's his first move of the game it's going to support the center pawns maybe it's going to transfer over here and by the way even this position has been reached something like 10 or 15 times in the database up until that point black plays Rook D7 this is a very very mysterious move but black wants to play Queen d8 fighting for this diagonal if the Knight moves and also supporting the advance in the center so this is a again very mysterious move very tough to explain at most levels of Chess I'm doing my best here come the preparations of the attack and at this point something's going to give right something is going to give here well seeing that white is about to start attacking Lazaro plays the move G6 okay G6 blocks the diagonal of the bishop it slightly weakens the dark squares but it's not like black is going to get mated okay it's not like it's going to happen I mean Black's not going to go like Knight G4 and hang mate okay hang mate on G7 that's not what's going to happen but now we plays F5 and my friends if you had the attention span to watch 10 minutes of this video you will be rewarded you are about to be rewarded can you imagine if some Bozo clicked on this video in six minutes and was like I'm bored and now was like watching some you know skibby toilet somewhere for anybody above the agge of 12 skibby toilet you really just don't want to go down that rabbit hole but you know as a YouTuber I I I have to know all the memes and where our society has gone is is really quite tragic um anyway now you are about to get handsomely rewarded so the move G6 while it does fight against the light squared Bishop is a hook a hook is a pawn in front of a king that can be used as a target for the attacking side to potentially trade and open up you will notice that if a move ago let's say in this position White had gone F5 black would simply go here and then you know if white Retreats black will just open up the center with D5 right that's kind of the idea but now white plays F5 and now pandemonium complete pandemonium so Lazaro Bron plays E5 which is what I just said right plays E5 and the bishop slides out of the way but here's the problem now if you're playing Black you can't go D5 can't go D5 because I'm about to open up your king I have a pawn there and I'm going to open up your king so he plays Rook E8 a preparatory move move waiting for white to kind of get in here with some pieces Wei captures the pawn on G6 as per his plan and now H takes G6 you can't go here because then the queen gets in that's very dangerous so H takes G6 but now what what's the idea now well now my friends now now wee 16-year-old wee teenager wee plays night D5 that move does not even look possible because after Knight D5 e D5 Bishop D5 white just loses a pawn I don't understand what was the point where's the attack okay you got ideas but anything tangible Queen H6 to try to sack black can play like Bishop f8 just kick you out so what's the idea of Knight D5 Knight takes D5 played well as it turns out the idea of Knight takes D5 is not to take the knight at all the idea of Knight takes D5 is to lose your knight and then sacrifice The Rook the move Rook to E8 designed to bring the bishop back to defend the king and potentially fight in the center destabilize that pawn and like a sniper Wei gets in and sacrifices The Rook this is brilliant positional understanding while the black pieces are standing around like this like in a Tetris Cube they're not equipped to defend the position Queen H7 is now mate you have to accept the offering you could play Knight F6 but then white wins by getting in like this threatening a discover check if the king slides to the corner Bishop G5 is simply overwhelming combined with Rook E3 Rook H3 but also if Queen E6 if let's say Bishop f8 Rook E7 shielding the attack here here and then it's mate oh my God so he sacks The Rook black has to take and for a brief moment Lazar is up seven points of material but his rook and queen are completely useless the bishop is useless on the light squares so now Queen H7 check Black's King is forced forward this is actually pretty easy to calculate how because if there mate if here Rook F1 E5 is mate like you take the Knight and then and then the king is just mated the the king cannot move so Rook F1 is is mate so you know that after Queen H7 the King has to go here and the idea is very straightforward the idea is that if you take the Knight saves you but now you take the Knight you don't take the Knight back here first you get a full Rook sacrifice and then you bait the king forward and you know the next move or do you because if Bishop D5 for King what are you going to do well in the game he took with the King he took with the King because he was trying to escape he's trying to escape he could have taken with the bishop then Wei probably would have played something like Bishop G6 threatening mate and mate Bishop G2 King G2 D5 Bishop F7 King D6 Queen H6 King C7 there's a bishop check so you would go Bishop F6 Bishop E8 and white is winning we calculated all of that when we played the move Knight to D5 he calculated 10 moves into the future and saw this position so at this point black is out of Crossroads he takes with the King he's trying trying to run back here what is the only way in this position to prevent the move King to C6 the only way and way he saw this from a distance otherwise white is lost the only way is to sacrifice another piece and attract the black king like a magnet Bishop to E4 check you are losing a full Bishop however when black captures now you have the element of time on your side and the King cannot Escape back because you play Queen to F7 now in this position stockfish gives a gangster Maiden nine if we had seen mate and N in this position this might be the greatest game ever played in this position the best move is not to take the pawn with check which many people would do because then the king escapes then the king escapes you can't sack your queen too no the best move in this position is C4 what yes to prevent the king from escaping and the point is you threaten check if black takes now you take what's the difference here here only move this is mate the difference is if you had taken on G6 right away way then after here here here this is not a mate so by playing the move C4 you actually baited your opponent into taking but you also threaten this if black plays Rook G6 then you play check discovered attack the king comes forward and is made it from the side King here mate oh my God if we had found C4 I mean I would have just lost my mind C4 trying to seal the escape and setting up that zigzag Checkmate oh my God but Wei plays the second best move instead of C4 he plays Queen F7 now after Queen F7 white is now threatening mate the king is sealed the king is completely sealed King is in the center Queen F7 a gangster move down eight points of material eight points the incredible thing about this position is that there are so many mates so a bishop move on this diagonal is made there there there there there Bishop D4 takes with the king so any other move is made also Queen F3 is made Dov tail Checkmate oh my so Queen F7 threatens mate now Black's only move is Bishop F6 Bishop F6 and now look look at did you see that stockfish did not even realize how strong this position was in this position Wei plays Bishop to D2 check saying okay you can go there or there which do you want to do because if you play King F5 I play Rook F1 now wherever you move your king I bring my queen back and I mate you on one of these two squares not E3 but one of those two squares is going to be a Checkmate very very soon Queen D3 is mate in one Queen F3 is probably mate in a couple moves there's no way to stop Queen D3 you have 25 points of material 10 19 plus 6 25 and nobody can stop this how insane is that if the King goes to D4 you gota you know you got to go here you can't go here let the king Escape Bishop F6 Bishop D2 King to D4 and now he repeats moves once and he goes here and the black king has to run around because this is mate so he has to go to F5 we plays Rook F1 check the only move now is to play King to G4 now how are you going to how you going to get the queen over here to mate or H3 what are you going to do none of that works if you slow play in this position the king gets out to H5 and then seals the door and if you play Rook F5 sacking everything black defends himself so how do you possibly win the game in this position only one move Queen to D what yes the idea is this and that diagonal so the king cannot easily run to H5 because you get him from this diagonal again King G4 is trying to run out that way so Queen D3 and now it's over the only chance chance that black has to survive this position is to sacrifice his Bishop that's it you have to take you have to take and generally When It's A Moment Like This like a moment in time when time is Frozen you got to be careful can they attack your king at all they can with Queen A8 a lot of people would panic because it seems like you're activating the black queen which is the last thing we wanted to do but the alternative was actually going here and now your queen can't made anybody because of Bishop to G5 so the bishop gets in and blocks all the light squares so King G2 Queen A8 and now the only winning move King to G1 right back to where he was well he was on H1 but sliding back how do you stop this and this you don't Bishop goes to G5 and now the only winning move is Queen E2 why is that the only winning move it's not Queen D1 it's only Queen E2 the King has to go here now where's the winning move where's the mid in fact if you're not careful you will get mated the only winning move in this position is Bishop to E1 and in this position Lazaro Bron resigned he resigned because why did is threatening Rook to F3 check and there is no way to stop it if you play E4 you stop Rook F3 but you block your queen so this is mate if you play Rook f8 you stop Rook F3 but when I take if you take you block your Queen's vision and this is mate and alternatively you can give me a million checks but I go King H1 and you're still getting mated Bishop E1 and he resigned because Rook F3 and queen G2 are two Unstoppable threats weyi played a top string of moves from Knight to D5 he Uncorked essentially a 15 move combination in this position Knight D5 Rook F7 Queen H7 e D5 King D5 Bishop E4 Queen F7 sealing the Escape Bishop F6 tried to fight back he repeated moves once so it's more like a 14 move combination Queen B3 and then he walked the king to the edge of the board and in this position he forced a resignation in 35 moves 36 moves this man is back in the Chess World this man was a worldender for like 9 years then he might have lost motivation right maybe that's what happened maybe he he he didn't see that there was a career in chess and he went back to University maybe he's a super smart guy and he has a better career potentially somewhere else but he's back and he just scored his biggest tournament win of his life he's 24 years old but he already feels like a veteran of the sport and he's number nine in the world for reference dingly Ren is number four so we got two Chinese Grand Masters in the world top 10 Way's been gone a while but it's good to see him back I'm excited to see what he does next now get out of here
