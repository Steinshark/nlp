okay for anyone who is leveling up in their career promotion maybe looking for a new job you can relate to this also before we get into the story thank you to HubSpot for sponsoring part of this video you oftentimes are looking around what is in demand where should I put my focus and most importantly where am I going to put my time which as we continue to grow in our career and age the time becomes more and more valuable that is why I'm going to share with you some of the top in-demand Tech skills that you can put your focus to right now before we do make sure to hit that subscribe button like button and leave down below any other video topics or questions you have alright now let's get into it although many on this list may surprise you as some of the most in-demand tech skills I have to start with probably no not probably the biggest one it would be crazy if I didn't include it can you guess what it is let me give you a hint actually speaking of AI before I share with you some valuable courses you can take skills you can learn to really be able to put Ai and different sectors of it on your resume to start really going after that skill I want to share with you how you can use AI to quickly generate copy for landing pages websites ads any campaign and this can all be done with just a few clicks thanks to hubspot's campaign assistant check this out first you need to select your asset type let's choose the landing page content next we can start with letting AI know what our campaign is about this is my favorite part by the way as I often have an idea of what I want this campaign to be about what I want to say on a landing page or email but I have trouble actually diving into the details of it this way I can simply input my ideas and share what my campaign is about and that is it I now have this generated copy of what my campaign is about and can simply copy this and input it into my landing page or email ads Etc this literally took a matter of seconds I linked down below hubspot's campaign assistance you can go check it out today and start utilizing this it has saved me so much time I mean I I really prefer to put my time and I think it's a great use of an AI tool I want to focus on bigger picture things on working on strategy on execution whereas things like this that can be done by AI is it off to my my AI assistant all right let's get back to how to gain skills within artificial intelligence actually one of the reports I saw that was really interesting was from Gardner who said over 50 percent of Enterprises will be using AI chatbots by 2030 which is now so the need for AI is going to continue to evolve and grow and experts within this both on the technical and also to the business side now as someone who is very clearly passionate about artificial intelligence and really many different facets within it here are some courses that I've been checking out one is through Coursera they have so many different options and I really really trust their recommendations their courses are always done by really well-renowned universities or colleges the other is Udacity which has a really great artificial intelligent courses to take as well also too some skills that are very in demand include learning Frameworks like tensorflow Pi torch they are highly sought after the average salary actually for AI Engineers is around 142 000 in U.S and this information is actually from 2022 I Believe by now 2023 that would have rapidly increased I've been looking on different job postings in the AI world and I saw one the other day for a director of AI engineering I think it was for just under 500 000. I want that job that's wild obviously there are a ton of different uh requirements and it's years and years of experience but the jobs are out there the money is out there you just need to start learning the skills next on the list is low code development and I know all you developers and Engineers who are watching this are going to be like tip what do you mean low code I feel like inherently as a developer it is in our nature to resist low code platforms and I hear you there in the past has been a lot of not great flexibility or functionality with these low code platforms but they have come such a long way and they are continuing to rise in demand which to me makes complete sense for someone who is able to get really familiarized with a low code platform you are able to build quicker and also to more standardized especially as you get into these large Enterprise companies there are tons of different low code tools out there that you can use so it's not necessarily a course that you have to take on low code but more so a mindset of being open to really embracing these tools and learning how they work now that being said it's equally actually more important to understand the the foundations before you start picking up low code really understand a programming language really understand the technology behind it we can't solely rely on low code tools however by being open to these tools and picking them up quickly it will really set you apart I see over and over again more companies coming out with low code options so it's going to be essential for a lot of developers and other individuals who aren't developers to start learning these tools next on the list caused a massive debate by the way on another social it was Tick Tock I posted a video on this which is SQL or as I pronounced it in the video SQL what team are you on SQL or SQL I know correctly if we want to do it properly it's SQL but SQL just it sounds really fun how do you pronounce it sequel is actually one of the most in-demand tech skills LinkedIn reported that 74 of annual growth has occurred for the demand of SQL so it's not going anywhere it's continuing to rise and this makes total sense to me I remember when I was working at a past company I was working at even the business analysts use SQL because they were able to make queries for different data around customer reports that they were looking for or information that they could easily access having an understanding and being able to use SQL to your benefit is not just for developers not just for data analysts or data scientists it is for business individuals as well and it's really continuing to go in that way SQL is one of those things that having an understanding of the basics like a base level is pretty easy to do there are a ton of courses online I'll list some here so you can kind of choose from how deep you want to go depending on your role but being able to put SQL or SQL on your resume will really help you stand out now how do you gain these skills other than taking courses I just shared with you the best way is to build small projects with them some projects that would include a data analysts or visualization all right the next one is an area that I'm really interested in fascinated with I don't know if I'll ever get to utilizing this in my career but I should make it more of a hobby which is robotics robotics is continuing to be on the rise and this is something that you can start tinkering with right now today employees with robotic skills are highly sought after actually the robotics Market is estimated to reach 237 billion by 2027 and this is a really great way or what excites me about robotics is being able to merge software with Hardware it feels kind of like you're a kid again I mean until something breaks and isn't working and then the stress comes on but a great way to kind of get your feet wet with robotics is of course through things like Raspberry Pi Arduino boards different technologies that you can order to your home and start tinkering there are so many great resources especially for Raspberry Pi online there's this website right here that I absolutely love they have so many different project ideas to start building with and also to from beginner to Advanced there's kind of something for everyone the last one is actually you know what before I get to the last one can we just have a moment for let me share with you here this is totally random but I want to share with you that I got how cute is this this is totally non-tech related but I'm really loving it anyways okay back to the point which is actually I kind of look like one what I'm about to say which is a cloud cloud computing I mean I had to include it in this list I tried to make some think of some different ones and research some different ones that I just mentioned however cloud computing it wouldn't feel right if it wasn't part of this list actually cloud computing has become mainstream with 77 of Enterprises having at least one application on the cloud now courses around cloud computing feel endless of course there are all the AWS certifications around the cloud that are a great way to go it's probably one of the best ways to go especially because it is so well regarded even if you end up in a job that is not using these certifications showing that you committed to them and went through with them is really powerful the other way to go is once again back to Coursera or udemy where you can take a lot of these cloud computing courses that have both from the business side but also to the technical side so depending on where you land in that alright those are five five skills in the tech industry that are going to be not only currently most in demand but will continue to be for the Future these are areas that when I was doing my research are continuing to grow and highly sought after at the end of the day though it's important to be aware of these areas because putting your focus and attention to them is really important but don't become overwhelmed with it that you have to learn every area or skill that I just listed pick something focus in on it hone in on it become an expert in it and then from there you can choose if you want to really dive into it or continue to evolve once again going back to this idea of being a specialist or generalist this is something I wanted to put together for you though as we are halfway through over halfway through 2023 and understanding where you want to put your time and energy into we have half the year left and honestly I know for myself it's it's kind of like I'm just going to cruise through the last half of the year but then I was like let me find where I can take a really good course where I can really dive into some thing because one thing I have learned thus far in my career and also too on my entrepreneurial journey is that you never will regret learning something new and taking those courses so I'll leave you with that all right that is all for today I hope you enjoyed this video and uh let me know if you like some of these more casual but informative conversations we have any suggestions you have and also too I linked hubspot's campaign assistant down below go check it out start using AI to help you work better and be able to put more time into really complex things versus something that AI can do for you alright see you all soon thanks everyone [Music]
