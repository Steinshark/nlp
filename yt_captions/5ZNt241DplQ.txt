hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by retailmenot we are learning about whether or not a dead battery can actually cause damage to your alternator and so we're gonna be running two different experiments one with a dead battery on my crosstrack one with a charged battery on my crosstrek and then we're going to be measuring some of the parameters of the alternator to see what effects that has on the alternator now generally speaking as far as the electrical system of your car you have your car battery which is used for energy storage used to start the car up start the engine and then you have your alternator this is used for energy generation so once the engine is running this alternator is going to be able to provide that electricity for all the electrical components on the car now ideally your alternator is there to maintain the battery's charge it's not there to bring a dead battery up to full charge necessarily it has the potential to do it but what we're going to try and figure out in this video through some tests is what effects will that have on this alternator by charging a dead battery versus if we were to just start with an already charged battery and look at the different parameters of this alternator now the way an alternator works is very similar to how an electric motor works everything's just happening in reverse so with an electric motor you have a stator this stationary portion and you have a rotor the portion in the middle that rotates and so you supply an alternating current to this stator and that creates a rotating magnetic field and that rotating magnetic field forces this rotor which has magnets on it to rotate and so with the alternator you're simply doing the reverse so you have a pulley which will be uh connected with a belt to your crankshaft and then rotating that crankshaft will cause this pulley to be rotated rotating the rotor as you rotate that rotor it creates that swirling magnetic field that rotating magnetic field which then induces the alternating current within the stator now we want a direct current for our battery and so you have diodes within this alternator which act like uh check valves essentially one-way valves and so they only allow current to pass through them one direction so those diodes take the alternating current and they send a direct current to your battery now again this video is part of a series where i've teamed up with retailmenot which is actually what i use to buy this alternator if you ever use websites like amazon autozone or advanced auto parts these websites often have lots of coupon codes floating around for discounts on your purchase retailmenot genie is a free browser extension that's designed to compile all of the coupon codes out there so that you get the best deal on your product when you check out without you personally having to figure out which coupon code may be the best one to use in this case there were 15 codes found and it was able to take 25 off the price of the alternator from advance auto wonderful you can find a link to download the tool in the video description and it works with all of the major browsers out there all right so let's get right into the experiment we're going to be running two different scenarios and for those two different scenarios we're going to be measuring five different parameters and so the first scenario is the car is going to start with a charged battery so the same charge status that it's generally always at as i'm driving the vehicle around i haven't depleted the battery at all and it has sat in the garage overnight to remain cool so it's going to be a cold start we're going to idle it for about five to seven minutes before we start idling we are going to check the voltage of the battery then after we start the car we're going to measure voltage we are going to measure voltage both at the battery and at the alternator to see if there's any difference there we are going to measure the amperage coming out of the alternator we are going to measure the temperature of the alternator and so i'm going to be using uh this neat little thermometer here essentially you just it's got a little magnetic thermocouple so i place it on the stator of the alternator and i can measure the temperature of that stator so those are the five things which we are going to be measuring and then once i've let the core idle for about five to seven minutes i'm gonna go actually drive it on a short route same route for both scenarios where i'm going to drive it about 20 minutes or so come back and then we will measure all of those things once again for our second scenario we're going to do the exact same thing the only difference will be we will be starting the car with a dead battery so we're going to use this to jump the car but the battery will be dead when we actually start the engine we'll then look at all of the data which we've collected and see how it differs using a dead battery versus using a charged battery and what effects that has on this alternator okay so starting with scenario one with our battery already charged measuring the battery's voltage with the car off it is at 12.92 volts generally speaking for these 12 volt lead acid batteries a fully charged battery will be somewhere in the range of 12.6 to 13.2 volts so no problem we're starting off at 12.92 once we start the engine i am measuring the battery voltage the alternator voltage the alternator amps and the alternator temperature now for this first scenario the battery voltage and the alternator voltage were very similar as you might expect the alternator voltage was just slightly higher so we're looking at about 14.45 volts for the battery and about 14.47 ish a little bit higher than what the battery was reading on the alternator as far as the alternator amps for these first five minutes of the engine idling it started a little bit higher it was at about 15.25 amps and then after about five minutes of idling it was down to 13.2 amps the alternator's temperature started at about seven and a half degrees celsius and by five minutes it was about 23 degrees celsius then i took the car for a 20 minute drive brought it back and measured everything once again our alternator amps were down to 12.9 and our alternator temperature was up to 42.5 after turning the core off the battery's voltage was once again at 12.92 exactly where it had started so now that we have those measurements it is time to kill the battery for the second scenario so with the ignition on but the engine not running i turned on the fan i turned on music i turned on the engine fans basically just running a lot of electronics in order to drain this battery down so i drained it down until it was reading just 9.34 volts and actually when you put the key in and turn the ignition on it was reading just 4.5 volts nothing at all happened all the screens were blank none of the electronics worked the car was totally dead so turning the key did absolutely nothing so then we took our jump pack started up the engine and then measured all of our parameters once again going through the exact same scenario as the first time just this time using a dead battery so in this case once we had started the engine the battery voltage was reading just a little bit lower at 14.35 the alternator voltage was at about 14.5 which was slightly higher than previously our alternator amps however were significantly increased so right when we started the engine it was reading 55 amps and it went as high as 61.8 amps during those five minutes of idling now both of these tests started with a cold engine so the alternator temperature starting point was exactly the same at about 7.5 degrees celsius however of course running more amps through that alternator meant that it was now producing significantly more heat and so it actually did heat up quite a bit faster after 400 seconds of idling it was at 42.6 degrees celsius versus 24 degrees celsius for the charged battery now if we look at a plot of the two different scenarios idling for 400 seconds you can see that they're on different trajectories so the gap between the temperatures is widening with time after then taking the car on the driving route for about 20 minutes and bringing it back the alternator amps were at about 40.5 and the alternator temperature was 66.2 degrees celsius so next i shut the car off i let it sit for a while and then i measured the battery voltage of this dead battery after having been charged for about 30 minutes of idling and driving and what i was surprised to find out is that the charge the voltage of the battery was actually 12.82 so that was significantly higher than i was expecting it to be and also the temperature difference wasn't all that great 66 degrees celsius versus 42.5 degrees celsius not a major difference so it actually seemed like the alternator didn't have too much of a problem charging up that dead battery now there are still some things to consider here so the battery voltage looked like it was actually fine 12.82 volts but based on the alternator which was still putting out 40 amps that's over three times higher than what it was with the charged battery so that indicates that the battery wasn't actually charged and that the engine the alternator was trying to charge that battery as it had significantly higher amps i also put the battery after it had ran that 30 minute test on a battery charger to see what it said the state of charge was it said it was 75 percent uh for our second scenario it said it was 100 for our first scenario and it actually charged for a good number of hours before it finally read 100 again another thing worth considering is that outside temperatures when i was driving the car were just above freezing and so it was very cold outside and as a result that means the alternator had a wonderful cooling had it been a very warm day we would have seen significantly higher temperatures on the alternator the higher the temperature that the alternator gets the more likely the internal components are to fail another thing worth considering is the health of your battery so let's say you have a battery that's on its way out it's not doing so hot at holding a charge anymore well your alternator sees that your battery needs more charge and so it's going to continually use higher amperage in order to send more charge to that battery and it's going to be a losing battle so you're going to be heating up this alternator when the battery itself is dying it's on its way out it's no longer good so you're putting unnecessary strain and work on this alternator in that scenario which could lead to premature failure if it starts to get too hot all right so what have we learned from all this and what would my recommendation beep so you know if you're stranded somewhere because your car battery is dead obviously the smart thing to do is to jump it and get where you need to go whether that's home or work or wherever you're going get your car jumped get where you need to be that's obviously the smart solution if you have a car at home that has a dead battery and you have the ability to charge it that may be a better solution so if you left an accessory light on or perhaps if you have a project car that sits for a couple months don't know who that would apply to then you know a better solution might be just get it on a charger and then charge that battery so you don't have to overwork your alternator the second that engine starts up uh either way i was surprised it didn't seem like a huge deal for my crosstrek here to charge it back up uh you know that could be of course worse if the battery was in worse condition so a neat little experiment hopefully you guys learned from this thank you so much to retailmenot for sponsoring the video and thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel
