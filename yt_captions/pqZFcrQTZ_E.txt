- Come here guys, come on. This is 1.2 petabytes. And the last time we built
a petabyte storage solution, it had to be spread out
over multiple servers. Not anymore, with Seagate's
new 20 terabyte EXOS X20s, we are gonna be building
a single 4U server that can hold over a petabyte of raw data. It's gonna be flipping
crazy and truthfully, it's hard to be that excited because the real reason
we're building this is because of a data loss in our previous petabyte project that is making it so that we
have to build a new server to copy all of the data off that server while we attempt to recover it. So, I'm gonna be having fun, but in a, all of this is very sad
and stressful kind of way. What I'm never sad about is telling you about our sponsor. Thanks to SignalRGB for

if you think about it, 20 terabytes of storage in a single drive. The original 1x server, which was hard drive based by the way, had about 20 terabytes of storage, except that it was an entire
4U chassis like this one, full of one terabyte drives. - Man, 1x server was 20 terabytes up until like two years ago. - One, freaking, drive. And the craziest part is last time we did a petabyte project, we wanted to get a full petabyte of addressable storage
into a single chassis but we fell short because I wanted a 75-drive
version of the chassis. So it would be actually
five of these rows, but there was a bit of a snafu and we didn't end up getting it done. The crazy thing is since then, we've gone from 16 terabytes
maximum capacity to 20. So we are gonna have exactly
what we were targeting, (laughing) except in 60 bays instead of 75. Now, I couldn't help noticing, Jake, that none of the hardware's in this. - Well, it's kind of a
long story. (chuckles) - Does it involve these
bins of hardware over here? - Yes, so in there is actually
the original hardware, if you look there. So I think it's a 26-core
Xeon gold, I think. 512 gigs of RAM, it would've had 4 HPAs
in there at one point. But in between the process
of this server being built and it arriving to us, I kinda decided I wanted our cache drives to be NVMe, not SATA. And unfortunately there's not really a lot of PCIe on here. There's probably enough, we probably could have put some junk four-splitter bifurcation thing in there, but I figured we should go EPYC instead. - We're going EPYC ladies and gentlemen, need that PCIe. It's kinda crazy how like
as an enthusiast or a gamer, you don't really think about that as AMD's advantage over
Intel in the server space, you kinda think of it in terms- - It's kinda huge. - Of performance-
- Yeah. - Or core count. - I've heard that's important. - Or eight channel memory, right? These are all things that
as gamers we understand. But 128 PCIe lanes, when you're plugging this kind of schiz into your CPU, matters a lot. - Yeah. What we ended up with is actually the XL-60S turbo variants, so it's got a little bit bigger CPU than the base one. But if you wanted, like us, you could probably ask 45Drives and they maybe make you an EPYC system, it's just not something that they show on their website. - You probably don't need to, as long as you're just
running mechanical drives. - Yeah. - But because we wanna put
a bunch of NVMe drives in, we do need the extra PCIe. Now at this stage we've
got a couple of options. We can work on things together, or we can divide and conquer. But the one thing I'm not flexible on is we need to take this thing and put it on one of those carts. Because if we load it up with hard drives and we have to move it again, I'm gonna lose my (beep). - I already brought it
downstairs it was fine. - No, no but full of drives? - Yeah, I brought
downstairs full of drives. Also it's better to carry
it than put it on a cart, the cart is bad. It was a IPM study, look it up. You got to have- - That was a cross like- - Parking's still-
- Parking lot. - Lots of bumps and stuff. - Oh co ... - It's gonna be fine. Look, I get it, you're kind of a small guy, you know. It's okay, it's gonna be fit. If you don't wanna carry it we got other people for that. You know you employ like 50 people. He's not saying anything, he's just putting drives and I think he's given up. Should we maybe wait, hold on, hold on. Should we do- - Oh, now he doesn't want it to be heavy. Oh no, I'm sorry, Jake. I'm sorry, Jake, this not how you wanted the hard drives to go in? Oh, oh, oh shoo, oh man, I'm sorry. - I just think we should
put the motherboard in and make sure that's working. - They just keep going in there. They just slide in so nice. Love 45Drives mechanism. Look at this 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 terabytes just like that. Oh yeah. Let's actually talk a little bit about the drives that Seagate sent over. These are their data center
enterprise grade drives. They run at 7,200 RPM, they've got 256 megabytes of cache each and they say at six gigabit
per second interface. They're gonna actually be pretty similar to the 20 terabyte IronWolf Pro NAS drives in terms of performance. But these have double the rated meantime between failure and almost double the rated annual workload, so they're just designed
to run a little heavier. They're also $20 more expensive at MSRP. But a funny thing that
we've noticed in the past, is that these XOs drives often end up being less expensive once they've been on the
market for a little bit. So these ones have only been at retail for about a month, month and a half. So the cheapest that we could find these specific drives was $571 each from a Newegg Marketplace seller. That puts this at, wait, $35,000 worth of drives. (laughs) - And the funny thing is they're actually gonna send four more so we have some cold spare. So that would put us like 3750. - That's a good thing to have with any storage set up that has more than, I mean realistically, a handful of drives. - Realistically we
should have a hot spare. - Mechanical devices do fail, it's something that happens
and it's something that you have to be ready for. Holy crap that sexy. (laughing) What? - This is like one of my
favorite EPYC boards for sure. - Seven PCIes 16X slots. Is that a USB type C on a server board? - Yeah. It's also, it's all Gen 4 too. We originally got this board for the sensible jellyfish fryer, but I think they originally sent the OG EPYC version. - Yeah, the Non-Gen 4 one. - Yeah and then this is the Gen 4 one that does Rome and Milan. - Sorry, Yvonne, I'm filing the papers. This is my new wife. - What happens when the new one comes out? - Well then- - More papers. - Off with the old on with the new. (laughing) - Jesus. - What kind of EPYC
are we putting in here? - Hmm. Okay. So it's not a Milan 'cause we still can't get any of those. We have two, we finally got two, this is not one of them. This is a 7402P, it's the previous generation Rome chip. It's 24 cores which is probably excess for this, honestly. (laughs) But it should be pretty good once it's paired up
with the 512 gigs of RAM we take from the old board. More funny thing's, we don't have a CPU cooler for this that fits in there. We have this one it's a U12, it's a little big. - We'll just run it hot rod for now. - Yeah, I think we'll
just leave the top off. - Can we just take a moment and talk about how the Molex connector has apparently been
doing RAIDs? (laughing) (laughing) You see me? - [Jake] Slack back
back into the right one. - What is this? It's all about having a steady hand. - If I just, if I just blew right now. - No, you wouldn't. - I would have ruined both of our days, so I'm not gonna do that. Just a quick (laughing). - He was telling me
what a great job I did. - You mean like what a great job I did. - Well, someone did a great job. Whose name is on the channel again? (laughing) - [Jake] Oh, okay. - Hey look you- - [Jake] You got strong strong words. - You started it today,
you went 100% started it. - Fix this, fix your petabytes yourself, you damn it. - You stared it. - I'm done, I'm through. - You started it. - Oh God. Oh, no. - What, what, what, what? - Problem. Okay. So to use all the ports we wanna use, we have to move a jumper. - Oh no. - So right now they're both on the right. - Two and three yeah. - Two and three, two and three. So that's where we want it actually. - Perfect. Well, that was easy. - I don't know if I believe that though. - That's fine, we'll find out soon enough. - Worst comes to worst we just have to switch
it to the other side. - Okay. - Cause then it would be on one and two, one and two. Okay. - Easy. - We're hoping that that's right. - Okay now EPYC has no
built-in RAID functionality. So fortunately TrueNAS has a built-in redundancy function so that you can just install the OS simultaneously to both drives. And it's not RAID but it's a backup, which is better. - It's that a (indistinct)? - Is it as a (indistinct)? - Probably just makes a- - Oh I didn't even know it was using. Oh come on, cool. - This does not feel fine, oh my God. - It feels pretty fine. - Can you imagine though? - No I cannot imagine. - I don't think this is built to be tipped like this. - Okay. - Yeah everything's fine. - [Jake] That's horrifying. - So this is cool. These connectors right
here are super cool. They can be used for
SAS, SATA or PCI express. So it can cause some confusion 'cause I thought they were U.2 which would be PCIe like for NVME drives. But actually they are,
are they SAS or SATA? Probably just see that. - Oh yeah. I think they're SATA. So we're just gonna connect this little breakout cable and bippity boppity we'll plug these into our drives here and we're good to go. - That's cool, it passes through the SATA power too, you see that? - Yeah. - So we actually do need four because story about our NVMe drives, they're not here yet. (laughs) In fact not even two of the
cables we need are here yet. The Oculink, wherever that is to U.2 cables are not here yet. They were supposed to arrive today. Maybe they're just sitting in logistics, I don't know, anyways. Yeah. So we're gonna do two
8 terabytes SATA drives that are from Micron and we're gonna do two, 1 terabyte NVMes those are gonna be our intent log for CFS, which is almost kind of like
a right cache not really and then our level two arc which has just been extended read cache that adds onto the RAM cache that ZFS uses by default. Why didn't you take the.... - Well, they're there for in case - Mm hmm. - There are there in case, get it? This is the case and they were in it. Andy likes it, Andy likes it. - Andy likes everything. You pay him to like it. (laughing) - I pay you to like it. - I'm just a bad guy. - It's just one of you
is better at their job. (laughing) - Yeah. - [Andy] Hey, thanks Linus. - Put her in the first slot there. - There it goes. Oh yeah. - Look at all that PCIe baby. We still got- - That's terrific. - One more slot that works. - Yeah. - Wow, you mangled this cooler, what the heck? - I did nothing to that cooler. You know I didn't do
anything to that cooler. (laughing) - [Jake] Look at that part. - [Linus] I didn't touch that. - [Jake] This was brand new. - [Linus] Was it really? - [Jake] Yeah. - [Linus] What happened? - I don't know. Probably when you were fumbling it out. Probably both of us messed it up a bit. - We might have a big problem, Jake. - [Jake] What? - I don't know if I can
plug it in the front IO. It's right angle on this board. - [Jake] Oh, who cares? - I can't get it in. - Well, who cares? - Okay. We could do it. - I have a new idea. We just take the pins
and we just bend them up. - I love it. - Okay, I'll be back. Did you just pop that
out for no reason at all? - Oh I didn't know the
screw wasn't in yet. - What'd you think I was doing, picking my nose? Like- - I mean, usually you're
not doing too much, so. - Really? (laughing) Mr. stand there and. - We hit it, we hit a cord here boss. - Walks up and unplugs
what I'm working on. (laughing) - I did the math. - And lttstore.com is a great deal. Check it out, we've got this new hoodie. - Is that even online yet? - It will be by the time (indistinct) Sorry you can finish
your thought. (chuckles) - I don't even remember what I was saying. - Doing the math? - Oh, I did the math. So at one gigabyte, a second, which I think is a little- - Optimistic. - Optimistic for the old volts. (chuckles) Especially in a degraded state, it would take seven and a half days. If it's sustained at the whole time, to move 700 terabytes. - So what you're saying is? - So let's say 500 megabytes a second, it'll take 15 hours. - I wanna hear you say it. - It's gonna take a month. You're supposed to just
tell me I was right. - Wherever you ... - You said it was gonna take months I said it was-
- Well to move everything. - Gonna take weeks. Yeah. - To do it three times. - Three times? - Twice. I don't want to have
new volt stuff on here, I want to move it off and then move it back. Is that like, is that unreasonable? - I don't know, but I think we're ready
to fire this thing up. - Really? - We ready? Are you ready boys? - Oh you put the management
port into it I see. - Are you ready? Wait what- - Let's see what you were saying. - You plugged it into management. - Yeah. - That's what you wanted to do. - Yeah, okay. - Yeah I want you to plug the crap here. - I thought you were just stupid. - It smells like fire. - Does not. Is it still post coding? - I mean it's a server so like. - Yeah it could take a minute. ASRock boards are sort
of middle of the road as far as that goes to the right- - Speed. I think it's usually pretty quick. - Yeah it's probably gotta
do memory training though for 512 gigs of RAM so. - Oh it's running. - [Linus] Nice. - [Jake] 170 seconds it's been going. Hey look, look, 63 I think that's right. Oh wait, no. - [Linus] No, that's not right. - [Jake] We're missing some NVMe. So we got our two NVMes. Oh the SATA drive 6.99 terabyte. Yeah. So we're missing one of those-
- So we're missing one of the SATA. - And then we're missing two of these. - Yeah, theoretical. - Oh bananas. - Oh I bet use those two. (laughing) You suck at this, you put those in this is your fault. - You distracted me. (laughing) - That, those were very out. Oh, I can feel them, they're they're doing stuff now. - Okay. - I don't know why this
boy is not working though. Okay but let's. - We are at 65, we are at 65. Okay we have more hard drives now. We're just missing. - Okay, so tell me if that's the bad one. - I don't know if will. - I guess we could have
checked the serial. - I don't actually know if it'll ... - Oh yeah - It could also be that this cable is bad, these cables suck. I've seen like tons of them fail, so. - Well we have another one of them. Serial number mismatch it says. - So it did pick up the drive then. - Since SATA link is
three gigabit per second. No, no it picked it up, Micron 4,300. Okay try the, plug the other one in for a second. Yeah, that cable might be bunk. - Oh, it couldn't be the cable Linus. Must be a bad Micron enterprise drive. Yeah, for sure. Well, you know, with all the ... With all the crap that has taken place that did not make it into videos, it's probably just as well the volt gets wiped
points in awhile. (laugh) We back up? - Look at that, 66 baby-
- We got everything. Nice. - [Jake] So we got 900, 900, those are two NVMes, let me just switch this to 100. We got 6.99, 6.99 and the rest. - [Linus] Okay. - [Jake] Now you have to make a pool. - [Linus] Okay, let's do it. - Oasis. - Sure. - Let's call it a oasis, the data oasis. - [Linus] Good gravy, you have to select them one by one. - [Jake] Yeah. But think of how often-
- I mean I guess. - You're gonna do this-
- Champagne problem. - [Jake] I think you can also hold control and just, you know. - RAID-Z2 gives us two
drive failures per V Dev before we actually sustain
any permanent data loss. Which from our recent adventure we found is not necessarily
the be all and end all. (laughing) - But cause it doesn't
save you from bit raid. - Well look TrueNAS sets up a scrub for all pools by default monthly. - Yeah. - It just does it automatically. - Until S had no such functionality. - You can't screw this up. You can, but. (laughing) Yeah. All right, anyways. - Should be fine. I wanna listen to the initializing. - [Jake] The formatting. They're already initialized. The servers on what do. - They're not doing anything. - Oh they're going now. - That sounds terrifying. I know it's normal, but. Like Enterprise Drives are- - We are doing data things. - Well these are ones are getting kind of warm actually, maybe we should put the top on. - Yeah we probably should. - [Jake] Oh look at that. Okay so we have available 895 tebibytes. (laughs) - [Linus] 984 terabytes. - Okay, so should we remake the array? Just RAID-Z1 so you can see more than a petabyte of usable. - No, that's okay. - RAID-Z2 is bare minimum for this. - Yeah. - We still have 1.2
petabytes of raw storage plus 32 terabytes of NVMe once it's done. - So one point of
clarification, each V Dev, so each grouping of 15 drives is running in RAID-Z2. So that means we could actually theoretically lose up to eight drives before sustaining any kind
of permanent data loss. But you'd have to get really lucky. - I'm gonna call it volt three, okay? - New, new vault. - No, I'm not doing it. I have power in this manner and it's volt three. I don't care. - One day I'm gonna come in on a weekend and just change it all. - [Jake] You had a network interface like these two are 100 gigs. Sweet. One thing that's really smart to do on your storage service, especially one with this mini drives is you can actually set
up a scheduled smart task. Like on all of your drives do a quick smart test like once a month. And you can usually tell like if a drive is gonna die. - Yeah. - Just based on that, It'll like email you
the results or whatever. - That's one nice thing
about mechanical drives is they tend to spit out some warnings before they actually completely give up the go to. It can, not always though. - [Jake] Do you have
anything in here that's bad? - [Linus] I don't hope so. - [Jake] Spam log pickle Linus. How is it called pickle Linus? (chuckles) - I was making up on Dale for one of my just like
random troll streams on Floatplane. (chuckles) So I just put that up there. I killed him. (laughing) - Oh, there we go-
- There we go. There it is. - [Jake] 895 tebibytes I think. Anyways the moral of
the story is holy (beep) that's a lot of storage. Is this a holy (beep) now? - It could be. Now it's time for us to
drop it in the server room and start a week's long data transfer. - It's probably gonna be like two weeks. In a use case where you need more IOPS that is operations per second, maybe if you're video editing or you have a database running on this, you might wanna do a
setup that has more Vdevs because typically it means you're gonna have better IOPS performance. In our case, basically everything gonna
this is sequential AF. We're moving like 500 to a terabyte - Of footage. - Of just straight footage it one go. - See you later buddy. - So it doesn't matter for us. If anything, we just want more capacity while still being safe. - Yep. - And this is our middle ground. Actually, our it's not really middle it's like on our side ground.
