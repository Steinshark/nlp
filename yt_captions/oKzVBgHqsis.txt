all right so if you don't know this is low level learning low-level learning is one of my favorite producers of content and not only that great streamer based takes wears glasses so he's likely smarter than you if he carries a clipboard and wears glasses he will somehow intersect the the full ability to appear ultimately smart and thus I will actually get imposter syndrome being around him it's that good it's that good on March 21st 1986 Ray Cox drove to the East Texas Cancer Treatment Center where he was set to undergo a regularly scheduled treatment oh man is this gonna make me sad Rey would receive 180 RADS of radiation for a tumor developing in his back just left at this fine five months later this gentleman was dead the East Texas Cancer Center incident was just one of six radiation related injuries and deaths from 1985 to 1987. the common theme in all these events same their act 25. like I just can't imagine oh my God I don't even want to talk I just like just think about my beautiful wife or something like that having that happen too where it's like a medical oopsie Daisy with dividing by zero or some man I feel like I would just I would just lose it which is also another thing to think about everything that is being used remember somebody like me or you programmed that machine it's actually kind of terrifying once you think about that it's not easy to treat cancer treating cancer effectively has been a hard problem in the field of medicine for several decades is that a chat GPT image is the medical industry spends you're welcome for the screen tearing oh my goodness the fly just landed on me we're gonna end the slide's life in three two one oh God away the fly that got away billions every year in research and development attempting to make cancer treatment more effective and less invasive in the mid-1970s the atomic energy of Canada Limited company or aecl developed a radical new double pass concept for electron acceleration the double pass accelerator allowed new Radiology machines to be more Compact and perform two kinds of radiotherapy in one machine x-ray therapy and electron therapy this two-in-one package made the newly developed their act 25 extremely attractive to hospitals as it was easier and cheaper than the original therax6 and their act 20. it's called the therak25 why wasn't it called the ferric 26 I mean they had a 20 and a six and it was both models together why wasn't it the 26. Windows 21 confirmed off by one air here we come here comes Derek 25 was the first radiation therapy machine controlled entirely by software previous versions use software to make the interfaces more convenient but still add Hardware interlocks to operate the emitters on March 21st 1986 Ray Cox entered the East Texas Treatment Center to receive his 180 RADS he was taken to his room where he laid under the therak-25 base down operator entered the control Bay where she quickly entered the prescription data to the therak 25 user interface could mess this up honestly this looks perfect um this this seems absolutely easy and it definitely non-oopsie Daisy proof I mean this is perfectly perfectly straightforward perfectly straightforward imagine this is what it'll never it'll never mess up dude I know dude imagine if this is your life was dependent on this input oh my goodness I'd be terrified because x-ray therapy was more common the operator accidentally input X for x-ray she quickly noticed and having operated this machine for more than 500 patients very quickly changed the X to an E for electron therapy which was prescribed for Ray Cox after confirming the inputs were verified and the screen read beam ready she hit B for Beam on to begin the treatment oh my goodness this is making me so uncomfortable I am so uncomfortable because I like my brain's already trying to run like what's what's the thing since the beam was already ready therefore it's already set to X and it just doesn't do did you just not do enough and is the energy too high like what is that what is the thing right what is the thing that after several seconds of confusion the machine shut down and displayed malfunction 54 on the screen if that ever happens and the patient isn't immediately escorted from that room covered in lead and and and dodging all the X-ray lasers I don't know what would be like I would never have that's crazy if that if the if they if they didn't get him out of there because of that what the hell the screen also displayed a treatment pause error which normally came from a low priority operator error that was easy to fix the only documentation though presented about malfunction 54 indicated that there was a dose input 2 error something in aecl technician would later indicate meant that the patient was given either too high or too low of a dosage the screen indicated that the patient had only received six RADS so far and while the operator had ordered 202 the operator pressed P to unpause the treatment while all this occurred in the control room Ray laid alone in the operating room normally the two Zone two zones were connected by Audio and Video but during this session the video monitor had turned off and the speakers had been broken for some time okay first off if I saw a keyboard that looked like this I'd have many questions before getting radiation okay just throwing that out there but how in the world are you allowed to operate one of those things without working video and audio to begin with like how's that even a thing how's that how how is that not a thing after receiving the first attempt at treatment Rey later recounted a feeling of electric shock or that hot coffee had been poured down his back being his ninth treatment Rey knew something was wrong so he got up from the table at the exact same time the operator unpaused the therak-25 he ran to the door of the control room screaming and pounded on the door visibly shaken and upset simulations after the incident estimate that Ray Cox received not 180 RADS but somewhere between 16 000 and 25 000. Ray Cox in the following weeks would feel excruciating pain in his neck and shoulders suffer from several types of paralysis and eventually die to complications five months later five other patients in the U.S and Canada would suffer a similar fate what could have gone so terribly wrong in software to cause a man to lose his life you know I I harp on unit testing and coverage and things like that I'd say that this is a really good place to just just be out of control with every kind of coverage possible and there's people today remember this there's people today that program airplanes and radiation machines and all this stuff like it's actually really just scary to think about how many machines that could just destroy your life are programmed just by people you know and at some point there is an unknown situation that's going to that's going to happen several assumptions about software poor software engineering practices and safety design choices in the therax 25 led to these catastrophic events that were all rooted in bugs and software in the 1980s and early 1990s there wasn't much knowledge about how software worked outside of a small community of programmers there was an attitude in the public that once the code worked software was unable to fail none of these guys are Gamers you could tell right away none of them were gamers people that have that attitude never played a game ever in their lifetime now all you gotta do is play any game any AAA game like any of them and you'll be like wow this is piece of how many people worked on this once the code performed the function it was able to perform there was no more work to do nothing could go wrong there were no edge cases the fact that people in chat right now are kind of debate me ever I can see it over and over again just wait it gets like it's it sounds like this is gonna get real bad I'm I'm already having like an emotionally hard time even watching this just because this is atypical of any content I ever ever consume I don't like I don't I don't like I don't like it I don't like it stop saying just wait I I could I'm literally holding on here aecl allowed a single hobbyist programmer to program the therap25 alone in PDP 11 assembly get the get the hell out of here get out you what what what is what what the hell's a hobbyist like was this guy like an electrical engineer that they're just like oh by the way could you just whip up some codes for us one person coded alone in assembly I mean now that I think about that green screen was incredibly impressive like can we all just take a moment and just remember that that UI he built okay the the UI was actually incredible considering what was going on okay just one dude I know it was usual then but it doesn't feel good it doesn't make it somehow better okay the UI was great I don't think the UI killed people I think it's obviously the buggy program that messed up with the UI I'm just saying the UI itself was good okay you know people always people are always like you know it's just greed I I'm not sure if it's green this time I think it was obviously a massive misunderstanding of software but I I I'm just completely shocked that anybody at any point I guess I never lived I never was a software developer in the 80s so I don't know what people were thinking back then but I cannot I can't imagine being like this thing shoots lasers in which can kill people let's just throw somebody on it like that just can't be real right this well yeah lasers right I don't mean like I remember it's all part of a spectrum right what I don't what what particles come out of a radiation I don't know what particles come out of it I don't know how I'm not a I'm not a chemist I'm not a physicist I don't know these things damn it okay I I program it typescript okay I don't know this I just know that it comes out of there it's effectively a laser it's just a laser you don't see it's not like Star Wars okay I'm not talking about like a laser gun from your childhood I'm talking about like real lasers like real real that actually hurts you okay software cannot fail attitude bled into all aspects of the Engineering Process the design of the therak 25 was unnecessarily complex and when questioned by the FDA about how much the theraq had been tested and set upper culminator keyboard Handler data entry offset parameters mode energy mode energy offset mios calibrator calibration tables reset date you don't even get that I and date intent that date didn't happen anytime when I've been working on it that didn't happen anytime setup done set up tests patient treatment pause treatment terminate treatment date time ID changes the the aecl representative reported that the Thera 25 underwent 2 700 hours of testing when pressed for more information and data representative backpedaled and said 2 700 hours of testing by The Operators using the machine it was later revealed that's not testing dog that's production that ain't that ain't the test environment there act 25 was never tested until it arrived and was assembled at the hospitals where it underwent minimal system testing to prove that it functioned and nothing more they literally test and prod a laser gun okay by the way the guy that keeps spamming something about the CIA CIA doing that if you're ruining the ending and this turns out to be a CA CIA psyop that's crazy but if it doesn't say that okay I know it's it's it's funny to do an Alex Jones Chasm okay we all laugh about it but let's slow it down a little bit okay CIA guy okay CIA guy can we just calm down a little bit code that was modified between the their act 20 and the third act 25 underwent zero regression testing and the therax 25 didn't come with any system level documentation about the errors so that an operator could handle them when encountered so what happened to Ray Cox inside the therak 25s code a task Rand that executed the treatment inside that task a variable called T phase controlled which one of eight subroutines was being ran at any given time when the operator first accidentally entered x-ray mode the t-phase variable quickly moved on to phase three or the setup treatment phase during this time the X-ray energy specified on the user interface was used to look up and program a configuration to the digital to analog converter which would be used to emit the radiation energy to the patient also during this time magnets were put into motion that would be used to bend the X-ray beam and control its output it took about eight seconds to move this magnet during this eight seconds the task would ignore additional input from the user as the data entry task was not being ran because the operator in this case was skilled and able to change x-ray mode to electron mode in under 8 seconds the changes to the prescription were not observed by the machine instead of receiving electron radiation as prescribed Ray received x-ray radiation at electron radiation doses without the proper bending and mediation by the magnets this error damn I mean it feels so obvious since I get to look back is known as a race condition in a race condition logic in a program depends on a data location that can be written to by two separate threads the race condition exists because there is no logic controlling who is allowed to write to that data at any given time the race happens when the logic executed on the data depends on what piece of code gets there first in the therak 25 the race condition caused the data entry to occur before the patient setup task was able to read it causing a misconfiguration in the machine that was not accounted for previously by the programmer you know I think often about what it would be like working at a place like Tesla or or you know NASA or any of these places where you're like programming real systems that if they mess up people get hurt and I just think about like how sick I would feel programming like I'd be constantly freaking out geez Louise I can't even imagine trying to program an x-ray machine in assembly how did it even test it if the first time ever tested was like assembled somewhere crazy this would not have been a problem in previous versions of the theraq where Hardware interlocks were there to make sure that these levels of radiation did not come out but to make the therak cheaper these Hardware interlocks were removed and the system depended entirely on software checks to make sure this didn't happen why would you do that I cannot imagine a hardware lock being that expensive aren't they selling I assume these machines are like a kajillion dollars each and you're telling me that you can't throw a little bit of hardware on that that's crazy in code it should be accepted that bugs will happen ones that you're aware of and ones that you could never predict incompetence plus greed one of the most dangerous combos of all time it is just super super dangerous classic corporate greed well you also had to you I mean you also had just sheer and confidence right it wasn't just greed they they I mean if what he's saying is true so I don't know I don't know what the 80s was like okay I don't know what the 80s was like so I have no idea I was I was zero to four years old in the 80s so I have no idea and so I don't know if this idea that software will never fail was a mindset people had right if people had that mindset why would you have Hardware locks real talk if you actually genuinely believe that why would you have them I have no idea it seems crazy to me because to me obviously my heart mind and soul knows that software fails Non-Stop right but it seems It's it feels very it's always very easy to look back and blame people but man this shit's so messed up it's just so messed up I don't even know what to do with this it's so messed up rigorous code testing should always occur especially in systems where lives depend on software safety if the therak 25 code was tested raycox might still be alive
