okay what is GitHub co-pilot [Music] workspace dude this is like 13 seconds of just unneeded content can you just tell me what it is man Microsoft I don't know who you're advertising to this is crazy all right Coop pilot native Dev environment designing designed for everyday tasks what does that even mean go from idea to specification it's like if tikt had a baby with YouTube with a single click edit the details of any steps before generating a plan I got to turn this down it's so loud the AI is purple see how co-pilot plans to implement the changes oh my goodness it's like Devon and let's copilot generate the code you can be confident is this like Devon are we doing Devon just with more trap with more dubstep is this just Devon plus dubstep oh no oh gosh can we rename co-pilot to Kevin Kev okay so okay let's see now okay we're going to do it live preview a lot of assumptions were just made in that live preview like I think a lot of people probably missed that entire live preview business which is if you're running from the browser you make all these changes you then press play I mean all of that made the assumption that everything is probably written in JavaScript somehow I doubt that we're like streaming video of an application being ran on a on a server why aren't they using dark mode who is their customers what is this I think this I almost vomited all right okay create pull request [Music] all right I got a hot take for this I got a steaming hot take for this one okay I got a hot take for this one um I think that Microsoft given the fact that they give co-pilot to students for free would rather see you be more incapable than anything else and so when I see this part and I see what we're seeing I cannot understand why you would want this I get that there's like the every now and then super simple bugs that are just so dang simple you could just make it happen but man driving all of your implementation like having the implementation start off on GitHub just seems like such a wild experience like I I do understand I mean I I I really want this idea of the AI assisted code review to be real um and what I mean by real is that I love this idea that you should be able to create a PR and then the co-pilot can go up to you and say man hey you know I've noticed that you probably didn't consider this other part of your program that relies on this but it does look like under these conditions something might happen why don't you give that a quick review just to make sure hey you know there's this one security problem that could happen why don't you give this a quick review just to make sure it doesn't happen but the problem is is we've already seen that the I and llm stands for intelligence and we've already seen how bad it gets with just all the various security issues right now that are just going wild with these llm takes that are just absolutely off Bas false positive absolutely crazy and so I I want this to be real I do I want it to be real so bad cuz it sounds great hey there's no I in llm you got the joke then the i in llm stands for intelligence you got the joke good job I I just don't see how this is going to work out and then this co-pilot Co first first off I couldn't tell what the hell happened in this commercial okay maybe I'm not Zoomer enough I think there this is a very intentional commercial this is a very intentional commercial I assume this is for Zoomers because my mom's way too much Boomer to know what the hell happened and she would just be confused as as it gets seeing all these words fly across the screen I'm like a little bit more used to the words flying and zooming around so I kind of I kind of can like kind of do it but man this feels like something that there this is a very targeted thing for people you know like this is targeting what I would consider newer people entering in uh to programming trying to like get you to understand that this is this is the way this is the future this is the new Dev environment okay which is such yeah welcome to the new Dev environment I can't believe how old I sound okay I feel like I sound old I feel like this guy that's like you they're praying on the youths man what is happened to me oh my gosh oh shoot dang it oh no I am just unsure how this is going to be practically useful and what I mean by practically useful is that you open up GitHub you see a problem and then you're going to get these you're going to do like what a code review on mobile and you're going to hope that you got all the code like I mean it's going to suggest a new piece of code for you to run does it come now now comes with tests as well is the test useful they actually thought through yeah they're green for this experience maybe I mean Facebook's like whole example of things running green and doing all that were so thin to begin with and and they only had like a success rate of like what was it 30% 15% to be be able to even generate code that was like syntactically correct I like let's say I have liked co-pilot then I hated it then I took a break for the past few weeks yeah I'm on like week four of no co-pilot or week three of no co-pilot I've just been enjoying it I've been genuinely enjoying not continuing on this whole thing Prime welcome to the Boomer club we meet every Wednesday at 5:30 a.m. at Dunkin Donuts oh man I want them so bad you know some people love the autocomplete from co-pilot and I think autocomplete I think a smart autocomplete has always been a great use of llms I'm not quite convinced that it's a great use like it's it's a perfect use but it's nice it's been good I've been happy I've currently turned it off say I had the chance of giving it a try and recorded a slightly longer version 6 minutes Hands-On it's far from doing everything by itself but with the right fine tuning of the instructions I see it can help help what though can you can you be a little bit more specific on that like what is it helping that's what I don't understand like what are you getting out of it was pain in the hands yeah like like I said I think the autocomplete can sometimes be very interesting again uh read your repo and suggest where uh to look at then propose Solutions yeah but I mean have you seen these success rate on any of the security vulnerabilities or any of those things like when people say it just needs to be it just needs to be trained better it's just like one of it's it it to me it just feels like a fallacy like we're follow I don't know what the name of the fallacy is it just feels like a the ever Perpetual fallacy of like it's just not you know it's going to be good don't worry whatever it is I don't know what you call it uh futurism right it's like some sort of futurism retr futurism of like the thing is going to happen it just hasn't happened yet it's like right there I'm going to say this I don't think llms are going to be some huge great iteration in programming I think our current state of llms aren't great I don't think they're going to be great I think they can be neat I think co-pilot can be okay like there's sometimes that I'm like hell yeah copilot was pretty cool just then but that's about it that's that that's what I think now I think that there could exist an AI that's much better I think that I think that's possible I'm not disagreeing with that but I am absolutely under no guys that that co-pilot and this current set of of AI experiences are anything more than just some sort of like magical initial feeling into disillusionment everybody know that's leaned in hard enough on these things it starts off as wow these are the greatest things ever they're going to solve all of our problems everything is going to be better because of them and they end with W they're actually like if you really give it a very specific case and you really train it on this one thing it can sometimes be kind of useful I don't know if that's really like the win that you think it is like I don't I just don't know anyways uh just for those that again I say this all the time and I want to keep saying it for those that are like new to programming you're worried about AI I don't think you have anything on the near Horizon to like quote unquote worry about I think the biggest thing you need to worry about is the fact that all you've done is produce the same content as everybody else you've all taken a react class you've all produced the same react portfolio you've all used Redux you've all used react server components you've all done all the latest greatest things and that's all you've ever done is you've just plugged a bunch of different things together and you called yourself a portfolio when real life real work is none of those things and is arduous long tasks and old code bases using technology that hasn't been talked about actively on Twitter for the last 5 and a half to 10 years the name is the primagen
