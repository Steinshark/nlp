- [MrBeast] I bought every single car at a car dealership. - [Chris] Can we afford this? - [MrBeast] I really don't know. - [Chris] That's reassuring. - Hey.
- How are you? - So we talked over the phone. The paperwork took forever. So these are the 12 cars, I just bought them. And now that I've spend
over $100,000 on cars, I need to reprice them, because they were way too expensive. - This car is $3, $7, $2. This car, we pay you $1,000 to buy. And this car is $4.20,
do not get it confused. - That's a great price. - This car is $69. This car is going to my stepdad. $10, 99 cents, not $99. This car is $9. - [Chris] That's expensive. - This car is free. And this is one of the most
expensive bad boys on the lot, it is $12. - [Chris] This is a nice car. - [MrBeast] So yeah,
we own all these cars, and now we're giving them away. (Chris yells) - 100% credit approved. - So we now have a car lot full of cars. I want them all gone
before the end of the day. So man the phone, man the floor, man the phone, man the floor. I'll man the floor. You're gonna handle all the paperwork. You're on Chandler support. All right, guys, our car
dealership is officially open. This is the first ever
Mr. Beast Dealership. As mentioned, the most
expensive car in the lot is $13, we are ready to start accepting customers. Let's do it. - Buy my cars, yeah! Ah, there's a spider! - We have a sale. - Yes, come on in!
- They're coming in. - [Chris] We have our first customers. How y'all doing? - Great, how you doing? - My name's Chris, what
brings y'all in today? - I mean, I got a big family, so I was trying to look for a truck. - We've got a nice Traverse right here. Third row seat, you can fit
the whole family in there. You wanna know the price on that one? - Yeah. - Let's look in the window. $3, that's the price on that one. - No way, come on now. - $3 every day. - [MrBeast] Before you commit to this, you want to show them the other cars? - Yeah, let's just take
a look at the other cars. 69 cents, it'll go anywhere. - [MrBeast] You want to do
a test drive with this one? - Sure. - We'll take the $3 one. - [Chris] Oh, you'll take the $3 one? - [MrBeast] It is a little pricey. This is on the higher end of the lot, $3. How do you like it? - I love it. - [MrBeast] Do you think you want it? - We'll definitely take it.
- Yes, sir. - [MrBeast] All right, well,
let's go do the paperwork. Chandler, we ran the 33% off sale, so it's now $2, just so you're aware. - [Chandler] So we're gonna just give you this piece of paper, I
need you to fill it out. - [MrBeast] Do you know
what that paperwork is for? - No.
- Good. Why is the second page a word... What kind of dealership are you running? - Very important. Go away, I'll handle this. - I did it, I made a sale. Y'all have a great one.
- Thank you. - Enjoy the new car. - [MrBeast] And there we go. Bye. Chris, that was your first sale. - I did it. My mom's gonna be of me. - A new customer is approaching. Let's do it together, friendship. - [Jake] Hey, how are you doing today? - I just need something for my son. - He'll love this Nissan.
- That Nissan is bad. - [Jake] Do you like the interior? - What's your name?
- Hi. My name is Wendy. - Oh, thank you, Wendy. - Professional vlogger. - She is. So Wendy, how do you like it? - Okay so far. - What do you think it's worth? - I would probably say 10, 12,000? - We like the number 12, but not 12,000. How about $12, can you do that? - Huh? - $12, is that fine? - Okay, is it gonna blow up? What's the deal?
- Nope. Actually, I feel bad for marking her up, how about $10, is that fine? Okay, you drive a hard
bargain, nine, we'll do nine. - Wait, hold on, we should have a meeting. - We need to have a meeting. She's a good bargainer. Let's start off with eight. I'm willing to go down to six, anything lower, we walk away. - Okay, we'll do $5. - $5 today, cash.
- Take it or leave it. That's the floor, no lower, I'm sorry. I'll give you $100, just take the car. - You gonna give me $100
just to take this car? - Yes, deal?
- Sike. - Oh, she's bold. - Hey, I'm sitting in
this car with three guys with these Beast shirts on. Well, they want me to take this car and they're gonna give
me $100 to take this car. You want the car?
- Yeah. - All right, fine, we'll
give you $100 as well. Geez, these guys are good. - Okay, bye. - [Wendy's Son] Is that MrBeast? 'Cause I got one of the Beast shirts. - Oh, $500! - Whoa, all right, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Are y'all serious? - [Jake] Yes, ma'am. - Now you're making me wanna cry. - [Jake] It's getting a
little emotional in this car. - It is. - [Jake] My throat is
starting to getting locked. - I'm starting to tear up. - It's the sweat. I'm not crying, it's the sweat. - So $500 we give you, plus the car. Let's go sign some paperwork. - Let's go do it! - We sold a car! - I'm overwhelmed, shocked, blessed. - [MrBeast] Congratulations. - Thank you. - Group huddle. That was amazing. - Perfect. - That made me feel good,
let's do that again. - Don't just shout out
we'll give them $500. - Guys, we got a new customer,
we got a new customer. - Don't do that next time.
- We got a new customer, go, go, go!
- It's $500! - Stop. How are you doing, I am Jake. - Alexis, nice to meet you. - This is our co-salesman Chris. - I'm the owner, hi, I own this place. I like Rubik's cubes too. - Thank you. - Are you interested in a new car? - I am. I need something that has a third row. I have four kids, and they have to- - Really? - It might not look it.
- Everyone has four kids. - My birthday is September
the 1st, it's coming. - Oh! - Happy early birthday, free car! - No, no, hold on. Before you make decisions, I
need it ran through me, okay? This is a very expensive video. - Free car? - I spent over $100,000.
- Free car. - I'm also paying lots of people. - It's her birthday in like a week. - It's just like, I've been
spending a lot recently on videos, so I need you to... Okay. - Happy birthday, you get a free car. Is this the one you want? This is the one she wants, that was easy. - Test drive, drive. - [MrBeast, Chris, And Jake]
Test drive, test drive! - This is our first day
running a dealership, how's the service? - You guys are awesome. - We did it, Jake. - We did it, and it didn't
cost us $500 this time. - It did not, it cost Jimmy. - Yeah! Is he mad? - How do you like it so far? - It drives well. - I actually feel really
comfortable, I like this seat. - [Alexis] I don't think this is good. - The check engine light's on, boys. - We said it was free, we
didn't say it was perfect. - To be fair, I just bought
all these cars today. And I've never ran a dealership. I don't know what I'm doing. We are back at the Beast Dealership. Let's go inside and sign some paperwork. - So apparently, Jimmy tells me the check engine light's on. Let's crank her up and take a look. Yep, so it says check engine. There is an engine in there. I checked the engine,
it is in fact in there. - Oh okay, here you go, ma'am, the engine is in the car. I don't know what the light was on about, it's not missing. - Okay. - You're the proud owner of a new car. - [Alexis] That was easy. - I'm gonna file this right here. - There's three people
walking up right now. And as you know, we're MrBeast, so we're gonna be doing a
last to leave challenge, 'cause why not? All right, hey, how's it going? - You guys see this car? - We wanna do a challenge,
last one to leave keeps it. Do you guys wanna compete? We'll give you whatever you need. - I don't care.
- Yeah? Have you guys seen our challenge before? - Yeah.
- Yeah, have you? - I have your Instagram. - You guys are free to
leave whenever you want, the last one to leave
gets the keys to the car. - I stayed in one for three days one time. - Don't say that. - I'm not joking. - Oh my god. - We have new customers approaching. Have fun. - You guys got this. So we got the Lexus right here. - How about the Venza? - [Chris] It's nice. Do you know how much this car is worth? - No, I don't. - [Chris] Jimmy, you want to
help me, Mr. Financial Officer? - I'm gonna go get Chandler. Chandler, are you throwing up? - [Chandler] Yeah. - I tried to get Chandler for
back up, but he was puking. - Got you, must have watched Moritz video. - I have nothing to do with this. - I'm going to England, Moritz, come on, one V one me,
boxing match, let's go. All right, this car, two. - [MrBeast] It's $2 right now. - $2? - [MrBeast] Okay, you drive
a hard bargain, it's now $1. - $1.
- $1? Stop. - [MrBeast] 50 cent. - 50 cent?
- 50 cent. - [MrBeast] Chris, that's
as low as we can go. - [Customer] 50 cent? - 50 cents is as low as
I can go, finance said. - I'm gonna go run it by our accountant, if he's done throwing up. I'll be right back. Chris just did a 75%... Are you okay? - I don't know. - [MrBeast] Is 75% off
okay on one of the cars? Will that bankrupt the company? - Probably. - [MrBeast] Okay, good, thank you. - 50 cents, ladies.
- You got two quarters? - No, I don't have two quarters. - Didn't your daddy ever tell you to keep change on you at all times. You never know where you might be. - For real though, like seriously? - For real. - 50 cent? - 50 cent. - [MrBeast] Unless you
don't like this car, we can go look at another car. - No, I love this car. - Chandler's going home, he's sick. - Okay, bye Chandler. It's all these low prices we're giving, they're making him sick. We're out of an accountant, our other salesman is
out doing a challenge, we're losing employees like flies. I need you to clear this
lot pronto, make it free. - [Customer] What? - You can keep the 50 cents I gave you. - Wait a minute. Hold on for real! Come on, stop playing, y'all playing. Y'all playing. - [Chris] Let's go do the paperwork. - Come see our new accountant. How's the second page looking? It's a crossword puzzle. Marcus, that's my 50
cents, I'll take that back. Okay. Yeah, you can take the car, it's yours. - Come on now. I'ma be pranked when I get outside. Y'all stop. - [MrBeast] What's
going through your mind? - I don't have... I don't know what to say. - You're gonna make me cry. - [Chris] Did you know
you were getting anything today at all? - No. - [Chris] You were just buying a car? - Yeah. - [Chris] Well, you got 100% off deal. Well, congratulations. - Thanks. - Another satisfied
customer by yours truly. - Back in the car. I wonder how the radio is. (upbeat music) - As you guys know, I have a brother. He actually recently started
a channel called MrBro. Well, it turns out he has two editors and they both don't have a car. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna call him and have him come get a car that he can let his editors share, so they can come to work to edit. (phone trilling) Hey, CJ, so like I told you, we bought all the cars at a dealership, and I remembered your editors need a car, so do you wanna come
grab one to give them? Okay, CJ, pick whichever car you want. - $9? - [MrBeast] No, that's $9,000. - 9,000? - [MrBeast] You've got
some Target receipts. - I don't have anything in my wallet, man. I have a free haircut. - All right, so let's pick out a car. - [MrBeast] Because you're my own blood, I will give you this for $1. - This one?
- Yeah. - Jimmy, I don't even have
a dollar in my wallet. - [MrBeast] Okay, it's free, geez. - I have no money, okay? - Get in here and do paperwork. - [MrBeast] Chris, can
you be nice to my brother? - Get in here, please and do paperwork. - [MrBeast] Thank you. All right, Marcus, this is my own blood, so take care of him. - Okay, can you sign your name here? Shake on it. Hand's a little sweaty, but- - I'm not used to spending
this much money on a car. - [Chris] I'm Chris, nice to meet you. - Shamar. - Shamar? So this is the one that
caught your eye first? - Yeah, it actually caught
my girlfriend's eye, I'm trying to surprise her. - You gonna surprise her with a Lexus? Have you heard about our special
we got going on right here? - No. - See that number? That's the price, $10. - $10? - $10. This is your Lexus if you give me $10. 20, is that a tip? - Yeah.
- All right. This my kind of man right here. Let's go inside and let's
get the paperwork done. - Come on, man. - I'm serious. - No, for real. - If he promises to
take his girl on a date, pay for it, and then
surprise her with the car at the end, he can have it for free. - Okay. - Can't beat love. - Are you doing it tonight? - Yeah. Hey, if I can get it tonight, I will. - Well, as long as
you're giving it to her- - Come on, man. - [MrBeast] It's free. - You serious, man? - Yeah, I'm serious. It's a good car for free. - Man, oh my goodness. - [MrBeast] How are you feeling right now? - I'm blessed and I know my girlfriend is going to love it. She might propose to me. (men laughing) - Enjoy the brand new car. - We are going to provide
epic content for this video. - He just left me? Excuse me. - Oh my god, he not even
gonna get up there no more. - Oh, this about to be your car, ain't it? Dang. (woman laughs) (Marcus grunting) I'm a little person, so it wasn't as bad as it could've been. - How are things going in here? - Chris, we got another customer. All right, we will be right back, sorry, we can't be slacking
on the job, very important. - Hey, welcome to the dealership. Which car are you interested in? We only have a few left on the lot. - If you get this car, we give you $1,000. - Oh wow. - Do you feel like that's a fair deal? - That's an awesome deal. - Okay. - Do you want to haggle
a little bit, Chris? - All right, we'll give you
the car for free and $1,100. - Wait a minute! Y'all going the wrong way. - I think we pull the
double whammy, all right? We hit her with 1,150, and then when she shuts it
down, we go with the 1,500 and seal the deal. After discussing, we got a new offer. - Okay, okay, okay. - We give you 1,150 and a car. - 1,500, take it or leave it. - There it is.
- I'll take it. - All right, ma'am. There we go.
- I'm taking it. Oh my god, that's so cool. - I told you, the double
whammy always works. - I'm about to pass
out, I can't, oh my god, you're going the wrong way. - [Marcus] Congratulations. - Oh my god. - Does that car have a full tank of gas? Add another $50 just in case. (customer groans) 1,550. - This is so unbelievable. - [Marcus] How does it feel? - It feels like it's mine. (laughs) - You got a new car for free, girl! Free with $1,500 and a full tank of gas. - [MrBeast] Do you remember
we bought a car with pennies? - I do, that was a long time ago. - Man, I wish I had a new car. I got a new car! - [MrBeast] Do you still like that car? - I do.
- Yeah? - [MrBeast] You need another car. - Do I?
- Yes. Chris, we have another customer. We'll be right back. This gentleman right here will help you. - Cheyenne. - Very nice to meet you, Cheyenne. How about this car? - That's pretty nice. - See that price?
- Mm-hmm. - Just forget about it. Does this fit your budget? - Yeah, that- - [MrBeast] Okay, you
wanna sign some paperwork? - Yeah. - Zero dollars, free. - [MrBeast] It's been a long day, I don't wanna get ripped off. I think we hit her with the $300. - I look forward to our
business burning together. - Okay, $300, take it or leave it. - You're giving me $300 and that- - Yeah, to drive it off the lot. - We wouldn't make you pay $300, that'd just be silly. - Can I hug one of y'all? Oh my god! Oh my goodness! I want to hug you too, because this is crazy.
- Not an aggressive hug. - Sign it right here, but
it has to be in Arial font. - Can you give me an
example of Arial font? - I'm not exactly sure myself. Good, good. Congratulations, you got a free car.
- Thank you. - It's really unreal, I'm still kind of trying
to get out of the shock of getting something like that for free. - [MrBeast] Well, congratulations. - Thank you. Oh my god. - [MrBeast] All right, sorry for that. - I got a new truck! And I got my own bed, for when I get kicked out for snoring! - This is true. Oh god, my mom is gonna
kill me if you get hurt. We didn't even talk about the price. That's okay, you can just drive it away. So here's the deal, we
put them in the car, and told them last to leave keeps it. - We didn't say which car. - So what we did was we
pulled two cars up beside the middle car. Ba da boom, ba da bang, dang. Technically, they get in another car and they'll be the last
to leave that other car, so everyone wins a car. We don't want to have any losers here, so we're just gonna give you all a car. Your new car is that one. You can have it. - Really? - Yeah, go ahead. - No, I can't get out of the car. - No, you can get out of the car, that one's your car. Also your car is right there. You can go get in it too. Let me have a word with my people. - [Chris] Why can't people
just take our good fortune? - [Man] Please do it! She's getting out, thank God. - Yes, yes. - Why are you watching my feet? - [MrBeast] Because we want
you to get this car, please. - [Chris] Oh, she stepped out! - [MrBeast] All right,
now get in your car, yay! (group cheering) You won it. All right, congratulations. You can drive off with your brand new car. Enjoy. This is your car. I mean, I don't care how you get in it. I just want you to know this is your car. That means you lost, so we keep this one. - You keep my car? - [MrBeast] Oh, the
confidence, she said my car. All right, well, yep you're right, this is actually yours. So enjoy it. - But you really thought
you were gonna lose the car. But y'all got a car, how
does that make y'all feel? - Still can't believe it. - You can't believe it? Congratulations, y'all. - And there you have it, we sold all the cars on the lot. - I need paid, I worked all day. - [MrBeast] Here's a
little bit of pocket lent. - Sweet. - This video is very special to me and we impacted a lot of lives today. And I really wanna continue
doing stuff like this, which is why I need you guys to buy merch from ShopMrBeast.com. Literally, every dollar
we make off this merch goes right back into the videos. I wanna open a homeless shelter, plant a lot of trees, just
do a lot of good things, but it's very expensive. Basically, I can't make an
impact without your help. - We need you to buy merch. - Yeah! - And to make it easier on you, we dropped a lot of new
designs, like this one, look at that sleeve. Oof, I love this one. And come here, Chandler. Oh, this one's just simple,
it goes with anything. And obviously, this hoodie, I love it. And this isn't just cheap crap, it's actually very high
quality, wouldn't you say? - Yeah. - My nips are soft. - I really want to make an
impact and I can't without you. It's comfortable and all the
money goes to doing good. ShopMrBeast.com, it'd mean the world to me if you bought something, thank you. ♪ MrBeast6000 ♪ ♪ MrBeast6000, yeah, you know his name ♪ ♪ He changed it once or twice ♪ ♪ But I think it's here to stay ♪
