ladies and gentlemen Magnus Carlson has done it again you see a couple of days ago here in late 2023 Magnus broke the all-time highest ELO on chess.com for Blitz 3,340 eclipsing the previous record by hikara Nakamura which was 3,336 and that's a record that Hikaru held for I don't know as long as chesc has existed maybe 10 years I don't know what it is but Magnus is now 3340 and in this video I'm going to show you the streak of games that he played after that to break his own record and hit an all-time high of 3,348 and on this channel I cover a lot of the great things that Magnus does I like to cover when he plays lower rated Grand Masters to show you the difference I like to show you total dominance against his own opposition I like to show you him playing different openings right sometimes it's a master class of how he handles a certain opening a certain way well the truth is we're going to miss him when he's gone the truth is you all enjoy this content and I enjoy this content because he makes it look so easy so let's jump into to uh today's games uh I am a bit under the weather I am almost fully recovered from Co this time was very light uh last year I had it much worse uh this time I didn't even know I had it I I just you know I needed to travel to Toronto and I figured well I should probably take a covid test and um so I'm I'm almost fully recovered uh and these games that I'm about to show you are funny like if there's a way to describe them it's funny the first two games are the most disrespectful way you could possibly beat a grand master so here we go Magnus plays E4 by the way th this rating is already accounted for after the game is concluded he was 3340 when this game was played he's playing a grandmas I've never heard of in my life just you're your average 2950 GM Magnus plays the carlan and then against the advanced variation Magnus plays in a very very very provocative and dises respectful way Knight H6 this is stupidity embodied like this is but Magnus is Bored do you understand he's bored he's so high rated he has nobody to challenge him on chess.com for winning against the 3,000 Magnus gets two points okay and these guys are not bad players they know how to play chess so Magnus voluntarily gives himself bad positions do you know why he does that so that the opening is no longer a factor because you see in chess if you memorize enough in the beginning of the game you can force your opponent into very boring territory very dry territory and that's not what Magnus likes so Magnus immediately blows up the center of the board he damages his structure blocks his own Bishop he's going to have problems castling for the rest of the game and now he has to instigate in the center he tries to win his Pawn back his opponent says no so Magnus has doubled H pawns no G Pawn at all and is a pawn down and then he plays this move A6 the idea is just to prevent anything from ever going to B5 right his opponent plays C3 the idea is to build up B4 so if black plays E6 white plays B4 and is going to have a very comfortable life or we'll see now Magnus plays Bishop G7 of course targeting the pawn on E5 and white decides instead of uh trying to defend it right instead of trying to defend it with the queen because it's not going to be very it's not going to be very easy for uh White to hang on to that pawn he says you know what take my Pawn let's trade and now white can just Castle but what he chooses is to get aggressive of course I mean look at magnus's position literally looks like a 400 is playing with black doubled H pawns king is not going to Castle you know the bishop is hanging you you got to go back I mean this is a fantastic looking position for for white but this is the way Magnus plays these people I mean he needs to do something provocative he needs to do it's like that song you know what is it no one knows what it means but it's provocative it gets the people going you know that's that's Jay-Z and and Kanye uh it's it's got a song title I can't say on YouTube but uh good song it's got a good song I it's a good song It's a good vibe you know puts you in the zone uh anyway my point is uh ball so hard and and and as far as this game is concerned taking risks for Magnus is what he has to do otherwise he gets bored E5 all right E5 takes the center defended Queen G5 takes takes Maybe idea Magnus look look at this move look at this move Knight to E4 you can't take cuz then there's a discovered check and I win your queen so Magnus has to allow the knight in he has to be provocative he's got to get the people going all right Bishop F5 now ASAP Queen trade so he's got to get the Queens off now he UND doubles that pawn that he doubled from the opening and we go to an end game now this is one of the worst looking end games I've ever seen white is going to get a cluster of Pawns moving this way he's got a four on two black has pass pawns but they're not going anywhere and all of Black's pawns are blocking his Bishop while this Knight is going to stand there like a God and yet and and and Magnus is down 30 seconds and he's down 30 seconds watch plays F6 the idea of F6 is simple defend everything bring the king up slide the bishop back that's the F6 every move Magnus makes has a purpose King F7 now suddenly White's try look where did White's Advantage even go the thing is when you play against Magnus it's not so easy to capitalize your advantage like apparently the right idea was to be ultra aggressive right away not giving black time but because white was sort of lulled into this like I'm just going to slowly improve my position yeah well so did Magnus right like so did Magnus who now stops you from anchoring your night and somehow Magnus is not even worse anymore in fact Magnus is calling the shots Magnus has pieces on their home squares how is this man in a better position with all of his remaining pieces on home squares it doesn't make sense how does he play chess like that now the bishop did move remember the bishop moved but the pieces haven't done anything look at this B5 Magnus baiting his opponent forward like like like waving on the bull you know look at this he's waving him on he's he's Galloping into the position and yet what's he gonna do he takes and now like a hydraulic press that channel there goes D3 and that Pawn's a problem because now in comes Magnus look at him go he's breaking down the defenses he's connected his pawns E4 and all of a sudden this is M he won that game out of nowhere and he won the game by 38 seconds what I will remind you when this end game began bro was down 30 seconds on the clock just straight up down 30 seconds and in the worst position of the game he wins the game up 38 seconds and it's never in doubt his opponent needed to be more forceful needed to be and he missed one chance and I mean the the effortless nature of how easily Magnus maximizes everything on both sides of the board with pieces on their home squares I mean it's just it it's by the way the next game is even worse this is this is one of the most disrespectful things I've ever seen Magnus do to anybody like seriously I'm I'm going to take a sip just relax and I'm going to show this it's so bad okay look um Magnus plays D4 I play already plays a sideline like I don't even know what he's doing I mean I don't know what this his opponent goes here Magnus tries to just get his Queen up so Magnus like baited black into playing a London side like system and now he attacks B7 of course black can defend the pawn but he doesn't black plays Gambit in a Gambit style he gambits the pawn and his logic is well this bozo moved his Queen he's going to have to get out now and by then you know I'm going to get all my pieces out so black is saying for the cost of a of a measly little B Pawn I'm going to have a massive lead in development right Fair Knight F3 Knight F6 both guys develop now black is not playing Rook B8 because he doesn't want to lose this Pawn he wants to you know maybe finish up his development first Magnus moves his Queen again moves his Queen again so Magnus has now made 50% Queen moves but he is a pawn up black immediately plays Rook B8 black has a better position all intents and purposes he got much more development open space but he has no Pawn so he he has a pawn down give and take now the next sequence of moves is bogus rather than finishing his development with normal stuff like this and this and this right Magnus senses he might be under a little bit of threat here and he plays Knight H4 bro is not developing anything and now Bishop C2 stops the Queen's Escape so suddenly the queen can only go that way and I got news for you this is the end of the White Queen so Magnus now plays Queen A6 another queen move he's got a black is mean while marching into White's territory because all of White's pieces are asleep that's hanging so Magnus has to go back he's played one two three four five six seven moves with these pieces out of nine he's just worse now he's not even not only is he worse there's Bishop B1 and then Knight C3 you can't take as you go here I mean I mean really because because of this it's a really bad position for white provocative is an understatement now Magnus can take another Pawn he doesn't he plays Queen A5 that is yet another queen move finally there is this this and Knight takes C3 and that's a problem because after Pawn takes you lose your rook and after Queen takes you lose your queen and it doesn't get any better because if you try to go here Bishop before so Magnus gets punished for his goofiness I mean he he just doesn't care like dude's like whatever I'm just like I'mma beat these people anyway like black Black's a grandm you can't mess around you're gonna get caught and he does get caught he gets caught dude is just down a queen I'm not even I'm not meeing he's just straight up a queen down okay he has some pieces for it he has two Bishops but this is completely loss for white because if you want multiple pieces to play against the queen what you need is is you need like a setup in which you can either exploit exploit weaknesses the opponent has or you have to have so few pieces on the board you have a fortress so if you minimized everything and white had bishop and Bishop and pawn for a queen white might survive because you can stop the queen from getting in but Queen's got so much help there's no way this is hopeless Black's just going to go here trade you'll make a couple of Trades you know if I was playing Black I'd probably trade one of the Bishops off rather than the Knight but okay Bishop D2 E3 but you gu you all know what's about to happen I mean Magnus just develops his pieces castles right like he bro just doesn't have a queen black plays C4 very simple just get all the rest of the pieces and just go after this Magnus says no let's trade off that pawn I I don't like that that pawn is encroaching and magnus's idea with this is to is to cut the board in half if he can get rid of both of these pawns then they can trade a couple Rooks maybe less weaknesses I told you the more the more pieces you trade the higher chance you have of making a fortress but you can't trade too much and you can't trade too quickly Queen E7 see look they're trying to trade pawns black says no Magnus activates his Rook finally black Waits too long Magnus says oh B4 you going to take big decision you going to take I don't think so why would you want to lose a bishop for a rook that's not a good deal now Magnus makes sure he never blunders back rank mate Magnus is no different than you he's also worried he might blunder back rank Checkmate one day Rook C2 Rook A2 and Magnus just has a fortress I mean he's just sort of waiting like dude is I told you he just lost the queen in the first 12 moves and he's like I'm Magnus do something about it boo his opponent puts the Knight on C4 that looks really smart I mean I really like that that looks really sophisticated if this you know the D Pawn's going to become a major problem so he puts the night on mag says Nope just plays G3 just G3 King G2 just waiting just waiting he has no weaknesses everything in the position is defended except this bishop but you can't attack it black has to win how's black going to win Rook B6 Rook C6 and now this man Magnus who should obviously be doing nothing he should be sitting here and waiting like a good pupil opens the position against whomst is this man creting counterplay he's down a queen take take now suddenly his opponent psychologically like psychologically wait a minute now Max is up 30 seconds he's up 30 seconds in a Blitz game after stalling for so long H4 Rook A5 oh my God Magnus is still trying to call the shots he's playing D5 he damages his opponent's Pawn structure opening up the king suddenly here comes the bishop but Rook E7 is a really nice move now Magnus might be forced to trade the Rooks he is oh this is really bad he messed around too much as you can see the eval is not very happy either but he gets that pawn his Pawn is still protected everything in White's position is protected except the Rook Bishop F4 B5 he's creating a fortress like Black's got to get there but he can't cuz he can't go there so he's going to go bang bang bang bang maybe Rook B6 uhoh now Magnus is going to win a pawn he wins the outskirt pawn so now he cut the board in half I told you this a long time ago he cut the board in half now all the pawns are isolated on one side and black structure is ruined it's immobile now all white has to do is trade Rooks and he gets it and now good luck winning because how is the queen going to get through this brick wall none of Black's pawns can help the only thing that can help is the king so for example Knight D2 if the black oh well I guess you that would that hold on let's say something like this and and he tries to help but there everything is protected you can play King H5 and King G4 it's not going to help it's not going to help I'm just going to go here you can't get close you try to get close I just play here just play Bishop F4 you get close I play Bishop E3 there is F4 so you got to be a little careful a little bit care maybe King G2 instead of Bishop E3 but that's the point and guess what now Magnus just laughs in his opponent's face his opponent can't do anything he had a queen Advantage he can't do anything and as time is running lower and lower Magnus starts shuffling shuffling shuffling they Shuffle they Shuffle they Shuffle and on the 88th move of the game his opponent hangs his Queen and you may be wondering why Magnus didn't take the queen here he was pre-moving he was pre he's just not pre-moving but he was just trying to beat his opponent on the clock so I mean this dude Straight Up played one of the goofiest openings I've ever seen hung a queen still wins now what happens when he starts [Music] trying what happens when he starts trying oh boy okay Magnus plays a pier defense this is the uh Pi's defense with black you try to play B5 counteracting an opponent's queenside Castle now white stalls white doesn't choose to Castle yet he's a little bit hesitant Magnus does Castle and his opponent attacks him right away now Magnus does something very sophisticated he volunteers a doubling of the central pawns doubled isolated Center pawns but this is actually a lot more potent than it looks because the pawns control four very key squares all right like a totem pole and then they also create openings so the C file the E file is open the key squares for black to make progress in the position and they remove opponent possibilities so as long as you protect them they're actually really really not so bad Rook E8 Knight F6 Knight E4 Bishop F5 the position plays itself this is what happens when he tries okay and and even then he's able to create things that are a little bit more exotic he plays in just a very solid v v now now I'm uh I'm I'm I'm German plays in a very Solid V right he's trying to play in a way that's provocative but still positionally sound he got a little bit tired of being a queen down now how is he going to win puts the queen on the active Square rookie six rookie eight doubling up a lot of pressure building we have a very tense moment now how is Magnus going to tip the the first Domino to fall in his favor how's he going to do that right he's got a nice position but but now what cuz you don't want to move something then you start trading all the pieces well H5 same side pawn attack made possible by the fact that Black's completely safe from these pieces this Queen's not threatening anybody the the Knight can't come forward right none of these pieces can come so white plays C4 Sometimes the best way to me to strike on the flank is in the center pretty good move it's a very important Pawn in the black position takes now that's possible but so is that you can take both things with the bishop that move lost you a defender of the Knight but you only lose material if you take with the bishop what what am I why am I speaking in riddles take take take take take take white is up a knight of course white is winning but that's not what's going to happen What and why is black still better well when you're about to start a SE sequence like this where at the end of it you have a bishop and there's going to be a pin on a major piece like a queen sometimes mentally you can take with the more valuable piece beginners learn something in chess called capturing with the least value first which makes sense you want your lowest value pieces to perish first so you preserve the higher value pieces but then you move up in chess and in chess there's something called superseding Concepts you learn a concept until a point and then you get Advanced now it's time to unlearn that concept just a little bit there's exceptions Rook E4 why when all is said and done before you take you go back to that concept of lower value D5 and that's the key and now you're going to take that Rook for sure now if there was a check here that wouldn't be possible it's very important that you can't move the Rook the King was here none of this works because rookie eight is check and I can't take the queen but Magnus doesn't even have to take look at this Flex defending his Queen side structure pressure on that pressure on that finally he takes and now the queen can get the pawn in the center as well when it's all said and done Magnus is a pawn up and watch how he cuts through this like a fine slice of beef Bishop to E4 threatens Checkmate on G2 light squared weakness has been created the missile is ready to launch A5 a key move stopping anything from happening on the queen side and this cannot be taken because you would take your eyes off the E3 Square Queen F5 repositioning complete Queen goes to F1 Queen goes immediately back to E4 now that the queen took its size off that's a threat that's a threat that's a threat and white resigns because he's going to lose his Knight and then obviously he will lose the game as well and this was all out of a complete game where Magnus actually tried did not lose a queen in the first 10 moves created a slightly imbalanced Central Pawn formation simply improved the positioning of every single one of his pieces and the second that his opponent tried to pipe up Magus said sit down Rook E4 D5 and that's it we just go straight to a Queen Bishop versus queen night end game there's nothing you can do to me and the last one another game where Magnus tried right like you know he could be down to Queen he doesn't have to try he gets bored playing on equal terms he's been playing this opening recently which literally again I would tell beginners never to play you see a lot of you think like this you go oh you know when I'm playing I'm like 800 I like to play a little Italian maybe fried liver and then your opponent plays C5 and you go oh you know KN F3 night C6 I'm playing the Italian a lot of you learn chess in the way that like if you get a hammer in your hands you just think everything is a nail oh why is that screw not going in because this is not the Italian because black can play E6 and D5 but superseding Concepts that's a concept that exists for many people but when you're Magnus you don't care like watch cuz he's going to he's going to put his Bishop back a square and then he's going to put his Bishop there in many positions maybe not in this game but in many positions so the point is you learn things in chess to a point and then you can unlearn that stuff you could do whatever you want but you have to earn the ability you have to earn the level you have to earn the respect to start breaking those principles D4 for example I go to boxing I'm never going to fight Southpaw I'm I'm just not switching stances is very useful if you're a good fighter but I'm like 600 at boxing so I don't need to fight Southpaw yet right CD CD also boxers don't really switch stances not not a huge amount I I don't think D5 E5 Knight bd2 we have a very tense Central moment here black decided not to take the Knight which would have been a fair trade black decided I'm going to let you take my knight what that's going to do is it's going to unclog the defile it's also going to open up my Bishop so The Grandmaster said Magnus I don't think you want to make this trade Magnus said I'm Magnus cuz that's just how I imagine Magnus just speaks like an NPC he speaks like a Pokémon you know how Pokémon just say their own names I feel like if you meet Magnus you're like Magnus what are your thoughts on this he's just like I'm mnus and like that's it that he's just mnus Carlson and you're like oh well yeah that makes sense you know in Pokemon the Pokemon goes Pikachu and you're like oh yeah of course yeah no that's I completely understand your positioning on that geopolitical issue yeah absolutely so anyway Knight A5 Magnus is attacked Rook G4 now yeah black does have a lot of open lines absolutely Ely but so does white We're positioning The Rook directly against the pawn that is only protected by the black king Knight takes B3 now a classy move this is what we call in chess a zishan zuk before you take this back you play an in between move that frequently either captures something or creates a stronger threat boom that is worth more than the bishop and The Rook CU you're going for the King instructive by the way you could take with the bishop but this is forc mate cuz there's no way to protect that Queen D3 is game over because of F5 of course on F pass there we go right G6 now he doesn't take the Rook the idea of Bishop H6 was just to weaken the squares now he takes the Knight and then he plays H3 H3 is a weird move why would he play H3 was that a mouse lip was he trying to play H4 H3 might have been a mouse slip cuz I got to tell you this looks pretty damn good but got to live with it or maybe there was an idea maybe the idea was night here night here night oh but he could have done that with the pawn here too so maybe he mous slipped I don't know Queen D2 look at black trying to create counterplay Black's not letting Magnus live black knows it's just a matter of time Magnus repositions trying to put his Queen there trying to put his Knight on G5 and then maybe go back to playing H4 there it is Knight G5 now this is never going to happen because you're going to walk in and get butchered on the on the dark squares there's the queen oh my look look at this masterful positioning while defending against mate while defending the center this rook's just having a smoke he's like yeah you guys are good man guys are doing a great job you guys are doing awesome I don't even have to okay now he moves cuz maybe you're going to take the bishop to deflect the queen maybe you're going to play Rook C5 whatever you're going to do maybe the rook's just going to sneak in now to Black's credit black manages to relinquish a lot of White's pressure get rid of a lot of it I guess Knight E4 Magnus maybe miss queen E4 Maybe he should have gone here first and then the computer was just like bludgeoning but he goes here and Magnus is like you know like at the end of the day I'm Magnus Carlson and I can win an endgame so he loses the pawn in B2 but how does black make a move he can't move his F Pawn or his Rook or his bishop or his King so all White's got to do is get another Rook to the back Rank and it's over so black starts pushing time is of the essence Rook stops the pawn okay okay the pawn can't go forward anymore now you could play Rook B1 here but then I would just play King F1 right I would I would get a king closer and you wouldn't be able to do anything but instead of that sensing the pressure black decides to solve his problems right now he could have been a little bit more patient the computer gives G5 take take lose your rook and then try to like survive this and apparently it's a draw because if this there's Rook B1 check black misses that plays F6 Magnus takes and now feeling the heat black decides to make a run for it and unfortunately Magnus embarrasses that King and forces it to walk the plank Rook A7 takes Bishop G7 suddenly the king realizes wait a minute I have a very limited option of squares King F5 Rook E5 uhoh uhoh that's my only remaining square uhoh and now check made in two we finish by forcing the king to walk the entire length of the f file to the F3 Square where it will perish with Rook to E3 Checkmate out of nowhere that was like going to an end game for a second and then just a clean win black could have defended if he was stockfish but he's bwat BL so uh you know I don't I don't cool name but probably stands for something like BL is there Grandmaster in the world BL and this is how Magnus broke the all-time high that he just set of 3,348 now the crazy thing is they played again and Magnus actually lost the next game and he lost 15 rating points Magnus is playing games against these 2950 3,000 rated Gams if he wins he gets two rating if he Los loses he loses 15 he has to beat them seven times to one to get the points back it's crazy it's absolutely ridiculous um yeah all I have for you today very fun to watch him play these games and uh tomorrow if you're watching here in late December the Champions chess tour finale starts so it's going to be a week of Rapid chess Blitz chess to determine who's the Champions chess tour winner of 2023 Magnus playing hikaro for bios so we'll see if Magnus can take some of this momentum into that event uh that's all I'm going to go rest my throat get out of here
