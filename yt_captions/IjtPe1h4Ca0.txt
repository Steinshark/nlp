solana rhodes just rug pulled her nft project and ran away with 1.5 million dollars now she's claiming it's not her fault her community was just getting too negative for her one of those negative comments was about how this person can't feed their kids because they invested it all into a star's jpeg collection quote i spent what i can't lose spent 4k no job have a two-year-old son if only someone bought my christmas lana yeah and apparently lana road saw this post and said hey this is this is getting way too negative for me i'm out i didn't know these people wanted to feed their kids apparently she's too busy feeding her own kid to worry about this when asked about this she said yo diapers are expensive that's right guys she needs that 1.5 million dollars now let's just say what this is from lana rhodes to the to the person who invests their last diamond to it this is the dumbest story we've ever talked about by far i mean it's there's no contest but here we are so let's just let's just embrace what it is welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla the internet detective so again this story is what it seems a star gone influencer offered an investment to her fans and then they invested 1.5 million dollars she ran away with the money i'm gonna say right off the top come real close come here we have to have a talk okay if you fell for this we're in trouble you're this is not good now to be clear she's wrong for doing this i want the best for you guys and i'm sorry that you got scammed but it's looking bleak if you fell for this this was not a hard one to spot this was not a big gotcha but anyways with that disclaimer out of the way let's talk about the story okay so look lana rhodes started an nft project full of a bunch of pictures of basically cartoon versions of herself and she told people she was gonna work super hard to basically make this a valuable investment the nft project was called cryptosis and she said my number one goal for the project is to increase the value of crypto cis nfts and make it a lucrative investment for holders that they can sell for more than they paid to mint and this is basically my big beef with this project they made it sound like an investment nowhere was it like hey buy my art clearly this was something where it was like no you're gonna make money on this project and she repeats this idea later she says quote the brand plus value will keep growing with every drop so her fans thought this was going to be some kind of long-term investment i guess and of course it wasn't if you look at her road map it was pretty clear things were promised that weren't delivered on for example in phase two she said decentraland and sandbox wearable will start getting developed she promised a piece of designated metaverse land would be purchased to create a hangout spot she said 50 lucky cryptocyst owners will receive cryptosis merch signed by lana even promising to distribute 5 eth to the top holders and of course one of the biggest things was an exclusive community to speak with lana this apparently was their reasoning for having to raise so much money 1.5 million dollars precisely because they weren't a pump and dump unlike other pump and dump projects we don't just plan on stopping after minting so we actually have to be able to fund all that stuff so you heard it right there this is a long-term project not a pump and dump but that didn't happen less than a week after all this money was raised lana rhodes vanished from her community and took the money out of the wallet here's the main wallet withdrawing over 1.5 million dollars in ethereum out of the project her reason things got too negative quote the truth as why lana hasn't been around was she was very shocked and upset by the amount of negative and rude comments she was seeing in the chat i personally find this part hilarious because i i checked out this discord you can't imagine a bigger simp army these guys were not negative and i do mean guys by the way uh they put their last dollar into this project truth be told and one of them even got like a tattoo of the project logo on them before it rugged but my point sort of is this wasn't a negative community at all in fact even after they had been scammed all these people in the community tried to police each other into being nice so that lana would come back here's one of the holders saying how do you want us to keep it respectful while the whole entire management scammed 6 000 people and took their money and left and then the person responds doesn't mean you can't be respectful i mean i feel like that tells you everything you need to know they had just been scammed and still you have people in the chat being like hey be respectful about it and honestly they used this fact that people were upset that they uh basically got rug pulled to justify then abandoning the project here's actually one of the collaborators informing the community of this they said good morning i chatted to crypto cis about my nft lana isn't interested in continuing mainly because she felt part of her discord community was cruel and she didn't want to have to look at comments that's right guys lana rhodes doesn't want to have to look at cruel comments just because you can't feed your kids now doesn't mean it's okay for you to get negative on her oh by the way yeah that same post that collaborator um they actually said they'd be releasing their own nft project in the same sentence so they basically said you guys got scammed and so uh look out for nft scam part two and you might be thinking who would fall for this well the same people who bought the first one uh because look here they said quote go show her some love talking about this person let's prove we are not toxic she can still save us i mean at this point it's pretty sad isn't it you got rug pulled and you're about to go into a second rug pull i mean again i want to help you guys but there's only so much i can do if you're gonna do that you know what i mean there's only so much we can do so yeah that's basically the story uh what did we learn from this hopefully nothing um i hopefully all of this was obvious to you if it wasn't you need to pump the stock honestly zilla hey it's free you're not gonna get rugged this time it's impossible just like and subscribe it's absolutely free and you need to watch a lot more of this channel
