all right so I'm about to unbox five special edition smartphones each one higher value than the last and in total you're looking at a hundred thousand dollars worth of phones so the highest budget video I've done by a very very long shot starting with the HTC Exodus 1s which at $250 is gonna seem like pennies compared to the later phones but it's still pretty wacky virtually I will say this pretty nice packaging for a 250 dollar phone they call this the crypto phone which I'll explain in a second but spec wise it's actually a little behind what you normally get for 250 dollars a 720p display on the front and a mid-range Snapdragon 435 chipsets this phone is all about one feature you've probably heard of Bitcoin you can think of it as a currency that a lot of people have purchased in the last few years in the hope that its value will rise so they can sell it again this is the first smartphone to have full Bitcoin note support which basically means that whilst you normally have to go through a bank or an exchange to buy and sell Bitcoin as furn is secure enough to do it directly through it pretty cool next up is at twice that price a phone you might have actually seen before this is the gundermutt limited edition Oppo Renault ace now Gundam is a Japanese animated series all about oversized robots I never watched it but I took one look at this limited edition online and thought we have to get on this video all right so pretty normal looking so far from the front Wow oh that is so much better in person it is gold silver blue red it's a lot of things at once and I do not hate that and underneath thief's phone and the other layers you actually get one of the nicer smart phone cases I've seen bundled with a product if you actually look carefully it's ridged in certain places and it has a couple of gundam references which I think are lost on me USB C charging cable and arguably the star of the show a 65 watt superfast charger able to fully charge this phone in 30 minutes flat now before we start getting really pricey or an extra two hundred dollars you can get yourself this well actually this plus all of this this is the xiaomi black shock 2 pro plus its entire gaming bundle and this is similarly specs to the renault ace we just looked but it can do a few extra cool things let's see what we get inside the box so it's kind of lightly textured on the front oh okay yeah that would be my color of choice this is iceberg gray and I think grays and whites are actually kind of overlooked on smart phones they do a great job of hiding fingerprints and they look clean it also comes with a gamepad attachment power adapter and also a case that is such a good color combination you've got matte gray followed by glossy grey and then these kind of blue highlights in the middle and that continues all the way around the phone you even got the blue rims on the front here in a weird way as well as looking just out the box crazy it also looks kind of understated it kind of feels that like even though this and the Renault both clearly have gamers in mind the Renault still somewhat trying to appeal to a broader market Xiaomi doesn't really seem to care they just want to make the ultimate gamer phone and to assist in that objective you get all of this stuff one of the primary differentiate is with the black shark is just the sheer number of accessories and they fit together in a really complimentary way there are two game pads the left one and the right one and whilst it does seem a little weird that the company sells the gamepad separately they can work independently but if you did buy both the best way of using them together is with this it's got a really nice grip on the back of it you then slide both of those Oh mr. joy konzern you slide both of those controllers in and you get something that looks like that and this feels great no flexing at all there's no headphone jack on the phone but if you didn't resolve that there's also a two-in-one audio adapter so that would essentially clip onto the back of the phone like that and then allow you to plug headphones and a USB CN at the same time and then to top it all off you can play your games on your TV using a USB c2 HDMI cable it's easy to forget but our modern our phones especially ones like this have already exceeded the power of last generation consoles so we're not putting to a TV you might be surprised by the results it is clever marketing having a really affordable based smartphone with tons of attractive accessories to get on top of it but at the same time all of this together is less than thousand dollar flagships so it's not something to complain about now moving from the expensive high-end category to the ultra expensive luxury category we've got this one you might have heard of a company called caviar they try to unite technology with exclusive luxury and they've gone hard with this package it is worth around eleven thousand dollars just for this alone which by the way absolutely pales in comparison to the one coming afterwards but is still a lot of money so this is actually from Russia and someone has flown from Russia to London just to be able to post this to get to me which is crazy how incredibly heavy for a smartphone box it's got caviar russia written on the front there in kind of embossed gold text i don't know what to expect okay another box okay that just got a whole lot more premium we've got what looks like a leather box with more gold text here and this feels fantastic the stitching is on point i suppose i said you'd expect so without further ado see that oh wow okay i'm gonna come to that in a second we should have a few other cool things in here let's start with this so there's like a little brochure that tells you other smartphones that caviar produces there's the hand-signed international warranty card and you also get an international certificate of ownership Wow so inside three more boxes well okay so if that's just a power brick yeah okay so this is a matte black gold embossed air pods Pro I believe yeah look at that that isn't nice and I guess I'm assuming this will be a cable yeah so standard Apple cable there oh and actually worth noting is this this is caviar xoan signature sim ejector tool and essentially meant to represent a sturgeon which is a type of fish which links back to caviar as a brand name because caviar means fish eggs most importantly though the smartphone and this is a 256 gig iPhone 11 pro with a twist oh god it's so heavy it's been built to remember the Titanic that massive ocean liner that hit an iceberg and sunk over a hundred years ago now and I suppose as you'd expect given the price the company hasn't spared much expense here the main body is made from black and titanium and interestingly there's no camera bump anymore because the whole back sticks out and to be honest I like it I'm torn as to whether or not it's a better implementation than the original Apple camera bump but it's nice to see that this is not just a lazy paint job they really have built a custom smartphone there is a lot more to this firm though it depicts a scene with waves and an anchor below it to remind people what happened that day there's moving parts these rotors on the back they actually rotate and the name of the shipyard Titanic was built in is called Harland & Wolff that is engraved on the back there are just so many touches here on the bottom you've got these three stumps one says 11pro the other says titanium the material it's made from and the other one is the caviar logo and finally arguably the most important part of the smartphone is was housed in this circle here it is an actual fragment from the Titanic ship which I suppose is getting more and more valuable over time because well it's deteriorating at the bottom of the ocean in fact there's only ninety nine of these in the world and right here it says this one is number 15 and now for the final phone this is gonna be crazy now you've probably done the math this entire unboxing is worth $100,000 and so far we've been boxed about $13,000 worth of stuff so what is inside here right now is worth ninety one thousand and thirty dollars if you're enjoying this video by the way a sub would be amazing it's as you can imagine taken quite a lot to get this video together anyways this last phone is also from caviar but this time trades exclusive luxury for something that is very literally out of this world oh yeah so it's got the caviar Russia logo on the top again and another leatherette box this one looks like it opens completely differently I'm like I'm physically nervous right now I never dreamed of the day I could even touch a phone of this value let alone film of video on one I'm going to assume it opens like this there's so much gold on there right here we go a home white god oh wow this is not meant to be touched look at this that is unbelievable tell you what I'm gonna have a quick look at what else comes in here and then we'll get straight back to that we've got the same cable and the same Sturgeon sim ejector tool but in this box also is that oh okay that's the that's a tool to adjust some part of this phone we have a pair of normal air pods this time which are matte black but no caviar branding on it that's an interesting choice I do like the idea of having my earphones it does resist fingerprints better than the traditional ones do the final box is actually buried right in there what happened to it area oh it's a charger this is it I don't even like to grip it okay it is very heavy and let's talk about it this phone is called the universe to Diamond gold and as you can probably tell it's got a space-themed so all these kind of rings you're seeing they're meant to be the orbits of planets around the star kind of like a simulated version of our solar system and right in the middle here this ticking sound you can now hear that is from a working tour beyond which is something that's used in traditional watches to negate the effects of gravity so again kind of links to that space theme and I believe this goes and it winds it up that's amazing I could do that for a long time oh and internally we're looking at an iPhone 11 Pro max with 512 gigs of storage obviously for $91,000 probably the coolest part here is that each of these planets that is orbiting is represented by a gemstone in fact on the back of this fern alone you've got seven diamonds three rubies and two topaz's and keeping with the space theme there's more on the back of this fern alone you've got a piece of the moon you've got three meteorite fragments and apart from a spaceship that's been orbiting this black body is made from lab engineered stone and every bit of gold you see on here pure gold and to top it all off you will notice that the lip of the iPhone is a little bit higher than normal and that is because it was protected by sapphire glass and you might know that sapphire is one of the hardest materials on the planet it gets a nine on the Mohs hardness scale meaning that it can only be scratched by something equivalent to Diamond you're actually not gonna get wireless charging anymore but clearly that's far from the point here this is all of our exclusive luxury the best materials I don't think anyone buying this is gonna be too bothered by that a lot of these caviar phones they're made in batches of a hundred sometimes ten and they're sometimes one-of-a-kind so yeah the $100,000 unboxing I can't believe we just did that if you enjoyed this video
