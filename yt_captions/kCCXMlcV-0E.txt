for a lot of people the next one plus phone is going to be the most exciting device to come and 2019 and in anticipation of that one plus are sent over this we've got the main event on the right but first let's just take a quick look at the Explorer backpack they've sent with it see ya oneplus makes backpacks - and this one is probably my favorite from the company it looks clean it's water-resistant it's got a fair bit of storage but there are a few key differentiators it's got this magnetic buckle which you open just by pulling down and then when you're done with the bag you just let go and usually it'll lock itself and of course because it is made by a phone company they've added a secret pocket at the back to hold your phone alright on to this densely packaged cardboard box they also sent over and when we open this up there are a lot of things inside but first things first the bullets Wireless they come with a couple of interesting pieces you've got this silicon looking case which kind of reminds me of the back of some of the cases you actually get on oneplus phones there are a range of ear tips as well as different sizes of hooks to keep them in place if you're running around and these are the bullets Wireless and I like them they sound good but as with the backpack there's a couple of features here which do differentiate them the earphones connect with magnets and you can use this to play and pause music without actually touching your phone the magnets aren't quite strong enough for them to find each other if you just drop them but as long as you put the earphones together they do connect and it does work you might have noticed they don't come with a charger of their own but using most smartphone charges you can give them a 5 hours of battery in ten minutes alright for some context on what's inside this box take a look at the oneplus sixty McLaren edition then we've got the oneplus 60 and before that came the bomb plus six if we jump back to 2017 there's a 5 T the 1 plus 5 and we've not even talked about the limited editions oneplus is made we've got White's we've got Reds we even got the more obscure like the 1 + 5 JCC Plus edition with that in mind let's take a look at this the box for the 1 + 3 T this phone was the last firm they produced before the 1 + 5 which felt like a major shift in direction underneath the phone there's a little instruction manual little sheet of paper that welcomes you to the device and then the - charging cable and the - charge that you're very familiar with we've also in this box got the 1+3 soft gold edition and something I'm really curious about is this phone the oneplus X but there's more this right here is the box for the oneplus 2 and as you can probably tell now that we've moved this far back in the company's timeline things are starting to look a little different we've got an instruction manual inside this red box but the charger and the cable you're seeing here are very different this is only a 10 watt charger compared to 22.5 on the new ones and the cable is still USB type-c but just looks unusual and then this is the oneplus one box a super exclusive phone you might remember when this thing came out you needed an invite to even purchase one I've got to say I like the box it's kind of unusual in terms of form factor and the phone is the first thing you'll see underneath that you've got this well-presented sim ejector tool you've got the cable this time only micro USB as well as a screen cleaning cloth and a SIM tray so this might be one of the first times ever where someone has had all the main oneplus phones from the oneplus one to the one plus 60 McLaren Edition and there's quite a few cool things you can do with this much history in one frame if we lay all the phones out one thing you might be able to immediately tell is how the company has matured when the first device the oneplus one came out the company were trying to smash the past to redefine the market and the phone's almost alien different and exciting shape from every angle really aligns with this message and right up until the oneplus 5 you can see that each new phone is a major redesign after which it feels like the company's kind of found what works and has proceeded to iterate on that as a base now this is not necessarily a bad thing whilst these new phones might look a little less differentiated compared to everyone else that doesn't change the fact that they're now more ergonomic and better built than ever before now I would say there's one exception the oneplus X it came out just after the oneplus 2 but I think this design is well ahead of its time it's got a glass body it's got a flat camera bump and these sham furred edges make it look super premium it is genuinely the type of form factor that I would consider buying into even for years onwards of also done a bit of a camera comparison and in fact this is probably the most phones you've seen in one side by side to start with when there's a lot of light do you can tell the two and the X are already well ahead of the 1+1 there isn't a huge amount of difference between the 3 and the 5 in broad daylight but you probably can tell the difference between the 5 T and the 60 you'll notice the shadows are a little brighter the whole dynamic range of the image is a little higher and just so you can see the whole journey this is 1 plus 1 versus 1 plus 60 the earliest to the latest with the 3t which is about the halfway point in the middle taking a look at the selfie cameras you'll notice two trends firstly how more recent phones are better able to expose the bright sky in the background and also how they tend to be a little subtler when it comes to your beautification algorithms and here it is start to finish we haven't really seen any kind of bump in detail it's been all about dynamic range and that beautification quick attempt at a portrait shot you can see the oneplus one here has a very pasty yellow color scheme and we don't actually get true portrait mode until the 1 + 5 the first poem from the company with dual cameras you can then see this portrait mode maturing with future iterations with edge detection becoming better and if you compare at the beginning to the end for this image quite a big shift alright the final scenario I wanted to test was night time and you can probably tell the first few phones from the company really struggle the 1 + 5 is a marked improvement but you only start to see a massive shift with a 1 + 6 and the 60 which are built to work with the company's nightscape feature see you looking at the overall trend the night time performance was consistently weak for a few years and only recently it's taken a jump one of the other things I was really interested in trying it was a performance benchmark I wanted to see how much more powerful phones had gotten from the oneplus one in April 2014 to the 1 plus 60 McLaren Edition four and a half years later some reason I couldn't get any benchmark to work on the oneplus X so that phone's got to sit out this time but the results for the rest of them are really interesting so the 16 McLaren Edition has pretty much exactly the same score as the 6 and the 60 run about 65,000 which makes them 50% more powerful than the 5 in the 5 T which are hovering just over 40,000 you've then got the 3 the 3t at around 30,000 and then neatly the 1+2 fits in just over 20,000 with the 1+1 at around 13 so roughly speaking the latest oneplus phones are around five times more powerful than the oneplus one that's only four and a half years of hardware difference the other thing I thought it would be interesting to test is display brightness so I've pulled up a Google page on all of them turned up brightness to maximum and you can probably tell comparing the latest to the earliest there is a massive difference the oneplus 2 is a fair bit brighter than the 1 + 1 + 1 + X is the first time they used an AMOLED display so the display quality is higher there's a fair jump between that in the 1 + 3 which is a first full size phone to use an AMOLED display and is definitely brighter but then the big difference I would say comes between the 3 T and the 1 + 5 here in the bottom left corner it's also interesting to see the evolution of the software you can see the original oneplus one came running something they call CyanogenMod a super customizable kind of open source software both the oneplus 2 and the oneplus X I've got here are Chinese versions which are based on an early version of something they call hydrogen OS the name might ring a bell and then with the oneplus 3 onwards you start to see the development of oxygen OS the same software that we have today it just looks very different in its early stages as the ferns evolved oneplus trimmed the fat they tried to build a software that focuses on pretty much speed and only having the functions in there that people would actually use you start to see the evolution of material design as well as gestures as the screens get larger and the need for buttons starts to fall what I also thought was quite cool is if you pay attention to the default wallpapers on these phones they started off getting increasingly complicated they peaked at around the 1 + 3 + 3 T and then they've slowly gone back to being simple again which aligns better with material design oh yeah and take a look at the fingerprint scanner situation you'll notice the oneplus one doesn't have one the oneplus 2 introduced it in the home button but then the oneplus X skipped it if then got the 3 the 3 T and the 5 which all have the same fingerprint scanner as the 2 in home button but then on the 5 T and the 6 it's been shifted to the back of the phone it's only on the 60 and the 60 McLaren Edition that you see a fingerprint scanner built into the display if you enjoyed this video I've got a ton of mystery unboxings on the channel as well as another interesting one coming so if you could subscribe for that it'll be amazing as always my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
