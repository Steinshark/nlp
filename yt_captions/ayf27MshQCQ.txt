foreign welcome back to another episode of talk Tech with 
Tiff in this episode I sat down with Yad who is   the managing director of sap Labs us and also to 
the global head of sap Innovation Center Network   in this conversation we really dive into what 
he is where him and his team are working on at   sap some future Technologies and career advice 
that he has all right let's get started [Music] welcome to talk Tech with Tiff the Silicon 
Valley Edition in this episode I sat down   with Yad Oren to talk about his 
career journey and also to the   latest Innovations they're working on at 
sap Labs alright let's get into it [Music]   well before we jump into your career Journey 
uh tell me a little bit about yourself and your   background yeah of course so I have two roles 
in sap I've been with the company for 18 years   now believe it or not uh one of the roles is 
managing a global Innovation unit it's called   sap Innovation Center Network okay where we 
are building the next big project recipe we   are looking in very Advanced Technologies many 
of them you can hear right here on the show floor   uh like chechi PT blockchain Quantum computings 
and many others interesting stuff and based on   those technology we find very interesting business 
problems that weren't Soviet and we try to build   new solution and coin debate with our customers 
to really shape the next generation of enterprise   software this is one world and the other role I'm 
also the managing director of sap labs in the US   where you know we have around 5000 developers here 
in the US and I try to really make the best out   of the region for the employees and sap you know 
how we are working with universities what kind of   talent we can bring in this region for the product 
all the way to day-to-day operation to make sure   everyone is a great place to work wow those 
are two big hats to fill I must say yeah it's   a fun job complaining but now on the personal side 
when we were speaking uh a few days ago virtually   you mentioned to me which which I gotta get into 
before we get into everything sap you you were in   a rock band or you are in a rock band yeah well 
I'm a frustrated frustrated musician right so   yeah I didn't um choose that I was finding myself 
going into technology yeah I went to busy College   actually I went to a music College yeah believe 
it or not and yeah I've always seen the condensed   we were almost famous right so it was really cool 
times uh I also went to engineering school right   and and indeed a couple of degrees there but 
yeah I always had a dream to become a musician   and today it's still a hobby I'm doing with my 
family right so this is something I'm very happy   and to be honest it's also helped me quite a lot 
during the career you will be surprised how many   artists and creative people we have here in the 
tech industry and I believe it's really helpful   to be Innovative as well so you're right I have 
this background yeah very proud of it I love that   you highlighted that it's so important to have 
interests outside of technology and all that   has to offer because through those interests you 
can really think of problems in a different way   or Solutions in a different way and just bring 
a lot of creativity to the table right that's   really interesting okay can we look up your band 
or is it well maybe some other time yeah because   honestly it was a really heavy Rock right so 
now wow but you could check my name if you find   something you know that it's funny because when I 
I tell you a very short story right when I met my   wife so I was a musician right and back then if 
you Googled my name right so you can find some   cool rock clips and images as time progressed and 
I release more computer science publication and   geeky blogs you know I become like in the page 
number three and four in Google so my wife tell   me what's happened to you when I met you used to 
be cool now everything is running so yeah so you   can find it but you need to be an archaeologist 
to do this to do it all right all right well   going back to your career at sap you you mentioned 
you've been with the company for over 18 years uh   first off that is incredible and as I was looking 
through your your LinkedIn and reading different   um uh blog posts and articles I know you have 
held within sap various different titles I   know from product manager software developer and 
then continuing to grow and when I see that and I   think with many people who are watching this see 
that one question that comes to mind is how were   you able or what advice would you give to finding 
success in each role because a lot of times they   are pretty different or are they yeah it's a great 
question it really depends what would you like   to achieve if you would like to specialize in a 
certain domain that you would like to be the best   developer for immersive Technologies right 
or the best Architects for blockchain based   solution then you should really focus on that and 
grow your skills to be the best in the industry   if you would like to become more like a general 
manager type right you need to start running the   gamut with few roles and really diverse your skill 
sets uh and this is the reason why you're right I   did I think almost any possible role in r d from 
development to product management to research   I even did some roles which are outside of the 
development units like I was in corporate strategy   and and this really helped you to have diverse 
skill set that can grow you into this kind of   more managerial position but it really depends 
on what you would like to achieve and then if   you would like to go to the more general manager 
role definitely try different things so you can   come well suited for them when you are starting 
out in your career you mentioned that trying these   different or wearing these different hats is super 
important to becoming a general manager did you   know when you were starting out your career that 
that was the path you wanted to go down or was it   more so at the time a mix of that with curiosity 
of different roles I actually knew it because I   always wanted to do this I have a desire for like 
a big operations right and derive large-scale   input yeah so also I have to say I was a developer 
I was in R D and and I was a nice developer one of   the best developer right I was one of the guys 
that actually for the more geeky audience you   know break the build right before the weekend and 
then you get the phone call you stuck all over so   I I think that becoming more of the generalist 
right and doing many things was also kind of   um I wouldn't say the last the only option that 
I have but definitely something that I thought I   can Excel more than becoming the best technology 
expert you know out there in one domain or others   so yeah I definitely wanted to do this and I have 
I think um really strong tendency to do things in   a large scale yeah I like that do things in a 
large scale for individuals who are watching   you know even myself when I was once again going 
back to your current role managing director head   of global Innovation Networks what is some advice 
you would give to others who maybe are starting   out in their career Journey maybe don't have as 
much direction as to where they want to go what   is some advice you could give to them I think 
we need to have a healthy curiosity right I   think while you are let's say younger in your 
early stage of your career definitely try many   things it's perfectly okay to fail and don't 
like like one role in another you know I tried   many things and some of the roles I mean you know 
help me to go to a different stage in my career   but definitely it's not something I wanted 
to continue to be this kind of domain expert   uh so you need to experiments you don't need 
to feel dead if you are not um first of all   if you're not fit the mold right just like I am 
I mean you don't see too many I think Tech and   Tech executive with a ponytail and a beard and 
a funny accent right with my background so you   need to be very authentic as well but also you 
need to experience anything there is no you know   I felt so many times right and I try my things 
and eventually you get into some sort of maturity   certain time of your life certain time of your 
career that you know and then it's like you get   into the orbits and things flowing from there yeah 
I love that and it's it really hits home for me   personally because when I was starting out in my 
career as a developer I thought the only way to   succeed would be if I was a specialist I thought 
oh I have to really focus in on one technology and   go really deep into that and of course that is an 
amazing career path for some people but I quickly   realized that I was leaning more to towards 
being a generalist you know I liked wearing   different hats I liked trying different roles 
out and different things like that so it's really   interesting to hear your your perspective and 
your journey through wearing many different hats   as well yeah and especially if you start managing 
what we call a p l profit and loss Revenue then   you better get some other roles and skill 
set you can also learn other things it's   very important to learn I also have an MBA 
right which was very helpful but I I truly   believe in true I'm a True Believer in trying 
many roles and bring some diversity to table   um so definitely yeah I mean there are many career 
paths but yeah yeah but I like the general manager   one yeah yeah I hear you on that going back to 
sap Labs us so I was on uh one of the the pages   for it and the projects that you are working on 
are really fascinating to me so I was wondering   if you could dive into one or a few projects 
that you're working on that you can share about   oh wow it's now now you you hear all your kids 
crying you know Daddy Daddy who is your favorite   one but definitely you know we have many of 
them I can share with you maybe two examples   so we do a lot of work in sap you know sap 
is one of the leading companies um for for um Enterprise Innovation Enterprise technology 
right and we have the leading solution in the   market for analytics and databases so we do a 
lot of projects about the future analytics right   and this is where we really are um obsessed with 
how customer will consume you know reporting and   insight and how will they drive their business 
so we work on one project called continuous   intelligence which is a self-learning machine 
it's like using really Advanced AI also chpt   to find anomalies to find you know bottlenecks in 
the organization without the need really to train   the system or to learn about it so we're not 
yet in the you know in The Terminator era when   you have General Ai and the Machine are um all um 
autonomous but definitely we're getting a lot and   we have many reference customers already talking 
about this it's a project called continuous   intelligence where the system learned by itself 
from your data and understands what kind of new   anomalies what kind of new insight you might want 
to see without even you you need to ask for it   or train the model so kind of self running system 
this is around the future of business um decision   the last example I will give you we also like a 
lot to see the future we see the future Maurice   collaborative between Enterprises like we call 
it we saw some example in the business in the   keynote about the business Network so the future 
of business collaboration is very important for   us and this is where we look into how hundreds 
and thousands of companies can collaborate within   themselves so we use blockchain where they can 
share identity without need to do long term long   onboarding authorization authorization process or 
how we can streamline any compliance of document   sending and do self-motorization how you can 
authorize your own legal document without the need   of Auditors this use blockchain technology and 
really help to streamline anything that help to   collaborate between companies without the burden 
of a lot of legal work a lot of authorization and   any cool stuff it's incredible I feel like we 
could take those two examples you just said and   have a another completely separate conversation 
around them because I just find them both super   fascinating and I'm going to put my questions 
for that on on ice or else I'm going to keep   you here forever but kind of on that note 
at an individual level at a personal level   learning technology and I think a lot of the 
viewers can relate to this learning technology   how quickly technology is is uh growing 
it's so fast it's hard it feels like it's   impossible to keep up with it at sap how 
do you ensure uh you're you're always so   ahead of the curve so Innovative how how do 
you ensure sap is always staying ahead yeah   it's a great question we have two things 
that we are doing and we encourage our   our team the first one is the constant learning 
and upskilling we heard also a great example   in the keynote how we're now using AI for having 
more personalized development plan for employees   but we are lucky that we have very curious and 
ambitious employees and they bring bottom down   as well many initiatives they look for but this 
is why also as we mentioned earlier it's very   important to be curious and keep this desire to 
learn otherwise you might be caught in something   that's becoming obsolete or something that is less 
Innovative so curiosity in constant Learning and   Development come from the employees but we also 
have a lot of Learning and Development program   and AI is a big factor how to even increase 
the reach of what we're doing the second thing   we learn a lot from our customers and this is a 
great opportunity where we are here in Sapphire   we do a lot of co-innovation you know our custom 
grave over sap is over half a million customers   right and we are lucky that they come to us first 
to share their problems to share sometimes their   data together and learn about what we can do 
in anonymized fashion and we learn new things   um about the word right it's something that we 
learn so much from our customer that we are lucky   and this is where honestly the outside in is very 
important channel for us to learn to that is such   a good point too to to learn right from your 
customers what their Pro they're facing their   challenges they are facing as well as external 
tools like AI you mentioned as well but it seems   throughout our entire conversation the theme has 
been stay curious and continue to learn which I   think is super important and have a hobby right 
and have a hobby yes exactly going back to you   mentioned blockchain you mentioned AI these are 
you know even cloud computing these are all really   trending Technologies and uh that have been 
around now for a while but are continuing to   get buzzwords or buzzed or spoken about where do 
you see and you touched on this a bit already but   where do you see these Technologies uh being used 
further at sap or in the world I think you know   to give you an example A lot of people are really 
wondering where AI will go in the next few five   years or ten years and I I know we can't predict 
the future but what's your thoughts around that   no I think it's it's a it's a good 
question it's on top of everyone's Minds so   AI will be dominant and it will be we're going to 
see another chapter of of game changing because   it's already changing out of the thing we're 
doing but definitely we can reach all the way to   an autonomous Enterprise right it doesn't mean you 
don't need the employees you just need to automate   fully all the manual work you can do and you can 
get questions and and answers for everything you   ask in a very fast way which open a new door for 
creativity and grow your business right so I think   it's definitely going to take a Lion's Share of 
all the activities we're doing in the organization   not today not tomorrow but it will come there and 
the employees will go through a risk killing where   they go into what we call more cognitive tasks 
tasks creativity Innovation growing the business   I can tell you already we see a lot in the HR in 
human resource how AI is automating a lot of work   looking into candidate resume which is a lot of 
you know any position could get one thousands of   CVS but those employees researching these resumes 
are you know they're not leaving the workplace   they're just moving now to develop the talent 
pipeline working with universities right coming   to new audience which is more kind of creative 
cognitive Talent work so this kind of thing will   go and I think it's a very good story because in 
the end of the day it's all about productivity and   I'm gonna say I'm not going to like you say we can 
spend the entire day here but you know just think   about the implication when you move the talent 
and innovation in healthcare or Food and Drug   admin kind of Supply chains right and other thing 
that can really help Humanity yeah it's incredible   and it's it's moving so quickly which is really 
exciting too yeah as someone who's very impatient   yet for someone who is watching this and wants 
to uh apply at sap because they're like I want   to have a similar career path to his or I 
want to work on these Technologies what is   some advice you would give to someone who wants 
to go through who wants to a apply and then maybe   is going through the interview process what does 
what characteristics or what stands out that you   see across all or most sap employees well I 
think the most important thing is actually   not related to the technology or the job itself 
I will really advise anyone who comes to a CP   or would like to apply to be authentic I mean we 
can talk all day about technology and business but   honestly sap is a cool company there are really 
cool and nice people we're really proud in this   and being authentic being curious like 
comments yourself to the interview it's   something that will never fail you and and of 
course you need some sort of domain expertise   in the area you apply to but you have so 
many roles Technical and non-technical and   we really appreciate people who are ambitious 
right and reliable and if this kind of futures   comes in the interview it's definitely in bonus I 
would even you know you know risk myself and say   that we are would like to take candidates that 
of course are excellent in everything they do   but at least it is important to meet people who 
are ambitious good people authentic reliable   and and this is what I'm I'm also honestly 
like a lot about about our company culture i   it is so true it's it's one of those things 
I you know this makes me think of a story for   when I was interviewing quite a few years back 
at a company and and I got hired there and it   was one of my first roles as a developer and the 
looking back baby he could have worded a little   bit better but it always stuck with me the uh who 
was my manager when when I got hired he called me   and he said you know we really uh appreciate 
you and your personality and your drive he's   like your technical skills maybe aren't where they 
should be but those can be taught but those those   skills that you're bringing with personal 
skills curiosity those are something that   you know you can bring to the table and the 
tech can can be taught I think that's kind of   it made me think of that from what you just 
shared too it's a very good point and maybe   I will add one more lines regarding what you 
asked earlier it's important if you want to   progress in your career for managerial role to 
work as much as possible with people you don't   have to manage people but you need to know how 
to work with people you need to know how you flex   your communication style people are very different 
right you know how you have different audience   that's right and it's it's and and you need to 
know how to deal with some happy moments and also   less happy moment and if you if you are a good 
people person definitely the chances you will be   promoted fast to manage your role and officially 
be responsible for people developing and grow   it's bigger so the people's skill is as equally 
important if not more for the technical skills   and I think your manager was a very smart 
person those are a little bit harder to   being to teach them than technology skills 
yes exactly exactly yet I always end these   conversations with the same question which is 
what advice would you give to your younger self   I guess besides besides buying Bitcoins selling in 
plenty okay now um I think one one thing that um   so I as I said I I tried many things I failed 
many things one thing that I would advise the   younger me is not looking into technology and 
doing technology for the sake of technology and   coolness which is something which I'm mumbling a 
little bit because it's very hard to tell people   who are you know just out of school and would like 
to build the next things in AI but sometimes we're   seeing so many smart people and I think I was 
one of this very excited young person that just   look at the technology it was so cool there was 
no business certification there was no problem   to solve there is nothing which is relevant for 
the customer but you can do an amazing thing you   can do an image recognition and you know hey this 
company offer image recognition that can identify   a cat 99.999 of the times I will do another nine 
and then so these things are exciting they take a   lot of work but sometimes the the value is notors 
of Technology exciting get excited but always try   to find a good business problem because especially 
in corporate right a good business value in the   end because this will help to scale the idea to 
take it to Market and grow it um so this is what I   would say and and then maybe even more of my ideas 
could find themselves into the into customer hands   yeah yeah I think it's so important and so true 
especially when you're you're uh starting out your   your career in technology you just there's so much 
exciting things going on that you just gravitate   towards that naturally but you also need to think 
too about the value that it's bringing and and   that's really where you will find uh purpose long 
term exactly yeah thank you so much for taking   time to connect with me it was really a pleasure 
um and I hope you have a wonderful rest your   day here at Sapphire thank you Tiffany for for 
having me and yeah enjoy Safar as well thank you [Music] thank you
