okay so don't freak out but I did spend a lot of time doing this we're probably gonna have to chat soon whoa boys because of legal reasons all I'm allowed to say right now is this do not believe what you're hearing online a Frasier okay reportedly found a cease and assist against coffee Zilla which is why I'm making this video to inform the boys Fraser's Law Firm that unfortunately I'm gonna miss the deadline boys now where it gets very very interesting is also the accudation servicing around what seems to be a former FaZe Clan manager known as Jordan Galen there's even more to this okay because Sam Pepper before any of this happened was involved in his own pump and dump Scandal and I say somebody investigates Sam Pepper on last week's mom's basement you know what that kid did Sam Pepper he privated his Twitter guys this has gone so beyond social media drama at this point like there's legal implications for these guys I'm sure one of these people making videos think that they know the truth and that they know who's responsible when they just don't all right guys welcome to the final part of our story on Save the kids taking a while we got here save the kids was a crypto charity coin as many of you know that turned out to be a scam it was promoted by some of the biggest influencers in the world and for the past few weeks barely sociable mudahar and myself have been working to uncover the truth of what happened this will be my final contribution to the story so far we've given everyone a lot in terms of evidence but I think it's time to zoom out a bit and so in this finale I'm going to try to make it so that everyone can understand it and see this whole thing for what it was and I'm gonna be trying to create using the best available information a narrative on what exactly happened who changed the anti-wail code who started the coin who's been writing these deals I'll do my best to answer all of those questions but bear in mind you have to understand that many of these people with key information aren't talking they're scared of law enforcement some of them might even be on the run and others are just simply lying to me but I'm not just here to talk about who's guilty I also want to clear up anyone who got caught up in this but anyways without further Ado let's get to the bottom of what is in my opinion the most complicated crypto scam of this year ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar Studio I'm your host coffee Zilla the internet detective and where we last left things we didn't know who the Mastermind was we had key players we also had some people who sold some save the kids token but didn't have a pattern of malicious selling and we also had a bunch of question marks unknown wallets and people who we really didn't know their level of involvement with this whole thing and some people we didn't know if they were relevant or not remember this guy named Manny seemed to be involved but we didn't know who that was and a lot has happened since that first video went live the first thing was that nearly right after I put it up I get hit up by none other than Manny and he said his whole role in this thing has been misunderstood he wasn't some big Mastermind he was just the connection guy yeah so me and Fraser were in this one group shot and uh it's a paid to get to pay to get in or you have like one million dollars in crypto and through there he asked yo I need a Dev and I'm like I have a Dev uh and that brings me to Lucas that was my role I I was hands off from there pretty much all right so we can kind of cross his name off it isn't a lot but it's a start there are a lot more names we have to check into so the next thing we did was hunt for more wallets of people who were involved and that's when we got pinged by one of the founders of moon portal remember this was one of the scams that was promoted by a lot of these so-called influencers and this developer told us that influencers ruined his project and because of that he decided to give us the wallets of several famous influencers who were involved in his pre-sale among them ricegum so this is it the alleged wallet it looks like on June 6th he got some money from the pre-sale and uh 30 minutes later he starts selling it off then he waits a couple hours and sells off the rest so after a few hours ricegum has seven kids to his name which based on the fact this guy's an ambassador of the project is a pretty scumbag thing to do however looking through his other token history this guy isn't a crypto Mastermind if I can be honest ricegum is from what I can see not smart even though he abandoned saved the kids seemingly at his early as convenience I'd put him more in a similar category as Jarvis or nikan who we talked about last time as selling off some of their save the kids token but not having a pattern of malicious selling I think that's really important as we go through this and pretty soon after we got this lucky break finding rice gum we got another lead when we heard that one of the influencers in involved Tico wanted to volunteer his wallet saying he had nothing to hide we of course took him up on that and here it is Tico's wallet now let me tell you up front Tico is probably the only person in this whole story I feel bad for because we have him on blockchain record putting in roughly forty thousand dollars worth of crypto in to save the kids token and then just not selling at all as you can see he bought some here uh he even bought more from pancake Swap and just held on to it as it tanked to basically zero which means that in all of this Tico seems to be the only one who actually wanted to help save any kids now as we were hunting for these other wallets we found something that we didn't expect see our plan was to trace back the scams as we had in the past and talk to some of the developers and among them we kept hearing a name pop up Jordan Galen and I want to say I didn't mention him in the first video because I had never ever heard of him before I didn't even know he was involved and save the kids but the more we explored projects Beyond just save the kids his name kept popping up as someone who is organizing these deals here for instance is a text from Jordan Galen to the moon portal team hey hazim I was telling Gabe that officially confirmed is Frasier Jarvis ricegum me waiting on official confirmation from Aiden and Banks and will Circle back shortly now this hazim he addresses I actually spoke to he filled me in on how all this worked apparently Jordan was the go-to guy on these guys behalf now to be clear you guys got a lot of these influencers by talking through Jordan right uh everyone or most of them other than Pomp and Ray J seems like a lot of influence who is this Jordan guy well according to his LinkedIn he is the senior talent manager at FaZe Clan and he admits he was brokering crypto deals for talent such as K Jarvis and the rest when I asked him about it he said quote this began with me answering emails that were sent into Fraser's inbox after a few of the deals I got in contact with a party who then brought in a bulk of the deals to me and that's it and you might be asking what did Jordan get out of all this well commission according to him and we were talking about Fraser's deals specifically here quote after Frasier was sent the money he sent me between 10 to 20 percent of what he got there was never formal conversations about commission since Fraser just always took care of me on every deal we did so it seems like Jordan galen's the guy going out there getting the deals negotiating the terms and this is later sort of confirmed when we found such a deal in negotiation it actually fell through so it never happened but it gives you an idea of the numbers we could be talking about here K was supposed to promote something called ape Haven token and at the time they were negotiating to be paid over half a million dollars of which 150 000 would have been part of a giveaway to promote the coin which would have put Jordan's commission at around 40 to 80 thousand dollars with Kay's cut being three hundred and fifty thousand dollars which isn't bad for a few tweets and a little promotion and we actually obtained footage of this negotiation taking place we're super excited to get started um Frazier's ready to kind of start formulating and drafting his tweets for tonight now this negotiation goes on for a while of when these tweets are going out but I noticed that Jordan Galen was doing most of the talking and later the call is wrapped up rather strangely oh yes yeah we're down we're down to go now man we're going to the Moon tonight and then we started going over to Mars and we get all the way to Pluto let's do it I'll see you there now unfortunately since this deal did not work out we don't know if they made it to Pluto or not but we know how these deals were getting to K and others Jordan was hunting them down but not just for phase members for others like ricegum as well this brings up kind of an important question if a talent manager for FaZe Clan was involved did FaZe as an organization know about this I've spoken extensively to everyone I could about this starting with FaZe Banks he immediately denied any knowledge and after hearing what Jordan Galen had done FaZe Clan promptly fired him I asked Jordan Galen if any of these deals had crossed FaZe Clan's desks and he responded quote no I didn't bring in the deals through the paths I usually did and was working with Talent directly there were no agreements so there was nothing ever to send phase legal to review nor did FaZe get any Financial cut on these deals this corroborates what he'd tell me later Jordan told me quote there were no contracts either now given all of this I'm comfortable saying phase as an organization didn't know what was going on with these crypto deals because it kind of doesn't make sense if phase knew they'd want a piece of the pie and the other part of this is that if they knew they probably would have vetoed it because why risk in a hundred million dollar plus brand for a 40 Grand payout over here or there you know it just it doesn't make sense but if you're a talent manager who's looking to get paid a little bit on the side I don't know I think that just makes a little bit more sense that way and this doesn't mean that I'm I endorse phase or I'm I'm phasing up or whatever I've just I've seen so much Flack online that this whole thing is a phase conspiracy and how phase new and all this kind of stuff and from what I've seen that simply isn't true but okay if phase the organization didn't know who did know somebody had to put this thing together who was left after we check off box after box well three people seemed to me to be at the heart of this Fraser K who sent me a cease and assist letter shortly after my second video you have Sam Pepper who lived with K and has been known in the crypto industry for a while now as someone who constantly shills worthless coins and of course Jordan Galen a rogue manager running crypto deals and here's what I wanted to know okay they're running this crypto game for a while where they post about a coin get a bunch of money immediately sell it delete the posts but how long was this pump and dump type scheme happening how far did it really go for this I had to go deep on the blockchain so I spent several late nights tracking down every transaction I could and trying to get to the bottom of this thing and what I found out was that this thing went deeper than I ever could have imagined okay so don't freak out but I did spend a lot of time doing this I know how insane it looks it looks like I'm about to bring up Carol from HR okay but I'm not this is genuinely the best way to visualize what we've found here we mapped out the blockchain crypto transactions between three people we know about okay we have Jordan Galen and we have Sam Pepper and we mapped these out in order to find out where their connections are so let me tell you how this works in pink are the altcoins and purple are the main wallets so here we have Frasier's main wallet right here we have Jordan galen's main wallet and up here Sam Pepper's main wallet and I also threw in Jarvis over here in order to show you guys the difference between a normal wallet and the rest of these guys so over here it's just one wallet and it's connected to three things save the kids Doge Elon and Jordan Galen comparatively look at someone like okay he's tied to nearly everything different wallets different crypto coins he's moving money between different accounts like for instance this whale wallet for K and what we've done is color coded each wallet we believe these guys control okay for instance we colored in light brown the wallets Weebly Jordan controls in light blue and the wallets that Sam Pepper controls in green all in order to give you a better understanding of their operations and the reason we went through all this trouble is because if I sat here and walked you through each and every transaction you'd get lost because it wasn't always their main wallets doing the sketchy business here's a small example see Ox E40 here Fraser funded it on May 7th by sending 5.1 BMB from his main wallet that wallet then bought Pluto which Frazier promoted and then this wallet sent that Pluto back to two different wallets one of them is Fraser's main wallet and another one is a wallet he's linked to ox881 both of these wallets then immediately dumped that Pluto but if I explain that to you with just wallet numbers and just in transactions it's easy to get confused but with this map we can see how they're linked and ultimately it isn't about one transaction or another that's not the point the point is that these people aren't amateurs so if they try to come out and tell you that they thought this was just like any other brand deal or they didn't know what they were doing or they're new to crypto it's just not true this scheme is incredibly complicated K and Sam Pepper both have wallets the way a janitor has keys and I believe they use them to hide the full scope of what they were doing and the question is of course why if you're not trying to cover something up why have 5 10 20 wallets why shuffle your money around like you're playing a game of three card auntie I think the answer is obvious and what's also clear is that K and Sam Pepper they worked closely together because with things like Moon Pub we've previously discussed how K made roughly a hundred thousand dollars from it but pepper was also involved over here and the other thing we learned is that Jordan Galen over here he seems to be instrumental in finding these deals 4K he has less wallets than either one of these guys but he was key to getting these deals done for example hazim the moon portal developer we've heard from earlier told me that when he reached out to k k insisted on having Jordan involved uh he was actually the first one I reached out to and he said that we had to have a conversation with Jordan president so we hopped on a group call together okay so we know Jordan is tied up with K and Sam Pepper and K are working closely together and basically they would run these crypto deals some times in their main wallets sometimes not they promote these coins dump these coins and then delete the posts but now that the stage is set now that we've found out how this all work we're almost ready to save the kids but first I want to clear up something from the last video in mudahar's last video we had highlighted some of the problems with these token giveaways where some of the giveaways seem to go to wallets linked to K for example this wallet which won three of Fraser K's giveaways in a row in the exact giveaway amounts we also highlighted when Fraser announced a giveaway for the token MILF quote I'll give 500 to a random person in 24 hours who likes this tweet good luck and not Financial advice now who was the one person who got paid in MILF token in that 24-hour period it was Jordan Galen and we said at the time this looks like giveaway fraud but Jordan was adamant that no such giveaway fraud had happened that this was his commission fee he told us not giveaway winnings which fair enough call it commission call it whatever you want the fact is Jordan immediately sold that MILF token right after as Kay was tweeting and hyping up these tokens now with that short correction out of the way and now that you understand the key players and their history with crypto let's talk about save The kids all three of these guys Kay Galen and Sam Pepper bought into the presale but were they all equally responsible who's in charge well as I was trying to figure it out someone who I wasn't expecting suddenly reached out we're probably gonna have to chat soon whoa boys okay sorry I had to move we had to go back in front of the screen for this um obviously when I saw this my mind was blown we've been trying to get a hold of this guy like forever he's one of the key players here so immediately I respond hey got time now and then I gave them some contact information and then for probably I don't know five minutes I just see these three bubbles that are killing me and my heart is just like pounding because this guy could be the key to this whole thing this whole save the kids thing he's maybe the missing link but then he replies sorry mate moving all this means the house closed down and everything will most likely be next week keep this between us until then I don't want to create any unnecessary drama until we fully get to talk start to finish of what happened I gotta tell you guys being this close to it this deep in the investigation and almost getting this guy to talk only to be pushed off was just killing me and because at this point we have to play a waiting game right but we did learn something it seems like whatever friendship him and K had seems to have disintegrated because moving out of Kay's house where they lived meant they wouldn't be working together anymore but while I waited for a response for him to get back with me I got sent an anonymous email that caught me off guard in it was a recorded call with Lucas the developer you guys should remember him from the last episode he designed the save the kids project code he also changed the whale code but said he was just doing that because he was told to coffee this is what I was told to do I'm a com contracted I I don't know what to tell you and in this new recording he finally points the finger at who told him to change that whale code this is a big argument between the devs to change the code and the dev's trying to not wind choose the code always explain why this is 24 hours are necessary um but there is a behind the scenes manager who mainly pushed this this is Sam's pushing trying to argue with the devs that the uh the coach should have been changed so it was a lot less limiting whoa so Sam Pepper was the one behind the whale coat change I asked Lucas myself and he confirmed it now full disclosure I think the email containing that video about pepper is from K just anonymously now I have no hard proof of that but the tone of the email sounded like it was from K or his team and it's worth knowing that as we move forward because later it emailed me a bunch of really personal information about pepper like literally a photo of Sam Pepper seeming like he was just going out to his car or something like he was being watched without his knowledge by some kind of a private investigator but regardless whoever was sending me this information was pretty obvious that I wasn't the only one investigating Sam other people wanted to know what he was up to as well and then then I got another email I know lots of emails here this time from an ex Sam Pepper fan who invested in the coin himself through Sam Pepper he showed me that Sam was actually part of the promotion of this coin because he ran his own version of the pre-sale list this is a list of people Sam Pepper got to put in money and got them save the kids before the public could ever get involved now I analyzed what these people did with their coins and it turns out a huge proportion of these guys dumped their coins three to four hours after launch which may have been part of the cause for why the coin got rocked but at this point I'm thinking Sam clearly played a hand in the rug pool in this whole thing turning out to be a scam but right as I was thinking that he was responsible for everything suddenly we get a response from Sam Pepper it's long and full of PR so let me give you the important part I've been a paid consultant to K for two years I took orders from him and had no Authority pretty independent of him everyone knows that K does what he wants and doesn't do anything he doesn't want to do even if others want him to do it everyone knows that too the name concept and aspects of save the kids coin were Kay's idea and he chose and assembled team members he controls that's what K does okay obviously we have to take this with a huge grain of salt coming from pepper because everyone's playing this like PR game at this point but what if there is some truth to this was K behind save the kids token launch I mean he made himself seem like another Ambassador but what if he's the one who launched it then I get sent this picture from Sam Pepper to confirm what he's saying it's a message from K on May 21st founder of coin market cap heard I'm starting this and reached out to call me later wow now pay attention to these dates here because this is important this was allegedly sent on May 21st when 2021 and presumably he's talking about save the kids here because when you go look up the domain for Save the kids guess when it was created May 20th a day before so a day after this savethekids.io website is created right here K is contacted by the founder of coin market cap now I reached out to Kay to try to confirm the screenshots existence because obviously I don't trust Sam Pepper as far as I can throw them but Kay didn't respond but even without all this right everything does seem to point at K starting this coin we know that he's the one who brought on Lucas the developer we know he used Manny's connections we also know he brought on Sam Pepper to mod this thing up and you know what else this giant pre-sale wallet that everyone's been sending money to this one right here it looks like K might control that too it was active after the pre-sale money was sent and even sent twenty thousand dollars to an address linked to K all of this evidence points to K at least being the creator of this coin but it doesn't take away from the fact that it seems to be pepper who doomed the coin by changing the whale code and of course where does uh our good buddy Jordan Galen fit into all this we know that he's been facilitating a lot of these deals but unsave the kids his role does seem to be a little bit more low-key he seemed less involved he initially insisted that he had nothing to do with the coin quote I want to be abundantly clear I had nothing to do with the development organization of talent marketing or anything to do with save the kids going I responded why are you lying and then sent him a screenshot showing him trying to onboard a popular YouTuber on to save the kids this text is from Jordan himself quote hey great to be connected one of the talents I represent face K is one of the lead ambassadors for a new crypto token launch save the kids we would love to get this person involved now I'm not showing their name because they decline the deal and I don't want to just drag them into drama for no reason but the point is he clearly was working on some of the organization of talent now when I showed him this Jordan backpedal he said if I tried to have anyone be part of the project it would be because either Sam or Fraser requested I reach out to a talent to see if they were interested but I am being very genuine when I say to you that I did not have any involvement and I'm not lying to your face interesting Jordan would later tell me that this is the only person that he approached with this deal so make of that what you will going back to the wallet map I think a picture is starting to emerge here given our available facts a story of what happened so here is in my opinion what what happened with save the kids token given all this new evidence I think all three of these guys were doing this crypto thing for a while where early dumps meant big profits Jordan is uh the deal guy we've got Sam Pepper and we've got Fraser K being more of the crypto people and then one day Along Comes K and he decides you know what I want to start my own charity coin so he gets a bunch of big influencer friends on board using him and his manager Jordan galen's connections then at some point Sam Pepper is brought in on the team maybe to mod this thing up which seems to have been a critical mistake maybe Kay thought that because Sam Pepper and him lived together his friend would act different for his project and not rug the coin I don't know but then Sam Pepper starts selling off a bunch of save the kids token to his own gang of people and he receives in exchange a small fee of one BNB from many of these wallets which he immediately even sends to his main wallet meanwhile K is working on promotion and gets several famous influencers this of course Hypes up all of their fans who get their wallets ready for the big day but right before launch we have Sam Pepper who approaches Lucas the developer with the idea of changing this whale code Lucas says that he was just following orders and makes the change and all of this Dooms save the kids token from the very start then comes the day of launch this project is supposed to be unruggable but immediately the project gets rugged as sellers take advantage of Sam Pepper's code change and then the price collapses Sam Pepper's group seems to be one of the first to fully jump ship four hours in they were completely out K isn't any better he started selling 40 minutes after launch and continues selling until 24 hours later he's out too out of what looks like to be his project that he started in the first place Jordan Galen also abandoned the project early he sold off within about six hours Kay's influencer friends who shot this embarrassing promo well they also sold some or all of their tokens really quick all except for Tico of course who didn't sell any but with all of this cell pressure the result is obvious the project collapses all the while the fans of these guys are dumping money into a product that never had a chance except wait that isn't the full story there's a bit more and I'm sorry for adding this in it's 6 a.m on video launch day and I am still getting new information on the Fallout of the story so I'm just gonna have to shove this in somewhere real quick because I've just found out that Sam Pepper fled to the U.S to go back to the UK here's the evidence first I found a new photo of Sam Pepper in the UK you gotta appreciate the shirt he's wearing that says paranoid nice Sam now of course you might say just because he's in the UK doesn't mean he's fling the country could be coincidental travel and that's true but here's another piece of information you should consider Sam Pepper had a white Tesla Model 3 lease a fact that was told to me by the person that I believe was working 4K and was basically stalking Sam Pepper remember they're the ones who emailed me a really weird photo of Sam now they had told me that Sam sold his Tesla to a CarMax location in Escondido California right here now the problem is of course I don't trust K and they didn't give me much to go on just a license plate number which I confirmed was Sam Peppers but after days of searching I couldn't confirm or find at Carmack not only that when I approached pepper he denied it I told him I'm hearing from Anonymous sources that you've sold basically everything including your car is that true he says what lol the conspiracies are getting out of control I said you didn't sell your Tesla to CarMax he responds I am completely lost to what you're on about but eventually the truth of course came out I had an acquaintance in the car industry call these CarMax locations and get confirmation that Sam Pepper did have a lease on that white Tesla Model 3 and that he did sell it because we found his car at the muriata CarMax location which is a 33 Mile Drive North of where we first heard he sold it here's our call confirming that and it's actually a Murrieta Murrieta California and here it is on their website we found this with the stock number we were given it's the same then as Sam Pepper's car meaning he really did break his lease about a year early it's not yet available yet because of how recently it was sold so why sell your car why leave the country and why lie about it well obviously I have my theories but Playing devil's advocate you might say maybe this is just all coincidence right you know that Sam happened to travel to UK right after save the kids he was deleting posts right after save the kids and privated his Twitter account right after save the kids and ended his car lease early right after save the kids and then lied about that fact maybe it's just all coincidence but in my opinion it looks like Sam Pepper is fleeing the United States to escape legal accountability for what happened but I asked him about this and he of course denies this categorically he said you're very dramatic I've been waiting for kova to be in a place where I can travel UK just released its mass mandate and I haven't seen my family in years several years I private by Twitter as I'm not tweeting about crypto right now and as there's clearly drama with influencers talking about coins Etc I have hundreds of thousands of people who can still see it and if you're saying that I deleted tweets then you can see that too not much hiding or running going on there I get that the storyline would further your story and make more of an interesting angle but it factually isn't the truth now worth noting he did not address the lie about selling his Tesla or the fact he sold it at all but I'm gonna just have to let you guys decide what the truth is did Sam flee the UK or was this all part of a a regular trip to visit the family he hasn't seen in several years but anyway guys that's the new evidence now back to a more well-rested coffee Salah all in all that seems to be the story of save the kids token I approached Sam Pepper Frasier K and Jordan Galen with my account of the events and where I could I've added in their side of the story but besides that I think something worth mentioning is the only person who shared even the slightest bit of her Rhett so far was Jordan Galen who responded to a question of whether he felt remorse and told me absolutely at the time I was doing what I felt would make Frasier and the Talon happy I didn't want to upset anyone by not helping so I helped get on some calls and negotiate deals and one thing led to the next now this obviously isn't the world's best apology but coming from the guy who probably had the least to do with save the kids of these three people it's at least something you know K meanwhile has dodged all responsibility and tried to pin it on Sam Sam in turn has tried to pin it all on K saying he's the Mastermind the reality is without the other one this would have never happened without K creating and hyping up this worthless coin this could have never happened and without Sam changing the whale code last minute this also could have never happened and the irony to me is that before this falling out these guys were clearly working together in crypto involved in the same coin so don't let them fool you as they try to you know point point the finger at the other one there's plenty of blame to go around for both of them so there you go that's the story of save the kids oh and since I know everyone's gonna be asking me about how much money everyone made let me just get through this real quick I I just have no clue I thought I did when I had just one wallet per person but now that there's like 20 wallets finding an exact number unless you're like a forensic accountant is next to Impossible given how convoluted all these wallet transactions can get you guys saw the board but what I can tell you is that it wasn't a lot not on Save the kids at least pepper probably made the most money since he sold the earliest but the real money to me seems like it was made earlier for these guys back when Kay and pepper were on the same team running these crypto deals Moon pug Pluto eclipsed tits coin safe Galaxy I think this is where these guys made their real money we know already that these deals could easily net six figures for them so they could be millionaires from this by by now and it's crazy to think that if save the kids had never happened we wouldn't know the extent of these other stories we wouldn't know how these influencers have been taking advantage of their fans and obviously it goes beyond K and pepper right like just how many influencers have done this deleted their tweets and gotten away with it it's crazy to think about but hopefully this Series has shown people that a we need regulation in crypto for these promotions and B once it's on the blockchain it's forever so if you are an influencer who thinks that you can delete some tweets and never get caught you might be wrong about that we will eventually find you and we will expose you and hopefully eventually maybe the cops will pay attention to what's going on here I don't know like the FBI SEC does somebody else needs to get involved in this besides me I'm just going to be straightforward with you guys because I'm about to go crazy watching all this stuff uh unfold so hopefully it's not just me finding you and exposing you hopefully leads those guys because I'm kind of tired of looking at the blockchain for now anyways I think that's basically it for me I'm gonna go take a long nap probably drink a lot I'm out of here see ya I know what you mean [Music]
