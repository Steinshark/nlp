they will find themselves once again in a world of Gins and fairies and intermediary beings you're seeing a lot of people talk about re-enchantment people taking mushrooms talking about all these beings that they meet and everything and I think that that's the future if you want to know what the future is that's it but it's not that great of a future it's scary because without order without the logos ordering that world for us then it's a very scary and dangerous world to walk through but I really remember the int experience of having been a Christian a believing Christian and then in a very short period of time entering into what you might call a re-enchanted [Music] world this is Jonathan pedo welcome to the symbolic world so hello everyone this is Sarah from Hamilton and today I'm very excited to have Jonathan Pou back on the channel uh my last video with Jonathan was one of the most viewed long form videos on this channel so I know people got a lot out of it and I definitely did as well so welcome back it's great to see you again s always great to talk to you you too so I want to talk today about a lot of things really but I'm going to start by returning to this theme of universal history which you've produced a huge amount of content on and I want to connect that a little bit to your recent work on Snow White and so let me just ask you this question what is the connection between the universal history of real quote unquote Nations Ethiopia America Israel uh and uh unreal or or fictional narratives how do those two things intersect and what does that mean for the significance of symbolism in Universal history well what happens I think the way to understand is that what happens with universal history in some ways is that the way that things are remembered at the origin especially at the origin of something they tend to have a certain form they tend to contract towards in certain directions towards something we could call mythological storytelling which is that the the the become more and more condensed and uh you know you find things that we don't usually find in everyday life when you look especially the further you go back into the past so if you look at early uh Chronicles it's always like Giants and dragons and you know hybrid Kings and all of this stuff that seems a little crazy to us um and I think that studying fairy tales can help us understand why it is that things get remembered that way and why and what importance they have some of the images and some of the tropes have an analogical coherence you could say that that can help us understand why our Universal histories look the way they do um and then to some extent also why those patterns happen in scripture as well similar patterns as to what happened in the fairy tales of course in scripture we're talking about a different level of reality we don't want to comp we don't want to compare scripture and fairy tales too much but to some extent we can in the sense that they they seem to capture similar themes uh as the the fairy tale seem to capture similar themes that what you find especially in the Old Testament yeah and what do you mean there's been a recent um I've noticed uh Focus uh from a lot of different people on this idea of you know a haunted universe or a universe which is more populace than um then then we're familiar with thinking of it um and I know reading ST perero it was very interesting to me there's a story um where someone is talking to him and he's asking him uh you know are is there life on other planets are there aliens and he says why are you even asking me about life on other planets do you know just how much stuff there is around us right now that you no idea exists and and I just thought that was so interesting because St perero is one of those Saints who has you might say relatively unique spiritual gift in that he was able to see um lots of different things in the material world and the non-material world which aren't accessible to us or even to a lot of other Saints um and that was just fascinating to me in terms of this new kind of excitement a relatively new excitement about a more populous universe so yeah when we talk about fairy tales obviously we're talking in part about fairies so do you think that at what point do we say that um there is kind of a genuine concrete reference to beings that we might call fairies yeah so let me back up a little bit and try to I think kind of contextualize what's happening in terms of this new interest in like you said a more populous Universe you know one of the things that happened of course in 19th century materialism was the evacuation of agency in the cosmos uh as Superstition right the idea that that every time you see agency in the cosmos or that you see other Consciousness acting in the cosmos um it's just Superstition and and projection you know that's the type of word they use but that type of thinking this materialist type of thinking was never trying didn't come to the point of trying to account for our Consciousness and our agency and they were just ignoring it as this kind of blind spot from a point of view where they looked on the world with that agency and consciousness but then but then use their reason and their agency and Consciousness to evacuate the rest of the universe of agency and Consciousness and so I think that we've come to a point where even a lot of scientists and a lot of you know especially scientists that study cognition they're realizing that this is a ridiculous position to stand in it's a ridiculous position to ignore the categories of Consciousness when we're literally using those categories to evacuate the cosmos of Consciousness so I think that's the point where we where we've come to where now there are people very reasonable you know people that aren't Christian that are atheists or secular or all kinds of people that are willing and in some ways realize that using categories of agency and Consciousness to understand certain phenomena is actually more useful than the kind of cold analytical description that that they're used to especially for understanding social movements for understanding kind of large scale uh uh Transformations using things like agency to explain those you know what people use the term egregor they use different you know they use things like emergence words like emergence in some ways it doesn't matter to us at the outset what word they use but they're noticing something like intelligent patterns kind of coming back and manifesting themselves on the world so once you've crossed that threshold and this is the the funny thing that a lot of people don't realize once they cross that threshold and they ride that out uh consistently they will find themselves once again in a world of Gins and fairies and and intermediary uh beings and I think that that you're seeing a lot of people talk about re-enchantment you know you have broad Dreer I've just read an article by Mary Harrington today that tries to talk about re-enchantment people taking mushrooms talking about all these beings that they meet and everything and I think that that's the future if you want to know what the future is that's it but it's a scary it's not that great of a future it's scary because without order without the logos you know ordering that world for us then it's a it's a very scary and dangerous world to walk through so I think that fairy tales are a way to help people re accustom themselves with these types of of of patterns it was really interesting to me that you just mentioned the danger of meeting these things apart from the logos and then mention Fairy Tales again because I remember in that ous strength which is called a modern fairy tale or a fairy tale for grown-ups That Hideous Strength has this wonderful scene where um Jane encounters Venus um and she goes into her room and she sees this Burning woman and it absolutely terrifies her and uh when she goes to Ransom and talks about it uh he tells her well you've met Venus but you've met Venus kind of naked you've met her apart from M or Christ in the story and I think that idea really rolls together with a lot of things we read about in scripture especially I think in Galatians where the what life looks like outside of Christ is you are enslaved or subjected to these Powers which are external to you you are considered just as kind of a part of a kind of wild world whereas in Christ humanity is really born so that Humanity stands um you know in relation to the world as its Lord master and bridegroom because of the Incarnation of the word who structures all of these different things so I know that's a you know no I think you're you're you're totally right and you know you can we can talk about it in different ways especially for people who might struggle to understand this because you know obviously when you say something like that as as you and I who've been thinking about this forever it just makes sense when secular people hear something like that they just hear woo they just like see the the wildness and craziness and so you know one of the things that I've been trying to to do is obviously to bridge these two worlds that people understand what the hell we're talking about and I think that you know understanding for example virtues and vices you know it's a it's a completely traditional Christian way to help people understand how agency acts on us and how depending on how we approach certain agencies that are acting on us and through us then they can either be liberating and pointing towards Christ or they can they can simultaneously be you know tyrants that rule over us you know and so if you think of a of a of of a that they have a virtue like courage you know that is that is definitely a virtue if it's pointed in the right direction if you're courageous for the right reasons that but then the same virtue can become a kind of pride ful you know irascibility that will then that can trap you and that can make you a slave if it's not pointed towards something higher if it's not pointed to something it kind of traps you that's what Dante for example tries to show in his Divine Comedy which is that you know anything that is not that not aiming up and always kind of giving itself up towards higher and higher Goods can become a vice and that's what we see in the falia you know it's like the vices and the virtues are basically the same thing that that depending on how they're treated will will uh will either be something like a you know Angelic transport towards God or a demonic kind of uh rule over you and so this is it's more than that it's not just virtues obviously it it is actual agencies that can rule over you but I think that to help secular people using the language of Virtues is a way to to at least help them see a little bit through this so they don't think we're just like in a Marvel Universe with like Gods floating in the heavens that are just you know like this kind of weird materialist Ghostbuster type of spirituality that people uh you know immediately go to yeah and and um I think that's a really good point I want to invite you all to the very first symbolic World Summit over 3 days we will finally meet in real time in real space and everyone from this little corner of the internet will be there to explore the theme of reclaiming the cosmic image of course I will be speaking but there will also be Martin Shaw who is an amazing mythographer father Steven D young of Lord of spirit Fame there will be Richard Roland from the universal history series Vesper Stamper Nicholas kotar and Neil de gr that you've all seen on my channel here and there for entertainment we have everyone's favorite apocalyptic band The One and Only dirt po Robins this event will be the chance of a lifetime to capture and embrace our current moment so join us from February 29th to March 2nd 2024 in Tarpon SP Florida visit the symbolic world.com Summit for more information and I will see you there and part of what has interested me you know since I mean it's now become something of a you know a buzzword for certain people but I really remember the intense experience of having you know been a Christian a believing Christian and then in a very short period of time entering into what you might call a re-enchanted world where all of these things which formerly would have an intuition of implausibility had exactly the inverse intuition so that you know before if I read a typological pattern in history I would say oh someone's fudging the details yeah and then afterwards if I read a typological pattern in history that's like oh well this is more likely to be true than not because this is just the way the world Works um so what what you just said there reminded me of one of those questions that I've had for a long time which is um in a lot of circumstances why does the occult quote unquote seem to work um and let me just kind of throw a theory at you and then see what you have to say so my idea about this if you just think about what the occult is it works through speech incantations and you use incantations to alter and change things so you know God makes the world through the word you know he's speaking throughout the six creation days then he makes Man In His Image I.E man is the speaking creature God speaks to man God a man can speak back to God in other words and then man reconstitutes and changes the world through that speech well I think what the occult is or at least a lot of it what it really is is it takes that principle that nature that human beings are tied to the world in such a way that their speech will alter and change things and it severs it from its archetype the super nature which is the basis for its existence and so what is going on in the occult versus what is going on in Chris Christi prayer well in a certain way there's an analogy between the two in that both are trying to influence the world in one way or another when I'm praying for someone to get well you know I'm submitting the will to God but I am trying to get them well by the means of prayer and I think what happens in prayer is we take our will our intentions our desires and we seek to affect them in the world but we always bring them through the crucified Christ so that we say not my will but thy will be done and what that does is it perfects our intentions so that they can be realized with the maximum goodness whereas if a person does not transmit their will through Christ this is incredibly dangerous because they say oh I want more money but they don't have a sufficient understanding of the nature of what money is and everything else with which it is connected so that when they realize their intentions in the world without transmitting them through the logos who is the archetype of all things they get all this other stuff along with it that they weren't expecting because they don't have the comprehensive knowledge of the nature that the logos himself has so I think when you look at you know the occult and the ceremonial nature of it in a certain way it is a parody of the Liturgy because the Liturgy is where we rule over the world that is where we enter into Christ's throne room and there it looks like that but even for a person who doesn't believe in God or Christ even for people who are interested in practicing it there's something creepy about it there's something that's wrong I mean I think that's CS Lewis talks about that you know when he was a younger man interested in the occult not a Christian something was just off about it it seems to be detached from its actual end yeah I think I think your inside is absolutely right that's what it is so the way to kind of understand it is for normal people to think about this is that the the idea that you use ritual language and incantation in order to modify reality is actually something that you do every day all the time right it's like if I if I ask my contractor and I signed a contract with my contractor to build my house I'm using language meaning and ritual in order to get my house built and so I'm not building my house right someone else is doing my will for me through through through an incantation and uh and a ritual signing of a document so that the contractor will then build my will my house for me right so it's something that we actually do all the time so first of all we have to be a little cautious about freaking out too much like about some of this stuff right but we should freak out because the difference between me asking getting signing a contract with my contractor to build my house and an occultist is that the occultist is conscious spiritually conscious of the mechanisms by which things manifest themselves in the world he understands that you are invoking certain principle IP alties and certain realities in order to get things done in the world but they are trying to utterly weaponize spiritual principles in order to get their will to be done by ignoring the way in which it connects to the highest good and to to to to God right and so the truth is that sometimes I'm doing that all the time in my life now right it's like I'm sinning all the time because I'm hungry and I want to eat and so I'll ask my son to go to the store and get me a chocolate bar or whatever and in that way I'm doing all that stuff but it's it's kind of unconscious it's it's not it's not great but it's it's it's kind of unconscious but when you become conscious of it then the sin becomes much greater because you know what you're doing you know what type of action you're posing and what what type of let's say misdirected power that you're using in order to accomplish your goals and that's why like you said that's why it ends up looking more ritualized that's why it ends end up being more like liturgy because it's people that are more aware of the mechanisms of reality and because of that should be more let's say more aware of how they should ultimately you know participate in a in a true liturgy which is submitting their will to God and then through that you know submitting their will and the wills of things around them to God so that God's God's will can transform everything uh but but it's hard it's hard because people to think like well how why would that work like why would you know saying some incantation uh why would you know doing some procession work and it's only because they don't understand that they do it all the time and just because they can they can recognize the mechanical causes that is bringing about the change that somehow now they they believe in it but but you know when a when a politician let's say makes a kind of statement on television about what needs to happen you know or or or some kind of thought leader and then it happens in the world they are not aware of the mechanical causes by which it's happening they don't they don't know who's going to instantiate it or who's going to make it happen but it still changes the world and so it's those types of understandings that the occultists are trying to weaponize towards their will and in some in a stranger way and in a more subtle way it's something similar to that that we understand that if we address our prayer to God and we submit our will to God then the greatest transformation for the greatest good is happening as we're doing that so what do you think of uh of the global Consciousness project I don't know what that is what's the global Consciousness project Global Consciousness project sounds Eerie to me it's it's so it's been a while since I've looked at it but what it is is they um set up around the world true random number number generators which are really actually hard to do because getting genuine Randomness and not just a really complicated pattern uh takes a lot of doing a lot of computer power and so they set up these random number generators around the world and it's going to just Generate random numbers obviously and then what they do is they look for patterns in it and they see if that's correlated with major events in um you know world affairs and so in like massive divination project here yeah so they what they did is they I think it's was set up in the 9s and then they uh just looked at the data set in like September 11th 2001 and uh they argued that the numbers become less and less random because there's a genuine kind of physical significance to human attention being focused at the same thing in other words that reconstitutes the actual structure of the world in some mysterious with Rel ative to our present state of knowledge uh way so assuming uh for my viewers it's been a while since I've looked at this I'm not going on in on the legitimacy of this but assuming that that data set is actually true how would you interpret that in light of what we were just saying yeah I think there are two things like like divination is obviously is GNA say Obviously well I it's obviously a real thing divination is practice in every culture all the time from the beginning of time there's I don't think there's such a thing as a culture that doesn't have some form of divination even within the Bible there are there's divination the the the famous Ur and thumim you know there they were divination uh things you have Joseph who has a cup for divination that he hides in his brother's uh bag and you know even in the New Testament you have the discip the the apostles drawing Lots in order to decide who the next the next Apostle is going to be these are divination these are div divination mechanisms now I think you're right and and the idea is that there's a there's a relationship between intention and question as a frame right you you can understand it that way it's like you're framing reality you're looking at reality for a reason and when you look at reality for a reason then out of indefinite potential right out of the the chaos tohubohu chaos that is still I think believe underlying all of real you know forms will will come up because it's like it's it's it's analogous to When God Says calls forth and says to the Earth bring forth you know identities and then then he sees them and then and then you know man participates in naming them so I think that's that's actually how it works now there are obviously also reasons why divination is is prohibited in Scripture because because it is very it is dangerous the question is why are you doing that that's I think that's the biggest question it's like why are you doing that are you doing that because you want to try to if you're doing that because you want to try to predict the future in the kind of Base way if you're doing that usually people do that stuff because they want to get rich really like you know they they they want to guess the numbers for the lottery or some kind of nonsense like that and so you can understand that when humans look for that type of power they're often doing it for for they're more than often you know just doing it for the wrong reasons and also the other problem I think is that the the capacity to accumulate data sets and to notice patterns across across massive amounts of let's say generated chaos uh doesn't mean that you'll understand them the insight to understand those and the insight to understand the the the meaning from them don't come from that from that generation they come from heaven you could say and you know the capacity to interpret dreams you could say that you see in in in Joseph is similar to that but just because you have the dream doesn't mean you can interpret it and sometimes people will will put their will like you when we talked about the idea of occultism instead of being a transparent vehicle for a higher Identity or or or reality to manifest itself then they'll just put their will in it and then it gets twisted right away into whatever it is that they want right so what you're were saying reminds me of um uh that phrase in Genesis 11 where mankind they come together they build a city a culture and a tower cult and they're all unified and God says they're all one people nothing that they do will be impossible for them and I think people read that and they're like well isn't God God I mean uh what is he talking about here but I think this is actually a real statement of the ontology of creation mankind exists and in Genesis 1 there's one image of God it is the Human family male and female who is the image of God so when mankind is United that is the image through which God develops the world and so when mankind is joined together and is of one mind but that one mind is directed contrary to the word that is an existential threat to the Integrity of creation so that in the flood the world just collapses it falls apart um and I think that says something but let me just get on what you said which is that it's a great it's a great like nothing will stop them from doing what they want to do and and and and that's true and like you said it's you you got it exactly right which is that the problem like what you when we talked about occultism at the outset the problem is that is that you don't understand what it is that you want you don't understand all the cories of what it is that you want so maybe we will create a society where everybody has everything they need physically and everybody's super comfortable and then we're like well why is everybody infertile now why does everybody why is everybody desperate why is everybody miserable didn't we do what we wanted to do and I think that that's right it's like it's exactly right so the story story of bab is like they'll do what they want to do but it's actually to their own destruction yeah so um let me just kind of take that and ask over the past couple years or few years um in what way has your kind of attention to symbolism in creation and in non-biblical quote unquote stories how has that affected your reading of scripture and then how did they kind of ping back and forth because that's been a big thing for me that reading symbolism in scripture then you see the world better and then you see scripture better so on and so forth oh definitely I mean I think that you know if you think think if you take the Snow White project that we're doing now that is definitely there's been this weird back and forth between scripture and so let me give you a little example in Snow White it is you know snow white eats an apple and dies right so you're like obviously there's got to be a connection to the other story but it's kind of Muddy right it's like I don't totally see it and then I realized that in the story of Snow White uh in the original Grim story or you know based on the ancient Traditions the the queen goes TW three times to see her and every time she goes she brings her something to supplement her beauty she brings her a comb and then like a a girdle or a belt in order to supplementary Beauty and you're like why is she doing that isn't Snow White the most beautiful girl in the world so why is she trying to tempt her with this supplementarity and then I'm like okay I'm on to something this is definitely what's going on related to scripture and so then my my Insight was that in fact what the what the queen is offering Snow White with the apple is awareness of beauty she saying you will know that you are the most beautiful in the world she already is the most beautiful in the world but you'll know that you're the most beautiful and so she trades like reality for the supplement for the artifact of it or for the the self-conscious awareness of it and she and she actually trades the real thing for that and I thought oh man there's already there's something in Genesis going on with that because it says that Adam and Eve are made in the image of God and then this the serpent says eat the fruit and you'll become like God it's like there's something so it's like I'm still I'm still kind of bouncing off those two those two those two things and then Snow White brought me back to scripture and made me notice that it's as if it's as if there's something that you know the idea that what God really did want for them was them to become like him that's actually what he wants for them but that in taking that for themselves and becoming kind of becoming self-aware of it through an an act of Will and power they lose it but if they had just submitted to God and you know been in the right relationship to him then they would have been they they would have accomplished that which is that ultimately even because they even what the serpent promised them they could have they would have accomplished it and that's what we see in Christ obviously uh uh and so it's weird that so Snow White so it's like I I use the Bible to understand Snow White but then when I saw what happening was happening in Snow White it made me see back in scripture a pattern that I had kind of skipped over that IID you know ironed over too easily that when you're describing that story it recalled for me you know this great biblical theme which is that you know after the sin one of the curses is that your desire will be after your husband now you know in the context of the story Adam has already been created in a relationship to Eve which can be called headship and so how exactly do we take that what the way I've come to take it to say well right now what Adam is what's happened made Adam a fallen creature and Eve the feminine partner is now in a state of curse because she's in subjection to this creature who is fallen and so then you see throughout Isaiah and so forth Zion is described as a bride who is Barren who can't bring forth seed and the servant and the god of Israel so hint hint they're both described as the true bridegroom who is going to marry this barren woman and raise her from the dead and so there's that that theme in a lot of stories you know that the bride is in a state uh to some degree of her own fault to some degree not of her own fault it's a complex issue in scripture uh the bride is in this state of deep sleep or death and needs rescuing from the bridegroom and obviously this is typical of Christ um and then in that theme of knowledge uh I think we see there's a lot of stuff going on in Genesis 3 and following and then in the New Testament because they eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and then Genesis 4 Adam knew his wife and she conceived and she brought forth Cain so what is the problem here well the problem is that Adam and Eve have just been cut off from the presence of God and the presence of God in the garden is the means by which their knowledge is joined to him and having been cut off from the presence of God they know each other to some degree apart from uh God and that produces Generations which lead down to the flood and then in the New Testament what happens is we have a mode of selfhood that is from outside this world but comes into this world that is the sell foood of the only begotten son in relation to the father and that enables us to then be human in a way that um is compatible with God's knowing us fully so that we might be fully known so those are just some yeah yeah yeah there there's definitely there's definitely that's definitely right and the the we the strangeness of the story too the strangeness of the story when you see this how Christ kind of resolves the whole pattern um it's it's a it's interesting when you compare to Adam and Eve and you see you know what knowledge does and how Christ reacts to um to his situation and how Adam reacts to situation and so I always have this image where you know the the the serpent the the serpent tells Adam and Eve if you eat the fruit you'll become like God and then God told Adam and Eve if you eat the fruit you will die and Jesus just said yes like yes to both those you know and but Adam didn't and that was that was in some ways part of the Fall is that Adam refuses to Humble himself you know in the in the moment where he eats he refuses to die in the moment when he eats the fruit he says it's not my fault it's her fault it's not my fault it's the Serpent's fault it's like it's everybody's fault but mine and I'm going to protect myself gonna hide myself I'm going to to cut myself off from God whereas Christ says yes and then Christ dies and and you know and so this image you know you you you Orthodox so you've seen it like this kind of this icon that we have during during uh Holy Week of the bridegroom you know and it's like we have this this icon which we call the icon of the bridegroom and it's the icon of Christ being beaten and tortured you know and ironically being treated as King by by pilate and his and his his cronies uh and it's like well that's the surprise that's the surprise of the bridegroom right it's the surprise of what it is that solves the puzzle from the beginning which is that in humbling our ourselves in being willing to die you know then that knowledge is transformed into Glory it doesn't cut us off it actually leads us higher into yeah into into the highest place so it's a it's yeah blose your mind when you when you see it yeah in Genesis you know when God says if you eat of this fruit in the day you eat of it you shall surely die you know one of the things that happens immediately afterwards is God takes Adam puts him into a deep sleep which is would argue a type of death you know it's a place where you're divided in two and then you're reunited in glorified form and then when you think about the way in which Christ is the bridegroom and the way that that connects to his mission relative to the church by the way for my audience I do live near a military based if you can hear the the plane outside so I apologize for that uh if you think about the way that Christ is bridegroom to his church it says that he cleansed her by the washing of water through the word and then you read Genesis 3 and there's supposed to be a three-way dialogue here or a trialog the serpent Eve and Adam because it says Adam was with her and yet he's utterly silent the serpent is engaging in this dialogue with Eve and Adam is just kind of standing there and I think one of the implications of the text is that Adam is very interested to see what is going to happen because God has told him something about the tree the day you eat of it you will surely die but he hasn't learned that by direct experience and now he has this other person who's standing there and the serpent is saying you're not going to die why didn't you eat of it and Adam stands there he waits sees she eats of it he doesn't immediately drop dead and then Adam says I'm going to eat of it as well and then it's the divine presence which comes and and James Jordan has argued that this is the first instance in scripture of the delay of the peras where the divine presence waits for us to kind of work our own will out before appearing and then um implementing the consequences of that decision so there's so much stuff here that I think you're right in that going to these mythological or fictional stories these fairy tales you know we're less familiar with them and as a consequence sometimes the point of the story strikes us more directly and then we read scriptural stories with which we are more familiar and we see them in in a new and more profound light that's that's absolutely right and I see that all the time where people we know we've been so especially if you grew up in a Christian world and if you you're surrounded by these Christian stories these stories are so M are have become almost invisible because people know them and they don't see their full implications they don't see and also because of the way the scripture is written you know the links aren't often made for you like they would in a movie for example like you watch a movie and it's you know it's like they'll lead you along they'll make sure you understand how everything connects to everything else and that's fine it's like a training for for stories but in scripture it's not like that in scripture it's just like Event Event Event Event Event and and you have to be able to see the pattern through it they're not going to tell you they're not going to hint at it uh and so and so looking at these looking at ancient myths or looking at fairy tales even what even modern fa storytelling can be a training for us uh because they have to some way maintain similar patterns because they're made of attention you know stories are made of attention they're the things we care about and and we are created by God we're created by the Divine logos and so when we when we are attracted to something even if it's perverse like I'm not saying that everything we're attracted to is good obviously sometimes it's bad but hidden behind that is always something which is revealing reality to you which is why even when you're you're attracted to something that makes you sin in that sin there's always an opportunity right there's always like an opening where you're like oh no like why did I do that why did I pay attention to that why did I like why did I move down that road and there's an opportunity to actually see God like you talked about this idea of of the divine presence manifesting itself I think that happens almost every time you sin that happens it's like you sin and then you're like and then then you can feel the burning or like this presence of God that's reminding you of of how of how you misdirected your your will and your attention yeah and that's that is something which you know is it's a way in which I think God works out all our evil intentions for good and you know we talked about That Hideous Strength a little bit earlier there's this part in That Hideous Strength where Jane is with Ransom she's with the good guys and she's learning the forms of things by direct acquaintance with their goodness so they're coming the forms of the or the archons of the plan planets are coming and revealing themselves and she is becoming acquainted through that with God and at the same time her husband from whom she's been separated is learning the same goodness because he's drawn into the objective room where the bad guys systematically pervert even the most mundane of things so there's a a set of dots which seem to be forming a pattern and yet they're not quite forming a pattern there's beautiful art which has ugliness just stuck on top of it and the mundane nature of the evil is meant to lead Mark to see that the only thing there is is evil lack of pattern but he actually it says in in the story Lewis says in that moment through seeing the perversions of these things Mark came to be conscious in a way that he never was before that if there's a bent there must be a straight yeah so you know God wants to teach us of his own goodness by acquaintance with the goodness but in Divine Providence when we sin we can also learn of goodness after we sin by repentance because we taste the bad and then God says repent we turn back and we see it by contrast and then yeah that habituates us to seek the good before we seek the bad yeah that's absolutely right and you see that happening all around us right now which is that you know certain forces are trying to twist reality into Fantastical shapes and into upside down shapes you know the upside down patterns and what It ultimately will do is restore truth you know it'll be a painful Road for that to happen it's painful and it's G to it's not it's going to get worse folks every I think most people know that by now things are going to get worse things are going to get crazier you know the carnival is going to increase and the and the clowns are going to rule but you know when you you when you sadly are faced with a Clown King then all it does is remind you of what is true like it because it's it's painful and it's ridiculous and so it's actually secretly shining a light on the true nature of of of of kingship of like the Return of the King ultimately in the end uh but but I think so at least we can you know that's why I always say I'm a short-term pessimist but I'm a long-term Optimist yeah yeah absolutely and I think one of the things I've seen over the past several years is that um people's I don't know how exactly to put it but their plausibility structure has kind of been broken down because people have been disillusioned by you know we might call it the establishment the intellectual establishment they say wait a second a lot of this stuff is really really bizarre I don't buy it as a consequence a lot of people I think have really been attracted to things which are genuinely silly but by the same principle a lot of people have been attracted to what is not genuinely silly but before they would have thought it's genuinely silly I.E Christianity yeah um and the breaking down of the plausibility structure you know it's a crisis and an opportunity it's a crisis because people can embrace the genuinely nutty stuff which is going to be bad for them spiritually and intellectually but they can also embrace the true nuttiness uh which is the foolishness of God revealed in the Cross of Christ and I've seen um that latter Point happen in people I never would have expected um it to happen to and and I just find that super super um exciting so well it is it's an exciting time it's a wild and exciting time and I think that you know the I hate making actual prediction but I think I do think that what we're going to see is while the world is getting crazier and crazier and as people accept things that you know we would have thought was impossible you know uh just 20 years ago that people would accept it as they as this kind of becomes as this Insanity becomes mainstream we're going to see a little Arc you know that's going to start to become more and more uh that's going to congregate you could say you know in in in Christianity we're going to see very intelligent conscious people that are going to become Christian and it's going to be it's always going to be a minority but it's going to be a very strong and and Lucid minority amongst the the kind of increasing Madness so I think that's something we can hope for and it's something that we can also find joy in like you said because you know I'm seeing amazing people that are that I that I never would have thought also would become Christian and Orthodox and are converting and I hear wild things like I meet I meet people that I haven't talked to in years and they're like oh yeah and it's just normal for them to go to church when just five years ago they were absolute atheists and completely and so so it is a time I mean it's a time to weep because things are getting crazy but I think there's also there's also place for rejoicing as well yeah yeah so in all in light of all this what would you say to a person who is kind of in the midst of the kind of collapse of the plausibility structure they don't know what to believe and it it I think it's kind of scary you know suddenly you have no categories with which to assess reality you have no way of differentiating what's nonsensical from what's actually legitimate so let's say that that person comes to you they're in a state of Crisis uh they ask you why Christ what is your answer to them like Christ well so I mean I think that the Incarnation becomes the key to reestablishing a a a structure of reality you know because you want you realize and in fact reality isn't just a bunch of facts that reality has to be framed that reality reality has has to be anchored in purpose and so once you once you notice that especially as you see the Things Fall Apart you know and you see that if they're not anchored in purpose then they go astray and they become insane and tyrannical and and mad the question of what it is that is the highest anchor becomes a plausible question to answer a plausible question to ask which is that now that you see that the world has to be anchored in purpose what is the highest purpose what is the one purpose that cannot be uh weaponized that cannot become a a tyrant or a you know a kind of demon ruling over you and you know I think that we can argue that self-sacrificial love is the one there is really nothing if you if you work it through in your mind all the other virtues all the other things can become can become torturous and and and horrible but the the relationship of the king that gives himself to others that's it like that's the key that's the top of the hierarchy right the top of the hierarchy is not the king that just rules on others it's the king that rules and gives himself simultaneously it's like you can't beat that story you can't go any higher and that is the story of the Cross you know and so you could say well I like it I kind of believe in it but I don't like that it's this actual person that was born 2,000 years ago that revealed this to us and and and brought us to participate in that well you're G to you can run around in circles as as much as you want but that's the way that's where it happened and that's where it was revealed to us and that's the story that we can participate in you know truly when you engage into the community the body that was born out of that out of that reality um and so so that's why I think I think that it's you know ultimately and and ultimately what happens too what interesting is that even as the World falls apart and there's still a remainder of these goods and a remain and the tort virtuous version of the virtues that used to guide us um when people strip them and start to look at them they'll they'll realize that it's always Christ hiding behind there you know as you kind of straighten it and you remove the parasitic aspect of these different values that people are are worshiping right now you'll realize that it's it's Christ that's hiding behind it yeah yeah and and my brother uh my younger brother he became U when he was a teenager kind of and what I would call an unhappy agnostic for some time and it was really exciting to me to watch him gradually then come to say wait I think God is real it was a genuine um intellectual and spiritual struggle that I think he handled very responsibly you know and not jumping into anything trying to think through all the issues and then I remember one day that he said I believe Christ is Lord and it's because you know he looked at history and as you look at history it really does seem that there is a center to it and that Christ really is at the hearts of we can call it the human story every human story and when you look it's and this this struck me when I was working through my crisis of Faith which is that how is it that this obscure Jew is crucified in the first century a tiny little group of people announce he's lord of the world and say by the way he's going to Reign Over All Nations before they're more than a little cult and three centuries later the Roman Emperor is abolishing sacrifice yeah that's an extraordinary thing and for me it I I I sometimes engage in apologetics relative to to Judaism who argue Jesus is not the Messiah from script RT and they say Well when the Messiah comes it'll be obvious because you'll look outside and people will be worshiping the god of Abraham and they say well look out your window around Passover ceas and then look at thousands of Gentiles making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to honor the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the name of the crucified Jew that's an extraordinary thing you know that alone does not prove he's the Messiah but it does put him to the top of the list in plausibility candidates uh uh and so yeah well I always used to think I used I used to have this at some point I realized because people because it's also because I grew up Evangelical which which somehow obscured some of this to me because you know I grew in the Evangelical Church there's this idea that it's it's a it's a self-contradictory idea because they believe in everything in the in the Creed but then they also think Constantine is the devil and that the conversion of Rome is the beginning is the fall of Christianity right it's like woo uh you know but then when I actually realized that Christ you know the idea that Christ would become his King and that he would that he would rule over the rule over the Gentiles it's like well that happened I mean it took 300 years but it still happened and when you read what St Paul's saying it's like St Paul knew it was happening where St Paul says he is at this time Christ is ascending the principalities he's he's subjugating all these principalities to him it's like you might not see the fruits of that yet but just wait you know and so and then it happened so it's a it's a pretty astounding it's a pretty astounding thing and and you're right I I do also think that you know C there is no way to view history outside of Christ anymore you just can't you can't view the world outside of what Christ came to reveal and you know even as we move towards weird internationalism and globalism you know a lot of the basic values that underly that even though they become Twisted you know it it is a kind of the idea that you should have compassion for your enemies the idea that you should all this kind of weird stuff like even like the rules of war and all that stuff what would you think that that's just normal you think it's normal that we would have rules of engagement and rules of war and that you wouldn't just Slaughter your enemies pretend you know and then just Slaughter your enemies like if you if you believe in these in these these values and the idea of helping the weak and the marginal like this is all Christian stuff guys I don't know what to say yeah I I you know sometimes we can get kind of we can roll our eyes at you know this or that uh religious leader generic says war is bad you're like well yeah of course war is bad and then I realized one day that is not something that everybody has taken for granted there's a reason the cult of war is Central to lots and lots of cultures no war julus Caesar so this is the thing about Christianity too it's like Christianity is ripe with war and horrible and tragedy and everything the difference is they always have to make excuses for it they have to try to hide it they have to deny it you might think that's nothing but Julius Caesar bragged that he slaughtered a mill million GS like it was glory to him it wasn't something that he had to hide or apologize for or like sweep under the carpet or try to find some excuse for it's like no it's like when when you know when Americans bomb n you know Hiroshima and Nagasaki they they have to find some moral twisty reason to like make that plausible they can't just do it with a and I and I first of all I think it's a it's a horrible thing that happened you know but but the after that they have to make excuses for it they can't just be like you know what this is how we win a war this is how we beat our enemies and just like you know let's say uh just just Rebel in the blood of your enemies like the Scandinavians did it's like you think any it's just weird to realize just how people don't can't see how much you know Christ has transformed reality yeah yeah absolutely and I think that connects to this theme you see in in scripture and outside of scripture of um you know lurgical Warfare and it's interesting to me that so many cultures have a story of creation through Warfare and then you read Genesis and you know you've got God forming filling brightening the world in these six creation days and then he enters into his rest but you follow the language of rest through scripture it's also used in relation to Warfare so there seems to be I think some connection some thematic connection between what's going on in Genesis and the bro idea of warfare but the way in which Christ takes it is that you know these cultures say Warfare upholds the world blood is what keeps the world pumping and Christ says yes it is what keeps the world pumping it's my blood my blood that's right and and and I think that has really profound implications for what the church's mission is in relation to her liturgy and that you know in scripture you know you've got the idea of the Heavenly Court the heaven Council you follow that theme through though you realize the Heavenly court is God's Heavenly Temple and that's where liturgy is going on so Christ is King and priest he's King because he's priest and priest because he's King and God is ruling the world through the Heavenly liturgy and then you go to the Orthodox liturgy why is it that we are praying for you know everything conceivable we're praying for fruit we're praying for you know that the Nations be at peace the unity of all mankind and then we have all these names we're putting these names into the Eucharist well this because the liturgy is the throne room of God this is where we enter into God's Reign Over the world and I think we really need to and I say this to myself as much as to anyone else um recover the sense that no this is actually something real there is ontological significance to writing a person's name in the diptic and having them prayed for it changes things when we do this God really does take that into the logo so that that he's shaping the world in and through um his Union with those those intentions um so I know that's you know spaghetti but you're AB you're you're you're absolutely right uh it's difficult like I find it hard like I I'll be honest with you like I struggle to totally believe that you know but I know it when I stop and I look at how how it happens for me like let's just say like if I carry someone's name in my heart that transforms everything about them right it transforms you know if I if I'm angry with someone and I'm annoyed with them and I say okay I'm just gonna carry that person's name in my in my heart with good intention I will direct good intention towards that person then it changes everything you know and it will transform my perception of them it'll transform my actions towards them he'll transform everything and so it's like that's actually how it works and so then the idea that we would take the these names and that we would raise them up higher into the Divine will and into the Divine uh into Divine Providence then of course it would do the same at a cosmic level I don't it just makes sense because we know that that's what happens within us it's just it's harder because we're selfish and we're we think we're little Gods so we think it pretty much ends with us you know and and that happens to me all the time uh you know and I forget to pray for people constantly you know people ask me to pray for them and I usually do it for a few weeks and I forget and it's like man you know it's like if I like you said if I understood the power of taking people's names and and you know and and and bringing them up into the throne room of God I would uh yeah probably be have more perseverance yeah yeah so so how has um your kind of focus on symbolism and all of this stuff how has that if I can ask it this way shaped the way in which you read the story of your own life not to make you sound self-important or something like that but are you comfortable um I I suppose reading the story of your own life symbolically I think so I but I think we I think it's dangerous we have to be a little careful you know the way that I do it is I try not to be too deliberate about it uh like you said not to become not to become self-absorbed but I'm grateful for the insights that come to me maybe I would say it that way it's like there are moments when I see parallels in the things that I'm doing and the things that are happening to me and I see the parallels with scripture sometimes it's not sometimes it's frightful it sometimes it's actually quite frightful but nonetheless I try to be grateful when I see that that uh that that uh when I can see the relationship between these stories but I would be I would warn people to be careful because when you become and I say this like really because the you know I've seen it happen to many people where when they start to think this way then they become the equivalent of paranoid because what happens is that they become very self-conscious and they start to analyze all the things that are happening to them and all the things that they're doing in these symbolic structures and then all of a sudden you know before they know it they think that they're being spied on by you know the Illuminati and that they're you know and that you know they're demons that are constantly pulling at them this and that direction that's why this is happening and this is happening because of this and you know it's like if something bad happens to them then all of a sudden they're trying to wonder if there's someone casting a spell on them you know that kind of stuff that is a very dangerous place to find yourself in I think which is why I think the best way to do it is to focus on God and on the stories of scripture on the Liturgy on participating on your family on all the things that you you can have power on and not focus on your own story so much but then once in a while there'll be you will encounter some insight and and then you can try to be grateful that that God is using you in this way or that you know that God is shining a light on on moments in your life but I I wouldn't warn against doing that too much like for those reasons yeah yeah I mean the primary reality has got to be you know our direct relationship understood not to exclude our relationship with the church and so on forth uh our direct relationship with God and obedience to him and that obedience precedes wisdom obedience precedes knowledge if you don't have obedience you might get like Adam did knowledge but because knowledge is ultimately rooted in God and we are smaller than God if we try to get that knowledge directly we're going to burst we're going to burst open and that's why I think there's there's there's a connection there with the way we talk about the mother of God as the kind of archetype of the church uh Mother of God is more spacious than the heavens it is only when God grows us to a sufficient size that we have the room to actually assimilate any knowledge and the person who has grown to that size is a person who like her is defined by trust and obedience to his will um you know one of the things also that I think is because it's interesting because what that using the mother God's an example is a really good one because it says in know when this is one of my favorites page about the mother of God which is that you know when the when the the the Mages come to see her it says that she gathered all these things in her heart uh and I love that because it's like first of all that's symbolism the word is actually symbol it's actually symbolism uh where she kind of gathers all these facts into her heart and she is basically like you get the sense that what she's starting to see the pattern like she sees it's like oh this is showing this is manifesting something you know but there's a kind of a there's a kind of attentiveness uh that is balanced by you know her discretion you could say about it right it's like she didn't start talking about it she didn't start telling everybody about what's happening she just she's kind of gathered these these hints and these these events into into her heart and meditating on them I think that's that's the best approach you know yeah yeah and in Luke and acts it's really cool there's 's a there really is an incredibly developed Mary Church typology there uh you know one way to see it is you know the Holy Spirit overshadowing Mary and then the Holy Spirit coming on the Apostles of Pentecost while Mary is said to be there it's described in the same ways but also when says she treasured up all these things in her heart and Jesus will later say where your heart is there your treasure is also and then in Acts there's this emphasis on the church is of one heart and one mind and they held all of their wealth together in common and there's this idea that well what is wealth really we we we think of wealth we're used to think of wealth as a tool to make you comfortable but what's the difference between $1 billion and $50 billion as far as comfort goes you're getting diminishing returns that's right what what is wealth really what wealth is I think is it represents the degree to which you can realize you know your intentions for the world outside of yourself right with $50 billion doar you can directly shape and change a lot of things and I think when scripture connects wealth to Divine Life you know the riches of God's glory the idea is that in Christ we have received reive the treasury of God's own life we would say in Orthodoxy his energies his operations into ourselves and then it is really the church at prayer which is the treasury of God's glory in the world we are then taking that and directing it to shape and mold certain things which goes back to what we were just talking about with the Liturgy and then you look through the Bible and there's really a huge amount of financial language in scripture you know buy without money I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire there's all that stuff there and and thinking of the the toos say more spacious than the Heavens to has this immense treasury who is Christ himself in her is a good way of of of conceiving that I think um the other thing that I think can be difficult or problematic in quote unquote reading your own life symbolically is that people can and I I include myself in this if you see certain symbolic structures that really seem to be there there's a kind of self-importance I I'm the center of History look at how God is directing my life you know I might as well be a Biblical character but I think what you you always have to remind yourself of is no this doesn't mean that you're different from everyone else it means you're like everyone else where those symbolic structures are really there because you read so uh names and uh lifespans in the Bible often have symbolic significance people Joseph dies at 110 years old that a symbolic significance Moses dies at 120 years old has symbolic significance the names even where the meaning is not explicitly drawn out it really does seem to correspond to something about their life I think that's that's true I really think that is true in principle for everyone's life even if we don't um know what it is I think in the final accounting of things we're going to see some symbolic meaning to all this stuff one of the things that that um was very striking for me in my personal life um and I'm have her on to talk about all of this but when I was uh 1819 I did a 40-day aathy to St Nicholas to find an orthodox spouse okay and it just so happened that the day of my engagement and I did not plan this was precisely 4,000 days after I completed that 40-day set of aathy and I think you know if you just look at a lot of stories in a lot of people's lives and a lot of stories in what are you married now yeah oh congrat congratulations thank you thank you yeah so we got married in on on June glory to God yeah glory to God glory to God um so seeing that in in my life um I think what we need to do is we we take these things as a sign of the way the world always works not a sign that we are set apart or special or something like that yeah that's a good that's a good way to to to talk about it it's a good call because like you said like we we've been saying since the beginning in some ways those the patterns the the patterns in scripture are the patterns that inform reality they are the patterns that make reality real and they make and so when we see them we actually shouldn't be surprised you know and when and if we see them you know only occasionally it's it's actually a reproach on us that we're blind to how in fact God is always working through through things and is always you know bringing things together towards their good so yeah and and you know one of those things that um when I was kind kind of still going through many years ago you know doubts about Christianity one of the things that struck me was you know there's all these patterns in scripture you know and the Book of Kings or Exodus for example you know the temple was built 480 years exactly 12 * 40 after The Exodus and well that seems a little too perfect but then you come into that period of History which is close enough to us and we'll documented enough relative to us that we can say okay no these the these numbers are real is one of the things that struck me is wait a second the temple was destroyed 40 years after the death and resurrection of Christ and that little fact kind of wormed its way into me because it suggested that these patterns are not just literary they are a real feature of the world so that's been just one of the exciting things I've followed through um over the last 10 years so we don't have that much time left but I did want to just um ask how does um your project of um Universal history relate to the kind of mission of the church in taking all nations into the story of Christ I.E you know the whole Christ is present in each one of us not a little bit of Christ the whole Christ is present in each particle of the Eucharist yeah the whole story of Christ by implication must be manifest in those Nations whom he takes into himself so how do you see that project sacramentally yeah I think I think I mean I think you hit the na the nail on the head and and you know as we just by the way as we're talking about Universal history I have to give a shout out to Richard Roland obviously because you know in those Universal history podcasts I'm usually pretty passive and he's the one who's like teaching me about all these these great uh stories that that often I know a little or I don't know at all and so I've been really grateful for at him to to to help that but I think that you know both of us we kind of we we started messaging each other on Facebook I think several years ago and realizing that we both love this we both had this same vision it which is similar to what you said which is that if we believe that Christ created the world and if we believe that the Divine logos is that which that orders you know chaos into being then the story of the logo should be hidden everywhere and that the universal history um that the Ancients did is an example for us a shining example for us at how people started to remember their own history through Christ and how this is possible not only for them it's possible for us now and it's possible for all the peoples of the world that if you remember your story through the lens of Christ then it actually shines brighter and it reveals more things about yourself more things about your place in the world and also your your possible purpose uh for your people for your family for for for everything that you can participate in and so like you said I think that ultimately this is a work that is not just something that happened a thousand years ago in Scandinavia or in Ethiopia you know 1500 years ago or whatever it's something that can still happen now and the you know and some of it and it's weird because and this is going to this is Al going to scrape at people in the wrong wrong but some of it has to do with fiction and some of it has to do with what we most what we usually understand is kind of factuality and and there are moments when those when the bridge between the two will will will collapse and you don't have to be too scared of that you know uh you also have to not I mean obviously you have to be careful but you have to be not too scared of that and so you know the way we're doing God's dog for example this graphic novel series that we're doing you know we're we're using fairy tale tropes with Saints and bible stories to kind of help people see the structures in the Bible and in the history and in the hagiography and uh and I and I know that some people will probably find it find it the wrong way to go but you know that I think that we are tapping into something that will surprise people and will help them look back now at their own history at the Bible and understand it better because of some of the the the narrative connection that we're making through this fictional story right right and so what um intellectual Trends do you find most exciting now just outside the range of people who are already kind of familiar with universal history symbolism say just a totally group of people who wouldn't have heard of of you in your work um uh what intellectual Trends do you think are should be brought in and and can have a positive influence and who was most receptive to this kind of way of thinking well I think I mean if you look at the conversation that I've had on my channel you'll see that in some ways a lot of the people I'm talking to are are are that so I think that a lot of cognitive scientists you know like John RI uh and and other people like that people that at least try to connect you know the the most the most advanced visions of science with cognition and try to see how they're related uh you know although some of it can sometimes get messy and and maybe a little chaotic I think that those are very people that are very interesting like Ian mcgilchrist people like that that are trying to look at how Consciousness Works they will come to very similars um let's say they'll come to very similar answers as what what it is that we find in the Bible and then engaging with them and talking about it in those terms can help move the conversation further and help bridge a lot of the um let's say the Gap that exists between secular and religious culture and I think that not only is it good for the secular people it's also good for the religious people too because the religious people sometimes we have these this kind of inner language that we developed you know this kind of inner religious language which is useful but can also be fetishized where we say things like Divine energies and and uh you know and apophatic and kenotic and we have all these really these technical terms and at some point it becomes like a language that doesn't even mean anything anymore it's not connected to your experience it's not connected to reality it's just this inner theological uh language and I think that engaging back into the conversation with with with thinkers like that um you know for example the question of Consciousness and AI the difference between intelligence and and statistical uh prediction of of of information these are all questions that you know St Maximus can cast a light on you know and so we have to get involved in these conversations you know um because if we don't then even Christians will be seduced you know by these these new machines and will think that they're actually intelligent when when all they are are are basically divination massive massive divination uh machines that just predict a statistical uh you know probable relationships between facts between points on a on a grid and so anyway these are just examples but I think that the all the discussion about emergence all the discussion about about uh about Consciousness all these are Trends in thinking that that are that are coming back that I think Christians should should take seriously and get involved in you're you're mentioning I AI reminds me of a question I've had for a while um what do you think the relationship is symbolically metaphysically or whatever between our modern discussion about Ai and the medieval idea of uh talking head you mean kind of like what you see in that hi his strength that kind of thing yeah and you know Albert the Great um was said to have you know invented a device which he could then animate and it would give him answers to any question that he put to it and there's also the idea in Judaism that with the right ritual you can and it's prohibited in most forms of judism with right rituals you can take stuff and animate it and it'll talk back to you yeah well I think I think it's there's definitely something there's a relationship between the occult and the AI I mean I think that that's just inevitable you know and that the way that um the way that a cultist would try like like what the way you talk about it the way that they would try to aggregate a kind of being you know and then use it as a as a divination tool this is definitely what's going on I mean this is clearly what's happening you know I had a an interesting conversation with a with an AI developer because the way I mean obviously the language models you kind of know how it works right it's basically they create a semantic map and then what they do is they just measure diff distances between words and then you know if they do that well enough then they can project what what's going what what's the most probable relationship between the pro most probable next word because of the proximity in terms of a massive massive amount of data and so you know it's like that semantic map like the massive semantic map obviously no one has access to it or very few people because it has everything in it right it has it has all your darkest thoughts all your darkest desires every every you know underlying thing that humans don't want to look at is all there in that Ai and so I asked this a developer if we could if we could trace out in this in this massive kind of data set if we could trace out certain Gods like if we could for example summon the god Aries by basically finding the boundary in the semantic map and tracing it so that when you ask the question you're you're you're within that that relationship of language because obviously when you're I know when you're talking about war you're not talking about flowers like you're not talking about you're not talking so there is a and he said of course you could do that he's like that's just that of course if once he understood what I was talking about at first he thought I was woo wooing but once I kind of explained it it's like no that there there there are there's personalities and have semantic Maps too right and so you can imagine that the the the gods of the ancient gods have a semantic you know uh Pro let's say boundary uh and you said yeah of course and it's like man so so in some ways it in some ways a lot lot of the things that when we look at in the occult world we don't totally understand because often the the the mechanisms by which it happens aren't described uh but I think now we we have and we and and I say we know the me we don't even know the mechanism by which it's happening you know the AI people it's a black box they don't know how the AI answers they they they set up the parameters but then they they don't they can't account for the emergence of the answer and so it's like once the the AI is running they can't see the process and it's like that seems very similar to what what the the occultist were talking about it's kind of a it's a way of existing I don't know self-referentially right so if you want to know the the answer to your question what do you do you just kind of ask this instantiation of of human beings Collective Consciousness or whatever maybe one way to think of it or if we think about the occult as um as idolatry you know what idolatry is is we take our ultimate good to be something something other than God and because we become like what we worship and God is the only one with life in himself well when we turn away from God we just kind of collapse into ourselves there's no way of kind of breaking out of that um and it's interesting because it's like I don't know how they're going to deal with it but there's you can see in you can project into what's going to happen with they are at least one line which is the problem of self-re self referentiality like the problem of self-reference and that kind of cannibalistic system you know you could say that that's why we we believe that everything has to kind of move up into the into the into the apophatic and Transcendent you know because AI like the AI models right now they're kind of cut off from the internet a lot of them for a good reason because as we move forward in time the AIS are going to be producing content which will go on the internet and then the AI will start to train on its own production and So within a certain amount of years there'll be this cannibalistic spiral that will that will spiral you know obviously spiral into into idiosyncrasy and spiral down into kind a kind of Madness um and that's almost inevitable because they at some point they can't have thei just closed off forever they need to have it reopened so that it stays with the times but those times will have been built by the AI itself so it's like you can actually see how the idea that this will that this will give birth to like a to some like God that's going to be you know it's like no it's going to it's going to turn into a monster and it's almost inevitably so yeah it's you know that reminds me of there's that um bit in um Voyage of the Dawn Treader where they go into that this part portion of the sea and it's the place where dreams come true and it sounds so wonderful oh my dreams are going to come true but no it's horrible because your dreams come true that's right dreams and I think there's something profound in there because what happens in our actual dreams not our Daydreams where we have a measure of control we can direct what part of ourselves we want to look at and our actual dreams the reason they can be so disturbing is because we are encountering oursel without the ability to choose which bits of our self we're going to encounter and that's what I think damnation is if we pick oursel as the ultimate reference point there's no way we can differentiate which parts of ourselves we like and which parts of ourselves we don't like because by what standard are we going to do that no we get our whole self our whole subconscious and we might not like what we actually encounter so you know because that's the thing with that's exactly the thing with these these semantic maps and these the is that what's in there is the the the idea that the how can I say this it's like as the the AI model speed up at some point the AI will know what you want more more than you do and will know all the dark things you want more than you do and will not necessarily know I mean they'll try to control it but they won't necessarily know not to give it to you and so it's like dude that's hell that's literally hell like like we're you know this image that CS Lewis has you know uh of of Hell in the in the great divorce you know of people moving further and further away from each other other right and becoming more and more idiosyncratic and more and more isolated and more and more in their own little kind of closed off world I mean can you imagine that like we're building that right now yeah and it's I think it's one of the things we've seen in just the last couple of decades you know there was some study you know teenagers are having less sex than they have in decades and decades and well uh in itself that might be a good thing but what's the reason it's because all of these things things which drive people together by necessity are now dropping out we can want to eat well just get door Dash and they can leave it at the door I don't have to see anybody for weeks if I don't want to and I think you know this is one an instance of the way in which we can see the good through the bad so at a certain point when the necessity of community is Stripped Away just for our day-to-day existence those who choose to engage with people are doing so really deliberately because seen something good just in that and that is where I think there is a real opportunity for the church to be the church as the extension and the form of all Community as the disclosure of God's trinitarian life in creation and so people they want to be alone all the time well now they can be alone all the time and they get to see what that's like and then they say I don't want this and that is where the church can be the city of God and says you don't want this you can have what God has to offer instead yeah that's a great Insight you've got there which is that in some ways the kind of spiral out of control of the West and the spiral out of control of our own lives is an opportunity to become to become more even you know and and even that in that image in some ways that stus presents of Adam and Eve as something like children right where in some ways what the fall does is that it it takes you through a kind of self-consciousness which leads to more in the end and that you know that someone who needs Community like a village in you know in South America or someone it's like they're living the good life like they they've got that that goodness but they're not you know in some ways it's it's the way that children way the children have it but if you lose it really lose it and you see all the consequences of that then when you deliberately go back to it then maybe it has even more than what it had at the outset you know like the Heavenly Jerusalem is more than the Garden of Eden you know and it's it's a little mysterious but it seems to be that that's the case yeah yeah it's you know when you're when you're a kid uh you can only have as many cookies as your parents give you an adult it means you can have as many cookies as you want which means if you're not having as many cookies as you want you're doing that because you know what that means and so there's more virtue in not having as many cookies as you want because you're choosing that and it's the same I think with community so Jonathan as we as we wrap up I just want to uh ask where are you going intellectually what are you really excited about going forward is there anything new on your map that you're pursuing I mean I'm really excited about the storytelling mostly and so those that kind of know what I've been doing in the past year I've started this new fairy tale Series so we're going to put out eight fairy tales that are gonna be a kind of self-conscious treading through fairy tales but in a way that hopefully will provide insight into what the meaning and the the power of these stories uh is and I'm also we're still working on this series of graphic novels and I think that's the thing that excites me the most is kind of where that's going how it is that I can participate in helping to revive stories you know give people's stories that are pointing to the good rather than you know just to this kind of crazy type of Storytelling we're seeing uh and so that's the thing that I'm putting most of my attention on um because I think that explaining things which is what I've been doing for the past six years is wonderful it's great but doing them is probably better and so H you know and I I started like that where I was carving icons and I was was involved and I was doing it and I was in the in in the life of the church and making these images and it was wonderful and amazing and then this weird opportunity that I definitely didn't ask for to now be able to just like talk to people and explain these things to them and I think it's been an amazing Loop uh and I won't stop doing that that but I think I am going to now start refocusing on doing things so you know telling these stories uh is the thing that excites me the most well that is awesome I know so many people have really been changed by uh your work and uh I'm very very grateful um that you're you're doing what you're doing and super excited to see where it keeps going so thank you so much for coming on it's always a delight uh to talk to you and and have you on the channel um and uh hopefully uh at some point in the future you can come back uh but thank you so much for for doing what you do and for I think so this is a great conversation you always push me you push me further in talking about things that I usually don't talk about and so when that happens I'm like hey I've never talked about that you know and because you know when you're doing it you're on your own at some point you you kind of go around in circle so so I appreciate it thanks for provoking me and also thanks for for all the work you're doing know that you know that your great love of scripture is also having a big effect on on the Orthodox uh around you and congratulations on your wedding again that's that's amazing thank you thank you thank god um so Jonathan thanks again and uh we will look forward to seeing what comes out of the POU World thanks thanks everyone
