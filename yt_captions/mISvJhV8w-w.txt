I am abroad in Japan with abroad in Japan clever I see what you did there Aon and we're about to spend $10,000 buying the coolest Tech that this country has to offer and then we're going to test it to see how Japanese Tech compares to the Western Tech that I spend most of my time with sounds good man all right let's get going oh my God yabashi camera the best electronic store in Japan and funnily enough the biggest tech store in the world this is nine enormous floors of basically pure Tech so we're going to ascend each floor one by one picking out the weirdest most unique things you've never seen before it's the only place you can buy practically any camera on Earth I love it this is my favorite shop in Japan right right off the bat something I've never seen before solar panel bag this is absolutely mental every single one of these rows is just cases people absolutely love Fame cases in Japan so this right here is privacy glass so if you look straight on you can see through it but if you rotate it you can't very good on a packed train might I say not I look at anything shady this is really really cool the heck is that absolutely miniature so you take your photos on that throughout the day connect it to this wirelessly and print out the photos I've never seen this back home and I wonder if there's a societal reason for that people love tiny things yeah it's that idea of being sort of cute isn't it so when you want to buy things you just take the tickets instead of the things exactly all you need to put in your your basket is uh looks depressingly empty but that's brilliant quite handy if you they want to carry things around store wow I'm kind of struggling to process the depth of this store on the ninth floor there's Golf Course is my first phone so these are actually smartphones I've never seen a watch like it it's got a baked in camera and it looks like it gets its own signal as well so the idea seems to be this is not just an accessory to a phone but it is a phone I think the r1s is the way to go we're only on the first floor we've already seen so much interesting stuff this brand Aquas is a spin-off of sharp and sharp is one of the big Japanese suppliers Aquas were really popular but they've sort of died off now they're still one of the big players in Japan and they actually have a top-of-the-line th000 plus flagship phone you have to try it oh we're sitting down this is why I don't like buying phones in P I think it's been 20 minutes maybe half an hour we're still waiting for our phone he did a little like unboxing ceremony like when the the hairdresser shows you the back of your hair what what do you do okay thank you so much okay a miracle an absolute Miracle so this is really interesting the Samsung phones don't say Samsung on them they just say Doo which is the provider and then Galaxy and that's because Samsung's not overly popular as a Korean company essentially what I'm trying to work out is what phones have flourished here so Asus you never see that in stores in the UK compact phones seem to do well here yeah yeah this must be one of the only places where Sony phones have a massive presence it's a shame because I think Sony phones are really good I agree but they just don't do anything special enough to stand out against Apple and Samsung yeah this is it this is like the the full Sony lineup oh no way nothing phone too in the store again never before seen no this is actually such an apple thing to do is to create a separate part of the store that they call the Apple area they've got their own table Decor it almost is like an Apple store isn't it like transported into the Bachi they definitely picked the tables like if you look at the Microsoft Surface table compared to the Oak from the mountains of central Japan okay floor two find last just printer ink look at this printer ink everywhere if I was a printer ink Enthusiast boy power supplies motherboard and if you wanted to build your own PC you could do it entirely from this store absolutely and you can pick your chip all the way up to like the very best 4 9 you call that a Wi-Fi router no what is this do you feel powerful just holding that this is how you launch cyber attacks around the globe oh wow they use this little mug for cooking and preparing soup it's kind of like a kettle but it's a kettle f food let's try a cook mug oh hey mug in nice I want to say this is all desk equipment very cute cuddly Mouse M Mouse like an extreme version of a wrist bre let's get one of those his basket was not big enough we got a wa what the hell is this it's actually got a little socket to squish the butt the back side of a dog yeah it does feel quite good oh la la this is like when Mom says we have moue at home look at this so ugly but I intrigued CAU it on the first bounce how was I meant to assume that that was going to come out so you can tell what's Happening Here is it's got the optical sensor on the inside and so instead of tracking the position of the mouse on the table it's tracking the position of the ball very very interesed ball sounded like one when I dropped it that was such a horrible noise oh the mice keep going these are all mice this is keyboards let's just go for this the noise is kind of nice at first I think D me m yeah how loud it is keep someone up at night what's this wao it almost looks like it's like sucking the teeth and then that one's piling into the gas yeah so this spins around extremely fast and as it spins you can like dig it in between your teeth it's like proper dentist equipment at home you can buy one right now and I can buy one right now8 which I will uh this is very interesting let's get it does this tone your feet it's supposed to mimic walking I think I've always thought of the idea of exercise equipment that you can have done to you as opposed to you having to do that sounds very lazy well this might be it this might be it you can stand on that and it'll move your feet and that's the same as walking just generally the beauty section here is vast as is shaving and it makes me realize very very few men here have a beard buy like a laser guided shaver I think it's a great idea oh you got to get that what is that ion boost moisture it moisturizes your face and warms it it's probably the single most Cur first piece of tech I've ever seen at least you've got your thumbnail sort of oh true true go on Halloween face mask doing this for you Chris we were making good progress in the store but then we saw the camera section and it genuinely stopped us in our tracks my favorite bit every camera every lens every accessory if you're into film making photography this is heaven on Earth this is a $20,000 camera here it's very difficult to find this what have you got there oh my God didn't even see the end of the lens I can see into another dimension with this feels like criminal sort of technology that says 125 times optical zoom 4K so if I zoom in wow wow oh my goodness it just keeps going oh my god wow look at the size of the lens to get this kind of magnification you have to create massive difference between the glass and the sensor my God don't drop that it looks like an RPG look at the size of the camera and then the size of the lens it looks like the kind of thing you'd use to contact extraterrestrial life look at that looks like a devil oh they've got shocks here definitely get a pair of those oh my God those are the bang and olivon configurable panels so each one of these panels is a speaker the more you connect in the bigger your speaker system becomes yeah oh my goodness me you actually get so much sound separation because your audio source to spread across such a wide distance base is not bad either that's so cool like it's a piece of integrated Furniture that's also like a really good audio Source but it's so expensive wow that's interesting yeah in a suitcase a record player in a suitcase with baked in speakers balmuda this is the company that makes the best Toaster I've ever experienced they've Diversified I'm curious what they're going to do with the speaker but we have to find out following on your theme of seethrough transparent they things it almost looks like the speaker's missing something it's really weird I think we have to get that man Bal muda all over the place here what is this the Gohan the rice cooker should we get a rice cooker we've seen these robots this is called Lok look how insanely animated it is the way it moves do you want a hug oh okay they recognize remember your face and sort of remember like who you are oh my God it reacts to touch and it like it moves in actually a really similar way to my cat oh no you want some okay oh okay all I'm so sorry I'm going to have to go I feel like I've just inherited two children oh goodness what it supposed to do it says the most popular toy in Japan but why great question uh I'm scared it's a little bit scary yeah this is all like Nintendo switch they've got an actual Mario branded racing wheel I didn't know that even existed I didn't know that existed Jes yeah that is insane oh my God we don't have this in the UK what a purch they've got completely separate joycon styles that are much thicker than the normal ones I think that's a must I love upgrading my switch it's like a upgraded version of the Nintendo switch doc we're going to need a bigger basket oh this is interesting it's called grip chip it looks like an additional layer you can put onto your controller that makes it grippier studless trigger so you can upgrade the feel of your switch triggers yeah it's amazing this a first person shooter assist ring it's apparently going to improve the controls when playing on the switch which to be fair it desperately needs what's this oh it's headphones that you don't need to wear on your head feel like an awkward hug it's like plastic and cold on your neck oh wow keyboard cleaner assuming it's yeah a way to clean your electronics cuz it can get into spaces that most cleaners can't all right we have bought far too much stuff now it's time to turn our tickets into products and this took hours as for every single ticket the employees had to head into a warehouse and individually find them none of this makes any sense in some ways Japanese culture is so automatic and smart in other ways it's so manual they just got shelves and shelves of the same phone and there people handling all of the moving Parts we're going down through every single floor handing in our tickets and picking up the items and the uh shopping bags of recruting I really don't know what people are looking at right now we [Music] test and on our way back Chris decided there was one more heck highlight we needed to see while we were in Japan hello phenomenal it's got like individual finger dexterity if I moved away would it just look at you now wow I'm scared we are being escorted to a table by a robotic waiter we got four options here it says talk dance game special I'm feeling very sad my girlfriend left me is there anything else you enjoy doing that you can focus on to help take your mind off things I play breath of the Wild that's great playing video games can be a fun and effective way to take your mind off it's definitely using chat too the way it responds that fast and then presumably that can take our order as well no so we can't do that we do that on QR code not quite as impressive we try a dance casual robot flying in the background terrifying this is part of the restaurant if you order Ramen at this restaurant the staff won't make it in the kitchen they'll come over to this vending machine there's so many parts to this it's got like spring onion it's got pork it's got eggs that mushroom do you think the bowl is pre-made with all the ingredients in the right place and it's just putting hot water on most likely wow smells interesting everything's there it's just kind of jumbl together if I didn't know that came out the microwave I might be like oh okay restaurant Robin aesthetically that looks a tier above any pot noodle I've had before it's a solid five out of 10 solid five okay well that is the single biggest in-person shop I've ever done in my life so let's go roughly from least expensive to the most expensive to see what Japan really has to offer in an actual Japanese Dojo so starting with all these cheap and cheerful Nintendo switch accessories the thing that I'm trying to figure out is can these simple little additions actually take this fairly expensive console to the next level so for these joystick enhancers you get three different levels you get easy you get soft and then you get hard which seems to correlate with how dense that foam is and therefore how much resistance it will add to your joysticks and it's a really cool idea because the foam is squishy it doesn't stop your joystick from reaching the end but it just means that with the same amount of force you're now performing subtler emotions I'd give them a seven out of 10 these trigger covers they're also an easy win in that they protect your actual buttons while also adding an insane amount of grip thanks to this tire likee texture and then these grip pads are interesting but they're not for me they're like these very soft squishy almost rubbery stickers which you can place onto your switch like that and they further reduce the chance of you dropping it they do feel nice it's just I think the switch already looks good as it is it doesn't need clutter but now is where we can take these upgrades to the next level so this right here is a joy-con and while there is a lot to like about it how you can very easily slip them on slip them off how they help to keep the console compact they have problems mostly in the fact that they're just small and fiddly with very cramped not very precise controls so has this comp Hy managed to do one better well I mean the second you clip this In For the First Time The Answer feels like a very resounding yes assuming you've got a little bit of extra width and depth to be able to store them they really feel like moving up from a kid's toy to an adult's toy like notice how much grippier and meater they are compared to the normal joy-cons so your hands can really curve around them the joysticks have way more height which allows them to be less stubby so you have more precise control they've got a whole extra configurable button on the back and they're lighter than joycons which means that assuming you're using your console in this handheld position the moment you clip them in this is a straight up allaround upgrade the catch though really just comes from the fact that it's not Nintendo making these accessories so they don't have all of the luxuries that would come with that so they have no built-in battery they can't work while detached from the console you don't get motion controls you don't get HD Rumble you can't use tabletop mode and you can't just snap one off hand it to your friend and play some co-op lacking friends in this moment so I'll give him a six out of 10 but while we're talking about the switch this is the supposedly upgraded switch dock so I initially thought this was going to be a replacement for the switch dock it's not it actually Clips onto the back of it and blows Air at it I was really excited about it in the shop but seeing it on using it now I can't help but feel like it's a little bit pointless because yes it means you can take your switch out and put it back in in the horizontal position but is that distinctly easier than just doing it in the vertical I don't think so also the switch console itself already has its own fan on the inside which is designed to kick into gear when you put it into the docking station so I've just never encountered a situation where I need or call it so 4 out of 10 but to properly finish this switch setup off two things first the neck speaker and second the shockingly premium looking official Mario steering wheel now what I've been really trying to figure out with this speaker is why does it exist obviously somebody has thought it's a good idea a board of directors has approved it Engineers have designed it what is the purpose of wearing your speakers around your neck because on the face of it it does seem like a kind of dumb idea well it doesn't take very long of using it to realize that it isn't this is like having a set of four speakers directly firing into your ears perfectly positioned for gaming like let's say you're playing a first-person shooter game and a character behind you is moving because the speakers are positioned all the way around your head you will hear those footsteps behind you oh and it does also have a microphone embedded inside of it so you can talk to your friends while playing now obviously this is stuff that a good pair of headphones can also achieve but it's just that because it's on your neck as opposed to kind of suffocating your ears nothing beats the comfort of this my only complaint is that it doesn't have the thumping base that I would quite like to feel as let's say I'm getting shot in a game of cod happens a lot so the sound Slayer is a solid seven as for the wheel though I got to say this feels like the luxury Mario Kart experience I have owned a few of these wheels in the past on like the PS2 and the PS3 Gran Turismo but the thing that's really surprising here is that this Mario Kart wheel is actually the most realistic like just after a massive turning look how the wheel swings back into the central position you got so many more button options than you do on a normal joy-con like even these paddles at the back they feel fantastic and the steering wheel grips too they are probably plastic but they definitely have a leather-like quality to them all that said I don't know how much I can recommend this I mean for starters it's cable City over here the wheel has one cable the pedals have a whole separate cable nothing is Wireless but then also this is Mario Kart I'm not saying Mario Kart doesn't have skill it absolutely does but it's just it feels weird to be using such a prole piece of equipment for a game where a randomly generated turbo mushroom at just the right time is going to be the difference between winning and losing the game's almost too accessible like it actually has an inbuilt option for your character to steer on your behalf at which point you feel a bit silly investing almost $200 on a proper steering wheel to try and be as good as that o all this activity working up a bit of an appetite so it's a good thing that we now have two pieces of Japanese technology that are going to help us cook first is the cook mug which is what I'm going to use to preper soup so the cook mug is a fairly simple but still pretty interesting idea so let's say you live on your own and you mostly cook just for yourself then the concept of this product is that you can cook and you can eat from the same receptacle so here we have some hot and sour vermicelli soup which I bought this morning from Supermarket one thing you will learn very quickly about Japan is plastic wrapping B put it on everything so open it up noodles looks nice and unprocessed look at that fresh vegetables oh wow M that smells really good smell it oh wao you went back for seconds so we got boiling water we're going to pour that into the fill line you plug it in and then you basically just select which setting you want to run it on now I will say a few of the practical ities aren't quite there like for a product that's designed to be picked up and put down and picked up and put down there's got to be a docking system or something as opposed to this massive cable sticking out the back and then also this handle actually will not fit my hand in maybe that's just a me problem but we'll save the verdict until I've eaten from it and then the second part of this equation is the balmuda rice cooker cuz honestly Japanese people have rice everything now me personally I am one of those simpletons who just Cooks as rice in a pan but here in Japan it is a very normal thing to carry around a rice cooker and this should be the best of the best so my first impression with this was a damn that's premium but also be there's a lot of wasted space here then I realized something you know the balmuda toaster that I constantly talk about the one that basically Cooks bread by using a stream of water vapor around it that cooks the outside but keeps the inside soft and fluffy this does a very similar thing to Rice so it's basically got a lower chamber which you fill with 180 ML of water and don't you love the little container so this is the water that's going to become Steam and then on top of that is where you put your normal rice cooking stuff so that's basically rice and water in a 1:1 ratio so we'll just use one of these cups we'll fill on with water something really Zen about the ritual of rice me and we seal it up and let it do its thing so the idea here is that the rice is going to cook to a normal level using the water that we're already putting it inside with but then the steam comes in taking the cooked rice and then almost recasing it back up so that it's got this grainy individualistic texture as opposed to just this kind of gloopy substance that all sticks together that's the idea but we'll only know for sure if it works when we come back and taste it at the end and while that's going I think it's time we build a proper work setup right here on our very authentic looking Japanese table I know this looks really uncomfortable by the way but once you're in they figured something out it feels great plus look at this sliding armrest so the mouse mat or should I say catm is as we expected nothing uh technologically groundbreaking but I do like it I mean aside from bringing joyous cat imagery to the workplace it's very sticky so it's not going anywhere it's literally easier to move the table than it is the mouse map and all these little tfts very squishy very comfortable and I don't know if they did this on purpose or not but it actually creates three distinct very comfortable angles that you can come at to your desk from the only compromise is that it doesn't actually leave much room for your mouse to move around on but that will not actually be a problem for us because this right here is our ball Mouse and there's something that feels both really futuristic and also really dated about it like the idea that you can now completely move around your screen without physically having to move your wrist at all is very freeing and it's definitely less total effort expended I keep naturally trying to move it around like this only to be like oh my God yeah I don't have to do that anymore it's just that for me at least if I actually want fine control over this ball I can't just rest my thumb on it I actually have to raise my thumb and use the tip to guide it and at that point it just feels like quite an unnatural stretch to have to hold so for me this is a file the keyboard though I am really starting to rate so this is made by Logitech who in Japan actually calls themselves logy cool cuz I guess that's how you appeal to the younger generation but the product itself is really well thought out I paid $80 for this and for that I've got 85 Keys each with their own individual Cherry MX Brown switch mechanism which giv gives a nice satisfying bump every time you hit the trigger point without being too loud you can connect it to up to three different devices at the same time and then flick between them using the one two 3 buttons there's a dictation button for whenever you want to speak something instead of typing it and that works pretty well too but what makes this the pop Keys keyboard is these These are basically instant emojis so that will do the heart phase that will do the crying phase this will bring up the menu for all your emojis and they've even given you alternative options so let's say I want to swap the heart smiley for the fire I just take that key cap out put the fire one in and then pull up Logitech software to reconfigure what that key means it doesn't feel like a super high-end product but it also doesn't feel cheap so for $80 I would give this an8 out of 10 oh I just noticed it started steaming theatric that's actually kind of nice and now time for the pie to resistance I've always been curious about the idea of an air duster and this one right here is everything I was hoping it would be it's just a smart smart product essentially this body funnels air from this side to this side it's got two different power levels so that's just number one and that's true so what does that mean well for starters it means it can blow so let's say I'm very messy eating a cookie over my brand new keyboard God this is painful you just pick it up flick the nozzle that way and then because the air is traveling from this side to that side in theory I should just be able to blow this right off my goodness that is phenomenal one little one left in there you disapprove so my keyboard is Chrome free nothing else is but then I guess this is where the other side comes in so because air is coming in there and going out there this side can be a vacuum so if we stick the filter on and then whichever nozzle we think suits the situation best it really looks like an interplanetary space gun that that is not bad at all look at this not going to be making ASMR Tik toks right now the fact that it's also got bristles at the end it allows you to kind of nudge out the bits that are stuck into the nooks and crannies of your products this is an easy nine okay that's enough of me sitting down it's time for a workout Japanese style this is the sixpad foot fit and the sixpad clothing and from what I could gather from the floor sales people this is an extremely fast growing thing here for people who are starting to feel unhealthy and I guess want shortcuts to getting fit 3 2 1 okay this is pretty tight and it's actually about to get tighter because essentially you got to make sure that every single one of the contact points is in complete contact with your skin right so this is the top controller that's going to go into our jacket and then this is the bottom controller it's going to go onto our shorts and the idea of these controllers is that they're going to send electrical impulses through my body very very quickly to force my muscles to contract but like 100 times a minute maybe more oh my my goodness oh I've done something like this before with the Slender tone belt but that was literally just ABS this is ah it's everything it's going like my whole body is like pulsing at the same time it comes and goes and burst so I fully believe experts in this field when they say that stuff like this is not quite the real deal but at the same time my heart rate is up my muscles are Contracting and I am starting to sweat a little so I'd be very shocked if this is actually doing nothing could you just be like reading a book and going about your D dat I actually really like the fact that it's a full body experience instead of just a belt cuz like I If you're going to be uncomfortable you might as well be fully uncomfortable and actually get all the benefits from it it's kind of both quite scary but also really cool Tech it's not like getting punched around it's like you know you're at the end of your workout and your friend is shouting in your ear just one more rep except you have no say in it but there is more so this is the foot Fit Plus and it's kind of like the same thing but for your feet and your lower legs there is also an upper leg connection but fell out my legs were already covered and this is actually the product out of all of the sixpad things that I could see myself using on a regular basis because you don't have to strap yourself up into a skin tight water suit so there's a bunch of different modes there's training there's conditioning and there's walking which is meant to simulate the gains that you would get from doing lots of steps when it's on a low power it's kind of like a a crawling creeping feeling and then as you start to turn it up oh goodness me I turned that up way too high can you see my muscles tensing up as that happens okay I got a bit Brave with the level this is on 20 out of 23 and it does feel a little bit like a torture device oh that's so freaky when it sends the signal my toes naturally curl up and I cannot straighten them oh my God so this is cool Tech all of this is really cool Tech and I'm so with the vision I just need to see some more conclusive proof of the benefits before I recommend it now this little camera I'm really excited for cuz it almost feels like it is purpose built for the Japanese Market they seem to really like cute Tech but in this case it's not just an aesthetic thing this has a very functional benefit too to the point where I would genuinely consider using this on a day-to-day basis why well you know this whole idea that I've really started to love of leaving the house without your phone and just taking a Polaroid to capture photos to be able to be more present in the moment well the problem with that is that Polaroids are massive and so what insts have done here is basically separated the camera component with the printing component so you leave this at home this is what you take with you so you can take up to 50 photos on it and you do it like so say peace oh here we go and I know the Instinct for people is to kind of take it and wiggle it around in the air but what you're actually meant to do is to just lay it on the flat ground we'll just stick it in this dark room for a minute so the quality is well like all cameras in this category not the best but there are some smart features like being able to pick what aspect ratio that your photo is print at or choose the sound your camera makes as it's capturing but by far the coolest thing is let's say you take a selection of photos and you don't want to print every single one you can do this so it looks like I'm printing a normal photo right now but let me develop that this is one of the photos we took but also in the corner that's a QR code so you have this one as like a physical memory which I could so imagine being like the cover photo of your holiday and then you want to see more you scan with your phone and it leads you to the rest of them I think that's such a good idea I'm going to give this product a nine right then we have the ion boost face mask which I have to say sounds like a load of marketing nonsense but here's the idea so the average person nowadays spends a lot more both time and money on their skincare products we've got moisturizers we've got toners we've got night creams and day creams and this is not an addition to that but it's designed to enhance the effectiveness of that entire routine apparently using the power of both positive and negative ions good lord well if this isn't the mask in the next Scream movie I will be thoroughly disappointed I was really hoping it' feel something o o it's getting really hot I would be alarmed but if there's one thing I do trust the Japanese with it's skincare they know how to do it when you get used to it it's actually kind of nice now it's obviously a very tough one to rate since I mean I'll have to wait 20 years to let you know if it has actually improved my skincare routine but they could have made it look a bit better couldn't they and while we're on the subject of beauty turns out the toothbrush looking thing that I picked up is not a toothbrush it's in fact a tooth polishing kit and don't get me wrong I think this is an awesome concept anything that means I can spend less time visiting the dentist I'm interested it's just the execution of this product is a bit of a Miss I mean even just disregarding the fact that the front of the box says the sooner with the prevention of your mouth and I hope my mouth doesn't get prevented the thing runs of AAA batteries Which smart toothbrushes ditched like 10 years ago and also the whole experience just feels like a really unsatisfying squeaky toothbrush what I'm saying is that there will be a way of doing the polishing in a way that feels better than this three out of 10 all right let's just quickly see how our food is doing wow that one's going to take a while this one oh you can actually hear it boiling oh just stay here for 2 minutes all right moving further up the price ladder it's speaker time I honestly can't get enough of audio products they're the best thing so first up is the record player which is something that I would say I've not fully appreciated until about 2 months ago when I got one for my fiance and we spent the entire evening just curled up on a couch listening to the same record again and again and again now most turntables they need a separate preamp and they need a separate set of external speakers and so what's really interesting about this apart from the fact that it's a suitcase is just the fact that it's everything it's the turntable it's the amp it's the speaking because and it's a battery because the entire thing can be used on the go so the question is how does it sound I recently realized actually that Mozart is royaltyfree so that is what we're going to be listening to oh wow love that warmth oh my goodness that's the charm of listening to a record whether or not it actually improves the quality questionable okay I've had a good listen to this and my take is I don't think this product makes sense I want to love it as the the allinone vinyl solution but I think either you decide you either decide you want portability and you go for a proper mini Bluetooth speaker or you decide you want the vinyl experience and you sit down you get the setup you get the preamp you get the external speakers because you can tell the sound of this is very much compromised and not getting the most out of this okay I'm sorry I just really like the aesthetic of this Bal muda company so this is their speaker and while for the price you're not actually getting a lot of speaker what you are getting is Major style and character like just look at this this is the pairing animation it's so sick if you look closely you'll see a whole load of small little lights on the inside it's got six within those tubes in the middle and then six in this ring on the outside and genuinely watching those dance around to the music you're playing especially at night it is mesmerizing and I know I'm acting like this lighting is God's gift to mankind but I want to emphasize that it's more than what it seems see it's one thing to build a speaker with a set of lights that pulse when the Bas hits that's what this outer ring does but see the inner ring is completely different it reacts to the middle and the high Nots and so what you get feels very much like a complete three-dimensional lighting experience that captures not just the drops but actually the entire Vibe and shape of the music but let me just show you okay song playing building up to a drop but see how it's still lit up and now flood lights when the base drops so you still get that in impact but even in the meantime it's very much like keeping up with the rhythm of the song so yeah in case it wasn't already clear I really really love this speaker but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the most practical like if they spent a little bit less energy focusing on lighting they could get a bigger battery in there and the sound I mean it's really well tuned for what it is but there's only so much that it can whack you in the face with bass when it's this small so I'm going to give it an eight but that shouldn't be as much of an issue for our next product the transparent speaker wow it actually comes with a set of gloves for the unboxing it makes sense and actually highlights one of the downsides of a transparent speaker in that any fingerprint will be visible from all angles but that does not take away from how pretty this thing looks when set up I mean of all the transparent Tech that I've tested in recent memory the TV the controllers this is by far the most effective because a it's not affecting the functionality all a speaker needs to be is a large air chamber and then a way to propel the air and then B it's also also one of the most unexpected products to see in this transparent form I like that the controls are tucked away from the glass so there's less chance of you dirtying it and also they feel so good oh yeah and audio quality definitely a step up from the balmuda you're still paying extra for Style with a product like this but at the same time I would class this audio quality as on the upper end of consumer grade speakers like so if I were to review their overall price to Performance ratio I'd give them a seven right let's talk about phones so there's two phones here there's the r1s watch phone which is for kids and then there's the actual proper Japanese flagship phone now I got to say this watch phone is the least convincing packaging I think I've ever seen a phone come in it really does feel like a toy this is designed to be your kid's first phone in Japan so what makes it good at that well for starters it's actually really easy to use you know sometimes when you pick up a new smartwatch you're kind of feeling like you're having to skirt round a virtual maze to figure out figure out how to do the things you want to do this is literally watch face and then flick down for a few of the extra bits you can customize your watch face by holding down on it and there's two rows of different options here the bottom one being entirely animated I mean I as a grown adult could see myself having a lot of fun with this and then there's just a whole load of little thoughtful touches like for example brightness when you click brightness it doesn't open up a new slider or menu you just tap it to cycle between the different levels of brightness the SIM card tray completely tooless it's got a wicked music interface it's got a camera how often do you see a SmartWatch with a camera but the quality is bad enough that you will only use it if you absolutely have to but here's the Crux of it this is what I think would be the reason most parents consider buying one of these this button right here is an SOS button you press and hold that for 5 seconds and all of your family members will get a notification they'll get your exact GPS coordinates and a 30-second voice recording of your situation that's cool T and also on the back heart rate monitor so a parent can set what they want to be the upper limit for for their kids heart rate and then anytime the kid exceeds that the watch will actually tell them to take a break from what they're currently doing so don't let this toy like exteror fool you this is a high-tech genuinely useful bit of gear I'd give it a nine and now just before our next level race From Another Dimension we got the Aquas R8 Pro that we worked so hard to get our hands on and I have to say initial Impressions slightly tainted it feels like the carriers have a lot of control over the Japanese market and this phone is a good example of what happens when that happens like right from the moment you set up the phone is riddled with extra menus and extra data collection and it's pre-installed with so much bloatware and also these companies like dok they're controlling the entire way that you buy a smartphone there's so much friction and it honestly sucks but that's actually Such a Pity because the phone itself has so many cool ideas like the fingerprint scanner for example massive you put your finger anywhere in this area it'll work or like swipe up on something with two fingers it'll initiate Autos scrolling why is this the first time I've ever seen that feature you can take screenshots just by tapping and holding one of the top corners I love how every single time I lock and unlock my phone both my lock screen and my home screen wallpaper will change it's got the ability to not just set your refresh rate to Auto but actually Force some apps to run at higher refresh rates which makes the camera for example feel really fluid what about the cameras then well the first time I tested this I was completely flawed the room we're staying in is right next to Tokyo Tower so the first thing I did on this phone when I booted it up was went outside and took a side-by-side photo of that really brightly lit Tower with this in the iPhone 15 Pro Max and honestly this was a better photo sadly though bit of a one-off as I continued to test it with the iPhone it became very clear that actually overall it gets absolutely pasted it feels five generations behind so the way I'm seeing this is really great ideas that I wish were present on all international phones but just very mediocre execution like I cannot believe the company actually let menus like this pass it often just looks bad five out of 10 all right food is nearly ready let's quickly talk about shocks what's really different about shocks is that their entire brand philosophy revolves around openair technology so being immersed in your sound yes but while still being aware of what's happening in the world around you I remember buying a pair of shocks years ago for that exact reason and let me tell you they've come a long way since then and actually here in Japan you see a lot of people wearing these so these are shock's new open fit earphones and the key technology behind them is air conduction so instead of a normal pair of earphones that block up your ear canal and thus your ability to hear anything else these shars sit outside your air canal and they use a really cool bit of self-developed tech called direct pitch which means you can hear your music you can hear the world around you but the world around you can't hear your music and this has two major perks first is the Comfort the fact that nothing's actually going inside of your ear means it's very easy to forget these things are even on and I had doubts about the bass because of that but let me tell you the Bas hits you like a a truck and the second part of it is the awareness whenever I'm in public and I see someone else wearing traditional noise cancelling earphones whether they're crossing the road or driving a car I won't lie to you it makes me a bit nervous it's really important to just be aware of other people and so the open fits fill that void not to mention the build quality is A+ the speaker unit on the inside is made from carbon fiber 20 times stronger than steel and the actual ear cushions Ultra Soft silicone Link in the description to learn more yes okay all right see what it's cooked up so the rice grains are as promised still very separate it doesn't feel like it's glued together into one substance so the idea of this cook mug is as soon as you're done cooking you unplug it and it just has a cute warm function so get some rice in there now let's [Music] see oh my goodness me it's subtle it's not going to change the very definition of rice but you know normally when you have curry with rice and you're kind of there for the curry and the rice is just kind of patting up the meal didn't feel like that here the rice is actually its own distinct character that's adding so I'm going to give this a seven and I'm going to give this a nine I hope you enjoyed our little Japanese culture trip I will catch you in the next one
