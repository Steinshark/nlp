In 1969, Ted Codd laid out 
the idea of the relational   model database in a paper. Nobody understood it. A year later, he wrote a different 
paper. And it blew people's minds.   His relational data model structured 
data into tables, and championed the   idea of "data independence" - shielding the 
user from how data is physically stored. Radical stuff. But Codd's papers only 
laid out how such a software should   work. There were no products yet. 
And there were so many questions. Can such a database process queries 
efficiently without a supercomputer?   Can an automatic system navigate better 
than a human can? Only one way to find out. In this video, we look at the dawn and rise 
of SQL and the relational database industry. ## Phase Zero When Codd's papers came out,   IBM already had a database product - 
Information Management System or IMS. IMS was very good. Though IBM was open 
to alternative database softwares - if   it sold them more machines, more 
on that later - IMS took up the   majority of their focus and resources. 
Relational model work was distracting. So in 1973, IBM management moved all 
of the various IBM people experimenting   with relational model databases out to 
the IBM Santa Teresa Lab in San Jose,   so that they can work alongside Codd himself. There, the team began work on 
a software implementing Codd's   ideas. The first stage of which was 
called Phase Zero. Why call it that? Well, IBM's System/360 designer Fred Brooks 
wrote in the famous book "Mythical Man Month":   "Plan to throw one away, you will anyway". So 
this Phase Zero was meant to be thrown away - a   quick and dirty thing to test the waters 
and get a sense of what we are dealing with. At the heart of Phase Zero was an 
implementation of a new query language   that Don Chamberlin and Ray Boyce 
had recently invented called Sequel,   or SQL later on. They later released a paper on it 
and presented it at a famous conference in 1974. Anyway, this Sequel implementation 
was written on top of another IBM-made   software called XRM. XRM handled the 
lower-level stuff - such as the physical   access to the data. It was basically 
pulled off the metaphorical shelf. Phase Zero was a limited product. XRM only 
supported one user at a time. And only certain   SQL functions were implemented. For instance, it 
cannot do "joins", which is a fairly big deal. After having demonstrated the feasibility of 
creating new tables, the new SQL language,   and even briefly test-running it with a user, 
Phase Zero was thrown away as planned. Then   in 1975, the 12+ member team started on the 
actual customer-facing product - Phase One. ## Ingres
Meanwhile at UC Berkeley, another effort to build a relational model database 
software was well under way. In 1971, Berkeley Professors Eugene 
“Gene” Wong and Michael Stonebraker   read the Codd papers and loved what they read. So in 1972, they got some grants from 
the National Science Foundation and   other organizations to start a little 
research project called Ingres. The name   came from some consultant and stands for 
Interactive Graphics and Retrieval System. For its data query language, Ingres did not use 
Sequel but a new thing that Wong designed called   QUEL, standing for Query Language. Stonebraker and 
Wong read the original Sequel paper and hated it. Though after a few rewrites, QUEL and 
SQL became largely similar with the   possible exception in how they handled "joins". By 1975, Ingres could run a query. Despite having 
far fewer resources - just 1-2 PhD students rather   than a team of 12 - Ingres progressed and its 
adoption grew to 50 or 60 installations by 1977. This was partly due to luck. Stonebraker 
had a DEC minicomputer and asked Unix   pioneer Ken Thompson - then doing a stint 
at Berkeley - to come install Unix on it. Stonebraker likes to say that it was one 
of the first Unix installations outside of   Bell Labs. Probably not true but it sounds 
fun. Might go on a Reddit thread someday. Anyway, so Ingres by way of association became 
one of the first database softwares to be   on Unix. As Unix BSD spread to universities 
around the world, Ingres came along with it. ## System R Back to IBM. With Phase One, the relational 
database project got a name - System R. The "R" is said to stand for "Relations" or   "Rufus" - the name of one 
of the team members' dog. System R was set up in two parts - a higher and 
lower level part. At the top of the higher level   system is the Relational Data Interface. This is 
where you submit a query in the Sequel language. The lower system was the Relational Storage 
System, which replaces XRM. It optimizes   the query and figures out how to access the 
data. Mechanisms were added to make it more   robust against failures and enable multi-user 
concurrency. Which is harder than it sounds. In doing this work on concurrency, System R 
team member Jim Gray formalized the concept   of a "transaction". That concept later 
evolved into what is now ACID - Atomicity,   Consistency, Isolation and Durability. These concepts guarantee the validity 
of our data when errors, failures,   and mishaps inevitably happen. Without them,   today's e-commerce and other vital electronic 
transactions cannot be trusted. It is a big deal. For his work on transactions, Gray won 
the 1998 Turing Award - the Nobel of the   computer sciences. Sadly, he later vanished 
while sailing the waters near San Francisco. By late 1976, System R got to a state 
where the team felt comfortable seeding   it to potential customers. Early 
users included Pratt & Whitney in   Connecticut and Boeing in Seattle. 
Both used it for inventory control. ## Competition The two teams at IBM San Jose 
and Berkeley knew of each other   of the time. And that injected a bit of 
a competitive air into the whole thing. They were in contact with each 
other too. Ted Codd actually   shuttled between the two to check on 
progress ... and probably seed ideas.   He felt no particular loyalty to System 
R after he wasn't placed in charge of it. And the aforementioned Jim Gray - 
who got his PhD at Berkeley - also   helped transmit information between 
the two teams in the early years.   Even bringing the Ingres team to 
the IBM offices and vice versa. So we have System R and Ingres. System R was 
backed by a big company, IBM. But it was not ready   yet and since IBM already had a database product 
they weren’t too much in a hurry to bring it out. Ingres on the other hand was out 
there and spreading along with   Unix. But it was not a commercial 
product - just a research project.   Stonebraker did it solely to 
get famous enough for tenure. Thus, we have a big gaping opportunity 
for a commercial relational product   out there in the market. The seas 
parting for someone to run through. ## Oracle The company now known as Oracle has a chaotic 
history. We shall stick to the main points. The company was founded by 
Larry Ellison, Bob Miner,   and Ed Oates in 1977 as Software Development 
Laboratories. They began as a consulting company   developing software for customers, 
but wanted to pivot into products. At the time, the database industry was booming - 
with products like ADABAS by Software AG, IMS by   IBM or Total by Cincom. Aggregate sales of such 
software in 1978 was estimated at $130 million. Ellison and company thought that people 
might be interested in a database software   for the growing minicomputer market. Then 
they came across Ted Codd's papers on the   relational model and IBM's publications 
on SQL. Both were in the public domain. Ellison immediately saw the potential. Compared 
to the existing products on the market,   the relational model was far easier for 
less sophisticated users to query their   database. There were data integrity benefits too 
- since data only existed in just one table row. So Ellison changed the name of his 
company to Relational Software Inc,   or RSI. And with money left over 
from consulting projects as well as   a PDP-11 loaned from a client, they hacked 
together Version 1 of the Oracle database. The Oracle name came from a terabit memory product   for the CIA that Ellison had worked on 
back when he was at Ampex Corporation. The name is familiar, right? Ampex was the 
American company that produced magnetic tape   recorders. They make an appearance in the 
Japanese VCR video. Go check that one out. Anyway, the CIA finds out that Ellison stole their 
product name and comes knocking, quite upset.   Somehow, Ellison sells the heck out of it and 
signs the CIA as the first user of the software! Thus in 1979, Oracle Version 2 comes out. It 
was a simple but fairly complete implementation   of SQL with joins, subqueries, and 
views. Version 1 was never released. ## Oracle's Principles Ellison positioned the Oracle product to 
ride a number of major technology trends. First, the Oracle database had to 
be completely compatible with SQL.   He figured that IBM will eventually 
come out with a SQL product of their   own. When that happens then SQL 
would be the industry standard. Famously, Ellison called the IBM System R 
team to learn their error codes. He wanted   to make Oracle compatible with whatever 
IBM was building. But IBM management   kept those error codes a secret - the 
only part of the whole project as such. Second, Ellison wanted the database to 
be compatible with all types of computer   hardware. This request originally came from 
the CIA, who wanted the software to run on   all of their various computers. But Ellison 
then turned it into a competitive advantage. The high-level C programming language - then 
emerging in the world alongside Unix - helped   in this regard. Oracle version 3 - released 
in 1983 - was entirely written in C, which   meant that you can compile it for mainframes, 
minicomputers and even microcomputers or PCs. In late 1977, DEC released the VAX-11 
minicomputer. Boasting mainframe-like   power at a fraction of the price, 
the VAX was massively successful.   Over a hundred thousand were sold 
over the 10 years after release. The VAX-11 helped jumpstart BSD Unix's popularity. 
It also presented a green field opportunity for   Oracle. DEC did make a database software for 
their minicomputer, but it was non-relational. So the team ported over Oracle Version 
2 - originally written for the older   PDP-11 minicomputer but compatible with the VAX. That bridged things until Version 3 which ran 
natively - again thanks to C. As a result,   the Oracle Database was the 
only SQL software available   for a very popular platform. The VAX 
played a huge part in Oracle's rise. But RSI's programmers ported the Oracle software   to every hardware platform - Pyramid, 
Sequent, Data General, Apollo, so on. The joke went that Oracle ran on everything, 
but the best platform it ran on was the slide   projector. I don’t know how many of you 
guys are going to laugh at that one. To further build on this second idea 
of portability, Ellison envisioned a   distributed database connected over 
networks. This well fit the growing   trend of networked computers taking place at 
the time. Little last thing but important. ## Head Start After nabbing the CIA, Oracle database 
quickly found more government users. This included military customers like 
the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base   and Fort Meade. As well as the Food and Drug 
Administration or FDA - which in turn pushed   the private drug-makers to adopt Oracle 
so that they can share data with the FDA. The Oracle software back then was not that 
stable. But that was okay at the time. Many early   customers were internal departments and small 
businesses who just wanted to query their data   for insights. They didn't need IMS or all that 
jazz and SQL was just readable enough for them. It was the right product for the 
right customer at the right time.   RSI the company doubled each year 
for the next ten years. In 1982,   they changed their name to "Oracle Systems" - a 
reflection of their flagship product's popularity. ## Ingres Goes Commercial By late 1978 or 1979, Ingres has about 
300 people using it. Basically for free. Per the license, all someone needed to 
do to use Ingres was to sign a 20 page   licensing agreement and pay $75 to 
get a big tape with the source code. Under that license agreement, 
anyone can use it - though not   for commercial activities. Supposedly a town 
in Maine was using it for counting votes. But then came along serious customers wanting 
to use it for serious things. In 1977,   the New York Telephone Company adopted Ingres to 
store information about Manhattan telephone lines.   That was when the Ingres team really started 
to learn what it means to service customers. Then in 1978, Arizona State University 
wanted to use Ingres to keep records   on their 40,000 students. They were 
willing to adopt Unix and deal with   all of its weird ownership issues to 
do it, but stopped short upon finding   out that there was no version of Unix 
in COBOL, and they were a COBOL shop. The bitter incident taught a lesson. Ingres 
was an incredible product. But - to quote a   certain someone from my prior Unix video 
- it needed to be a commercial activity. Around that time, Larry Ellison is 
telling people left and right that   Oracle is the greatest thing ever and 
ten times faster than anything else. So the guys on the Ingres team get 
a copy of Oracle database and do a   bake-off. They find that Ingres ran 
many queries faster than Oracle can,   and that finally convinced 
them to start a company. So in 1979, Larry Rowe - a Berkeley 
faculty member - joins the team with   an eye towards commercializing Ingres. The three - Wong, Stonebraker, and Rowe - recruit 
a fourth cofounder for sales and in 1980 start   Relational Technology Inc with some funding 
from the reputable Sutter Hill Ventures firm. ## Other Companies Ingres was the most prominent of the relational 
database startups to enter the market,   but not the only one. Two notable names we 
should bring up are Informix and Sybase. Informix was founded in 1980 by Roger 
Sippl, another UC Berkeley alumni. Early on,   he worked at the construction firm 
Bechtel. He had to use a database   software from Hewlett-Packard there and hated 
it. Horrible query language, very restrictive. He came across Codd's papers - or rather, the 
books written by Codd's disciple Chris Date, which   were apparently more readable. Sippl - honest 
man - didn't understand Codd's early papers. And Sippl realized that every business would 
be needing a database software running on   multi-user Unix machines. So he founded a 
company with $20,000 raised from selling   10% of the startup to an ex-girlfriend. What 
a girl. They later married, with three kids. Moral of the story? Women love databases. Anyway. Informix - the name was derived 
from "Information on Unix" - did not   use SQL as its data query language 
but rather a proprietary language   called Informer. That would later hold it back. Then we have Sybase, founded a little later 
in 1984 by Mark Hoffman and Bob Epstein in   the back porch of the latter's Berkeley 
home. They wanted to build a database   software for high performance computers 
capable of handling frequent transactions. But as they built what would 
eventually be the Sybase SQL software,   computers got faster. Fast enough that 
Sybase can be run on general-purpose   computers with powerful microprocessors 
like those from Intel, Motorola or Sun. So Sybase SQL Server targeted Sun 
Microsystems’ networked workstations,   which gave them substantial traction 
with Wall Street and other financial   firms in the mid-1980s as Sun 
skyrocketed towards the ... Sun. It also later caught the interest of Microsoft. 
And Bill Gates came down from his mountain of   money to strike a lucrative, 6-year licensing 
deal to turn Sybase SQL into Microsoft SQL Server. ## IBM Goes In
As all of this was going on, everyone knew that the giant IBM had this 
System R project gurgling in San Jose. But will IBM release it? They did. It goes back 
to a time-sharing company called National CSS. In 1975 they developed and released a 
database product called NOMAD. It was   directly influenced by Codd's 
papers and is often called the   first commercial relational database software. 
How relational it actually was, hard to say. National CSS ported NOMAD to run on 
IBM’s single-processor mainframes and   it was adopted by several big customers. They 
quite liked it and used it often. However,   NOMAD was not written to take advantage 
of IBM's newer multi-processor mainframes,   only the older single processor mainframes. But 
the latter could not handle larger NOMAD queries. As a result, two very large customers - Bank of   America and Chevron in San Francisco 
- ditched IBM for Amdahl mainframes. When something big like that happens, 
the news goes straight up the chain to   the CEO - Frank Cary. They told him about 
this new relational technology. And hey,   didn't IBM come up with this 
concept in the first place? Cary asks "Is it ours?" And they say yes. Right 
there, he decides to put it into the roadmap. ## IBM Goes Relational It took two more years for IBM to come 
out with their first relational product. At this time, IBM was organized 
into three hardware groups and   operating systems. The biggest 
and most important was Multiple   Virtual Storage or MVS for the big 
System/370 and System/390 mainframes. This operating system also housed IMS,   IBM's other big database product. Creating a 
relational database product for MVS as well   as educating customers about its 
differences with IMS was tricky. So IBM's first relational database product - which   they called SQL/DS - would run on two 
smaller operating systems - DOS/VSE and   VM/CMS. These were often used by mid-sized 
businesses to do transaction processing. SQL/DS first entered the market in 
1981. DB2 - the flagship relational   model database for the flagship 
MVS operating system - followed   some two years later in 1983. 
Neither sold well at the start. But IBM kept on iterating, and the second version 
of DB2 released in early 1986 got better traction. ## SQL Victorious IBM's entry did not wipe out the nascent 
relational software database industry. In 1984, IBM’s IMS had 50% share of the total 
database market but only 20% of new sales. In   other words, they were losing share to relational 
so they had to respond. It was a defensive move. IBM's going in with SQL validated 
Ellison's decision to make the   Oracle database compatible with 
SQL. Ingres and Informix were   going with their own data query 
languages - QUEL and Informer. Just like fetch, it wasn’t happening. 
Them not being compatible with IBM - which   means SQL - threw them onto their back feet. 
Meanwhile Oracle charged ahead into the market. In March 1986, Oracle went public. The 
relational database had transformed them   into a software giant with over $100 million in 
revenues. With the company mostly bootstrapped,   Ellison and his cofounders held onto 
most of the shares and became very rich. ## Conclusion
IBM created the relational data model, which should have given them 
prestige and credit no one else had. But at that time, IBM's top managers 
were still hardware people. For them,   software existed only to 
help them sell more machines. Until it was too late, they did not see the value 
of porting DB2 to non-IBM machines like those from   DEC and whatever else was out there. Oracle and 
the other upstarts did. They furiously ported it   like drunk rabbits - helping them grab market 
share leads that IBM could not weather away. In just about ten years, the relational 
model database went from some crazy ideas in   a few academic papers to a multi-million dollar 
industry populated by both giants and upstarts. So long the market was growing, everything would 
be fine. But that would not last forever. A   clash between these giants of the software 
database industry loomed on the horizon.
