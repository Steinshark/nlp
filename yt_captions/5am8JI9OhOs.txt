ladies and gentlemen welcome back to Norway chance 2023 this is a super Tournament being held in you guessed it Norway where there is a classical portion of the game worth three points but if the game ends in a draw the players go to an Armageddon where black has three minutes less but a draw is a win in the Armageddon portion very confusing and in the last few videos a lot of you were complaining about my intro being long well today it's not going to be long today we have El Clasico we have Hikaru Nakamura playing Magnus Carlson this is their first game of classical chess in 1300 and something days since 2019 these two have not played against each other in a classical chess tournament over the board they have played rapid they have played Blitz and I think they've played bullet they have not played classical chess so here we go and I will show you this game first I will also show you an uh a game between two of the young superstars and a massive game afterward uh which features a major update to the standings and also to the world top 5 ELO list Hikaru sits down and plays the move E4 Magnus responds E5 Knight F3 Knight C6 and we have a Spanish now Magnus likes to play A6 and then he likes to not play D6 he likes to do this Knight F6 and now Hikaru has an option to play an anti-martial which is D5 uh Marshall being the pawn going to D5 and one go but he castles now Bishop E7 now now Hikaru can again uh in this position play all sorts of different things he can play A4 he can play H3 he can play a lot of different lines D3 which you know or all kind of in some capacity surveyed in the world championship but Hikaru plays C3 and that is an invitation for Magnus to play D5 which is called the Marshall and the Marshall with black is essentially death to chess like the Marshall completely neutralizes everything that white wants because black sacrifices the center Pawn Place Pawn to C6 and is going to line up the Cannons this way Bishop D6 Queen ibishop F5 Queen H4 giving up the bishop with Queen H2 to come Hikaru goes here Knight D2 trying to go Knight you know Knight E4 Knight goes to E4 now Magnus forces a trait of queens and it looks like if white just gets a couple more moves to consolidate he's simply winning like for example if it was White's move here he can just play a three and then he'll play Bishop D2 he can also obviously take this bishop but you know point is that he is uh well first he would play Bishop H6 so that the Rook is defended but Knight D6 um but F5 and uh here come the pieces take take take take sacrificing the bishop check and in this position the players repeated moves and made a draw how do we feel about that as Spectators purely as spectators I'm I don't know what the right word is I you know obviously I want the two most popular chess players in the world by far I'm not a chess player I'm a content creator I want them to go you know Blood Sweat and Tears for four hours however you know this is an interesting kind of conundrum right so Hikaru plays E4 and the thing about Chess is that it's a silent conversation Hikaru plays E4 because Magnus a game ago played the French so kikaru is thinking he might play the French or the Sicilian but there is a chance to keep Lazy Five now kikaru claimed that it was a bit of a surprise right now if we're going here we know what Magnus wants but Hikaru might be thinking Magnus is not going to try to force a draw he'll probably go for something more ambitious but C3 is virtually a draw offer at this level of Chess I mean it it like it just is these these players they know their theory c3d5 is just like the board is dead so Hikaru goes to an Armageddon that's what Hikaru tries to do he tries to angle for an Armageddon and he gets 10 minutes to 7 and clearly this was part of the match strategy but I am you know I'm I am admittedly disappointed now now if if we can just get existential for a moment does this just mean that like classical chess is like I don't know dead for this matchup like we're not gonna get Hikaru Magnus In classical we're just not we're gonna get it in Rapid we're gonna get it in Blitz in bullet and that's really where it is El Clasico but I guess we're just not gonna get it you know I that's that's just and who knows maybe if they play in a tournament in the future and there is no Armageddon they we will get a game but this was you know I was like oh I did not expect this honestly um but that's all to say that the Armageddon begins black starts with three minutes less and we get another Hikaru Magnus game the first one was not much of a game in Hikaru I'm not joking plays the king's Gambit this man Hikaru sat down across from Magnus Carlsen played a Kings Gambit yo I do not know the last time that Magnus Carlson was on the black side of a king's Gambit I'm not even exaggerating in fact if you give me 30 seconds of time I am going to go to chessgames.com I am going to type in players Carlson and I'm going to type in King's Gambit can I even see that E4 E5 Kings Gambit find chess games Magnus Carlson has had the Kings Gambit played against him twice ever ever and the last time that that happened was in 2004 this man hasn't had a King's game but played against him in 20 years what I mean you gotta give Hikaru credit for for being theatrical Pawn takes F4 the king's Gambit is a very dangerous opening for both sides white sacrifices upon and all of this but tries to get D4 Bishop F4 Knight C3 now Magnus plays the critical line which is G5 basically just saying I'm posing an existential threat to your position with G4 and pawn takes F3 and queen H4 Hikaru plays H4 G4 and now in this position white has this line Knight G5 and Knight takes F7 but that line is garbage uh there is also some lines where you can play like Bishop C4 and you can sacrifice but uh I think before you play that you have to go here and then Castle uh and I think this is called the muzio Gambit I think basically here you play uh this and then this is like the Giga musio Gambit or something but Hikaru plays Knight E5 and just Pawn to D6 and magnus's plays this move in one second in one second he like and D6 is not a popular move Knight G4 and now Magnus just plays Knight F6 which plays normal look at this one second being used D6 look at this Magnus spending no time at all Magnus acting like you think you can surprise me I'm gonna spend one second on every single one of these moves that's ridiculous and now here comes the position from the opening where now the players are on their own Hikaru plays D3 Magnus develops his Knight and a and according to the computer already Hikaru chose the wrong way in fact as you can see from hikaru's last move 30 seconds spent he's out of whatever I guess bookkeep I don't know right like I I it's not so clear to me I think the surprising move was definitely D6 and then the follow-up of just very cold cool common collected um you know it was definitely a risk and now all of a sudden the night is coming and so is the bishop so Hikaru has to preemptively slide out of the way he spends two minutes on this move two minutes all right that's a lot of time it's not exactly two minutes one minute and 50 seconds whatever but all of a sudden here come all of magnus's pieces like nothing the bishop is out the Rook is out he's he's no longer even down three minutes on the clock car plays Bishop D2 both sides castle and now Magnus does something funny keep in mind a draw in Armageddon is a win if you win the Armageddon you get one and a half points so Magnus offers a queen trade and this part cracked me up hikara thinks plays Queen E1 and Magnus slides back to E5 and he slides back to E5 because if white plays Queen F2 which is the best move he's just going to threaten a repetition you cannot threaten a repetition a repetition is a draw but in Armageddon you can threaten a repetition so Hikaru has to play 92 and here comes Magnus with F5 but apparently F5 is the wrong Pawn break apparently the right Pawn break was D5 because then white does not have the pin here because of checkmating possibilities and if you play Bishop C3 I shut the door and if you play Bishop D2 back I play F3 so F5 allows this and the problem is if you play Bishop G7 in this position you no longer have D4 because pawns from the sixth rank cannot go two ranks forward so Hikaru is back in the game take take Queen F5 now kikaru has to play Bishop H3 he thinks for a bit and he plays Knight G3 which is inaccurate it's inaccurate he was supposed to play Bishop H3 and he was supposed to go for this exchange this is what was preferred by the big SF not San Francisco a place is trash but uh this is what was preferred unfortunately we have Queen F7 and uh Magnus just backs up out of the position you have to be very careful taking this Pawn because black is just playing Queen A2 and queen A1 so Hikaru plays Here and Now Magnus takes over Pawn takes D3 Pawn takes D3 not only is hikaru's position in Dire Straits he's also down on time and he started this game up three minutes which is a lot 94 Magnus calmly King B8 5 Second spent plays defense on the A7 pawn and here come the black pieces rookie two Bishop A2 you might be wondering why didn't Hikaru stop Bishop A2 because if Knight takes D3 Knight takes D3 and Bishop E4 so Hikaru King slides over he's down a pawn and Magnus brings his pieces to the queen side and ends the game in style swarms the black king with everything he's got wins The Rook for the night Bishop D3 if Queen takes then Queen F4 and queen G4 if this a very flashy move to end the game a man after my own heart Magnus Carlsen sacrifices The Rook on E2 this is hardly a sacrifice if Bishop takes it's either Checkmate or Queen C2 and C5 check and if rookie to check and you take the bishop it's discover check and a move Queen D1 Rook C2 and I pick up the queen and I pick up the Knight and Hikaru resigned can I just say something I mean I am I'm not like a backseating fan I was a little underwhelmed you know like they were done within 50 minutes with both games like I was streaming today and I thought okay it's going to be three four hour Hikaru Magnus okay that game was over I was like all right it's gonna be Carlos what he's doing you know I trust the captain and then I don't know it's a spectator I was just like oh well that was all right it's over that's it now I don't know the next time they're gonna play each other title Tuesday that was it like that was the whole match I the good news is some of you are going to click off because you only care about Hitler Magnus but you're gonna miss some really sexy stuff all right you're gonna I mean seriously we're about to we're about to see some fireworks and we have a new number three in the world so whatever we'll let those people depart we have a matchup of gangsters and alireza ferrugia Niger back plays D4 we have a slav defense we have a semi-slav Miron variation main line all right both guys just preparing their forces for battle nothing special blah blah blah Pawn trade Bishop is open good control of E4 Rook B1 with the intention of playing B4 and B5 and Rook B3 now ferrugia plays A5 stopping that and then he plants the Knight confidently into the center of the board now the computer does in fact think that there is some Advantage here for white uh but I but I've always liked Black's prospects in this position the close Center the possibility of attack Knight F6 C5 Bishop can always come around and yes rookie 6 and C5 these two very important moves are setting up good prospects for black in the future and here noji break played dc5 and farouja did not take back in this position alireza played D4 utilizing the pin on the queen and opening this now that's Maiden one okay that's just purely Checkmate so white plays Queen to G4 all right trying to trade the Queens um the queen size back to E7 queen size back to E7 because on his last move of Queen G4 trying to trade the Queens not your back exposed himself a little bit not like actually then he would have gone to Norwegian jail which is probably pretty nice but still not worth going to he exposes the queen uh to various Knight e5s okay now the now the Knight comes here Queen A2 and C6 C6 is a move played in a very natural state if Bishop takes Rook takes black is going to play Rook takes F5 right so we have Rook C6 and you're going to take back my Bishop because you just gave up a bishop wrong in this position Ali Reza faruja plays as zuich arugia is living in France playing in Norway but knows his German Pawn takes E3 the bishop can be taken in a moment it can be taken in a moment because Pawn takes F2 is a massive threat so white has to go here and Ali Reza emerges with very good attacking prospects Rook C1 rookie 8 Queen B6 now Knight comes in I told you a long time ago I really liked Black's attacking prospects here and feruja's got the word fear in his name he strikes fear into his opponents you add an e to fear what do you get fire fire on the board I'm spitting and this man's got his opponents quitting Rook D1 and my man says you wanna attack my queen you want to attack my queen nojar back Knight takes F2 take that sucker if you take the queen for free Knight H3 check and mate Boom headshot dead you attack my queen and I take a pawn and it's not even a check you point a gun at the queen just make one subtle movement you can't take the queen because then I take your Monarch's head with me Knight takes F2 is the end of the illusion of safety that is gazing over the white position there is no safety it's only Danger and Ali Reza is the danger rookie 8 Queen E8 it's just a pawn right it ain't just the pawn The Rook is hanging discovered check is on the way so he gives up the queen here's the problem the only way to successfully fight off a queen is to have really good peace coordination have pieces that work together really well and have no weaknesses let me tell you something right now this is not the sign of a position that has no weaknesses and that has good coordination the black queen is about to ravage the position Here Comes Pawn to F5 the second the Knight moves it becomes a Target it becomes a Target the white position absolutely disintegrates G5 King G7 and Ali Reza firuja marches forward isolates the weaknesses removes them from the board suffocating the white position and sacrifices his Queen two times in the same game Queen F2 Queen H2 Queen F1 and if you take you can't stop this and this filthy absolutely filthy alireza dust off the hands I mean take a shower what the what even was that with the black pieces I may add against the 27 30 feet of rated player and if you thought that was special You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet Fabiano caruana versus aryantari some uh Queen's Gambit declined G6 to try to go Bishop F5 and maybe bishop E7 later Bishop B7 there it is life is good this is the position and in this position Fabiano caruana can Castle Fabiano caruana can also Castle this way how do you know which way to Castle in chess sometimes you don't castle at all sometimes when your opponents have committed their King earlier than yours you can actually use that to your advantage if certain conditions are met in this case the white king is completely safe and white has a free hand to start attacking on this side of the board and he does he's just knocking on the door just making sure somebody's home just making sure somebody's home Atari reacts instantly and tries to counter-attack control chest from Fabiano keeping the king in the center Fabi can go that way he can go that way or or the king can just take a walk just take a little walk to F1 and maybe he'll go G4 or G3 and maybe the king will camp out on G2 King's just going a little camping trip he doesn't want to go to one house doesn't want to go to the other house sometimes you just want to spend an evening in the wilderness watch the Stars listen to the animals get eaten by a bear I don't know whatever you're into Rook C8 take take Pawn to G3 and King to G2 Fabiano's in no rush Fabiano carawana is a world championship caliber player he knows how to set the pace of a game and right now just the mere threat of the black king is good enough he can open up the center and pressure on D5 how is Fabiano going to actually do something here he's going to put his Knight in the center of the board but now what it's gonna inch forward Fabi it's gonna inch forward ever so slightly Queen F3 Fabi is not concerned about replacing the Knight with a pawn because the pawn on D5 will fall he's not concerned now black has to play defense black plays rookie five yeah that does defend the pawn yes it does but guess what remember how you could have made me put a pawn in the center that offers done there is no offer anymore now the pawn is hanging yet again and I'm rotating over this way and I'm rotating over this way because yes I might go Knight D5 but I also might brutalize your king Rook F5 Knight F4 I now have four pieces staring at D5 that's a whole lot of pressure tari to his credit reacts the best way which is removing the knight from the board but now he does not react the best way he has to go Knight E5 in this position and said tari puts his Queen on G5 a simple Queen E2 and the pawn has fallen the pawn has fallen because Queen E4 just doesn't work you have F3 Queen E6 he consolidates the knight in the center Queen back to C8 and in this position for the second time in today's recap a man has given up his Queen Pawn takes F5 he gives up his Queen F6 check I just told you you can fight against the queen if you have very good peace coordination and no weaknesses and if you had played this move you would have lost all your advantage all it takes is one Pawn but by playing the move F6 not only do you preserve the pawn but you also drastically weaken all long-term prospects for the black king and I got news for you that King Ain't surviving long he anchors the knight in the center of the board he allows Queen F3 check and black resides because you cannot stop mate Fabiano caruana just made beating one of the best Grand Masters in all of Europe relatively straightforward I don't even know what to say and after three rounds of action at Norway chess my friends Fabiano caruana leads the pack he won one matchup in Armageddon and he's won two In classical three three and one and a half seven and a half points ferrugia in second Hikaru looking nice and dandy up there in third place he has scored points in every single matchup he has a classical win and two Armageddon losses but he's still got five points so a lot to play for a lot to play for here and a big win for Hikaru in the classical still has him in third place in the event but my goodness the games today were spectacular I hope you enjoyed them now get out of here
