research has been showing now for about 20 years that when women are in the point in the cycle when estrogen is high that that's associated with an increased preference for testosterone cues and this of course begs the question well then what happens if a woman is on hormonal birth control and is never in the estrogen dominant phase of her cycle then what happens and researchers have since asked that question and what they tend to find is that women who are on hormonal birth control desire a somewhat less masculine male face and male voice and there's been some research even showing that if women chose their Partners when they're on hormonal birth control and then discontinue it that this can lead to changes in how they perceive and how attracted they are to their [Music] partner hello everyone watching and listening today I'm speaking with researcher professor and author Dr Sarah hill we discuss her new Landmark book this is your brain on birth control the surprising science of women hormones and the law of unintended consequences we break down and analyze sex-based differences in regret competition and academic striving the balance between life exposure and safeguarding when raising a child the practice of mate Choice copying among women and why our hormones are a foundational part not just of our physical makeup but of who we are most deeply and who we have the potential to become so Sarah I thought for years that the 20th century would basically be remembered for three things the hydrogen bomb the transistor the microchip and the pill and that the Hill was perhaps the most revolutionary of the three and that it was also equivalent to a speciation mutation that that's how profound it is now the first chapter of your book this is your brain on birth control is what is a woman and that's become a Trope and a satirical and a what would a satirical cliche and people laugh at the fact that it's even being posed but actually don't think it's that funny because I think that with the Advent of hypothetically 100% reliable birth control the question of what is a woman actually becomes a real question because a woman who has voluntary control over reproductive function is not the same creature as a woman who doesn't and not even a little bit and so then the question so so it's imagine imagine this and then we can talk through the book um if sex is no longer tied rep to reproduction then in principle women's sexual behavior can become equivalent to men's sexual behavior because the risk is now the same if women are acting like men sexually then why aren't they men like how are they different and then if women for if if sex is no longer tied to reproduction tightly and women are free from involuntary child rearing and bearing then how are they different from Men in the broader label labor market and with regards to General productivity and the answer is we have absolutely no idea and that's why the questions come comes up so I'd like to know why did you start the book with this question what is a woman what the way you open something is obviously to some degree the way you frame it so why why did that phrase why did that phrase jump out at you well for me it was really important because because so my background is in evolutionary biology and so I spent most of my uh career trying to understand um Behavior using the lens of uh Darwin's theory of evolution by selection and one of the big you know sort of uh paramounts of that theory and and something that's really a Cornerstone to it is is the differences between the Sexes right and that you have biological males and biological females and how do we Define them you know how do we Define what is a male what is a female and what a male is is the it's the sex that has the smaller mobile gametes that has less investment in Offspring and females have the metabolically expensive immobile gametes um and they have a relatively large minimum investment and so one of the big ways and and sort of the the foundation of all reliably occurring sex differences in all sexually reproducing species are these small differences and this doesn't seem like it would be that big of a deal like wow like your sex cells are smaller than my sex cells like who cares but that actually turns out to be completely foundational in terms of setting the stage for different minimum levels of investment and Offspring which then sets the stage for the evolution of sex differences okay okay so let's dive into that a little bit because people are people need to understand exactly what this means so you relate sex differences when you're trying to define a woman to the difference in size between the sperm and the Egg and an egg is pretty small and it doesn't look like much of an investment but a sperm is way smaller but the thing that's so interesting about that is that that you could say that that difference is fractal in nature is that it's echoed at every single biological level all the way up the chain to overt Behavior right and so the definition of a woman the definition of female maybe even more broadly female is the sex that invests more is compelled to invest more in Sex and sex sex and reproduction and reproduction wouldn't be just sex this is another thing that the the narrower evolutionary biologists get wrong I think it's one of the flaws in Dawkins thinking for example is that you can reduce SE reproduction to sex but that's foolish because human beings have a high investment strategy uh in relationship to the propagation of their children and so reproduction for human beings doesn't end with sex for mosquitoes it ends with sex right for human beings it just starts with sex and we have an 18year investment and at least the first three years of that falls I would say by necessity more heavily on women and really heavily on women right I think I think they say among chimpanzee females the chimpanzee mother carries its infant something like 500 Miles clasp to its chest in the first year right and so a woman not another issue maybe too is that like is a woman a single organism or is a woman a part of the mother infant diad right so right well so so that's a whole that that's a can of worms that we can we can open I mean there there's this whole Theory it's a Hamilton's theory of Inclusive fitness which is just this idea that your own Fitness just in terms of what your genetic representation in future Generations is likely to be is something that depends both on own genes but then also the genes of your relatives and and for women um in particular who have all of that you know invested in their offspring that this I mean it is an extension of yourself and and our relatives are an extension of oursel and there's no um relationship that um is like that evolution is shaped in a way that favor is just unmitigated investments in the relationship between mother to child um because there's certain 100% or certain 50% relatedness so mothers always know that this is their child you have Mother's reproductive value meaning the possibility that she could translate her energy into additional reproduction that is decreasing while that of her infant is increasing and so it's essentially like passing the evolutionary baton from one generation to the next between these two individuals who have the highest levels of relatedness that's possible in nature outside of identical twins so so I've wondered about this with regard to the transformation at puberty in female emotional response so the personality data indicates that boys and girls are approximately equivalent in terms of their sensitivity to negative emotion but that changes at puberty and so and so and the change seems permanent and it seems like it's hormonally mediated and so I've been trying to understand so and so what happens at puberty is that women become more sens itive to the entire panoply of negative emotions because they Clump together and so and you might say well that's cultural but it's not because if you look at the societies that have advanced the farthest in terms of gender equality at the social and economic levels the differences in trait neuroticism so that's that sensitivity to negative emotion between men and women are larger than they are in less egalitarian in less egalitarian societies so when the society becomes egalitarian the genetic difference is maximized rather than minimizing okay so then the question is well why would women be more sensitive to negative emotion because that comes at a cost and the cost is at minimum higher levels of depression and anxiety but also higher General levels of unhappiness so then you think okay they're more sensitive to threat why is that useful well they're smaller than men at puberty and so they should be more sensitive to physical combat that threat M but they're sexually vulnerable and that's a huge that's a huge deal and not to be underestimated yes and I mean in most societies for most of human history an unaccompanied woman was a target of attack right right right so but then the third thing that's most important I I think I want to know what you think about this is that well women are more attuned to threat because they're proxies for the vulnerability of their infant and so women May pay a psychological cost for being more sensitive to threat which is that they're more unhappy and that they're more anxious but the benefit of that is that they're more alert to any signs of danger or predation or or threat in the environment and they can alert well they're going to alert their husband generally speaking or the rest of the community to that now that also means they're going to be more susceptible to false positives right they're going to respond to threat when there's none there but if you're taking care of a dependent infant and you're over responsive to threat that's probably the right place to tune your errors so and and that seems to me also a reflection of this increased investment by women so they have an increased emotional investment in their offspring as well as an increased physiological investment right so right so so so okay I'll start with the woman piece but there's also some interesting things that happen with testosterone during puberty to men that turn that off um and so I would want to be able to return into that as well but um with women I mean absolutely the thing that we need to remember is that the process of evolution by selection didn't wire us to be happy or satisfied or or any it's like it has designed us to survive and to reproduce and part of that means that we're going to feel kind of terrible some of the time and part of women's design you know sort of the design of our psychology is such that it does it it's like a smoke detector it's tuned to picking up on even subtle cues of possible danger just because the potential cost associated with what would happen if that actually if that danger is real is much greater for women um for a lot of different reasons some of which you've touched upon I mean there's one is that women are mothers so it's like you know it's like you hear like you're eating for two you're feeling danger for two you know you're having to protect yourself and your Offspring You're more physically vulnerable because of course you're physically you know women are smaller and have less upper body strength sexual vulnerability for the reasons you talked about mean unfortunately sexual violence has been something that's been present as long as um we've been around and it certainly it's something we see in all species with choosy females you'll have males who want to override that choice and um and so there's a lot of reasons that wom manipulation too it's not merely that women are overpowered physically it's that they're also susceptible to very devious manipulation on the part of mauell and and Psychopathic men and they need to be alert to that that form of deception as a threat as well right as well and yes and and even also with with other females and and and and the reason for this is that you know when you think about the cost for a woman if she's duped so let's just talk about sexual deception right if a woman is duped she could end up pregnant there's a 9month investment there right and if you look especially at historical um you know types of populations like modern hunter gatherer groups if you have a a woman who doesn't have a father investing the child the risk of infant mortality is like 80% I mean it's very high and and the risk of death during child birth even is very high so women are putting their lives at risk every time they get pregnant and then to get pregnant and have a really high-risk infant that's not getting invested in she's not get and the reputation too yeah and the reputation I mean there's so many costs to that and the costs just aren't that you know it's not symmetrical for men the cost of those things aren't the same and so our brains are wired to be differently sensitive to those kinds of cues because the consequences are so much more dire if you have a female body compared to if you have a male body which do you know it is there a literature on okay one to tell me if I've got this wrong okay all right so we talked about the different reproductive strategies say of mosquitoes and human beings mosquitoes have like a zero investment strategy you have a million Offspring all of them die but like one but that's okay cuz that's replacement whereas human beings it's unbelievably heavy investment then you look within human beings women invest more than men then you could look within men and you could say there are men who invest less and Men Who invest more okay so the men who invest less they're the short-term Mater types now I've been looking into the personality predictors of short-term mating strategies and they're not that positive so the personality theorists who've been investigating the so-called dark tetrad which is a group of you might say undesirable descriptors psychopathy narcissism melanism which is manipulativeness and sadism because they had to add that to it those traits are much more um PR pronounced among men and women but particularly among men who who adopt a short-term mating strategy right and so now so one of the things I'm wondering about is it it's related to that so that men who adopt that short-term M mating strategy they love them and leave them right there's no let's say there's little postcoidal regret there's no guilt or shame associated with short-term mating opportunities do you know if there's a literature detailing the difference in response to short-term mating episodes between men and women are women more likely to evince regret in the aftermath of short-term mating episodes one night stance oh yeah absolutely there's a there's a rich literature and sexual regret and exactly as you would expect when you look at what people regret sexually um women regret more these short-term mating opportunities that they um you know participated in men more often regret those that they didn't participate in so men opportunties yes missed opportunities so men sexual regret tends to sort of cluster around things that they wish they would have taken advantage of and they did not whereas women's tends to Cluster more and I really wish I wouldn't have had sex with that idiot right right now do you know is there a personality literature that's looked at individual differences in post short-term sex regret so like are the are the women less likely to show regret also more likely to have dark tetr personality traits like there's got to be predictors of regret right now you expect neuroticism would be one because that would just predict negative emotion in general I suspect agreeableness is another predictor is that the women who are more agreeable compassionate polite more inclined to car take and bond so I would suspect that it's the more feminine women who are most more likely to show postcoidal regret I suspect the same thing would be true of men I bet you the more feminine men are also more likely to manifest that pattern of regret diversify your savings with physical precious metals while stockpiling silver in your home safe with Birch gold groups most popular

yeah positive Delight in the suffering of others yeah wow wow I wonder if he's got a brother um like that's just a terrible that's a terrible quality that's for sure um so uh no so I'm not I'm not terrible I'm familiar with the that but when I when I think about things I tend to think about um just because personality isn't really my area more The evolutionary area I I tend to think about the like you know my prediction would be um from an evolutionary perspective would be that we would see women experiencing more sexual regret when the costs are higher right so like what are the costs associated with having made that decision that you made right so whether it's reputational CA so for example a woman who has more to lose reputationally from having capitalized on that shortterm mating strategy I think that she would experience stronger sexual regret I bet I bet you could predict that by looking at the relative H just imagine there's a Continuum of men with regards to the socioeconomic status markers of their potential as providers I suspect that this might seem obvious but it would be nice to see it demonstrated that the larger the gap between the woman and the man in terms of status yes the more regret yes no I I would think so Abol because she sold herself short and the risk of that is too high right yes no absolutely absolutely and also I mean you know even the things that would influence her her biological cost right so for example if we're talking about short like immediate regret um a woman who's near high fertility in her cycle where pregnancy is possible I'm assuming that in her hormonal thing would be predict would be telling her like oh like that was terrible like why did you do that or and I would also expect you'd see more sexual regret at Peak fertility across the LIF see now we have a perfect study design we could look at personality dark tet red traits and number of days deviation from Maximum fertility as predictors of short-term coidal regret yes and and across a lifetime too and we could spend three years getting that through an Ethics Committee and not and then another three years trying to get it published right right right right right right yeah yeah yeah yeah so all right so back to so back to what is a woman so okay so what we've talked about so far is that what is the definition of female M okay and the female is the member of uh sexually reproducing species who invests more at least at see that's the qu the issue at least at the level of the of the gamet do you want to explain to everybody what a gamet is just so they know yeah so hey so so a gamet is a sex cell um and it's it's it's your egg or it's your sperm so it's like 50% it has 50% of your genetic material in it um and it is fused with a gam of the other kind if you make eggs it fuses with sperm and that is how we produce life um and yes you know the the initial greater investment that women make is just the starting point of as you said it it it it's like fractal it it it's exponential um increased investment because a selection continues to reinforce greater investment because of that large initial investment it's like a hand of Poker right if you put in Crystal that that makes a diamond around it right exactly so if you put in $500 in a in the first round of betting and we're playing poker and I put in a buck you have more to lose if that hand goes sideways than I do right and that Echoes all the way up the all the way up the okay so that's very interesting too because the people who claim that that sexual identity is merely culturally constructed fail to take into account the fact that that difference in investment Echoes at every single level of the biological ladder right it's not merely something it's certainly not something that's reducible to chromosomal difference which is another way of defining the difference between men and women you didn't pick that you picked investment okay so why why did you pick in it's not just you I know that that tends to be the bi the biological stance but would you say that the the chromosomal difference XX versus XY is of lesser significance than the investment issue or does it matter because they're so tightly linked well well they are so tightly linked but I mean honestly if evolution by selection doesn't see it it doesn't matter like in a lot of ways the the gears and sprockets that create us um those pieces like if you're trying to make predictions about behavior and sort of like the you know what types of things have been reinforced by this process of inheriting traits that work meaning that they promote survival and reproduction and those that don't um it's only what selection sees that matters and it never sees our chromosomes what it sees is investment right and and those those individuals who um have this really large you know minimum investment and they're only able to produce X number of Offspring instead of X prime number of Offspring um that those individuals what the best way that they can increase the probability of continuing their genetic lineage is through a heavy investment strategy and that's less true for this other sex and so sex you you know biological sex and again you know starts off with these small differences in the size of our sex cells but then um sort of recapitulates at every all these imagine just for the sake of argument how that would recapitulate even cognitively yes right now men for example men understand that there's a relationship between how successful they are and how attractive they are to women like and and part of what they motivates them is the game of that competition so I worked with high-end lawyers for about 15 years both men and women and and found some very interesting differences in that but the men even regarded the money they made in bonuses at the end of the year for outstanding performance they weren't so interested in the money they were interested in the money as a means of keeping score it was a means of winning the competition and you might say well competition for what and the answer to that is well let's call it competition not for status exactly but for reputation but the consequence of a stellar reputation is that and men who have that are much more attractive to women and you might say well women go after wealth but I think that's nonsense and I think that's also Bel lied by the relevant evolutionary biology Theory because what it shows and tell me if I've got this wrong is that women use wealth as a marker for attractiveness because they use wealth as a marker for competence and what they're after is the ability to generate wealth and and and to and to share it and to be generous with it has to be both productivity and generosity and a decent marker for the capacity to generate wealth Is wealth although it's not the only criteria so women are looking for competence and Men it's a very strange thing about men you know they compete among themselves for competence-based reputation and now I've been trying to figure out why because you can imagine a like a a movie scenario where um you know the quarterback of the foot football team wins A major championship and all the other men put him on his shoulders and you know bring him out of the stadium and he sleeps with the cheerleader that night and you might ask yourself well why in the world would the men group together to elevate a given man to that sort of status if it means that he's going to be the one that successfully reproduces and my suspicion is that men learned to Value competence probably as a consequence of hunting yes so any given Hunter no matter how good he is at hunting is going to fail in most hunts so now if Men band together to hunt then the collective success is much larger and so what that means is that if you're going to be a hunter that provides a cross hunting bouts your skill as a hunter is one determinant but your interpersonal skill in negotiating and establishing relationships with the rest of the hunters is even more important so among Hunter gatherers for example if you're the one who brings down the animal it's incumbent on you to downplay your contribution and to distribute the best parts of the animal to other people and you're doing that to Foster your reputation as a generous person and you're doing that in part to ensure that there's reciprocity in food distribution across multiple hunts now the men are going to be willing to elevate the highest Hunter to the highest position because I think it's in their Collective interest it's in their Collective interest and in their individual interest to be the followers of the best man and I think that's so important in terms of their own reproductive Fitness which would be tied to the provision of food across hunts that they're willing to take the reproductive hit that's what would you say implicit in elevating any given man among all other men you could think about that in in terms of hunting and you could think about that in terms of of combat too you know if you put the most heroic Warrior on your shoulders you give him an evolutionary Edge but if you're in his group well then you've got the benefits of being with The Greatest Warrior and the greatest hunter and so I don't know if the evolutionary biologists have been able to calculate out the relationship between establishing a reciprocal relationship with a great hunter or great warrior versus the costs of men competing to elevate a given to the highest possible position it's a very weird thing that men do no I think that I think you're I think you hit the nail in the head though I mean I think that the benefits of aligning yourself with somebody who's very powerful that I mean think about it if there's somebody and like let's say that he's you know 1.0 and you're sort of 1 point one um and so there's somebody who's who's a better performer than you you could get your ass kicked if you keep trying to have to you know fight with this guy so there's a big cost to you to trying to to overturn this person and there's a lot of benefit of aligning with the person who's also really competent that's especially true if it's a Paro distribution in terms of competence right because the really competent person might be like a hundred times more competent well right exactly and so it's like I think that there's there's a lot of benefits that come especially to men because of the hunting context of aligning with another man in that context and there's also this um tendency in other so this has been very well studied in non-human animals um but we see a very similar version of this in human but have you ever heard of lecking lecking behavior so a Leck is a place where males within a species will gather um to attract mates it's almost like a club it's like the like the frogs like frogs for example are lecking species and the males will all go to this display area and they croak right and and this is what attracts the females and so the females will go toward where they hear the loudest most impressive croak because that male generally is larger in body size and has higher levels of testosterone and so the louder male attracts all the femal all the females and so the males all want to hang out with this guy because he's attracting all the women and the same is true if we if men align themselves with um yeah with with you know somebody who's really high performer I mean if you go out for drinks with Tom Brady it's not too bad to be Tom Brady 2.0 you know you're going to be able bask in the reflective Glory bask in the reflective Glory right well and the women would also assume that if the extraordinarily High status male is hanging around with some character who looks like a dweeb on the surface that there might be hidden depths and utility to his character or advantages in the mere fact that he's proximal absolutely so women use that a lot and in fact some of my very early research um this is like this is going deep this is when I was in graduate school I studied this phenomenon in humans mate Choice copying because this is another thing that you see in females of other species but you also see it in us and this is males tend to be a somewhat ambiguous stimulus package um because most males a lot of the qualities that women are looking for aren't immediately available just based on physical appearance right right so women have to kind of sus out like what what is there about this guy and so when women see a beautiful woman with kind of an average looking guy the first thing they think is what he must be rich um or he must have some really amazing personality he must be really high in status um and I wonder is that magnified if he's unattractive because one of the things you might ECT is that if a very beautiful woman is with a man who's very nondescript that there must be something about him that's absolutely Stellar absolutely yes and so the magnitude of the gap between the the woman how beautiful the woman is and then the appearance of the man sort of um is linked with the degree to which women perceive that he has these amazing hidden qualities that make him a desirable partner the bigger the Gap the more amazing the qualities the smaller the Gap the less amazing the qualities oh that's very funny I so the right the proper mating strategy is if if you're a spectacularly under endowed male is to hire a beautiful wom woman to go to clubs with you absolutely absolutely and you would actually probably do better than a a more attractive man with the same woman because people would think that you must really have something going on to have attracted her and look like that right right oh that's insanely complicated that's insanely insanely comp comical that's insanely comical all right all right so okay so what is a woman so we've we've defined that as the the the the sex that invests more and we pointed out that across all the way echoing all the way up the biological ladder from the cellular to the cognitive women females are the sex that in invests more oh yeah the other thing about that was that well women are going to invest more too because and you already pointed this out but it's worth making it clearer because they have to so I I think I I looked at one point I looked up the world's record for most children a woman ever had and I think it was in the hundreds actually maybe maybe not maybe I've got that wrong maybe I've got that wrong it doesn't matter exactly because you could imagine if a woman had you know a set of triplets every year for 10 years then that would give her 30 infants so we could say the upper bound on female fertility with regards specifically to her children is going to be no more than 50 right right and that's a generous estimate whereas with men it's like 10,000 100,000 There's No Limit there's none right so women are going to invest more in their children too because every child and you already pointed this out is comparatively more valuable then you also said something interesting which is that as a woman ages her children actually become comparatively more valuable than she so does this mean this is strange thing though is there evidence that women's love for their children increases as their children age I mean because women are so invested in infants it's hard to maybe it's like this I don't so I've not seen anything specifically that has addressed that very question but they have done studies where they look at the difference between for example older mothers and younger mothers it's a world of difference I mean when you look at amount of investment that goes on like if you're an older mother compared to a younger mother older mothers invest more they spend more time investing um and and all of these things that you would expect given that their reproductive window is closing so it's like their the the opportunity cost of investing in that child are less than it would be if you're a 20-year-old woman because if you're a 20-year-old woman and investing in an existing child There's an opportunity cost that comes to you for not using that energy to have another child right right and so you're not making that tradeoff when when you're an older mother the holidays are

don't know because you know height Jonathan height wrote um the codling of the American mind okay and I've been very interested in this rise of what I like to think of as the devouring mother is that the over invested parent yes okay so instead of putting that on the shoulders of the given parent I've been trying to understand the cultural context that might make overinvestment more likely so so you can imagine well fewer children yes so if you have 10 children you're obviously not going to invest in you're not going to attend to each of them as much they're going to attend to each other more so more one child families okay older parents yes right so they're going to be more conservative to begin with because you get more conservative as you get older but they're also going to invest more in their children right and so and so so older and then also richer parents because if you're older you're richer and so part of the reason that children are coddled as far as I can tell to the degree that they are and overprotected is because mothers are not old enough to be grandmothers they're rich and they only have one child right and too much time on their hands too much time on their hands also because it's like historically women would have been out Gathering food all the time and now if you have women and and there's plenty of women who work and are and are still you know overindulging in their children but a lot of times when you see this it tends to happen more frequently and more sort of exaggeratedly in um in homes where where women aren't working outside yeah so you know one of the things I've talked to my daughter and my daughter-in-law about when they're trying to figure out how to um optimally care for their young children is how they and I talked to a lot of my clients too because they face the same problem is how do you balance as a woman how do you balance the need of your children especially under the age of three for continuous intense maternal presence with the with the pursuit of your own interests and my sense is that there's an optimized balance there because one of the things that children should see is that adults including women have good things to do with their adult time and so that's a good thing to model absolutely but then also if you have your own Pursuit as a woman then you're not going to interfere too much in your child's life because you actually have a life and one of the things I think that protects children against that proclivity of maybe excessively neurotic women to overinvestment is not this this is historically unprecedented you know through most of human history no one was that rich no well I mean yeah women never I mean it was like we always played a role in subsistence you know even though women were also mothering they were also finding food and they were also you know tending to whatever the dwelling was and and having to maintain relationships and having to go and get water and the children were having to go to work and help with these things and so it was a very different situation where now nobody is actually having to do anything to run the household because there's staff and um and and you have children that aren't you know having to work you have parents who don't have anything you know or mothers in particular who don't have something else that's sort of pulling their time away from just spending all their time thinking about you know Johnny and his it's also not diluting their Insanity you know if you're in a tribal group I mean one of the advantages to having two parents is that the average of two parents is on average more sane than either of the individuals right that's absolutely correct right right right and well and partly what you do in a marriage is you keep each other sane you you see where your partner has a tendency towards excess and you re that in right and you do that for each other and hopefully you do that with each other's best interests and the relationship of and the quality of the relationship firmly in mind and you do that for the children as well in a more communal child rearing environment a child is going to have in some real way multiple mothers like ants for sure and in a tribal group most people are kin anyways and so the role of mother is going to be distributed enough so that even if any given mother is a bit addled in her preoccupations there's going to be other people to whom the child can turn in a narrow nuclear family where there's a overindulgent mother let's say who has far too much time on her hands the child can be shielded from all other potential influences which is also something that the more narcissistically overindulgent mother is likely to arrange so so that it's interesting because it what it what it what it suggests is that what it indicates is that even though human beings are a high investment species and even though women are the higher invest sex within that confine there is a point where investment becomes a burden rather than a than a Advantage right no absolutely absolutely I mean you can't um if you don't teach if your children don't have to have the opportunity to learn how to navigate the environment on their own they have no navigation skills and I think that that's essentially what we're seeing why did you use the word navigation there um I Ed the word navigation because life is a journey right I me we have to navigate our environment and that means that we have to learn how to acquire resources we have to learn how to manage other people we have to learn how to get along with other people that we don't like we have to make I mean there's a lot of things we have to navigate through storms yes and so if your response to your child is there'll be no storms in your life right or I'll clear all of your storms don't worry and then all of a sudden you put children out in the world and they have skills yeah they they don't have any coping skills and um and we see this a lot you know as a college professor I see a lot of this and and and a private school with a very high price tag um where we'll have students who come in and and it's really a wakeup call about what life is like because they've had you know parents who are very well-meaning you know I think that the parents who do this they they have the the god deserv us from well-meaning yeah I know I think that they think they're doing the right thing but it's it's not you know if you carry somebody too long they're muscle atrophy and um and and and you can't do that I heard A good rule from uh I think it was my brother-in-law who told me this and he had spent a lot of time caring for very elderly people and he said that the appropriate rule of thumb for Elder Care is never do anything for your client that they can do themselves and the reason for that is that you facilitate you you you devour their independence right and so then that so there's an interesting Paradox here with regards to love right because there's the love that eradicates emotional distress in the moment okay and then there's the love that is devoted to fostering adaptive Behavior over the medium to long run right and that's a love that's much more allied with judgment so for example if you call your child out on their misbehavior you cause them short-term emotional distress but the long-term benefit of that is that if they integrate the impulses that are making them let's say unduly AG aggressive or reactive then they're going to be more acceptable to their peers and to the broader social community so you'll you'll allow them to be hurt in the short-term for a long-term gain now do you know if there are sex differences in that temporal Focus because see here's the here's the Paradox as far as I'm concerned and I watch women try to negotiate this with their children at about 12 months of age the thing about infants because they're so dependent is that the proper response of a mother to the distress of an infant 9 months and younger is fix that now regardless right so you could say in a sense that the emotional distress of an infant is an omniscient signal that care has to be administered but once the child starts to become somewhat autonomous which and that starts to occur when they can start to crawl then the mother has to make a transition from immediate reaction to emot emotional distress to allowing the child to dwell in that emotional distress or even sometimes causing it herself and that's a very tricky uh transformation because the woman has become so attuned to the infant and so bonded to that infant and so responsive to its signals of distress that to pull back from I think most of the way women pull back from that historically was they just had another child I was just about to say that exact thing I think that are interbirth ratios and like sort of length the the spacing between children has probably made that conflict and we call it weaning conflict and that Sciences um has has made that more difficult exacerbated it yeah because one of have a choice you know well also also if you have a 13-month-old and no other children around the 13-month-old is an infant right but if you have a 13-month-old and then you have a infant the 13-month-old is now a child clearly right and so yeah well I saw this when when when we had our second child Julian Michaela was 18 months old I think that's about right and you know she's still pretty little but compared to a newborn she was an adult right and that was also the point where she turned more to me and I you know the there there seems to be something that's apart from the inter birth interval let's say there seems to be something that's crucial about the role that men play in the facilitation of that longer term orientation because men are less suscep able to the emotional distress of of both infants and toddlers and along with that I think it gives men the opportunity to be less affected by the emotional distress of children and therefore to prioritize medium to long-term adaptive strategies over short-term gratification of emotional demand and I think that's part of the Cardinal role that men plays well they are agents of the patriarchy right they're going to be socializing agents well but but seriously they're going to be they seem to me to be right the women are oriented very strongly towards the primary care of infantile emotional distress but that's not a good long-term strategy okay so I have a vicious question to ask okay all right all right we talked a little bit at the be before we started this podcast about the corruption of the universities yes okay now you write in your book a fair bit about what's being the interpersonal and social consequences of women moving on mass into the workforce so I have a proposition for you all right let's hear this the default moral ethos of women does not scale it doesn't scale beyond the family so if you now I'm perfectly willing to debate this because I'm horrified by the fact that it might be true I've watched the universities transform themselves into holding Pence for infants mhm yeah no that's a fact okay and I've watched them transform themselves into holding pens for infants as they've become dominated by women who don't have children so so let me say this CU I was actually just having this a very similar conversation with a colleague of mine and actually here's what I've noticed so now here's the part where I'm going to say something that's a little bit awful okay okay steal yourself I'm like well no I'm just thinking like oh Lord I'm going to get myself in trouble with this okay if you are that's how you know it's probably true yeah I know I know so what I am seeing at universities is that there is a real bation in the performers and the not performers and the people who are the performers are the women and the people who aren't the performers are men and I'm going to tell you why if you are a man who wants all the things that men want status and power and you're achievement oriented and you're bright and you're a go-getter are you going to go into a job where you go to Oxford and make six ,000 year definely no you're not what what types of men do you think are attracted to University jobs you mean now I mean ever you're making $60,000 a year yeah but I think it I think it's changed and so so women who go into University jobs are generally women uh and and this isn't End Mass true but it's it's in my experience more true than it's not are people who are very competent driven motivated but also want f ability because they have children I work 60 to 70 hours a week but I get to pick the 60 and 70 hours a week I work I love my job I have two kids I spend a lot of time doing things with them and I like the flexibility and most of the really competent academics that I know who are just kicking ass and um doing a really you know good job in terms of like Discovery um are women okay okay so let's and so I think that I think the university is like falling apart because because there's a lot of people who are mediocre and they're generally old men um who are trying to maintain the system that rewards mediocrity and then you have performers coming in and there's a lot of fion that's being created okay okay so so there's two two elements at play there there's this element of sex and there's an element of performance okay so let's take this apart a bit and and see if we can get to the bottom of it well first of all you can't pathologize the behavior of one sex without patholog ing the behavior of both right right okay so so we'll use that as an axom and then you asked me what sort of men were attracted to University jobs when I started my career the answer to that was men the the one in in the universities that were really working I think my supervisor was a good example of that he was a football player he's a tough guy he was extremely extremely curious yeah right so he went into a university position because he wanted to do research and I was fortunate I when I did my graduate training at McGill I was surrounded mostly by professors who actually were oriented towards discovering the truth in the course of their research but I saw that over time deteriorate in in favor of careerists yes and and I would put most University administrators in the bin of careerists and careerists are interested in the secondary benefits of their career maybe that's security and maybe it's status and not interested in the pursuit the only people I saw who pursued a University career who had justification for it who were men their justification was I'm so interested in pursuing let's say scientific truth and the expansion of knowledge that I can find my status my interest there and if I have enough money to allow that to occur that will be fine and I thought that was a perfectly reasonable game now you brought up a couple of things there now and and and let let me say that that there's a lot of people who go into science for the I went into science because I love research and I love Discovery and and I'm creative and it's a perfect venue for a creative person to just think about things and then go test them it's like so fun and um and and and I don't think that what what I was saying is characterizing all people in all the motivational States I saying on the whole it seems like that like when we look at who are these careerists that go into this field um and you know and essentially because it's it's low risk and you know and you you have this stability um when you have men who are making that choice it's a very different car it's a very different phenotype than a woman Mak okay so maybe we have a feedback loop okay so imagine this imagine that as the universities become comparatively lower paying and more maternal in their orientation towards the students they attract a larger and larger proportion of relatively dependent men who aren't adventurous enough to make it outside of that sheltered environment and that and what that does in turn because the men act out that pattern of dependency is it reinforces the idea that the inappropriately maternally oriented women have what would you say insufficient charges that they need to take care of you know like things did things really do tend to spiral out of control when a positive feedback loop emerges right so if you want to become alcoholic the best way to do that is start to drink to cure your hangover right cuz it works right but it produces a worse hangover and if you want to develop agobia have a panic attack and then avoid right right right so most forms of serious Psychopathology if you want to become depressed get sad and then isolate right so many forms of Psychopathology are positive feedback loop so we could imagine that when a social institution starts to spiral that there's multiple causal forces at work that are reinforcing each other because that would also produce a rapid transformation but okay so you countered my proposition that the universities are deteriorating because they're being invaded by inappropriately maternally oriented women by saying yes but they're also inhabited by and I don't want to put words in your mouth by men who are looking for a dependent and less competitive Niche is that a fair summary yes do you think that's in keeping with what you're observing um I yes maybe the the um the maternal side of it thing I don't see but I'm you know I'm a woman and so it might be harder for me to like I don't I see it in the concern with microaggressions with the concern with with Equity with like the the all these okay but but I and look we we have that I mean we have so much of that and I I I was just telling one of my colleagues for the very first time in my entire life and I've been teaching for 15 years this semester was the first time I didn't just have like unfettered enjoyment teaching my evolutionary psychology class and it's because I'm terrified every day I go started that 2016 when I was teaching yeah that I go into my class feeling terrified like I'm talking about biological sex and I have to spend a lot of time you know talking about what biological sex is what gender is and and talking about because the the two things play into each in in really interesting ways actually and um and so I I spend time talking about that but I'm thinking to myself I'm going to get totally destroyed in my because everything you know ultimately in evolutionary biology comes down to sex and the reason I started my book off with the chapter what is a woman is that it's so foundational this idea that as a biological female that you um invest more in Offspring and what this means for for you as a woman is it means that the costs of sex are higher right and this creates a a completely like a mating Market where women essentially get to call the shots with sex right and Men sort of do the things that they need to do in order to get chosen um but then what happens when there's no consequences for women's sexual behavior I mean you know because the fact that women have consequential sexual behavior has set the stage for things like women being choosier about sex men more competitive to be able to get access to the things that women want in in partners and when all of a sudden we make sex non-costly for women which has been a huge achievement for for women but it has these huge consequences on everything because so much of who we are and our social behaviors and the the types of things that motivate us are sort of built around this system of sex being costly for women finally the perfect gift for somebody who has everything a gift

because we're a high investment species and our children have an incredibly lengthy and costly dependency period yes okay okay so we're not going to eradicate that now you could say now cuz you know you you you entitled your book interestingly the title we should just point this out is that this is your brain and birth control the surprising science of women hormones and the law of unintended consequences okay let's concentrate on that last part bit that law of unintended consequences because it isn't obvious to me and I think this is implicit in your book if the birth control pill is a biological mutation that exceeds the development of the hydrogen bomb in terms of its explosive consequences it could easily be that the unint intended consequences will swamp the benefits now the benefit let's let's investigate this as thoroughly as we can the benefit is that women are no longer prey to the terrifying consequences of sexual interaction right okay but also more so and that sounds small right now and in in and and in some ways it doesn't sound small because they a of you know women not being prey to you know sexual behavior is um is obviously a big problem and that that's great that women don't have to worry about that but more than anything in my view the thing that's been most important and sort of groundbreaking about the birth control pill and having reliable contraception is that it's allowed women to plan well okay that okay so let me let me ask you about that because I'm not so sure about that okay so well it's not something I want to toss away because obviously the problem of birth control is a walloping problem yes okay so so we're not going to underestimate the complexity of that problem it's the complexity of reproduction and so but so here's a statistic okay um now half of all 30-year-old women in the west are without children okay half of them will never have a child mhm so that's 25% of women 90% of them will regret mhm so now we have a situation now imagine this propagating across the decades we have a situation now where one in five women will be involuntarily childless right and that means that means from the time from 30 onward for 60 years alone right right okay now that's a walloping cost for 20% of women and and they're just the women who have it the worst now now now we can we could set that against the fact that women are much more educated and they're much more autonomous and the and the whole human race has now access to the intellectual capacity of women in a way that just wasn't possible say before the 1960s we know that women's educational attainment is the best predictor of their children's educational attainment after you factor in IQ we know that the countries that uh prioritize women's rights are the countries that are most likely to develop economically so there seems to be a huge benefit in the general emancipation of women but the costs are overwhelming and it looks to me like they're mounting you know because you also see I think it's now 30% of Japanese people under the age of 30 are virginal and the amount of sex that young people in the west are having right at least actual sex is plummeting and it's harder and harder for women to find a long-term relationship and so so what do you believe that why do you believe overall that or do you even believe that the benefits of the pill have outweighed the costs um I don't know that I believe that I don't I mean honestly I think that this is one of those things where we can't make I don't think that I can make a blanket statement about that for everyone do you know what I mean like to me that's a blank that's a individual level um decision yes exactly so for me right um using uh birth control for the number of years that I did absolutely the benefits outweigh the cost because of how I played things um I mean it allowed me to get my degrees and you know start my research lab and I had my kids when I wanted to how many kids do you have I have two I have a I have a daughter was that enough and a son yeah I was I was done that was so that was good for you I was comfortable with that I felt good about that um right so you managed all that I did and and and I think that there are many women who do there are some women who don't and so I think that the the question of whether or not the cost out way the benefit is something that's best answered at the individual basis which is why I think the best thing that we can do for people is to educate them about what the trade-offs are that you're making and what the risks and benefits are because like you said I mean I think that there is a you know women are taught almost nothing about their fertility like nothing well they're Tau lies well yeah I mean I have women coming into my class talking about how so and so had a baby at 40 I'm saying to my I'm saying like no like here's the here's the fertility curve tell me describe the fertility curve the fertility curve Peaks at 25 and then it begins to decline so women are at their most fertile at 25 years of age and then it begins to decline it declines very precipitously after 35 and um and the probability of getting pregnant um from General AC of sex is much much lower than it is when you're in your 20s and this is really hard thing for women to have a wrestle with because course that's for sure I mean you know I look at myself and I had you I was in graduate school when I had my first child and I had to make the decision am I going to um you know incur the cost to my career to go ahead and um and and try to have a baby now and I know that it'll be relatively easy biology um 28 right right so you were already by historical stand old yeah um but I wanted to go ahead and get why did you take the risk I took the risk because I study women's fertility okay so you knew and it's like so I know I know exactly what's going to happen if um if I wait and I I wasn't that wasn't a chance that I wanted to take and I think that if we do things like educate women on what the costs are that that they're you know sort of facing if they choose to restrict their fertility for all of these years like what is the outcome so first of all they should at least know what the facts are yeah I don't think that I don't think that we're educating about no we lied we there's no one who's lied to more than 19yearold women they're lied to in all sorts of ways the first lie is there'll be nothing more important to you in your life than your career is that I think that's a lie because I know almost no one for whom that is true whether they're male or female like I think on on average for men career is more important than it is on average for women but having said that men who have a successful family and a successful career are much more likely to Value their family over their careers so so and I think that's even more true for women and part of the reason I think that you can tell me what you think about this these lawyers I worked with as part of my clinical practice so I worked with with partners of law firms in big law firms in Toronto and so we have Bay Street in Toronto which is kind of the equivalent of Wall Street on a Canadian scale and there are large law firms there that are internationally competitive especially in the world of Finance because Canada bats above its weight on the financial side partly because of our banks so I worked with these so the deal we put forward to the law firms this little company I was working with was you send us your best people mhm and we will endeavor to make them even more productive than they are now in any law firm there's a small proportion of lawyers who are hyper competent at law but also hyper competent at generating business yes and they're unbelievably valuable because they feed all the lawyers in the law firm who can do law but can't generate business right now some of them are men and some of them are women and the law firms are hyper motivated to keep those women and they can't MH all the women all the women quit you bet between 28 32 so what happens is they're hyper conscientious and Brilliant they're usually attractive as well and so they do extremely well in high school they do extremely well in college and university they do extremely well in law school like they're on a track High achieving track they climb all the way up this track until they're senior partners and they're working like 70 hours a week and often by this time but not always they're married and usually to someone who has a high income and they look around having hit the Pinnacle and they're 30 and they think why the hell am I working 70 hours a week now the male answer to that is to win the contest right and we know that winning the contest makes men sexually attractive but that isn't the case at all for women and so what the women do invariably is bail out and take a job that gives them more flexibility in shorter hours and parties because they want to have a family right well no absolutely I mean this is something that's uh and people don't talk about it very frequently but I mean you hit the nail on the head that's exactly what happens I mean women generally want to have more work life balance than men do and it's just because the the reward structure is very different for male and female brain of winning the contest as you say and for men there's a real reward that comes from that and historically evolutionarily you there isn't anything more important than there's and for women it's about when you know it's like we like to win the competition but we also value investing in our family and in our relationships and that sort of thing to a greater extent than men and most women that I know even women who are really high Achievers and and have you know High performing jobs um also value their family time and a lot of them aren't willing to make those cost I I know more people that are women who' foregone you know really big promotions and opportunities to sit on this board or that board um and saying no to it even though it's an amazing opportunity just because they don't want to compromise their time with their children and their families um and and and this is this is yeah it's it's a real thing for women okay it's a real thing for women okay so so let let me ask you a question about that too tell me what you think about this so my observation of people who practice as scientists is that one in a 100 is an actual scientist right I agree with that okay okay so so then if one in 100 is an actual scientist and all the scientific progress depends on that one in a 100 which is also what you'd conclude if you looked at both publication rates and impact of Publications same predo distribution problem and men are more likely to hyperfocus on their careers what happens if we take the men out of those positions and we substitute in women because are are we going to attenuate the productivity of the highest performers at the highest level of performance well so I don't think that um you know I think that when you look at the distributions of like like like let's just say like super Geniuses so let's assume that scientists are super Geniuses okay and when we look at things like IQ and we look at the you know um the distribution of IQ between men and women we know that women have a more clustered around the mean type of a distribution there's less variability and for men there's more variability which means that with men's IQ distribution you have fatter Tails meaning you have more wonder you're terrified about getting into trouble that's pretty much what killed Larry Sumer well I know I know and I talk about this in my class and this is something that no nobody has problems with the fact that you know if you go to an Institutional like an institution for people who are profoundly cognitively you know challenged that you the the sex ratio there is like 2 to1 male 3:1 male and we know that more males have profound cognitive um disabilities relative to women but on the side of super Geniuses it's the same thing and we see more male super Geniuses than we do female super Geniuses but I think what that sometimes where things get you know everybody gets upset about that when which I don't think is necessary is that not saying that there's not female super Geniuses or and it doesn't make predictions about any individual one case um because patterns aren't good at making predictions about what happens with you or with you or with you and um yeah so we know that that's we know that that is a that that's true there's a gazillion Publications that have been published to that effect whether we want it to be true or not it is um and what this means is that um when you get to the upper echelons of any type of a career that requires a lot of G or a lot of intellectual power um you do tend to see that there is a little bit of a sex ratio with men to women this being said there's a lot of like really um valuable jobs that don't require as much G that play to some of women's intellectual strengths so for example things like science and medicine are becoming more female and that's because those are things that women are really good at yeah well at those well okay so at those very high levels of achievement you're going to require the intersection of rare trades so imagine in engineering okay so first of all you have to be more interested in things than people yes okay so that's going to skew it mail right away yeah then you have to be super bright yes okay now at the highest echelons there's also going to be a bit bit of of a male skew there and then you might also hypothesize that you also have to be either hyper dedicated so that would be conscientious or hyperco competitive or both and for the so so I we could be in a perverse situation where well let's play out the extreme case on average women will make better scientists than men but the best scientists will be men we could we could be in a situation where we'd have to balance that those probabilities so I wouldn't say the best scientists are men because to me that's like making predictions about individual cases based on pattern so I will say on average right we should expect to see that in the in the pool of best scientists that is a male bias sex ratio I would agree with that statement okay okay so let's clarify the absolute best scientist could actually be a woman and that wouldn't violate the patterns of and I'm not saying that said it more precisely but yes no I which is but I think that that matters when you're talking about something like this I think does matter matters a lot yeah exactly and so um so I I think that we

issue we talked about what is a woman and that took a long time and you wouldn't think so because you would think that would be obvious and it is because people can perceive the difference between male and female at a second um you are your hormones and you in the time of fertility those are the two of the first three chapters so what do you mean you are your hormones what I mean is a lot of times especially culturally and in the US and I I don't know whether or not this is true elsewhere I just know my experiences here we have a tendency to talk about our hormones like there's something external to us like there's us our sort of hormone free rational self and then there's us under the control of hormones um and that's just simply not the way that it works um our hormones are part of the signaling Machinery that our brain uses to create the experience of being the person we are right so they're like neurotransmitters or anything else when we consider the fact that there's a bunch of gears and sprockets that all work together to make us the sort of person that we are with our restaurant preferences and personalities and you know likes and dislikes um our hormones play a role in that that's like part of the Machinery it's like so that shouldn't be segregated off that's right exactly right it's this thing that happens to us right yeah and so I I think that this is something that on the one hand is really obvious because it's like I don't think if you tell that to somebody they would say well yeah of course it is but it said but then what happens we change people's hormones yeah right well testosterone is another great test case where um you know here we have a testosterone clinic on every corner these days and uh and so people are changing their hormonal profile thinking about what it's going to do to this thing or that thing so for example if a man is taking testosterone thinking like oh I'll get my upper body strength back or maybe it'll improve my libido or women go on birth control pills thinking oh I won't have to get my you know um I won't ovulate and I won't get pregnant without thinking about the fact that you're actually shutting down your body's ability to produce its own hormones you're taking a daily dose of the synthetic hormone and when you change hormones because hormones are literally a part of what your brain uses to create you it changes you and um and so that whole chapter is just really trying to orient people okay so you're trying to bring people back into their body in some way BR back into their body well you can understand why people have a problem with this because imagine you get angry yeah you know and then later you regret it you're going to feel like the anger overtook you like it was an alien force in some ways you know and the the it seems to me that the part of us that we identify with is something like the integrated self right and then that integrated self can fall under the sway of impulses that are more neurologically primordial and we do feel that as a defeat we do feel that as a subordination or even as a possession and so you can see why people have that hesitancy to identify with their hormon driven impulses right but by the same token those elements of you that might be excessive when isolated are a part of you and have to be integrated and they also have benefits that yeah in all likelihood far outweigh their costs okay so what do you think the costs are now you talked about hormonal substitution in women with the birth control pill now there's maybe there's two aspects to that one is that that the the consequence of the suppression per se and we definitely need to talk about that and then there's also the fact that what the normal hormonal regimen is being substitute what the substitution for that is isn't the same hormonal profile right because it's not the same chemical okay so let's start with the consequences of the hormonal transformation what has that done to women and what does it do to the relationship between men and women yeah and a really great questions I mean our hormones we have them for a reason like like evolution by selection doesn't select for costly traits and hormones are expensive you know they're metabolically expensive they make our brain reorganize themselves every month none of that stuff would go on if it wasn't doing something to promote survival or reproduction and so by eliminating that by decreasing or you know sort of minimizing women's exposure to C you know cyclicity in their hormonal profiles you're essentially changing a lot of the things that are fundamental to being a woman so just to give some examples of this you know for a naturally cycling woman which is what we'll call a woman who's not on the pill right because she's naturally cycling between her two hormones hormones go through two different states across the state of a cycle it starts off in with hormone levels are really low when a woman gets her period which is the first day of her cycle and then estrogen levels begin to increase as her egg follicles are being stimulated and as they're beginning to mature that releases high levels of estrogen and when estrogen increases because it's nearing the time when women are able to conceive in the cycle um it tends like it causes a lot of biological physiological and psychological changes that make women primed for sex so it makes women smell better to men it makes women look more attractive to men because their skin becomes more vascularized their cheeks become Rosier they just look more um they just look sexier they smell sexier they move sex their voices are sexier there's all of this research that's been showing that when estrogen levels are rising in the cycle that it's Associated get more tips strippers get more tips yeah they earn more tip money I mean it's a real phenomenon and um and this you know this happens right as women are so why not flatten that why isn't that just annoying for women and to so they can replace that with a more regulated emotional light and one that's less unpredictable right but yeah but that's like equating that's like equating normal and predictable with the male pattern yeah right much that's not and and that's not true it's like that's that's normal for males and predictable for males but that's not true for women that's not predictable for women um we're different entities and I think that we've been in this cultural Paradigm that equates normal with male for so long that we're even afraid to ask the question of what if both of our hormonal States matter like what if there's two halves to don't you think it's okay it seems to me that it and maybe this is unfair but it seems to me remarkably perverse that at least some of this can be laid at the feet of the feminists well let's look at a couple of the strange things that we have as a consequence of the of the feminist world we have the insistence that career is going to be the most important part of a woman's life now the leftist feminists and they're generally leftist are anti-corporate but they're pro career okay so that's very weird a career is to have a career is to be embedded in what the feminists object to as the patriarchy right to subordinate your cyclicity to the hormonal rhythms of a man you can't imagine something that would be more like subordination to the demands of the oppressive patriarchy right that that kind of like sums it up you're going to suppress the biological manifestations of femininity in favor of a Persona that makes you optimally fun in the corporate patriarchy right so all of that I mean there's so I mean there's so many contradictions at the heart of that right because another one is um you know we need to hire women in equal numbers as men because of the diversity that they bring to the workforce but women are just like men right right well and we do everything we can to suppress their horal variation that would in fact make them different yeah no yeah no and you're right I mean a lot of the people who um are re who really get nervous about talking about cyclicity and talking about hormonal changes um are sort of the Old Guard feminist where they and and where they um and and you know I um I I understand where all of that originated I mean women as we've had a very bad history of being treated pretty poorly because of the fact that our hormones change but it's like I think that it's time that we need to move past that and say you know all of this this idea that there's something problematic about cycling hormones is assuming that there's only one way to be that's correct and that way as male and that's wrong I mean to me it's like I I I reject that um and and and yes our our hormones change and um and you can say that they make us unpredictable but it's actually incredibly predictable like if you throw give me any woman you bring her in off the street and put her here and I ask her how old she is and when was the first day of her last menstrual cycle I can tell you with pretty good certainty what her hormones are doing at that moment right if I bring a man in off the street I have absolutely no idea what his primary sex hormone is doing because testosterone is reactive it increases when there's a beautiful woman around it decreases if your sports team loses it increases if your sports team wins your political candidate loses it decreases so testosterones is incredibly that's also relevant to why the men would be hanging around the high status men because if your sports team wins then your testosterone testosterone go more yeah no so I mean I so I I a lot of these um these ideas that people have been using to re reject the idea or object to the fact that um that women are arey they have cycles and that there's something problematic about that are all very much steeped in the idea that the male way of being is optimal normal and correct and that the women you know the female way of being is problematic and I absolutely reject that and um and so when we take the birth control pill what it does is instead of allowing you to cycle between these two hormones because you start with this big increase in estrogen which is coordinating all the activities related to sex and conception because this is the period in the cycle in which sex can lead to conception how long a period is that it's about four so that that period of time is about 5 to S days so about 5 days prior to ovulation and then within 24 hours of ovulation during that window which we call the fertile window um sex can lead to conception and that's how many days a month uh it's about 5 to S yeah right okay so and and then after ovulation a little temporary endocrine structure forms from the m the egg follicle and it begins releasing women's other primary sex hormone which is progesterone and when that hormone is being released it tends to make us sleepier it makes us hungrier it makes us um it lowers our testosterone levels it does a bunch of things physiologically that are helping prepare women's bodies for pregnancy right and prepare prepare ourselves for the possibility that an egg might implant and so women generally are less like likely to be going out and doing risky things they're more likely to avoid contaminants so women's disgust sensitivity increases there's all of these things that go on that are essentially preparing our body for when they have maximal postcoidal regret that I bet that you yeah that's so funny and so you get this waxing and waning between these two hormones that are organizing our bodies for two different activities implantation and conception or pardon me sex and uh conception and then implantation and pregnancy and we go in between these two states and each of these hormonal States is associated with different types of psychological patterns and physiological patterns I mean even they've done studies where they scan women's Brains every day across the cycle and take hormone measures and it's like you see things like white matter density increasing um it when estrogen is high spinal you get new um dendritic spines in the hippocampus when estrogen is present and then these things Retreat when you're under the control of progesterone and so we experience all these changes um and that's a very normal part of of being a woman and when you take the birth control pill what what it does is you get a daily dose of a relatively low level of synthetic estradi so estrogen and a relatively and a relatively high level of synthetic progesterone which is called a progestin because it's not biologically identical and this mimics the state that a woman's body is in during that second half of the menstrual cycle when conception isn't possible and what this does is it sends a signal to the hypothalamus not to stimulate the ovaries to produce a new egg because it's essentially waiting to see what happen s with the one that was just ovulated and so when you're taking the pill you get the same daily dose every day of this synthetic hormonal State that's kind of keeping you so in principle in principle the body's reacting as if the woman has been sexually satiated in the most fundamental way she might be pregnant yes she might be pregnant essentially is what that is saying and so one of the logical consequences of that would that correct me if I'm wrong she should be less interested in sex but then but then this also ties into her the change in her preference for for men yes so let's talk about that a little bit because well one of the things that really shocked me when I came across this probably 10 15 years ago was that there were pronounced VAR there was pronounced variability in the facial in the faces that women found attractive across the menstrual cycle and so if you take photographs of the same man and you widen or narrow the jaw widen widen Jaws is a sign of more uh classically dominant it's the wrong way of thinking about competent confident masculine faces he can do it with the same man and the women who are in their most fertile periods prefer the wider jawed men yes and so okay so so then I thought oh oh this is a problem because it means that women who are on the pill prefer feminine men then I thought that's a real problem because it might be that women on the pill really don't like masculine men uhoh that's probably a problem because we have a lot of tension between women and men in our society and we have no idea how much that's driven by the fact that the pill is transforming the manner in which females perceive the most masculine men I mean it's it's terrifying if that's the case right no it's I I mean it's very provocative right that's the word I would use it's incredibly provocative um because research has been showing now for about 20 years that when women are in the point in the cycle when estrogen is high that that's associated with an increased preference for testosterone cues like you said um vocal facial and behavioral masculinity are things that women are really zeroing in on um right near high fertility in the cycle and this of course begs the question well then what happens if a woman is on hormonal birth control and is never in the estrogen dominant phase of her cycle then what happens and researchers have since asked that question and what they tend to find is that women who are on hormonal birth control desire a somewhat less masculine male face and male voice and there's been some research even showing that if women chose their Partners when they're on hormonal birth control and then discontinue it that this can lead to changes and how they perceive and how attracted they are to their partner yeah I read that tell me if this is right that if they picked an attractive partner when they're off the pill they find them even more attractive but if they picked a less desirable partner when they're off the pill they find them even less desirable so it seems to okay so that's right it magnifies the consequence of their choices yeah it's like all sudden the blinders were off and so now they can if they chose somebody who that they found attractive and because they weren't really paying that much attention to that or weren't prioritizing that when they were on the pill all of a sudden the blinders are off they see it they love it they're attracted to it their relationship satisfaction goes up their sexual desire and their relationship goes up and if the opposite happens it's the opposite and we just so do do women on the pill pick friends as mates oh interesting I've I've never seen a study looking at that but I mean it wouldn't be a far stretch to make that prediction just because it does seem like women who are choosing their Partners on the pill if there's a pattern that's found the pattern is that women are generally zeroing in on qualities that have less to do with sexiness and sexual desire and masculinity and more zeroing in on things like um safety and and is this Nur compion yeah yeah exactly and so yeah well you can see that like women women have a very very difficult choice to make right because they want to pick a guy who can win a comption with other guys they want to pick a guy who can keep the Psychopaths at Bay they want to pick a guy who's productive but they also need to pick someone who's generous and capable of forming responsible relationships well you know talk about a play of opposites and you could imagine that any shift in hormonal balance is going to skew that in one direction or another right yeah I mean for partner choice I always I always tell my women in my class and and also the men the few men that are in my class because it's a university and it's all women now um but what we gener what I tell them is it's all about making tradeoffs right and and and sort of which side of the you know table you're stacking your coins are you stacking your coins more on the sort of sexiness um yeah keeping the Psychopaths at Bay kind of masculinity types of qualities are you stacking your chips all the way over here of good caregiver provider going to help you know uh with the children I'm putting them more toward the middle everybody makes a a tradeoff and essentially what we do what our hormones do is they kind of nudge where we put our stack you know and um and what we can see when this happens in mass is you can see and mass changes in in partner preferences potentially which is as noted pretty provocative well we have no idea what the political consequences of that are right because you could also imagine this is like the worst case scenario imagine that there's a distribution of women who are affected by hormonal transformation and some women are relatively unaffected and some women are tremendously affected well you could imagine that the tremendously affected women would have more impetus to engage politically right so the ones right so imagine that there's a subset of women For Whom the birth control pill makes masculine men particularly undesirable right right now imagine that that transforms itself into Political motivation because it might I don't not saying we know this we don't know it because we don't know anything about the relationship between hormonal transformation and political activism but the probability that there's no relationship zero right right so we thrown this new monkey Ranch into the works in 1960 that's transformed the relationship between men and women and we have no idea we really have no idea what the consequences of that are no you know I was just talking in my class about this because I I I think it's really fascinating because I I I think culturally we're I mean we've been feeling the tensions that are created by this for a very long time now and again you know I'm somebody I I feel very much like I I benefited from the pill I was on it for a decade it was it was a great time in my life to be on it um that you know it it didn't cause me any problems that I'm aware of I got to have my kids and I want to got to invest and so on and so forth but um at the same time you know having this having women have the opportunity to invest really heavily in their careers essentially sets up these expectations where women are supposed to be both women and men right and so women now it's like cuz it's not either or you know it's not like oh are you going to go to work yeah or are you going to stay home and take care of your kids it's like um no I'm doing both things so we we've set up this this expectation where women are supposed to be women and men and I think women's mental health is suffering hugely as a consequence of this I think it's been very hard for women trying to balance everything um and with the expectation that they're supposed to be doing all of it yeah but it also begs the question of what's left over for the men well and this is what I think is really interesting so this was the the Revelation I just had a couple days ago I actually had it when I was teaching and I told my students about it and I'm like I think I'm on to something with this but you know testosterone levels are an absolute nater right now I mean they're at an all-time low um and there's a lot of regions could that be a consequence of excess masturbation just out of curiosity you don't okay why not cuz I thought masturbating it matches the increase in pornography you say yeah no I look I completely yes and and and that goes on concurrently but testosterone level no cuz usually when men are seeing a lot of attractive women it makes their testosterone increase and then that's not something that like takes a major bit after masturbation so you think that's been put to rest all right so testosterone levels are testosterone levels are super low and you know and there's a lot of reasons for this you know we know there's a lot of xenoestrogens and the you know in the water and that that might be messing with their hormones and men are heavier than they used to be and fat aromatizes testosterone and makes it turns it into estrogen which also lowers men testosterone levels um another advantage of an all carb diet yeah but so here's another here's here's another interesting thing and I don't know if you know about this research but it's it's really fascinating so you know culturally we tend to think about testosterone as being this thing that like is always good to have super high right we think it's masculinity and virility and protection and um but testosterone is among other things it's a hormone of mating effort right it's like effort that you're directing toward winning and doing things that are going to attract Partners it also it's linked with men's interest in extra pair partners and all these other types of sort of counterproductive behaviors within the cont of a long-term pair bond and so what research finds is that when men get married or are in a long-term committed relationship their testosterone level levels decrease a little bit and this happens absolutely functionally because it's essentially taking easing the foot off the gas pedal because it's keeping men from doing counterproductive things within the context of a parabon when men have young children so it tilts the more to the oh okay go ahead men have children their testosterone levels decrease again okay and and the more caregiving that men do the more their testosterone lowers and this isn't permanent right this is a shift that men's bodies make in response to the environmental cues that's very adaptive and makes a whole lot of sense with our H they shouldn't be sexually attracted to the children for example yeah well exactly they shouldn't be attracted to the children and they also like if you've got young children at home who survival is dependent on you you need to keep your eye on the ball and not on the next door neighbor right right um and um and be and raising your children and so I started to think about this and I was thinking about this idea that you know women are being expected to be both women and men men are being expected to be both men and women because what men are now doing more household work and more child care than they ever have before I think women also tend to find not attractive well no they do like I mean it creates problems within the relationship because yeah women lose sexual attraction in that context but then men's testosterone levels could be decreasing in response to that and that could be one of the factors that's contributing to men's low testosterone currently is that we' created this case where where women are having to be women and men and men are having to be men and women right and so so what it perversely for the men is that the men who are adopting the caregiver role more explicitly also put themselves in the terrible position where they're Le less sexually desirable I saw a very funny study at one point it might have been David bus because he does funny studies all the time because he's still allowed to I think what they showed they showed University age women the same men engaging in male stereotyped activities and female stereotyped activities like vacuuming for example God Only Knows Why That's female stereotype but has something to do with nesting I suppose and reliably the women rated the men who are engaged in the more feminine activities as less sexually attractive right yeah know Absolut absolutely I mean that is such a um it creates this cruel bind but I also think you know it's it's funny I was having I teach a class called um Evolution sex and the brain and we ask big questions so this is is a class I really enjoy teaching because they encourage us to ask difficult questions that nobody really knows the answer to and one of the questions I always ask them is about seduction because seduction is such an important part of women's sexuality the idea of a man who has some sort of status and dominance sort of um like you know uh being masculine and women find that attractive and they find that sexual you know like that's sexually arousing and there's this whole literature about the idea of like one of the things that men do is sort of awaken women's sexuality with that's the kiss of the prince well yeah and so then the idea that that now we're in this environment where we say that we can't do that right right and and but but it's like also at the same time you know it is important that that women have exercise choice right and obviously like we don't want women getting sexually assaulted and so it's like like how do we create a space like culturally like what what is the conversation that we need to be having where it's like seduction is okay except that it's not yeah you know I mean it's really it's really you're definitely going to get fired you're absolutely 100% Going to well I see one of the things that's so perverse about the modern University campus is on the one hand there's this absolute insistence that every possible form of sexual behavior is not only to be tolerated but celebrated or even worshiped and on the other hand every single interaction between a young man and a young woman is so Rife with danger that it has to be formulated into a contract before it can be undertaken right well you get with that sort of absolute lenti justness you're going to get a call for like tyrannical regulation of sexual behavior because right because you can't have that much looseness without a demand for tightness but it does beg the question that you're putting forward and and well one of the answers to that I would say this is a sort of a sideways answer is that uh alcohol is a very bad thing to pour into the mix right yes you know because I it's it's the case that almost all sexual assault especially the date rape types but even the more violent types almost all spousal abuse all of that would disappear if alcohol disappeared this is a conversation nobody will have about campuses because part of the problem on campuses is that young men and young women who don't have that much experience with each other and who are also anxious as a consequence generally meet each other in alcohol fueled bouts and that's like you would the you can't say that alcohol causes violent crime but you can damers say it you know 50% of people who are murdered are drunk 50% of the murderers are drunk the stats are even worse with regards to sexual assault if without alcohol yeah yeah without alcohol it would almost never happen so that's something that could be started as a topic of reasonable dis discussion on University campuses like are there places where young men and young women can congregate and meet that aren't fueled by alcohol induced stupidity and recklessness right oh now it's complicated because part of the reason that people drink is so that they can engage in alcohol fueled stupidity because it's fun and one of the problems with the pill is that it actually allows that to occur without it being utterly catastrophic now it's catastrophic in that the rate of sexual assault skyrockets and that's you know not trivial but right yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so you wrote a letter to your daughter at the end of your book he I did yeah and so oh I want to ask you a couple of other things here The Curious Case of the missing cortisol let's do two things The Curious Case of the missing cortisol that's very interesting and also um a letter to my daughter sure okay so cortisol yeah uh this actually is the reason I wrote the book uh and and I'll say that it's the reason I wrote the book because uh I was sitting in a research talk about the effects of early life trauma on the stress response in adulthood and I'm sure you're very familiar with all of this work um because one of the things that I I do research on is early life adversity and affects developmental outcomes and I was in a research talk on that and the researcher was just like mentioning you know oh we collected data on X number of men and women and we only analyze the data in um of the men in our sample because the majority of the women in our sample happen to be on hormonal birth control and uh everybody knows that women on hormonal birth control don't have a cortisol response to stress and then yeah that was me I was like no who knows knows that like everybody knows that and I so I went up and I didn't hear anything else because it was just like I was just absolutely stunned because that's like what you see with PTSD and that's what you see with people who've experienced severe trauma is no cortisol response to stress it's not good and so I waited until after the talk and I went and to talk you see that in depression too if it's long term yeah I know I mean it's really really bad and uh so it's it means no play in response to stress no adaptation in response to stress no I know and it's funny because everybody always thinks that like cortisol is this bad guy and like wo it's got to be great to and it's like no like like stress is the bad guy cortisol helps you adapt to stress like cortisol is a good guy who comes in to help sort of restore homeostasis after your body's gotten all screwed up from whatever's stressing it out and so I went and I talked to my colleague afterward and I said did you say that women on hormonal birth control don't have a stress response and he's like yeah they they don't I I was really surprised by it too but then I went to the literature they don't have an Adaptive stress response yeah they don't cuz they they they report experiencing stress and they have an um their sympathetic stress response is still going off but they don't they don't have any cortisol release and so I went to the literature and he was right there people had been publishing on this since the 90s and I I'd never heard anything about it and I was on the pill and I'm a woman and I study women's hormones and anyway after that I was like what else don't I know about hormonal birth control and that was what led me in the rabbit hole that essentially led me to write the book because there were so many things that the pill does in terms of you know neurobiologically like what it does in terms of the brain and then psychologically proximately like in terms of mood um sexual desire partner Choice which we talked about an attraction and the consquence of the attent okay so women get stressed they don't have a cortisol so what's the consequence of that so here's the here's the really great answer nobody knows um I'll tell you what we know from research that's not that hasn't directly linked the things together um we just did a study where we found that um you get changes in the inflammatory response to stress in hormonal birth control pill users in ways that's consistent with the type of inflammatory response that tends to lead to things like autoimmunity which we know women are at a much greater risk for than men does it lead to depression because there's lots of evidence that depression is an inflammatory condition yes depression and anxiety are also some things that we know that being on hormonal birth control control puts you at a significant greater risk for and um all of these things are what you would expect in the case when you have a blunted cortisol response to stress so what does the normal cortisol response do so if you're stressed right so normally if you and I are um are you know if I'm being filmed let's say to be on a podcast that a lot of people listen to um what would generally start happening about 5 minutes after I arrived here is my cortisol would start to increase and it's doing this because it knows I am in a high pressure situation right it could be high pressure good or high pressure bad because stress is something that we get when we're being chased by a pack of hungry Wolverines but it's also something that we get on like our wedding day or Christmas morning for children is a time when cortisol is really high opportunity and threat opportunity and threat so it's essentially flagging your brain something important is happening right so should heighten attention heightened attention so our brain is aware it's on its game we start um creating new neurons in our hippocampus are being birthed resp because you should learn you should learn when there is maximum opportunity and Maxim threat hippocampus is crucial for that absolutely and that's exactly what's going on so that's an important thing that our bodies do is it's grabbing on it's helping us absorb these important experiences so that way we can have them for later it dumps fat and sugar change to change yeah to change it dumps fat and sugar into our bloodstream so that way we our brain has access to glucose but also so our muscles do so we can make a quick get away if we need to get away quickly if we're being chased um it's a so it should it should mean that blunted cortisol response should mean that women on birth control don't update their navigational Maps as effectively because the hippocampus is also the fundamental place of the origin of hippocampal maps yeah for Hipp map navigational Maps right yeah and I've never seen any research on that in particular but I have seen it with emotional memories and what they find is that women who are on hormonal birth control have a harder time encoding emotionally valanced events when you stress out which is exactly what you would expect that means you're not adapting to the that's really not good no it's not and I've actually heard from a woman who was a practicing therapist because I had gotten several emails and finally somebody called me and I I I answered the phone which I don't usually do and I don't know the number but it was one of these therapists asking about PTSD and therapy when women are on hormonal birth control because they all had the same theory that women don't respond as well to therapy for PTS yeah when're on the pill oh my God that's also that's that's terrible because there's no difference between exposure therapy and learning right exposure therapy is just the technical use of the learning situation in the therapeutic context right exactly yeah and she said we we don't get the kinds of outcomes that we need um when we have women who on the pill okay so what that implies is women don't women on the pill can't update as well yeah exactly Jesus that's brutal yeah and so this is I mean obviously and and here's this thing that we're taking just not to obious and in some cases women are being put on this teenagers for their skin yeah and it's it it's like we know nothing about the longterm consequences of brain development of blunting a woman's hormonal own hormone production and then replacing it with these synthetics ABS there's no way it doesn't affect brain development I mean it's like post puberal brain development is coordinated by our sex hormones right and um and if you blunt that you know for a naturally cycling woman you go through this period of estrogen and then progesterone and estrogen and progesterone and when you shut that down and then just put in this daily synthetic dose the idea that that's going to lead to the same brain development outcomes is getting is that an extension of pu prepubertal hormonal balance yeah I mean yeah prepubertal hormones are such a disaster because women's hpg axes are still regulating themselves I mean their brains and ovaries are still learning how to communicate everything and so women's Cycles tend to be messed up a little bit you know screwy at that time because everything is learning itself so does does does putting women on the pill when they're very young interfere with the full manifestation of puberty that's a really great question and it's not one that anybody knows the answer to it seem it seems like a logical conclusion from what you described well exactly I mean it's not something that I know and the thing is is we've been putting women on these drugs forever I've only seen three studies that have looked at long-term consequences of hormonal birth control use during Ence and on development what what um the research is pointing in the direction of the fact that using uh hormonal birth control during adolescence puts you at a greater risk of developing major depressive disorder over the course of your lifetime even after you've discontinued it not good stuff not something that you want your daughter to be suffering so that way she doesn't have acne um and I don't think that this is being very well communicated to the parents of girls um and and I think it's a travesty I really do m h okay two more things these the hormones that women are put on aren't the bioidentical hormone okay so let's talk about that and then let's talk about your your my daughter okay so um the the the synthetic hormones that are in hormonal birth control you think that they would be sort of biologically identical to our body's hormones and for the most part the synthetic estrogen that is in hormonal birth control is um it it it it has nice binding affinity and nice binding specificity to estrogen receptors um the synthetic progesterone or the progestins that are in hormonal birth control are not um and most of them aren't even synthesized from progesterone they're actually synthesized from most of them from testosterone and so chem chemist modify testosterone molecules in ways that make them able to stimulate progesterone receptors um but they don't always have perfect binding specificity meaning that they also bind to other receptors for other hormones and they don't necessarily have mess they're messy and they don't have good binding Affinity where they'll stimulate the receptor and then fall off and then what that means is you need higher dose of yeah is you need to take higher doses to make sure that you're getting enough um progesterone which increases the degree to which they're activating things they they shouldn't be activ be activating yeah and that's and that's actually reason to be um the explanation for why women experience the blunted cortisol response uh in response to the uh stress is that the progestins in hormonal birth control some of them will stimulate glucocorticoid receptors essentially making women's bodies believe that they're in a stra state of chronic stress and so women's bodies are then shutting down the stress response depression is a consequence of being in constant stress well absolutely and when you look at the patterns I mean the thing about this is that when you look at the it's all pointing in this direction where um when you look at the risk of depression and even the suicide risk for women who are on hormone Al birth control especially in adolescents so 19 and younger is really high during the first 3 months of use and think about it this is when their their glucocorticoid receptors are probably just being flooded with these non-specific progestins that are stimulating those making their body think that it's World War II you know and and oh that's just what you need at puberty well I know and and because it's already World War I I know and so so they're feeling terrible until their body finally shuts down the stress response and then you don't get any stress response to stress um but women actually end up feeling a little bit better because they're no longer you know sort of psychologically being put into this state of trauma like constant trauma um I think that uh it's it's crazy to me that this is the best we can do you know I feel like I think about how important why aren't we doing better than this you know I think that the reason for that we is because because like there's nothing more important than this no fertility regulation is so important for women in terms of being able to meet their goals that most women are willing to put up with all the  that goes along with it because they don't feel like they have any other choices well they also don't know well right and they don't know and then the drug companies are like you know if it ain't broke don't fix it and so it's like well the women are taking it you know so who cares and and and women are like you know we just having to deal with it um but but we need too I know we need to do better I mean and I look at what they're doing now you know they're investing in male birth control but all that they're doing is Shifting the problem that we have for women and shifting it onto men So currently what they're looking at and you tell me how many men you know that would take this they're looking at a gel that men rub on themselves that will lower their testosterone to such a degree that they'll no longer produce sperm oh yeah I mean don't you think that's take offers testost I was say there's a bunch of guys in the room here lined up to take it yeah yeah I mean it's like nobody's going to it's just a dumb idea and all it's going to and it causes the same side effects in men that our hormonal birth control does in women because it's shutting down their sex hormones and um and and the men that they that they try it on are like these side effects are terrible I'm not taking this um and these are the side effects that we put up with because we don't have another Choice It's like because we're the ones who have the baby if if we end up with the slip up and so I you know I really um my my whole push with with all of this is not that that you know the birth control pill is terrible and that it's you know done all these awful things I mean it's it's a trade-off and it's definitely going to have societal consequences that we haven't even begun to begin to put our fingers on um but it's all about like educating yourself what are the trade-offs that are being made when you go on hormonal birth control and then also putting pressure on you know people like drug makers and policy makers who are investing in companies that invest in drug companies and other types of technology to do something better because we need to be able to do better um we need to be able to do better you need to go to Washington and talk to the Republican study committee I mean seriously seriously yes you you need to do that y seriously yeah I mean we can do better for women we can do better for men we can do better for the people that love them and so my last chapter in my book the letter to my daughter I wrote Because I have a daughter I have a 16-year-old daughter and you know one of the things that I've thought about just as soon as I was writing this book was what does this mean for her you know do I what I recommend for her if she's sexually active when she's especially a teenager would I recommend for her to go on hormonal birth control which I know works right and it's effective and it's easy to use and it's easy for a teenager to use or would I tell her to use something else and you know ultimately my conclusion to that is that the answer to that question is going to be unique to every single woman and so I included that chapter in the book because I wanted all women to hear what I will say to my daughter when we're having to make that decision in terms of what are some of the things that you need to think about that's how you made it personal right yeah because um I mean these are this a really this is a personal choice and I think that it's really important that we think about like so for example how old are you right so we've been talking about brain development you know if my daughter wanted to start hormonal birth control before the age of 19 um I would want her not to be on it if there's any other thing that we can do that I know would prevent her from getting pregnant if she was sexually active um just because of what I know about brain development after 19 the effects seem to be more or less reversible like I mean so even if you go on it and something bad happens if you discontinue it no harm no foul right but before that time so the earlier the onset the the earlier the onset though yeah well you know that's also the case with sexual behavior so the biggest corlet one of the biggest corlet of early sexual behavior is antisocial personality so and it goes back to that dark Tetra totally see that yeah yeah absolutely absolutely so and so you know so you know thinking about that and then thinking about what are your life goals why do you want to be on it you know cuz some things you know preventing pregnancy when you're especially if you're like a teen girl for example I mean what an important that's like the most important thing you can do really because you know there there's no bigger predictor of poverty for women than single motherhood nothing especially when you're a young single mother that's just like putting you on the wrong path um in terms of like what the your aspirational hopes are and so um you know it's like considering where you are in your life considering age considering the product that you're on and then sort of going through the different types of things that are out there considering non- hormonal options and like what the cost and benefits of those things are this just to be mature enough as a society to actually have a serious conversation with young people about sexual behavior as such because one of the things you know one of your chapters I can't remember exactly the title is why didn't I know this yeah right well we're not very good in our sex education at schools of walking people through the dangers of short-term sexual mating strategies say well the pill I'm because want to casualx because that's the issue it's like well do you really want to have casual sex it's like what what does that mean exactly what are you sacrificing of yourself who is that going to make you attracted to who are the males that are more most likely to accept that invitation like because we had this idea and the pill produced this in large part that we could divorce sex from its broader context its broader relationship relational context let's say it's political and social context and I don't think any of that's true and so for a comprehensive sex education Not only would people have to be educated in relationship to the sort of biological realities that you're describing they'd also have to be educated in relationship to the psychological realities the difference between short-term and long-term M strategies how that's associated with personality very very complicated yeah and you know I think that there's a lot of especially in because we we tend to think about um you know high school students or college students and short-term sexual behavior but a lot of the people seeking birth control are people who are in long-term relationships that are you know just trying to not get pregnant in the context of their long-term committed relationship and even just having honest yes I I love the idea of having honest conversations about you know sex sexual development well and that Rel those long-term relationships tell me what you think about this you know my my sense is that you you get to try out about four people in your life and that's it right well because if you think that fertility window let's say it's it's it's in trouble by the age of 30 so you've really got by the time you have a bit of a brain so let's say 19 you've got 11 years right okay so how many people can you get to know to evaluate for long-term mating suitability in 11 years well five is a lot I would say right right so yeah no I think that's funny I love that you landed on four I mean it seems it seems reasonable right like I don't yeah well it's but the thing is it's reasonable it's very finite yeah and so that means the importance of your choice of a committed dating partner is likely far more important than you think right cuz maybe when you're 17 you think I have lots of time it's like well you're 17 and you've only been alive for 17 years and 10 years might seem like a long time but it's not right right especially when you have to leaving home adopting the responsibilities of an adult becoming educated establishing a career finding a long-term partner you got 10 years to do that you're going to be running especially if you're female right yeah yeah yeah so yeah interesting all right well any parting words for the young women who are how is this changed your let's let's close with this yeah what has learning all this done to your to your views on birth control yeah that's good enough okay okay let me think about this for a moment well I mean to me I had the same blind spot everybody else had I was on hormonal birth control for more than a decade of my life all the while I was studying the effects of women's hormones on the brain I was studying psychology and behavior and the way that women's motivational shifts change in response to hormones and I never spent one second thinking about what the hormones in my birth control were doing to me psychologically like I have that cost yes I had an absolute blind spot and so for me this whole process really removed that blind spot um and it I mean it was embarrassing it was it was really embarrassing to be a psychologist and and I like to think I'm a pretty good one and that and that I know a lot about a lot and never have to made that connection really felt like I was like this is the most this the most embarrassing thing ever right but uh but that's how how sort of blind we all are to it I mean it's also one of the things I talked about in the book is like St anabolic steroids are illegal because of the impact they can have on men's health because they're sex hormones and they have these non-specific effects all throughout the body hormonal birth control has all these you know non-specific effects throughout the body and it's available over the counter so you know we we've got we've got it's a total blind spot on on the way that we treat these two things and well we've only had three or four generations to adapt to the biggest biological transformation in our species history yeah no I agree agree we're in the early days of this but it is insanely complicated and R with unintended consequences which you're doing a stellar job of pointing out and hopefully that will help spark a conversation that's a bit more uh productive productive mature and focused on the fact that uh everything has a price everything has a price right thank you you bet right all right to everyone watching and listening thank you very much for your attention to the Daily wire people plus people for facilitating this live conversation which we're going to be doing a bunch of in the next couple of months uh thank you for the time and effort expended on that I'm going to talk to Dr Hill for another half an hour behind the dailywire plus platform that's usually where I delve into more autobiographical issues very interested in how people's interests how they're calling makes itself manifest in their life often from an early age so we're going to find that out these are very useful conversations to attend to if you're interested in well hearing from people who've had a stellar career and often done a good job of balancing that with their life how they managed it you know and you can't hear too much about that as far as I'm concerned so thank you everyone for your attention talk to you [Music] soon
