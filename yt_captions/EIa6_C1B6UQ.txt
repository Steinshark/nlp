hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about whether or not directional rotors uh can improve brake Cooling and as you can see I am a sweaty disgusting mess uh that's because it's over 100° in my garage and I've been working on my car all day I used to be an engineer and I lived in a cubicle uh you know I didn't have Windows but I did have air conditioning but it's way cooler to be in a garage uh without windows and no air conditioning so in order to make myself still seem legitimate I'm wearing these glasses I feel like if I take them off kind of just look like I don't know how to play football but I'm trying so those are there for professionalism let's talk about uh directional rotor so what is a directional rotor basically what happens is you have veins in here which are curved so they try and rotate and spin the air out uh rather than just straight veins which you will have on stock Vehicles so why would they do uh straight veins if directional is uh you know a better for cooling well it's because it's more expensive so these are going to be directional you can only put this rotor on this left side the other rotor on the right side uh some people will think this is on the wrong side because of these slots but in fact this is the correct Side based on how the veins are oriented um and so you know it's more expensive because you have to have two castings so if you just have ones with straight veins you can put on either side it's cheaper to make that's why you know all the auto manufacturers uh will use that as you know like the cheapest option if they choose to so the other difference versus the stock rotors uh is that this pulls air from the wheel side so from the outside air rather than from you know this heat shield side and pulling air in from you know your engine bay and suspension and stuff like that where you could have warm air uh floating around in there make sure you bring in cool air uh to go around it so does it actually improve cooling well I ran two different tests and really six different runs now the way that I actually measured the temperature on the brake discs themselves I've got this uh Data Logger here and so it has a magnetic uh Probe on the end of it and I just attach that to the brake rotor measure the temp I can record it and then look at that data in a spreadsheet and so for the first test what I did is I started from a standstill I recorded the temperature of the brake rotor front uh both the front left and the front right uh took the average of those accelerated to 60 MPH then came to a stop about 50% throttle 50% brakes uh in this and then back on the accelerator another 60 m hour and then back on the brakes come to a complete stop and then measure the uh rotor temp so up to 60 MPH stop up to 60 MPH stop measure the rotor temperature so on the stock rotors uh they started out at an average of 41° on the front and at the end of that first run they were at 137.5 De C versus uh the aftermarket ones which we have here these are Speed Engineering uh rotors and they started at 34 degrees and got up to an average of 150 degrees so as you can see they actually got hotter than the stock rotors second test did that again started with an average of 79 for the stock rotors started with an average of 84.5 for the aftermarket got up to 165 for the stock rotors got up to 167 on the aftermarket rotors so you see that the aftermarket one started higher the directional rotor started higher and they also ended higher um and then finally we get to our final test uh average of 81 to start with the stock rotors average of 85 for the aftermarket rotors got up to 173 with the stock rotors got up to 190 with the aftermarket rotors So based on that testing it seemed like these actually performed worse okay so I decided to do another test uh and this other test I ran downhill so I started at the top of this hill measured the temperature of the rotors accelerate up to 40 mph put it in neutral and then just use the brakes to Coast down and remain at 40 mph so only the brakes are being used no engine braking and then once I got to the stop point I did this for three different uh locations three different starts and finishes and once I got to that stop point I stopped pulled over and then measured the temperature so for the first test started at 56 for the stock rotor started at 43 for the aftermarket rotors got up to 105 for the stock rotors 102 for the aftermarket rotors now the aftermarket rotors started with a uh lower temperature so you know they a little bit of an advantage there also for the ambient temperatures during this second testing the first test ambient temperature was basically the same 23° C versus 24 with the aftermarkets this one there was a bit larger of a difference 22° C for the stock rotors and about 20 6° C for the aftermarket rotor ambient outside temperature while I was doing this testing I tried to get it close uh and I and I was successful for the morning but not so much in the afternoon not a huge difference though couple degrees ultimately when you get to these higher temperatures it's not going to make a huge impact uh so second let's see the test started at 61 and for the uh aftermarket rotors started at 58.5 got up to 138 for the stock rotors got up to 14 one so you can see there and this was the longest one this second run here the aftermarket rotor started cooler and ended hotter than the stock rotors uh not a huge difference 72% hotter uh in the end than the other ones um so in order to calculate the difference in percentage you need to add 273 uh to whatever the degree is in Celsius you have an absolute scale and then you can compare them directly okay our final run started at 138 deg for the stock rotors 141° for the aftermarket rotors ended at 151.50 for the stock rotors ended at 164.524 in the average starting temp versus versus the average ending temp for those first 60 to zero tests um and it turns out these were an average of 2.3 de hotter than the stock rotors and then if you account for ambient temperatures just 2% hotter and then for the downhill tests if you average those all up that was another uh difference of 2.3 degrees hotter but if you count for ambient temperatures because it was hotter outside for these it's really just a 1% difference in how much hotter these were than the stock rotors so not a huge difference in the actual temperatures um and I and I was kind of curious you know there's a ton of variables even though all I did was change these rotors the brake pads were the exact same the rear rotors and pads were the exact same everything was held constant on the car itself except for these rotors I swapped out the rotors uh from stock to these new ones now my first thought was well maybe the tests that I conducted from 60 to 0 from 60 to0 were closer together uh when I did the aftermarket ones didn't give these enough time to cool down like I did for the first runs that wasn't the case there wasn't a big time difference um I was actually really consistent in how long I had between tests for each UH 60 to0 60 to0 run and it was the same little Loop so not a big difference uh and then I thought you know it is possible if I were to slam the brake harder uh with these than I did with the stock rers that means more weight transfer to the front more responsibility on these brakes so you could have a minor difference there or actually a significant difference there depending on how hard you hit the brakes like like I said I gave it about 50% um I think after doing this testing I probably should have just slammed it and been more consistent but you know I I feel somewhat confident in the brake testing itself okay so it wasn't the time between tests um and let's just assume that it wasn't because my braking was different I did look at the cooling rate and these actually cooled uh even just sitting there um when the car wasn't moving they cooled at about 3° for every 10 seconds versus the stock rotors were cooling about 2.4 de for every 10 seconds and so then I thought okay well maybe there's a mass difference here and that's what's accounting for it and in fact these are about a pound lighter than the stock rotors and I think that explains a lot of it so you know they may have better cooling but they're smaller and so if you take uh the same amount of energy and put it into one thing that has less mass and then put it into one thing that has more mass the thing with less mass is going to be at a higher temperature uh because you have more energy uh and and a higher density and so that's what's happening here what's interesting though is these are 7.5% heavier and yet they're only uh being out cooled by 1% and so I thought okay well what's interesting about my testing is that this is all being done with very low temperatures I mean we saw as high as 190 CSUS but even still for breaks that's not all that hot uh if you're going on a track you're going to see significantly higher temperatures and so you know what should be done the best way to do this is a track comparison so that you get these really hot and the cooling efficiency when these are really hot is going to be more important than their Mass because if that mass can't get rid of heat it doesn't matter if it's big uh it's just going to get hotter and hotter and hotter versus if this can get rid of heat really well but doesn't have as much mass it may be able to stay cooler on a track so science of speed actually tested these rotors on a track they did 56 different laps and they had a little infrared uh scanner that was reading the breake rotor temperature uh during the entire lap uh so really cool test that they did and they measured two different laps with stock versus these rotors that was the only difference uh between the two and they noticed that uh the lap times were were within half a mph average so the lap times were pretty consistent um and they noticed that these remained 58.4 de F cooler or about 7 1 12% cooler on average for the entire duration of that lap so even though they do have less Mass they have significantly better cooling design and as a result on the track uh when science of speed was testing them they were able to remain about 60° fhe cooler uh or about 7.4% cooler overall they actually said that uh looking at a plot of the temperature these spent a lot more time in the 500 to 800° Fahrenheit range uh in comparison to the stock rotors which spent a little bit more time in the 800 to 1,000° Fahrenheit range uh so it is cool I do think they're legitimate my testing made it seem like uh these are actually worse I think the biggest reason is because I wasn't actually testing them very hard I wasn't getting them up to super high temperatures where the cooling efficiency can shine rather than the Mass because there is a mass difference and inherently if you put more energy into a smaller amount of mass it will be at a higher temperature so thank you guys for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
