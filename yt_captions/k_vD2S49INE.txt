All right, so, next up,
we have the 1989 Reebok Pumps.  The Reebok Pumps featured
 inflatable chambers  fitted within the shoe
 that enabled the wearer  to create
 a sort of custom fit  by inflating
 or deflating the shoe.  At the heel was
 the energy return system,  which is a series of cylinders  that Reebok claimed
 acted as springs,  releasing energy after
 the foot hits the ground. A lot of the claims were
about enhanced performance. I don't know how many pumps
it's gonna take, but I guess
we should pump 'em up. Just literally
pressing this ball. It's like an air pump. I'm afraid this is gonna
explode if we keep pumping. All right, well,
let's test our jumps. My baseline
in my regular shoes
maxed at 10'8". I'm kinda hoping to see, like,
an extra inch or two. Whoo! I did get 10'9" that time. I did actually get 10'9". Usually, my vertical is 9'3". So with these,
with the added height, with the added
athletic ability, I'm hoping to hit 9'4". - Let's see it.
- At least. - Oh, 9'2".
- 9'2". A little early
  takeoff there. - A little early takeoff.
- So, they need to sell these along with jumping lessons
from instructors.
