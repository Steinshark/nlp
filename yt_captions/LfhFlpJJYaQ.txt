so hello everybody I'm here with deacon Nicholas Cote are those of you follow my channel have seen him here before we did an interview talk about tokine and storytelling and deacon nicholas is just finishing up his series of books on ravenson so we'll talk a little bit about that but we'll mostly talk about the situation right now he wrote a great article for the symbolic world blog on the question of vaccines and fairytales and the importance of meaning and so we'll talk about that our current situation and see how that leads us also to always talk about storytelling because we can't avoid that [Music] this is Jonathan pezzo welcome to the symbolic world [Music] so Deacon Nikolas first off I want to congratulate you on finishing your series of Raven son maybe you can give us a little a little tidbit of how that experience is then and then we can jump into the question of vaccines and fairytales well it's been a really rollercoaster for me I mean not only because of all the you know emotional fallout as a result of coronavirus and everything now we're pretty isolated where we are upstate New York so it's not touching us too much but still you know there's always the the attraction of social media and things that tend to worry you but it's not just that it's also finishing a book series that I've been writing for thirteen years and on and off and it turns out that's a much more emotional and almost traumatic experience that I expected because these characters have become such a part of me and of course they come out of who I am and every single one of them is carrying some tiny aspect of my personality yeah as I was and I had to kill a few of them off and you know I yeah there was one that I killed off the next morning I was like I can't work today I'm good morning good morning for my character that's awesome it's true but yeah it's been a great it's been a great experience and it's just the beginning I'm now really in a good rhythm and I anticipate at least two or three more books coming out this year so that's awesome yeah I've been excited to see you how productive you been despite the coronavirus and so and I'm really happy to see you kind of joining our team on the symbolic world because I love your work and I love your thought process you know even from the first articles you wrote on the Orthodox art journal I like okay there's I have a good spirit in this person so the article you wrote for us is called why fairy tales might be better than a vaccine which was quite provocative so maybe you can kind of lay out the thesis word people could obviously check it out and read it but we can lay it out and we could talk about the tenets of your article well actually it's interesting that it all it's funny how I don't know if coronavirus is making us more cognizant of weird connections happening to out our lives in different ways but I've been preparing a podcast for for ancient faith media and it's basically I'll be retelling it's called in a certain Kingdom and I'll be retelling Slovak tails with a little bit of analysis attached at the end of each reading so it's you know it's kind of performed and things like this but my favorite part of it is gonna be the analysis of course with fairy tales you have to be careful not to analyze them to death because you can make him into a loo detected corpse and that's no longer a fairy tale yeah but this first article for the symbolic world actually came directly from the analysis of the first story that I'll that I'll be telling which it'll be made available very soon and those of you who have followed me at all will know that I have a slight love affair with Russian philosopher of the late 19th early 20th century named Yvonne ilium who is a bit of a controversial figure in some circles there's a effectively a hit piece out there written by a historian for the New York Review of Books that people all the way from here to India have read and whenever they people who are really you know who consider themselves people of letters when they hear the word is words Yvonne eg in the name you wanna diem they automatically default to that to that article which talks about Yvonne alien being a fascist prototype for the Phu teenis takeover of Russian and the eastern whatever which is it's a hit piece basically the guy doesn't doesn't even he doesn't actually quote et in the single time he says alien said that and then there is no quote so it's very easy to misrepresent the kinds of things Edie and said medium did have a short flirtation with what fascism cuz he was in Germany in the pre pre-war period but a lot of the Russian emigre ended up in Germany and unfortunately there you know a lot of people we don't know remember remember this fact but a lot of people had a kind of fascist flirtation before they really saw what was going on yeah and it really did is really easy for us now to judge people at the time especially you can imagine a Russian emigrate who had to deal with a communist revolution who is now seeing an Tifa and communist parties taking two you know taking ground in Germany and they want to resist that and so they feel like the only solution is this new thing that's act it's kind of appearing on the horizon and so it's easy for us to judge them for make making those moves at that time when in fact a lot of the writers you know like Heidegger is a good example you know where people say Oh Heidegger Heidegger but you know as soon as you understood what was going on in terms of the madness you know he distanced himself from the party but it's it's it's too easy to judge people right at that time I really get annoyed when people do that and I feel like it's a common it's almost like a weird leftist pathology right to just accuse but we don't accuse you know chapo sack of being a communist member until his death basically and and Pablo Picasso to have been gone I've been gone to Russia and propped up the communist state you know while it was massacring people and sending people to gulag so yeah I just I have no patience for that crap me neither and I get I get very angry emotions but what the point is that you you can only really judge a man by it by his own work output and if you read the stuff that he's written on culture especially it's really incredible he has a little booklet that I've translated and actually it's available for anybody who wants to once the buy it is called the foundations of Christian culture and it's one of the most unique things that I've ever read because he talks about he talks about one of the main responsibilities of a Christian being not simply maintaining an existing culture which seems to which seems to be the default position for about a millennium or honest but he says that no especially in this moment and he's writing in the middle of the 20th century as though as the world wars are going on he says it's time to create a new and it doesn't mean doesn't mean get rid of everything and start from scratch it means look take what take what you have good and bad transform it take what you have now take what you have in the past take what you expect to happen in the future combine it with a an active and kind of he calls it a a spirit inspired view of the world like he was he was very he Galen and people kind of believed in the indwelling of the Spirit being the the prime movement of the of the Creator and also immersing yourself in the worldview and in the narrative of the Scriptures and from that allowing yourself to be kind of moved towards a lifelong journey towards creating culture through your own specific medium whatever that might be and he even enumerates a whole bunch of he talks about economics talks about government he talks about visual arts talks about writing talks about all kinds of things so it's from that perspective that and from that similar kind of mindset that he that I found this other article he wrote it was actually speech given to a bunch of Russians in Berlin in the in the 30 so right before everything started to go crazy yeah where he talks about the spiritual meaning of fairy tales hmm the weirdest thing you could talk about in the mid-1930s I mean who's gonna be talking about fairy tales right right as the Great War is finished and another ones about is about to happen and it's obvious that things are not going well I mean the Great Depression is happening I mean who is gonna want to talk about fairy tales and yet here he see this is what he chooses to talk about and you talk specifically about Russian fairy tales to a specifically Russian audience but especially if you compare what he says with what Tolkien and other not folklorists I have an opinion but folklorist that I will not share here but people who actually write in the tradition of folklore they all agree that there is something about that way of telling stories that reaches very very deep into the historical past of a nation that reaches very deep into the spiritual base of a human being that can help reconstruct a proper relation to the world around you in a very realistic way as odd as that may sound because fairy tales are what there's they're invented funny little stories about talking animals I mean what could possibly be there that could help you form a worldview and yet that's exactly the argument that he makes which is fascinating argument I think well one of the things that the fairy tale does is that it it's using a grammar which seems very very ancient that is very very old and it's the very fact that you can take these stories seriously because some of the elements are so odd in the story you know and the fact that we are able to listen to them and to to think that via this is fine like that this is this is okay to listen to the story and to finish with a sense of satisfaction right it means that it's actually going very very deep in in our psyche and very deep in the patterns of being and it doesn't matter whether or not they are believable in a kind of literal istic stance or a kind of a historical sense it doesn't mean it doesn't matter you know they tend to tend to hone in on the best image ins within the narrative to make it happen um ya know and and it's it's built on structures of symbolism and these structures of symbolism they tend to persist throughout not even centuries but millennia I mean there's some interesting scholarship to suggest that some fairy tales that we tell now were first told 9,000 years ago yeah it's pretty it's pretty insane and you're and you're right and you touch on on something that I think what I would even go further I think that any sort of realism in a fairy tale makes it dead I think that it's it's precisely the lack of believability on some level as long as that lack of believability also plugs into those symbolic structures those commonly repeated images and ways of relating to the world that seem to appear in all cultures again and again things like we talked about those with father Andrew Stephen Dame akin the last Emmylou podcast that I did with him it's interesting scene in The Hobbit where Gandalf was talking about storytelling in the context of his little you know limited world and he mentions the the unexpected luck of widows sons and the rescue of princesses now neither of those things happens in the world of The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings so what is he talking about except if you know if you know your folklore those two elements are tropes in fairy tales they happen all the time yes always needs to be rescued and by the way there's a lot of reasons why she needs to be risky's and oftentimes it's not because of the princess so it's not a feminist or non feminist thing at all it has nothing to do with that well the unexpected luck of widow sons is also a very commonly repeated trope that it has to do with how you have to go deep into misfortune in order to find your fortune you have to be deprived of everything on the superficial level to be able to find that that sometimes mad sometimes dangerous wisdom that will lead you by impulse and by instinct as opposed to by rationality something it really we need to be paying attention to right now no exactly and it's it's definitely the Christian message even though people might be surprised to hear that is that all the symbolism of Christianity is about finding no light in darkness or finding life and death you know even the symbolism of the fish I always tried to remind people that the symbolism of the fish that's exactly what it is it's all about finding these sparkly things that are hidden in the in the depth of darkness you know it's about finding life in a dead in a dead world and so that is all that is really what Christian is about just the whole image of the crucifixion is is about that and how you know life comes after this this descent into into Hades and so or our whole aesthetic practice is a way to mimic if you will the unfortune the character this character that you talk about you know that the last son or the or the the widow's son or whatever the the loser never done no it's never the first time and so a lot of our aesthetic practice is there to kind of recreate that pattern within ourselves even even in a world that's fine you want to create for yourself that that opposition so that you see your passions but then you can also find something some precious nugget there and this is what what drives me what really mystifies me about the reaction to a lot of Christians unfortunately and I don't know if it's a lot but it seems to be a little based on based on what I'm coming across with especially on social media the reaction tool that a lot of Christians are having to the closure of churches and how how church closure is being supported and and defended by even people high up in the hierarchy as a necessary a step towards stemming the or what is it the flattening the curve in things like this well I'm thinking wait a minute whatever happened to recapitulating the darkness that is that is around Christ at the moment of his crucifixion so that we can then go down with him into Hades and come back up it's not really recreating its recapitulating which it's a word that natively all it uses a lot meaning actually re-enacting in our lives in a way that would then allow for the grace of God to fulfill the same thing that happened to Christ with us but this we're not even get being given the chance it's it's really it's really astounding to me how the necessity for maintaining superficial health is more important than leaning into as we always have throughout throughout history how many epidemics have we had Jonathan I mean hundreds and hundreds are just reading about saint st. philaret of Mosca who was the metropolitan of moscow the head of the russian church in the nineteenth century who had lived through six seven eight cholera epidemics people cholera is much worse than than cold in nineteen I'm sorry it's I mean if you want to die in the worst possible way I'm not gonna get into the details but just look it up all right he or he he never closed churches he opened hospitals he sent his monastics to go each of those hospitals to minister to those people he kept the churches open at all times he rang bells at odd moments during the day in the night to remind people of what is ultimately of the most importance and in the kind of superficial and pathetic and lacks lifestyle we live in the West right now this is the best kind of wake-up call that we could possibly have and here the doors are being shut in her faces as soon as we have the opportunity to go and recapitulate Christ's journey he is offering it to a saying go do it suffer with me hmm yeah and no and they're telling snow that's not good for you yeah and I think that that's really in your article that's that which you kind of suggest if it is very powerful is the idea that the communion we find in church and the communion we find in common story and in pertinent part dissipation in story is when you say it's better than a vaccine it means it's because what it does is it affords us the capacity to be human and to be there to help each other and to be a community which is which is the actual thing which will get us through this crisis and not artificial medication because them you know and the image that we saw like the image that we saw happening I said I don't know if it happened everybody like here in Quebec the scandal was the old people's homes like it was a scandal and so here we are all closed off on each other no church no community no nothing we're all shut down in our houses watching Netflix and the old people are abandoned in these old people home and they died of thirst because no one is caring for them they just died on these beds because they're being abandoned they just basically been abandoned and so it worse than that it's worse than that because in the state that I'm in in New York there was a scandal that started to be uncovered and then it was just shut down of the the governor was sending Kovac patients into rest homes specifically into into the population that is at the most at risk that the ones that are gonna die and so that now the numbers in the u.s. are clear it's long it's almost 50% of all the deaths attributed attributed to Cove it in the United States I've come from nursing homes yeah it's totally insane and so here we are all these young people sitting at home you know doing getting mad at everyone else for not following protocol all the protocol of which is designed whether purposely or not doesn't even matter to disconnect community in in a world that already has no community I mean how many people know they're pit they're their next-door neighbors hardly anybody yeah and this is I will tell you this is the one of the one of the most incredible things about living in a rural kind of isolated place right now in the middle of this is because the people around me for the most part are being very calm we talk to each other we don't talk to each other over across artificially imposed services of course we're being careful of course of course we're not trying to infect each other on purpose goodness goodness gracious it's not not everything that we have here has to be seen in black and white categories but except most fairytales are black and white categories but so and here so if there's any hope in all of this it's it seems to me like the the only way out is the is the rebirth of small communities in places that aren't beehives full of or ever ant hills full of you know unpeople going back and forth between their unworn and they're on home where they try to spend as much time as possible in front of their screen so they don't have any communication with their unwise and their unchilled Rijn you know did you get Nicholas tell us if your if your opinion on this sorry no I think it's good I think you're right and I think that I think that what I think that this idea of also one of the things that's lacking and maybe this can bring us to the next situation is that one of the things that is has been lacking and that is lacking is that the destruction of the common stories you know the the evacuation of the fairy tales and even not this evacuation but the subversion of a lot of the fairy tales oh yeah yeah with like the new kind of retellings the modern versions of them more and more we really do have this weird subversion of the fairy tale and and of course ultimately the the deconstruction of the common Christian story which has held the West together for you know since since the fall of Rome basically and is it isn't an interesting that those to happen hand in hand that the destruction of the Christian story cannot happen without a subversion of the traditional story tropes they all you know I'll tell you like most most traditional publishing houses that are that are publishing fairy tale based stuff which is usually fantasy in today's parlance yeah are very explicit that they don't want anything traditional and that they're looking for as many queer versions of of traditional storylines as many inversions of the of the men women roles yeah roles yeah and notice that notice the reason core movie that came out of Europe it's not Hansel and Gretel it's Gretel and Hansel so even on the level of the of the names of characters but it has to be the woman first now because there have to be reparations paid and of course I I'll be honest like occasionally I would like to read I do like to read a twist on something traditional especially if that twist somehow really means some basic aspect of reality that I know to be true but more often than not the twist is point hmm and because people because most of the people who are writing now actively in these genres that have traditionally spoken to the deepest held sort of the deepest longings of the human spirit that used to be old right and white men and now it's young Millennials all of whom as we have seen as we see no but I'll in in a lot of the political version that's going on they have they have swallowed up a deconstruction of reality as their worldview yeah that is their world their worldview is that everything is nothing or then that thing has to be twisted and that's it and they're and they haven't yet internalized for whatever reason the reality that there is actually no end to that it's the serpent that eats its tail yeah forever and there's no way of coming out of it just gonna keep spinning it spinning until you go insane yeah and your version is going to be eaten - yeah for whatever is left of the old of the old world then they're gonna come after you later because you know you can never completely deconstruct anyways because you know you you need the story it still needs to have a pattern went on likes very soon and I'm sure some people have already said that you know they'll say that the very pattern of a story you know that has a beginning and an end and an arc and a character arc is a form of supremacy it's a for emotion a form of power in position on on a viewer imposing a narrative on the person watching it and so just in that these types of things are you know like you said there's no you're you think that you've reached the bottom and then some other bigger monster comes up to come and eat up with isn't there like a series of memes where like there's one thing eating another thing eating another thing and just kind of you know ad infinitum but you know and this is something that all of us with no historical with no historical background or with no historical what's the word I'm looking for perspective who forgotten even though history of the last hundred years don't even realize I mean don't forget all of you who are you know really happy about the recent changes in that have to do with with the riots and everything don't forget that they come from extremely leftist position you know communist one and what happened to the Communists in Russia you know they came to power in immediately after the Revolution in 1918 all of them every single one of the main people who was involved in that in that pooch yeah we're all killed that's right 20 years later they were all killed as something by the way that's really beautifully shown in him in a Russian movie because we want to talk about stored storytelling versions of history not just not just you know beating people over the head with with facts but there's a Russian movie called burnt by the Sun that's that was directed by and you keep the musicals yeah I saw that that's an amazing movie so beautiful everybody has to watch that so powerful and it's powerful in that sense where that you see the general who who's you know they come for him now and it's his turn now and the scariest the scariest scene in that movie is when we see that the rising image of stallion yeah on the on a blimp or or is it's like a hot air balloon yeah it's coming up and it's the hot air balloon is is covered by the face of started and the main character who's this young young new communist has come to destroy the old communist he's smoking he's thinking is kind of conflicted about reality and he sees the image come up his face goes dead and he salutes to it yeah and that's it like that is that is the end game of any such political and cultural program it's complete depersonalization in front of that power that's going to arise out of the ashes napoleon did it by the way and we yeah we we tend to iodized Napoleon said to say oh what a cool character he was Napoleon was not a nice man at all and the things he did to Europe we're pretty bad I mean we don't read your history for people that's definitely one of the things that one of the problems is that there is something about the way that the story is told in North America which is that we only hear one version of the atrocities you know we hear the the atrocities of the fascists which of course we should because they were horrible and we should we should definitely know about them but we then ignore the other side you know we don't know about the atrocities that you know we don't hear about the red wave so much you know it's it's not taught and so it's very strange I have my theory one of the theories I think is because there's a sin like there's a sin in the fact that we won the world war two then right which is we didn't win world war two people say oh we won World War two know you did world war two we did we didn't win World War two we won World War two by associating ourselves with a murderous communist regime and now we have to we have to hide that in our consciousness we have to hide that and move on thinking that we won not knowing that we also we did win and of course we defeated the fascists which is great but in that new origin we gave half of Europe to a demonic you know murderous regime and we gave up all of our universities and all of the structures that raised our young people who are now all come up as basically neo-marxist and with who by the way don't who have also been taught how to tell good stories so this is part of the scariness of what's going on right now in the world around me is part of what's making me kind of know what on earth and how fasts happened what is happening it's because they know they know the storytelling structures they have the symbolism they have it we lost it like the Christians lost it because they were there too there were too busy arguing about the age of the earth and about dinosaurs and Abbas right things that that don't like matter in terms of your actual life they they started to see the Bible as just a bunch of facts that were aligned next to each other stop and saw narrative as almost something demonic yeah that's right like as if and you can't it's it's funny like I I'm all for conspiracy theories but one of the things that's interesting to watch is how conspiracy types they hate symbolism yeah hate symbolism so much that every time they see a pattern they immediately have to attribute it to a demonic force that's right says it if there's a pattern it must be someone who is manipulating and there's no and not saying there isn't like of course are people manipulating you know politics from all sides but and and you can you can really see the end of that problem which is that they hate narrative because they see it as evil in itself so how do you get so what happens is you've given up narrative to your enemy and now they're taking it up there love it oh then they are there feeding some really really impressive stories I mean how can you pop can you argue against this black lives matter narrative now I'm not speaking politically about this I'm just talking about the way that they tell stories okay you can't argue you cannot argue with what they are saying because the best you can do is come up with some sort of facts that count to their facts but it's not about facts it's about the emotion that has come about as a result of this story being told in this specific way and the story that they're telling is a good one even if it's not true and whether it's true now is almost be it beside the point because it's the net the width and the nature of their the way it's spoken and the entire lack of narrative and worldview on the other side and didn't the complete obliviousness to the fact that no no no wait a minute this is a clash not of politics this is not a clash of ideologies it's a clash of worldviews it's a clash of symbolism it's a clash of story yeah and if you start seeing it on that level only then can you start personal having the conversation and second of all being able to internalize and to decide for yourself what is the actual way of relating to us in a way that would give your own life meaning because people are just being erased in this you know their own their own personality their own stories are just being erased in this massive monolith that is this incredibly well told story yeah but it's also a very simple story of a good good guy bad guy narrative and you know and so it's very convincing because those stories are very powerful you know when you have an evil other even if for some even if it's weird because the evil other especially in the in the BLM narrative is that because most people were I mean most people in America are so white like with it it's like I think it's it's like twenty thirty percent African Americans and so most people have now taken on a bad-guy narrative in which they play the bad guy role completely and so I don't know like how you how do you get out of that like do you just self destroy like you just that's the straw that's well ha have you seen it you've seen the flagellants I saw the flagellants well the flagellants and the people who are doing digital blackface as a as an act not simple not simply of repentance but as an act of identity oxd like I wish I had another identity I wish I was not who I am and there and that is just I mean all kinds of lights are going on in my head because as soon as you separate identity from the rillette the grounded reality of who you are where you are in in terms of you know your your family your history and your place and your nation then which has been happening for a long time now but and when when it's when it's then suddenly given this fever-pitch by all of the things that are happening I mean David Brooks recently wrote a piece in The New York Times where he said that America is going through five crises at the same time yeah that's that's about right and it's just bringing to the floor all of the madness that has been going on inside people and it's also showing how there most people have no world you there's this incredible video I think or a photo I'm not sure I haven't seen it somebody told me about it of somebody in in a in an American grocery store and he walks in and he does this grocery store doesn't have all of the directions you know but which way to go you know yeah which aisle in what direction right and he stops he walks in and he is petrified he doesn't know what to do he has no idea where to go he has no idea who to be yeah because he has no identity as it comes out that and he hasn't had an identity at all and as soon as the external strictures that have been imposed which are so comforting you know because this will control everything for us but as soon as those things are moved in for a second massive confusion massive just fear and this is why more and more than anything right now you need story more than anything else because that story is the only thing that can start building you up piece by little piece which has made the main point of my of my article yeah yeah and the thing is yeah I was gonna say that there's an interesting other video that came up which is kind of the counterpoint to that one which is the Karen video like that there's a lady at the aisle who because they asked her to wear a mass he starts throwing all this stuff out of her cart onto the floor just like tossing her stuff out of the floor and I'm like man we're losing it like seriously people this is not this is not going well you know just not going well on all sides oh mercy so yeah so we need we need good stories that's for sure so all of you people are watching this don't just analyze symbolism write good stories we need we need better stories well read them first because if you go and start writing it right now the likelihood is that you'll probably write some sort of some twisted version of something that isn't it doesn't have the depth because you probably haven't been formed enough because we haven't been reading enough and because we have been reading the right kinds of things so that's partially what I want to do is that we set a new podcast I'm doing for ancient faith is is you know give people exposure to the way people told stories not only by by retelling the stories that have been told for thousands of years but also telling it through a modern voice my own because I'm retranslate and translating them from from Russian to English but I'm also you know adding my own thing I'm from performing it for audio and so we have we have to internalize you know the stories that have been given to us and if we have never had stories that have been given to us then we need to find a tradition that we like and build it up because I think we've talked about this before but it's very difficult to to really internalize the truth of Scripture if you don't already have a substratum into an internal substratum of those categories and those realities that are put in place by good stories mm-hmm most people that you know why did they what did the bar was the gospel spoken at the moment that it was it's it was the absolute fever pitch moment of the culture of a culture of extremely firm fervid storytelling being spread over the maximum amount of space at any given moment it was the absolute perfect time to do it because everybody spoke the same stories everybody knew them and everybody everybody spoke us in the language and everybody would understand those categories when they were spoken about now and speaking from an American context there was a there was an article that I shared about how black slaves in America created their own storytelling narratives by taking stories from the scriptures and from their own pagan past and kind of reimagining their life and adding constellation and hope and the possibility of reclamation through the through that storytelling tradition and how that eventually became things like jazz and stuff like this you know it was an incredibly rich way of dealing with of a very horrifying reality and in the comments section of the post that I shared meaning on my Facebook page when I shared the post I there were people just crying out to me for the lack of their home culture having a storytelling tradition Americans don't really have a native fairy tale tradition and closest thing you might have is something like the tall tales of the Paul Bunyan tales or something like this but they're fairly recent they're very culturally specific and they don't really have that same kind of depth as I don't think that while the west stories are have that they do a little bit they do but it depends on which one's you know and and it's and those are very difficult to to take up right now because of all the political issues involved and it's and they come from a close enough historical time period that it's not as safe as taking some of these you know ancient Russian fairy tales that were then we're told from the tenth century where you have you know the mythical King and the mythical hero and the mythical princess who elf of course all came from real historical realities but there's enough distance from it and there was enough storytelling tradition happening over centuries that gave it the kind of Sheen of yeah eternality and because I wonder like I wonder about if you look at the epic John like the epic genre in Greece and even though even in Persia or earlier than that in the Babylonian times or whatever there really was a capacity to create complexity in the character so right even when you read The Iliad you know even though the story is being told from the side of the Greeks it's not clear who's the who exactly is right in this conflict right there is a sense in which know that when Prime meets with Achilles it's a beautiful scene where you feel such sympathy for Priam you know and then even almost more than you do with the kilise who's supposed to be one of the heroes of the battle and so I think that within the epic let's say the epic genre there could be a way to tell Wild West stories where you know the native people aren't represented as savages and that also the the colonizers have it there's an ambiguity to their action on both sides and there's a meeting of two worlds you know that is not gonna it's not going to go well some places it's gonna go well there could be ways to tell complex and powerful stories that wouldn't be just one-sided but could even if you'll you know because if you look at the The Iliad for example the Romans ended up taking the side of the of the Trojans and they saw themselves as being descendants of the Trojans that so you can see how there really is a possibility to fit within a story told by Greeks that someone else takes the side of the of the Trojans and then it becomes a discussion between two civilizations then you have to have the capacity of holding more than one ID in your head at a time to be able to do that and I'm increasingly seeing the inability to admit to the to the possibility of there being any complexity to any argument the what would one of the things that has happened as a result of Facebook and as a result of this particular brand of social media as it's come down to us is that it by its very nature by the way that it's been created by the way that is structured it's intended to remove new ones hmm it's supposed to give you that immediate hit of dopamine from yeah you know from getting a like or from getting a great weight is the best right of course and in with nobody talks it some people do but what we sometimes forget about is that the these systems were designed with that in mind like they were designed to do that to us on purpose because that that's the easiest way of distilling the the absolute most basic needs and ones that we have for the purposes of advertising to those basic needs and wants mm I mean there's some really interesting books that have been that have made their way out recently about the you know the the addictive nature of of social media and how it seems to be it seems especially when you have these these crises it's starting to it seems to be eroding our ability even intelligent people's ability people who have you know who have education people that I know are able took to have a complex conversation about ideas they don't agree with something about the nature of this particular event at this particular moment in that particular medium is almost making it impossible to have any sort of conversation in which complexity is allowed to exist and you know the the idea with with the Wild West stories is a really good one but you need to have a community of creators and consumers of that creation who are willing to exist in that state of suspended complex storytelling and not judge it and that's actually why storytelling is so important but you do have to break through a wall to get past the rational self and that that initial movement from oh no I'm not gonna listen to your story because it's offensive and because you're a white manatee cuz you're telling me things that should that you have no right to tell me getting from that point to oh my gosh that's a really great story I don't care about the color of the skin of the protagonists there used to be a much smaller wall there right now it's massive so there's a lot more there's a lot more impetus on the storyteller to be able to draw people into that that kind of nebulous nethersphere between between your rational thought in your heart where stories have the most power and that's actually something that alien talks about in this article that and that I you know that I referenced repeatedly in my or in in a symbolic world post that I did in that he believes that the stories are and I mean it's interesting that he talked about fairy tales like I mentioned already during a time of intense ideological divide mm-hmm fascist versus communist this is this is like the worst right yeah what we're recapitulating right now and yet at that moment is like no no stories stories stories why because if you allow yourself to get into that that almost somnolent rhythm of the storytelling structures by the way all stories start with a nonsense statement was some sort of absurdity that shocks you out of the reality that you live in some sort of bizarre concatenation of circumstances sometimes it's one of the famous pre stories and Russia is there was this mosaic yeah this is you know peasant man there was another present man they came at each other they started punching each other until they were both bloody and then there was a bull and somebody stuck a it's like a sort of a knife into it and gold came out of it and in a certain Kingdom in a certain story so it's like I really what on earth but disaster you've been shocked that of the reality out of your everyday reality and suddenly you're like oh we're in that part of okay I can I can deal with this so yeah yeah and I think that that it's been also one of the functions maybe of that those types of stories because they're using categories which are not charged a lot of these stories then they they're able to reach everybody you know they they don't and and the danger that we've seen for example you know we saw some recent articles I don't know if you saw if people were writing me in private about this and asked me what do you think of this what do you think this how people were trying to say how in token the orcs were were racist right because the orcs were supposed to represent black people and I thought I mean I was like guys you this is a dangerous this is a dangerous road to go down the people who are accusing these stories of doing that because is that really what you want like because it's not that in the story but if is if that's what you want then that can go both sides if that can go you can go either way it's not a good place to go in your discussion look Fahrenheit Fahrenheit 451 has it right there are no books left all books must be burned it doesn't matter what they are doesn't matter what they're good or bad or well told or badly told if you're fascists or communists all books must be destroyed alright that's that's where it's gonna go if you go that way and I'm not even talking about the idiocy of that of that argument about works being black or may come on give me a break but of course this only shows how if you've lost your connection to your nations or your people storytelling traditions then you've lost your perspective on everything and you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna be able to be manipulated by anybody who has the best story or the loudest voice in that room and you need to be able to understand like it's so interesting one of the so one of the things if you've noticed the one al I've been emphasizing a lot the idea of the margin like I talked about that a lot because one of the things in a way that I want to help I feel like that's the that's the band a that needs to be put on right is that on the one hand you have people who are wanting to kind of move inside and cut off the the margin you know like that the conservative types you would say and then you all have people who live pretty much exclusively in the margin and who want the margin to basically take over the whole system right oh I'm like we know we need to put a band-aid there we need to be able to help people understand the function of marginality its role in in the giant pattern show some examples of it and then help conservative types understand also that like it's it it plays a role in the in your story too you need that's you need that stuff there as well and completely get rid of it you know it's interesting you mentioning the margin in that context really makes me think about something that's been going on one of the arguments that the traditional that some traditional Orthodox had been giving in in support of the closure of churches has been well the Hermits who lived out in the desert still had access to God's grace or are you saying that God was not able to come to them out out there and like okay what you've just done is you've taken the existence on the margin and you're trying to make it into the stage Center that's correct you've you've taken it out of its proper context because what they're doing out there is battling demons for God's sake that's their point there they're winning for they're winning the war for the entire cosmos out there as soon as you bring that in here you're bringing the MARTA chaos together wit with all of that back to the center the different markers in holy the difference between you and the Hermit is that the Hermit is out there fasting and fighting demons and you're watching Netflix and the demons are pouring in like come on let's go I just I it's like you have no idea what you're even saying you have no and especially when it comes to the argument about not having communion like all those those permits they didn't have communion like wait no they did they did did you in have you how many have you not read all those stories about angels coming to them with communion there's a lot of them those are not occasional stories they happen all the time and when those things don't happen it's st. Mary of Egypt you know who's able to do these incredible things and the one time she protects it it's like the apotheosis of that's right yes she takes communion one time and she's basically in heaven right there because she can't live anymore let's say our whole life has been moving up to that yeah do you live that way do you prepare for community no you don't yeah that's like you could say okay so if you agree that you want it all the churches to be closed and then that's not having communion and how about this you fast until you have communion how about that that's right told it eats three loaves in 47 years go oh mercy yeah yeah yeah it's crazy times it's crazy times all right so so so before we all lose our mind here let tell us tell us tell us before we go I want you to give us a bit of a sense of I mean obviously I don't want you to spoil anything but I want you to give us a sense of how you're closing up your your Raven son series um you know and and give us also a place where people can find your books and find your writings and obviously that book by alien that I'll put that even in the description you want to get the translation that you that you did yeah absolutely well okay so the the book is the series this series of books was started out with me kind of describing his story form my own spiritual journey so the first book first books are kind of they're extremely symbolic but the more the closer they got to the end the more I saw them as a kind of an Old Testament to another revelation a storytelling time revelation kind of an altar a story a kind of fairy tale version of the Old Testament if we if we take Tolkien's idea of the Evangelion of the incarnation as being the encapsulation of all stories which he talks about in his famous essay on fairy stories so this is this is kind of my addition to the genre in which Lord of the Rings exists in which this Lillian exists in which some other stories exist there it's loosely pre incarnational they're not they're not peddling any sort of religious idea it's more about the the universal longing of humanity for something beyond themselves in a state and in a situation where they can't get that in any easy way so meaning there hasn't been any incarnation there isn't an easy access to to divine grace in any sort of meaningful fashion or if it happens in kind of odd explosions of encounter that you can't really explain or only if you willingly embody a path of most resistance sometimes leading into death so this one is all about death it's all it's about the land of the death dead it's about what it means to and what it means to go through death to come to a better life and yeah it's it's it's like nothing I've done before and it's probably gonna really polarize people I think it's gonna it's gonna be one of those books that you either love or hate okay I'd much prefer we're not writing those kinds of stories anyway so so when is it coming out is it is it out already no no it's available for pre-order the the e-book is available for pre-order on Amazon by the but it's gonna be officially available on July 7th and at that point it'll hopefully be available in paperback as well but at the very least it will be available on all retailers in eBook format yeah and you can find more about that on my website Nicholas Cote are calm and the the alien book foundations of Christian culture just look look at a look for it on Amazon foundations of Christian culture by Yvonne eleum or put in my name sometimes it shows up because I'm the translator and yeah it's it's a very very good book it's one of these easy reads it's not very long but you could read it slowly for days on end trying to understand everything that he's getting it hmm it's more important than ever and perhaps not surprisingly a lot of people are buying it right now it's alright and I'm also looking forward to seeing your future contributions to our symbolical blog and I was
