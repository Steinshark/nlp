stronger uh there's no 
point to do anything anymore making over all jobs why do I even bother but she can watch TV all day 
where's my remote control all right now that we've had that very dramatic 
intro actually honestly it might feel dramatic   watching this video but I think a lot of people 
are feeling this way still every day it seems   like a new technology or new AI tool is coming 
out that can replace whether it be coders UI   ux designers product managers SEO individuals 
whatever the case may be and I understand why   people get nervous or get scared Wendy especially 
when you are investing a lot of time and energy   into learning something new or growing your 
career it can feel very overwhelming as to is   it even worth it is this the right way to go I've 
seen so many comments on my videos recently around   what should I learn should I learn data science 
or should I learn web development what is going   to become extinct faster and it really blows my 
mind I mean on one hand I understand where you   are coming from you are worried you want to learn 
a skill that is going to be in demand and that is   something we speak about a lot on this channel 
so I get it on the other hand though it's one   of those things I really try and hone in on that 
learn whatever you are passionate about you will   find a way to evolve and grow you're looking at 
it from the wrong perspective you're looking at   a perspective of survival where in reality you 
will survive and you will thrive in your career   by focusing on what you are truly passionate about 
and interested in that aside though here are some   tips that I'm going to be sharing with you today 
to really ensure you can kind of get the best of   both worlds on one hand that your career will be 
in demand the skills that you have developed will   be in demand and on the other hand though you can 
flip the switch and really utilize Ai and these   tools to help you outperform all your colleagues 
or whatever the case may be well let's get into   it I need coffee we always need coffee oh when 
you really look ahead think even five ten years   from now starting to look ahead and think about 
how can you stay in demand and I'm not talking   necessarily a technical skill or even a soft skill 
let's leave skills to the side for a second here   what makes companies hire people well at the end 
of the day it's the classic slogan we always hear   which is people hire people one more time people 
hire people okay I know you're probably thinking   if now people hire AI but at the end of the day 
we still need people and nothing is more important   the reality is oftentimes not seeing all the time 
but oftentimes skills aside is having that human   connection when people really enjoy speaking 
with you throughout the interview and can see   you're really collaborative and want to be part 
of their team and just an all-around good human   whatever that means to them they oftentimes 
hire that over someone who has these crazy   skills obviously skills are very important but 
putting that to the side and I'm sharing this   with you these thoughts with you because at 
the end of the day you really need to take a   step back we're on this Rat Race it feels like 
of what skill is most in demand or what should   I learn the fastest or what is going to keep 
me employed take a step back and just eliminate   all skills for a second what do people look for 
really good people so I think I'm really honing   in on this and kind of repeating myself a bit 
because at the end of the day networking is so   key bill building that community and support 
system now I know a lot of you or some of you   are saying tip I hate networking you know why I 
know that because I hate networking too but it is   so key oftentimes when you are looking at jobs 
you've had in the past or future jobs it is so   much simpler to gain those jobs when you have that 
Network and this is something whether you like it   or not that will continue probably be even more 
important as the AI and future of tech continues   to evolve having those connections with people 
because at the end of the day they are the ones   making the decisions of who they want to hire 
and if you have those Ins at certain companies   or are networking and really investing your time 
into networking you will see it pay off now that   being said sometimes networking all the time in my 
opinion just is not that fun so here are some AI   tools that can help you especially when it comes 
to writing because a lot of times for me writing   uh emails or just getting those conversations 
started is where I have that big writer's block   to even initiate a call so here you go for me 
and Jackie Wilson behind me first thing around   networking as I mentioned with emails is it's 
so difficult to even just send that email I get   writer's block so I want to share with you Ellie 
I've been using Ali on my other computer actually   for a while now because it really helps me I find 
when I want to send someone an email but I have no   no idea how do and this isn't sponsored by any 
of these tools by the way I just am obsessed with   using tools to help me out so you can see here I'm 
on their website it's called try ellie.com and I'm   just on their demo page so let's do something 
like this hi Ellie how are you how good are   you at replying to emails thanks James let's 
just Tiff ask Ali I was thinking it takes time   see look how accurate this is though hey Tiff 
I'm pretty good if I do say so myself I'm here   to help you with any emails you need what's up 
it sounds like a human like a human wrote this   which is pretty wild so with Ali let me go back to 
their home page here uh and you do have to you can   install it and use it for free but then also too 
depending on how many emails you want to use with   it you do have to purchase a license but you can 
install and start using it for free um but what I   really like about it too is it does have different 
ways to be responding so respectful casual annoyed   interested and it really helps me even if I modify 
the response at least get a response out there get   something on paper or even if I'm reaching out to 
someone get something on paper so whether you use   Ellie or a different AI tool to help you write 
emails it's a really great way to unblock that   friction for sending that first email to someone 
alright the other one I want to share with you   around networking is and really just finding time 
to connect with others is this personal assistant   so it's called Lindy and I've used Lindy for 
a few different tasks it's still embedded   better better right yeah comment down below I'm 
having I told you I'm still on my first coffee   um it's still in beta uh format so at the end of 
the day though because I've heard people say both   so I need to clarify that I've heard people 
in tech industry say beta and beta maybe it's   like GIF or GIF it's one of those things um but 
yeah so it's really helpful for certain tasks I   don't find Lindy to help me to the point where 
it's actually a personal assistant per se but I   do find it helpful the more you use this tool the 
more it gets to know your habits and your requests   your calendar and you can really use it to help 
you do the small things such as scheduling invites   let me know when my next meeting will be let's 
scroll down a bit here so one thing that I use   it for is scheduling so handles it back and forth 
to find common availabilities so kind of like an   email writer as well with that also too this is 
really really cool around pre-draft to your email   so you can actually wake up with responses to some 
of your emails I mean that's a dream to me wake up   and this AI has already responded in draft form to 
the emails I mean that's going to save you so much   time you can and also to morning anxiety waking 
up knowing that these emails have drafts already   written out is huge for me anyways I'll link all 
these tools down below by the way all right let's   dive into or address the elephant in the room 
which is great tip we've done our networking   where you know meeting the right people at 
the end of the day you still want to learn   new skills fast and as Tech continues to evolve 
you will need to learn Tech at a faster Pace or   these skills at a faster Pace the good news is if 
you are embracing Ai and using tools to help you   learn faster it won't be a problem but if you are 
one of those people who are really hesitant to use   it or really think negatively about incorporating 
some AI tools into your workflow I'm not sure how   you will be able to keep up with technology and 
keep up with building new skills and the reality   is the people who are using these tools these 
AI tools to help them learn or work faster and   be more productive freeze up their mind to focus 
on bigger tasks bigger problems are more complex   problems and in turn they will be the thought the 
the thought leaders the thinkers ahead thinkers   ahead oh Tiff you're not thinking is a problem 
here no I I'm still on my first cup of coffee   they will be the thought leaders of the next of 
2030 of 2040 because they are using these tools   to help with the smaller tasks so they can focus 
on the larger tasks think about the big picture   so there are so many different AI tools that 
you can utilize today whether you are a coder   whether you are a UI ux designer okay you know 
what let's dive into some of them all right   this tool is going to be a game changer and I 
know what you're thinking if this is going to   take out front-end developers no it's not 
what it will do is once again these these   designs that will turn into react code at the 
end of the day it's not perfect it still needs   to be implemented but it is a really wild thing 
to think about the direction this is going so   this is called bit Frost and it's still uh in 
Alpha Testing right now but what it will do is   turn your figma designs into to clean react 
code so let's watch a little video here hi I said there we go let's save and you 
will see that component one to one   it's wild this is really interesting as to when 
you think about the future not only for coders but   also to designers and how these roles will closely 
merge and that's what I'm getting at throughout   all this video hopefully to you is you need to 
start somewhere you need to have that knowledge   so don't worry about what skills are going to be 
don't focus on your learnings on what's going to   be in demand in five years from now or 10 years 
from now focus on what you're interested in   because with that Foundation you will naturally 
evolve with these tools as long as you're open   to using them this is a really cool one all right 
one other one I wanted to share with you I mean   there are tons out there so I'm trying to share 
different ones with you is build with AI club   now this is not a free tool let's start off by 
saying that but what it does do is it's a course   that will teach you how to build no code or low 
code apps with AI so this is really interesting   to me so if you go to courses here you can see 
say course Basics so you will learn to build an AI   web app so with a simple one-page AI web app with 
zapier and openai by building an AI dream decoder   so it's really interesting thing to think about 
this new level this new wave of technologists   that are coming out that are using Ai and low and 
no code tools to build really quickly and I think   we will see more of that progressing uh this merge 
of so many different roles coming together so this   is another interesting tool or of course I guess 
I should say that you can utilize to really take   your skills to the next level just because you 
do one thing today you're in one world today as   Tech advances it definitely means doesn't mean 
you will be doing that in two or three years you   need to be open to evolving and growing in your 
career and skill set all right we made it to the   end I hope you enjoyed not only hearing some 
thoughts around how the future of AI or future   of tech will affect your skill sets and where 
to put your attention if you take anything away   from this video I hope it's two things the first 
being put your attention to what you are actually   passionate about take AI away because that will 
find its way into every role and every career   it's not just related to what you're interested in 
maybe you think that though because you just heard   about a new tool coming out that's going to take 
over data scientists or take over web developers   well tomorrow there will be another tool that 
takes over lawyers there's tools coming out   every day focus on your passion the second thing 
I hope you take away from this video is to utilize   AI to embrace it question it yes we all are aware 
of that but use these tools to your advantage to   help you learn quicker help you learn smarter 
and also to work smarter in the sense of give   it these little simple tasks so you can continue 
to be a thought leader I hope you enjoyed this   video leave down below any thoughts you have 
around this video questions I do my best to   answer every single one also too let me know what 
else you want to see what other Tech coding career   related videos would you find helpful alright
