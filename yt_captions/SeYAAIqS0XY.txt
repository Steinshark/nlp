this is from dhh right here finding the last editor no flip cut it out do not put it in don't put it in some programmers can code under any conditions including textmate open Office yes they'll bring in headphones whatever editor is on their system they'll make it work using a different framework or language every few years no problem I envy that level of Versatility but I have come to accept it just isn't me I bond with a quiet room an editor and a program in environment far more deeply than that I I'm going to steal that line it's so be it makes it sound so cool to be programming it's like movie programming instead of like me yelling about that this didn't work and the tests are failing again yes that that's pretty much me me wondering why it takes 12 seconds to run a file just like what the hell's going on here yeah like my wife are you okay down there are you okay it was it was just JavaScript again okay I got I got JavaScript it all right case in point and I've been using textmate this is still the craziest part of this entire article I don't know what the hell happened here how how the emery that's the emergeny anoun just get this get this man something because this is what programming editor since I was first created or since it was first created back in 2004 what did he use before that that's 20 years now almost as long as my time with Ruby working on Rails textmate has been its or has seen its popularity come and go in that time and today few people are still choosing it but I don't care it's damn near finished software as far as I'm concerned and I love programming with textmate I like it it's a good take I like is more people could probably just use the have the confidence to just like keep doing something they're good at instead of being scared and like switching everything every week are you uh are you uh thrown shade right right now teach well was just I was just trying to give advice I wasn't trying to be a burn are you um you trying to are you are you trying to say would you look at me instead of looking over to the no no look at me don't turn your back on me yeah why you say to my face TJ well see now that I'm streaming more and not finishing any projects I'm not going to say like you need to finish your projects but maybe like staying with the same Technologies could be useful but I did I did do python this week that's the text made of programming languages okay it's actually not true at all all right it's all the little things like the algorithm for escape completion of words within the current document the macro recording and replay mechanism that I have used to set up the small handful of automations I use on a daily basis like command return to turn the method into def method new line cursor new new line but wait that's that's the wrong new line that's the wrong new line end or do tab to do cursor new line tab cursor new line end I like you know by the way these little things right here that he's talking about super super duper useful I actually use them quite a bit in fact I have one right here if I do like some sort of go file and I go lader e it just gives me if Air does not equal nil return nil or return err so it's like I I get I'm preceeded I'm ready to go I like it I like that I like that move you know it is good you stay in the zone I think yeah uh it's the superb column mode oh and it's the all Hollows Eve color theme the Perfection with uh which it renders bitstream ver Vera Sans Mano okay so this man really does appreciate the little thing I don't know what all hollow's Eve color SCH is is it Halloween themed that's I mean that's what I'm thinking which is like did just I I'm trying to imagine that it's not just orange what if it was only Orange it's just the only shades of orange I mean apparently it may look like this uh here let's let's throw in the word textmate okay that's all hollow's Eve it's not as orange as I thought it was going to be but it's pretty Orange it's I I can't even think of a word that rhymes specifically there a there is a lot of orange in that one uh probably more orange than I'm comfortable with spooky yeah no uh it's not much because I'm looking I'm sorry go on TJ's scaring away all the javascripts or you with like Ruby he's like I gotta keep my ID spooky we don't want the JavaScript to start creeping in and lo and behold he can't even help it it just keeps coming in it's not much because I'm not looking for an IDE I want to write my code in plain text editor and let that constraint force me to design programs and Frameworks that require nothing more I was actually going to mention this earlier which is something that I I I'm very happy he did which is I wonder how that like not having autocomplete not having co-pilot not having effectively anything other than an editor not even I I don't even know if a textmate has a fuzzy finder I'm just curious if it changes like the shape of software in a dramatic way clearly it's changed his like I mean he's as he says in the next sentence right he's like he's super sensitive to any extra thing he adds to rails cuz he has to type literally all of it yeah I mean it I guess is it that surprising that Hotwire is like a slightly more beefy version than HDMX right yeah like I don't I don't think it is and it's all like about I mean that's why I think he loves Ruby right it's like Ruby you can just do like dot XYZ and it does like 95 things right you know what I mean like I feel like it's a very high level language yeah H it's amazing how sensitive you become to extraneous elements when you literally have to type all of them by hand it's surely one of the reasons I never got on with explicitly typed languages which basically required an IDE to flow oh I'm the only one that pre-read now sure sure yeah you just you just happened to predict that he was going to say that you just happened to predict it who me that's literally what you said at the beginning what that he doesn't like type languages because it needs an IDE and he his text mate did you already forget it's it was only like 30 seconds ago of course I I literally have I literally have the memory of a goldfish I don't even know what you're talking about but that sounds like something I would say who wrote this article where are we I cannot believe we're reading an article by Joe Biden um this is like because I mean it makes natural sense because the only reason I mean typescript has I guess the side reason is that you could execute something out of band to see if any of your types fail but if you get absolutely no Auto complete and the reality is production software no matter how much typescript you use there's still that 0.1% of request failing due to undefine not being a function or something like that like you just let it through the cracks you naturally will code more defensively is my assumption and thus your software is more resilient mhm I don't know just a guess yeah when I flatter myself I think of it like climbing free solo minus the imminent risk of death it's choosing for something to be harder because the con has value so I I know some people like hate dhh is running but I feel like this this shows that he's not taking himself too seriously right like you wouldn't include minus the imminent risk of death if you literally thought that you were as cool as someone climbing free solo right am am I crazy to think that no because my first thought once I got done reading this was except for the imminent thing of death and then his next sentence was my exact thought which is the whole like immediately dying part he's just he's he's um chat that was not a window sound that that wasn't um that was it was me sorry chat TJ can you turn your windows off please some are trying to stream okay it's off now I love that you're you turn off your windows the same way Donkey Kong does H them mongos I smashed I just smashed the computer completely so I'd long thought that textmate might well be that forever editor for me I've tried all of the major Alternatives but none of them has nailed the basics in the way textmate does for me most of the new stuff they bought or brought to the party was stuff I'd pay to forgo it's such an interesting thought process like maybe you know like I always say that learning a language is best done if you turn off your LSP you will learn significantly better by not having that option and just having to go the slow way having to go and look up every last thing things just stick in your head like same with co-pilot co-pilot largely robs you of the process of learning like a new language though like especially with a language like go it's it's so simple that you can kind of go oh yeah that's correct okay that's correct okay that's correct but I may not be able to write go effectively without yeah co-pilot because I'm just so used to it some of that might too be because you already know a lot of other languages maybe it's easy in go to like recognize the p that you already know yeah you know what I mean so I also would be interested to know like how that feels for someone new starting out like if they used cop would and go would they not get a bunch of the stuff that's happening but yes I I think I think so as well it's occasionally good to maybe turn off a few tools or do a few things different just to sort of like push your brain in a in a different way I like it but here's the problem textmate is tied to the mac and tying myself to the Mac seems like an increasingly bad idea Apple has turned into the kind of company that I just don't want to have to rely on that doesn't mean I can't use any of their products but I absolutely do not want to feel like I have to I want to have the independence where walking away is always an option and it just isn't as long as I'm committed to textmate that's like the funniest sentence in the world not because I disagree but like textmate is the thing that's holding him to Mac like I don't know in my mind it's just like I like literally anything like Google Docs like could you just use Google Docs instead like will that work just as good I don't that is it is funny because I know people that are tied to Mac like especially in the movie production world where they have to use some like Arcane version of Mac cuz this one piece of software that is used in all movie productions only run on this one thing and that's just how it works and that's the industry standard right this is just textmate like you could you can literally just start emx and call it a day right that's the part that that is like throwing me off like I get the sentiment and he's had some run-ins with Mac I guess with their like you know their products on Apple and all this other stuff but I'm just it's just like throwing me off like they just if you could put a word in at the end right and you're guessing the probability of the word and the last word of that paragraph is just textmate you're like that's low probably that's not the thing I'm guessing this this must be some sort of legendary item we just stumbled upon because then the probability is exceptionally low here yeah all right hold on one second I do have to say thank you hey noticed that there's been like some gifted subs and stuff like that hey thank you very much but I'm in the Pro we're in the process of reading something so hey I'll I'll get there oh my gosh what happened dhh is moving away from textmate okay this isn't crazy okay this the crazy part is that he's on textmate yeah all right all right anyways thus began the search for the last editor I do love this idea of finalizing part of your setup a setup that you don't have to touch anymore it's one of the reasons why I try to edit very rarely just in general my my Vim setup is that I just wanted to become more and more the same and even if there's things that bothers Bother Me Maybe I don't need to fix it like maybe I got to like just just having it always the same there is something good about that yeah agreed and just like you can fix it later like you can try for a little bit maybe you were wrong about it being annoying maybe you like changed your brain and then it's good like we were talking about using I don't actually know if you're on the control y for accepting completions train I am that made me switch from tab to contr n and p and instead of enter or whatever it was to uh control y so now I use that and then it's like at at first it feels really weird but then it's at least for me it starts feeling really natural and like it's nice that every key only has one thing that it can do and all this right and you're like oh it actually like works really well in my brain same thing you know I think a similar idea for what you like about Harpoon and what you like about t-u right is that like oh I always know that one does this particular thing right so like tab always puts in a tab or like does a TBL like thing right it doesn't sometimes expand a snippet and sometimes jump to the next thing and sometimes do a completion and sometimes accept the completion right like and so yeah sometimes you pick something and you like try it at first and it's confusing but it gets good after you try it for a while one that isn't tied to a specific platform or preferably even a specific company and that I trust will be around until I'm done programming vs code has become the obvious choice for most of the web world but the longer I spend working with it the more I realize that its heart is beating to become a full-fledged IDE and all I want is a text editor it's true it's fair not WR fair fair statement I don't think we're going in the same direction V code and I and frankly even with their latest Redemption Arc I'm not keen to tie my editor commitment to Microsoft now man after my own heart right here just absolutely love this you knew this you pre-read this TJ and you knew I was going to celebrate this one moment didn't you he's singing Our Song he's singing Our Song not only is he dunking on Apple he's then follow Microsoft's catching Strays as well this is beautiful who knows what kind of villainy they may once again descend into and if you hope to still be writing code for another 20 to 30 years oh if you hope to wait I missed something there who flip take that out who knows what kind of villain they may once again descent into if you hope to still be coding for another 20 to 30 years I feel like I'm still missing something in that sense but I I know what he's trying to say yeah the suggestion I've heard Al yeah yeah the suggestion I've heard a lot is Sublime they have clients on Mac OS windows and Linux I hear a lot of good things about it the spiritual successor to textmate you feel like that's true I think that's a that would be in my it'd be a pretty fair assessment I feel like especially like it is crossplatform in that way and in a lot of ways I do think people who liked textmate probably like Sublime and it's like still getting some new features and stuff and they are focused on like being fast and being a text editor so I think that's I i' say it's fair one thing I like about Sublime is that no matter how big the file it is it is by far the most Snappy editor when it comes to big files yes it is I don't know what it is long lines doesn't boother like neovim can't handle a long line you cross 10,000 characters in a single column like game o it's so jover it's it's j big time it's j yep uh but last time I gave it a shot it f felt like uncanny valley very similar to textmate but not quite and all the little differences added up to a shimmer I just couldn't shake that's why I'm thinking it might be better to try something radically different I like Shimmer I just couldn't shake I feel like I want to use that it's pretty fun to say a shimmer I just couldn't shake yeah I like it you know it's funny that dhh doesn't like adding even one iota extra to his code yet the man the man's Pros are very verbose in adjectives yeah I like it though yeah yep uh also uh I actually get this a lot if you use something that is extremely close to something else yeah it's almost worse than just simply doing something different because then you're constantly trying to make it into something you know like how to Communists can never agree what communism is right is I'm glad you know it's not a Prime Time video without communism mentioned at least once hey leave a comment below if you love communism like Prime okay leave a comment below this is ridiculous enter Vim it's part of the ultimate neck beard Duo of editors together with emac it's an editor with a history that traces back to the late 70s and it's iconically quirky the long running joke is that nobody knows how to even quit it when they first start the command is is Right quit bang but talk about standing the test of time the modern interpretation of Vim is called the neovim and it's got a cult following including people whose parents weren't even born when VI originally came about it's still VI it's still quit bang to quit it's still quirky but it's also fast modern and integrates with the latest editor Evolutions like language servers I actually spent a summer programming in Vim prior to learning Ruby and remarkably a good portion of those quirky commands have stuck in my brain partly because the magic of Vim is is its ubiquity even Linux system has some version of it installed so whatever or whenever I'm editing files on a remote system it's with VI mode by the way this is one of the greatest reasons it's it's the reason why I always knock against Helix is that Vim has such a ubiquitous set of shortcuts it's AV available like in every single editor that when you use it I mean even xcode has it and X Cod I mean sure their emulation is not that great but nonetheless they like still have it and one time I had to be an X code for like 3 months straight and so it's just like having the ability to edit no matter what editor you're in in decent Comfort is such like a huge it's just such a huge W it is yeah having like Vim mode in things is is very nice I was a little confused did you skip over the cult stuff like on purpose or you were just sort of worried about we didn't want to talk about the cult thing no ne's got a cult following from the previous paragraph I didn't know if you were just like quit skipping that because we didn't want to talk about it or no as as as one of the cult leaders um I I just I accepted that and it seems actually completely normal when I read that I was like yeah that seems about right I actually was like I love I we should put this we should get this on neovim doio this needs to be a new quote it should be it's a called called following whose parents were born after VI was created I do like well it's like you know oh man it was a video from a while ago but then they were saying everyone who uses Vim is of a certain generation and they like said it really like you know really implying something but I was like I and at the time I wasn't even 30 you know now I'm 30 I'm old you know I get it that's fine uh but Vim a certain generation and it oh it's yeah it's the stack Overflow article stack Overflow right here certain there we go the consensus among many vim and emac users creates a picture that many Tech users from a certain generation would be familiar with it is literally the most like condescending quote that has ever existed in Tech I mean in tech is is just one condescending quote after another and this one might be the worst one I've ever seen we need to get shirts that just says certain generation or so you know what I mean like we need we need some merch C certain generation merch I like it it's that certain generation feel I'm actually getting old enough that that might be a bit confusing you know like back kind of hurts sometimes they be like it doesn't really go with your blue hair all right so we will see I'm still of two minds on of whether I'm going to allow Apple's villainies separate separate me from my beloved textmate but I'm willing to experiment and entertain the option now let's go neim show me what you got let's go BR one thing that you got to appreciate about neovim is that its ability to uh highlight and highlight well with tree sitter uh if you ever wish to dip down in and use a little bit of Lua honestly the apis they're pretty dang good TJ thanks there's very few that I have any sort of problem with the rest fantastic you just don't like the ones with lines cuz it is confusing I won't lie to you one base versus zero base vers Lua vers Vim it's those are they're tough but that's okay otherwise I think they're good they're tough sometimes buffer sometimes buffer sometimes buff you know there's there's a couple that have some historical difficulties that have experienced there are no keys that are not buff all the keys are buff but there arey that's buffer or maybe they're all buffer maybe that's what I mean to say I think you're right they're all buffer not buff okay okay okay I will I will I will believe you TJ yeah make sure it happens to Neo when was the last time you core contributed to neovim TJ um I wrote the Vim 9 script to Lua compiler that was I like how you tried to dodge my question by saying something that sounds super impressive but not answering my question when was the last time that's what I saying that was it was last year like in 2023 and then if we merged several files in that were a result of the transpiler I don't remember the month though probably January or something like that probably it was pretty early in the year that's true it was really early I just remembered being early hey that's pretty cool though that's pretty cool hey when's the last time you contributed to neovim core I haven't see you flip it was nice KN flip zoom out flip Zoom way out flip this is a marker cut this part oh my goodness anyways no one really likes DJ anyways so I mean I think we could all agree to that one right everybody the name is I wrote falor again okay you can't use the word again cuz that somehow implies that I've actually done it and that's offensive oh man okay so hey final thoughts a final thoughts on on on Vim The dhh Arc and really all the things we've read Because what has dhh done in the last few months uh let's see from Cloud to his own self-hosting with hay yep dropping build with JavaScript yep uh dropping types and just literally raw dog and JavaScript I wonder if there's some js doc floating around in there or not uh because that's you know quite useful and then lastly now apparently upgrading from textmates to neovim well they also did uh they released their first like chat application thingy for their like once.com you know what I'm talking about where you just download it and then you run it which I thought was kind of cool as well I thought it was really neat that it was uh it was done at an exceptionally cheaper cost than slack and you get to own the data I think there's a huge I I think there is like an an I think he's leading this idea whether we realize it or not where people are tired of subscription services and services owning your data and the ability as a company to have your own data yes for chat I think it's a little complicated because apparently there's a million regulations about it but like I do still like this sort of concept or at least just the option I mean it would be cool to like run your own chat for like your friends or something even you know what I mean like it's not like on and like what iford goes down and you like lose all of your chats forever yeah like you don't own your chats when they're in Discord it'd be kind of cool to to be able to do so I don't know and then now and now the neovim thing I'm excit I'm I mean I'm hopeful that he doesn't hate it you know because then he's gonna write a really bad article so dhh like I said reach out we wna we want to help you and make sure it's good so you write a nice article about it next time it wouldn't be a bad article it'd be beautifully written dunking on neovim no that's what that's what I'm worried about we will read it either way on stre worri I'm worried I'll agree by the end you know like what if what if what if he changes my mind again and now I hate neovim what if you're using textmate by the end of his Arc I've actually I've actually started I've used textmate and I was wrong LSP useless types useless typing useful boom can't argue with that one the name I'm fulltime streaming on Twitch now on twitch.tv teore DV because I quit my job to trying this and hopefully Prime will do it too bye accurate
