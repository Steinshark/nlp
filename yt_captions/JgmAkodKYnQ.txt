Elon Musk sues open Ai and CEO Sam Altman over contract breach okay updated 22 minutes ago this is fresh this is fresh on the presses people Elon who musk by the way dude I our our news website's like what the hell happens on a News website they're just so hard to read are these designed to like just like fully adapt to the Boomer brain because I cannot read mainstream news websites I look all over the place feel confused all right key points Elon Musk is suing open or Microsoft backed open AI and C uh its CEO Sam Alman by the way suing Microsoft is a bold move okay you know Microsoft wants to get involved in the game okay so now they have a reason to get involved in the game I I I'm just saying being involved in a Microsoft lawsuit is an extremely bold move so let's see where this goes well he's not suing Microsoft true but he's suing open AI you let me get this straight Microsoft owns 49% of open AI am I correct on that what percentage of open AI does Microsoft own 49% okay so they own 49% so so you're telling me Microsoft has no no no dock in this fight you're just telling me that Microsoft has no reason to be a part of this you're telling me that they're like ah yeah that's not a problem you go Sue that little company it's not like we have a commanding stake in it or anything it's not like we're a plurality of what's going on so anyways don't Sue Microsoft uh among others alleging they abandoned the company's founding mission to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity uh broadly oo this is kind of a spicy this is a kind of what open AI in Microsoft not immediately available for comment really shocking the legal actions uh pits two of the world's most prominent Tech leaders oh my goodness it's moving there's so many ads against each other uh at a time of extraordinary hype over the future of AI okay okay Elon Musk is suing Microsoft backed open I Ai and its CEO Sam Altman among others alleging they abandoned the company's founding Mission okay we already read that that's literally the key point this is literally the key Point Let's Stay on Focus here in a lawsuit filed on Thursday with San Francisco Court musk's Lawyers said the tech billionaires billionaire was approached by in 2015 by Alman and open aai co-founder Greg Brockman and agreed to form a non-profit lab that would develop artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity I'm really happy that they that they scare quote it like real talk just like just so just so you know okay here's the thing about Ai and all of this is that generally this is what somebody kind of looks like during their career as a computer scientist right they they learn they get better and then they kind of start plateauing about what like what they're good at right can we all agree it's some sort of inverse tangent curve right you start slow you speed up and then you kind of slow down on what you're learning it's it's it's effectively that uh it's so some sort of inverse tangent curve but that's what it looks like my personal guess is that with AI and these large language models senior Engineers that are already on the uh on the late stage of their curve you know they're they're right here are now getting like a like a like almost like a linear boost where they can learn and do things faster in in areas in which they couldn't do before so the barrier to entry the effort to becoming like good at something or to the to be like useful in something has gone way down and so it's really easy but my guess is that Junior Engineers that are starting today that are using llms right here their learning curve looks like this I honestly think that if you are proficient and you know what you're doing the AIS are going to be really good if you don't know what you're doing I think that they're going to be really hard on you I know some people think this is an L take this is just this is just my personal take on it now obviously there's a difference between co-pilot and uh chat Chad GPT right um sorry I wanted to write that whole thing out and the reason why there's a difference right there is that co-pilot is kind of like a push model where this is a pull model and I think the push model is more destructive to learning than the poll model I think the poll model you kind of get a craft your sentences and you can read about it and you get opportunities to learn a little bit more whereas co-pilot you don't really get that opportunity you're just reviewing and so I think it does matter which which which of the versions you're using but I I do see this as like this Tech golf that's coming up right I think that there's going to be this Tech golf where it's going to be a bodal function that looks like this right this is the trout of sadness and low people there's going to be a huge am of people that are just llm dependent and they can't like they they're they're very hard for them they're very Junior and they kind of stay in this weird Junior place where their code looks like the average code that's on GitHub at the moment which means that the average GitHub code is going down Non-Stop and then there's going to be a group of people that are in this senior camp that are going to be these like senior plus pluses that are going to be really efficient at producing stuff because they're able to harness the power and that's my guess for the future highly replaceable difficult to replace and I think this population is going to be small and I think this population is going to be large that's how I feel about anyway so that's the benefit of humanity I don't think I think it benefits those that are highly skilled I think it just creates a larger Gulf between the two it was already this way yes it is already this way but the entry is hard work now it's like you have hard work plus you have people that are growing faster than ever before so like that's a real problem to this day open AI Incorporated website continues to profess that it Charter is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity in reality however open AI Incorporated has been transformed into a closed Source deao subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world Microsoft the lawsuit files you know what I don't often give uh I don't often give elon's elon's lawyer Elon a w but I I feel like this is a pretty W take hey I'm just saying I think this is a pretty W take right here dude that it has been transformed into a close source deao subsid C of the largest technology company in the world Microsoft that's a pretty good take because they do own 49% and if you think you know I know they say that they they have no direct influence over the board of directors you're telling me they don't have indirect influence right you're telling me that when you own 49% of a company that you can't be like right you're tell you you tell me you can't send a couple wink Winks oh hey oh hey hey there board member you know I was just going to call up SAA for a quick second oh yeah oh the weather the weather's doing really great oh yeah SAA sends his regards and is happy that you're taking the initiative yeah the weather's great okay bye it's like dude you're getting mob Shakedown if they have no direct influence you know for a fact you're getting a mob Shakedown ain't no way you're you're telling me you're dude I don't believe it for a second so stupid uh musk's lawyer said in the lawsuit that open ai's focus on maximizing profits for Microsoft breaks the agreement under its new board it is not just developing but it is actually refining and AGI to maximize profits for Microsoft rather than for the benefit of humanity okay so I I am I am going to be real here for a second I do have I don't like Microsoft so maybe I'm a bit biased here and that anything that's anti- Microsoft makes me really excited okay so I I I will be I will be real that I am more anti Microsoft so you know when I read this I'm like hell yeah that's probably correct that's probably right um every company is for-profit exactly I think this is a pretty good take I I I don't want to say that I love anything that's going on in the old Twitter sphere but this is a pretty good one right here I think that this is a probably a good move that open aai did fundamentally break their contract uh were not immediately available for common yeah uh musk's lawyers said the suit was submitted to compel open AI to adhere to the founding agreement and to return to its mission for develop AGI for the benefit of humanity not to personally benefit the individual defendants and the large largest company in the world the largest technology company in the world okay okay Microsoft which is facing scrutiny from EU antitrust Regulators over its reported 13 billion investment in open AI recently announced a new partnership with French startup minstral AI yeah they're buying all the AI I don't know why you wouldn't right now the greatest money maker of the future like right now there's very few times in the world in which like a new Google is about to like accidentally happen or maybe not by accident but like it's happening there's like the new Google where it just starts off as like all you have to do is have a slightly better version of the thing that already exists and people are going to go nuts for it and so like it makes perfect sense that Microsoft's they're buying up every last possible AI oh you got an AI company we're investing in it oh you got a robotics company we're investing in it you got AI in your name we're buying it right the US tech giant said on Monday that it was investing in the company which regarded as the Europeans answer to open AI to help it unlock new commercial opportunities to expand its Global markets by the way this 29-year-old makes $125,000 or uh in Tech without a bachelor's degree here's how by the way this right here flip can you zoom in can you zoom in on this one okay flip can you just programmatically take out my head replace it Flip Flip look at that this right here is like the the um the the most evil cell of all time okay I just want to let you know that I think this stuff is just so bad you got to quit doing this to people okay you got to quit doing this to people you know why cuz all it does is give people false premises that they're going to just somehow get a magic amount of money doing nothing this person's working on Windows I highly doubt there's nothing even on the screen there's not even code on the screen okay I think this is probably lll generated okay this is llm generated there's not even code on the screen it's just a Windows machine don't even believe it's coding going on there since debuting in November 2022 open AI chatot Chad jippy has taken the World by storm the AI tool quickly became the fastest growing consumer application in history it and kickstarted a launch of rival chatbots from companies such as Google parent alphabet and Microsoft I don't know if this is a net benefit I don't think suing really I I I can't IM like here real talk can suing actually change what's going on let's just pretend that right now uh let's just for the sake of argument let's pretend that open AI is actually getting directly controlled or partially being controlled by Microsoft what does suing give them in a genuine sense because it's the people have already agreed given the premise to already be kind of like lacking for a larger company they already are willing to sell out to do stuff bad publicity only works for permanently online people okay you know who's not going to remember it all the people that are using it right nobody cares it's a publicity stunt at best right it's probably to be it's probably to get more you know like real talk it's probably just Elon hoping to get more people using his AI is really all it is and maybe that works maybe that doesn't work uh but but at the end of the day I think the heart of the lawsuit if correct is is is real and good but I don't think it changes anything cuz if the board is already willing to do the deed then whatever the outcome is you still have the same people willing to do the same thing so it doesn't change you know like nothing actually gets changed that's it anyways so that's kind of my take on this which is I think the whole like make AI benefit for Humanity is going to be make AI benefit for a few we you know already talked about it with this whole thing uh I think that that pretty much applies to any anything there are a few good pieces this is the one that might get me in trouble I think the one really nice part about AI is that if you have absolute no graphic skills and you want to create like a little pixelated art and you just have no idea what you're doing and you're brand new you can use the llms to create you some pixel art it will be the most generic average looking pixel art like everything else but at least you can do something and build something for the first time and see how it feels and maybe build your game or whatever and I I mean I think that that's pretty cool right I think that it gives an opport in a unique way to people and which is pretty good I think it can be really great teaching tools which is really great like there are some really good positive things uh I at the end of the day my fundamental problem with AI art isn't that it's taking jobs away from artist it's that it produces really dumb art I'm not sure how much the benefit there is to humanity I'm just not buying that in general bad take on that don't agree which part hit me we got based in bad takes all right code cone let's see it code cone what's going on what what do what what take and why don't you agree with it you need to pay uh the artist for the source training material like real talk how do how how did we get here new generators aren't very good they're extremely Bland they're like they're like rings of power they look incredibly beautiful until you look at it long enough you realize you just watch the most average television you've ever seen in your lifetime every time I look at an AI generated item you can just feel it right you can just feel it like the game is just average but I'm just saying it's great for somebody that can't build anything can't afford anything and they're just trying to use something to build it and put some placeholders in I don't have any problems I don't think it's because they trained on stock photos I think that's because that's what they fundamentally do they're averages that's why they produce average code that's why they produce average everything is because they use medians in these law you know they they they determine what they're attempting to generate based on a bunch of numbers average does not equal bad but it does not equal it does not equal impressive average does not equal impressive that's why I don't think real artists are going anywhere because a real artist develops a style that's unique that it's hard for an llm to keep on going with right the llm will take that style to some degree and make it into something that's just like a more bland version of it they're never able to actually keep innovating in that way that that artist does and it's the exact same reason why like and and and followup just to follow up that one this whole idea that that o that llms need to pay artists for their Source material you got to understand that inspiration like people aren't an island onto themselves every single artist has taken inspiration from hundreds of other people should they have to pay everybody else also I don't think so like inspiration is inspiration and ours looks different than them you cannot tell me that these people come completely from their own their own Universe right humans are just crappier and better llms you yeah you'll never get these things now now that they exist the llm can create a version of it that is very average but so did everybody else like think about how many people that have followed suit and tried to create the same thing that you just listed right here so many people have what's different between them and an llm I don't think there's a huge difference I just think that the real artists will float to the top just like real programmers are going to float to the top people that are really good at what they do will continue to be emphasized by an AI not minimized by an AI AI That's it I think that llms have a really great way to do inspiration too intellectual property is a real problem it's a very difficult problem and I don't think I don't think you can solve it by saying that an AI does it but humans don't right like should expressjs be able to sue restify because they came up with this little routing mechanism that's almost identical to restify right like that's the problem about intellectual work is that all of a sudden you realize that it's a it's just an absolute effing conundrum anyways the name you know what the name is you know what the name is oh you don't oh the name's the prime gen [Laughter] hey I hate Microsoft
