I'm sorry to ask this question almost but it's something that I think is a little bit important um how do you think first off people quit prefacing and saying sorry for everything okay it first off it the values saying sorry okay if you first have to screw up before you actually say sorry just comes out the gate I'm sorry for all the things I'm about to do then you're not sorry because you're doing them okay that means you're not sorry that's the death definition of sorry is I did something and I wish not to have done it and therefore I will change my life and I Repent from my sins instead this bird's like well I'm sorry but here we go that's not sorry you're using the term incorrect I think it affects the culture of a community of a project when the leader is on that project's public mailing list telling people in response to patch reviews that they should be retroactively aborted right and maybe that you're surprised that oh that is way too harsh I did not that I feel like I knew that but at the same time whoo you can't say that you're still alive because they should have starved to death when they were children because they were too stupid to find a hit to suck on I I'm surprised you're alive because I don't think you're smart enough to find a tit to suck on that is that is literally the most intense burn I've ever heard in my entire lifetime I I just don't think you could literally like that you just can't save okay Karen first off I'm not a big fan of teleportation can we not do that anymore okay I don't like that it makes me feel all wobbly and second off I'm just quoting a guy okay I'm not I'm not saying it she Karen I agree that some people might be put off by that there's at least one person we know factually stated there's at least one person put off by that minimum the one with whom you said should be retroactively aborted probably is offended at least one person minimum uh uh but on the other hand you know what I in the end I don't care oh my goodness you know like I'm not really into being mean to someone you know when they do something stupid I I I'm not into it uh I I don't think it's a good way to go about things but people most certainly have become way too sensitive right and this is just like a hilarious just interaction of these two worlds just colliding clearly Bull and china shop versus this person that's like sorry sorry for even saying it sorry for even speaking out loud but I'm going to speak out loud sorry about it right like this is a very funny interchange here um I care about technology and I've actually seen projects that took the whole political correctness so far that that the project no longer is about the technology he's looking at you Russ Foundation um I actually so on my wow we are getting more questions I think at some point we might want to moderate them so my take Duncan I actually am very happy to talk about this it's not a problem for me um my by the way I can't tell if this is too loud or not flip can you do some like post-processing to make the note the levels normal like in my headphones it looks loud but on OBS it's like quiet so I can't tell if it's too loud or too quiet it's very confusing for me right now it's actually really hard to know what's happening a standpoint has always been that hey people are different I'm abrasive um I grew up in a culture that I think is not quite as politically correct as the culture especially in the U.S today I also grew up in a family that was largely dysfunctional so um I mean so hey welcome to the club Linus I'm glad that we uh we share that you know uh you know nothing like a good dysfunctional family um I guess I took a different approach in the sense that my goal was to create a functional family you know what I mean like I want to be functional I want to be a functional normal human being by the end of this all but hey welcome it's a fun time you know we all go we all get to learn some things you know people are different and some people take offense and some people give offense and we all have to live together but the living together is not by finding some lowest common denominator and it has actually been fairly successful is to try realize that hey unlike your family you can actually pick your friends and you can pick the co-workers and open source is actually really good at that better so than many commercial software projects because in a commercial setting you're kind of stuck with your boss in open source find people you like find people you like working with this is actually a really good take uh this is shockingly a good take um I think that uh when you really like the people who you work with you work better right and I think some people get so stuck on a project they want to work on even when they find out they don't like who they're working with and then it just doesn't cause the right camaraderie right you really have to enjoy the people you work with and I I think that is uh this is a really great point because if you want to take something far there has to be something more than just like money or notoriety at the end right that that's just not it's very hard and very few people can be wired in such a way that just that is motivation enough to go through a lot of horrible things right um I I work directly with let's say 20 people closely and 50 people more or less right there's every release there's a thousand people involved geez find somebody you like better than me then that's fine right I'm not willing to be less honest less honest and the and the retroactive aborted I mean that's the thing is like that may not technically be honesty just throwing it out there that maybe a different quality than honesty but hey hey because I know I'm abrasive right and quite often the whole like when I say something like I wonder how he grew to be an adult when he's so stupid that he I don't expect him to find food some people might realize that it's kind of Hyperbole and joking I'm not um I'm not saying something back just try to his line is bad is back totally joking when I was just like you should have died I wasn't like you should have died I was like you should have done your change is definitely not being committed you should have died because of it Ain't No Way ain't no way that was a joke ain't no way just no way and I'm joking I'm not um I'm not saying something bad that you know it's not politically correct or whatever although certainly I would understand if people do say this it's more about treating other people with respect and maybe saying technical you know what I love the clappies in the background because they're just like tell him you tell liena I love that I love that there's a few clappies because they just hate this idea like you you do see it a lot in software 10 years ago my favorite most growing moment was not when someone took me by the hand hey Prime you know you're a really great guy and I think you're a smart person could we talk about this for a second he like walked in and said hey get that hand out of my hand your change sucks and you need to go fix it right now made me take things a little bit more seriously I still look back at that as one of a very great a very great moment applaud everything you want but I don't respect people on this stuff you think they deserve the respect there are people who think that respect is something that should be given no no I don't I I actually agree with that you don't you don't give somebody respect off the rip but I believe fully and giving someone the benefit of the doubt off the rip right I don't doubt them I don't uh I don't think oh they can't do it I go okay I'm gonna start off and I I'll believe you're capable show me you're capable I believe it so whatever you do I will come in there thinking this person's capable and able to do a good job that's not necessarily respect it's just I like to start everyone off in a nice in a nice uh in a good spot you know just like pastel pestilent ate you know he started off in a good spot now he's just not you know what I mean good times I happen to be one of the people who I'm perfectly happy saying no respect should be earned and without being earned you don't get it right it's really that simple and I not everybody agrees and that's fine too right uh there are people I refuse to work with right it's it cuts both ways and and I realize that right okay thank you okay this is a good video you know like I I still think you shouldn't justify being mean to someone right I I really I think there's a difference between mean and honest and all those things blah blah blah blah we don't need to preface all that you guys get it you guys understand there's a difference um but the reality is I think that people in some sense fight super hard and genuinely try to um in some sense like try to make the world into a place where no one can say anything negative right like there's just so much about this especially with pull requests where you can't even say hey this is bad right I think that's equally as wrong right you're fighting both sides at that point you should be able to say this is bad I don't think it's 100 I you disagree really so you you literally think that everyone should be given immediate respect I don't think everyone should be given immediate respect right I think respect is 100 earned right you you really do have to give an earned respect I think that you should be able to be harsh on something that is bad but I do not think you should be like I just don't believe in insulting the individual right uh as a human yes there's a difference there's a difference between human there's there's human dignity and technological prowess right those are very very different things and so those are two different categories like I wouldn't treat somebody bad or think they somehow deserve less because of some inalienable quality about them right something that I can't they can't I can't do anything about right I get that but when it comes to the technical side you don't get you just don't get respect right you can't walk in new person expect the same respect as Linus right if Linus is like how what I mean by that is that if Linus comes to you and makes a PR against your open source Library what are the chances you're accepting it and if some person named you know Edge Lord 69 420 comes in and makes a PR what kind of scrutiny are you going to give them well it's simple because one of these people has earned respect and as much as you would like to say yeah hey you know I get it I respect everybody equally the reality is you don't right you don't you know and I know everyone's joking actually I'll do it I'll do this let's see honestly I think he means honest uh uh to his own thoughts and himself and he wants to say I agree though you should be able to give negative feedback without being overly mean yeah you shouldn't be mean about it I totally am on that team and I think you should have the right to be mean and the receiver has the right to be offended yeah that's true I don't believe you have the right to never be offended yeah I so this is okay so this right here is a great statement you don't have the right to never be offended and that's the thing is like I'm totally about drawing lines like I'm never gonna say someone I think that you're something horrible I mean pestilence eight we did it as a joke even with all the dumb things he said no matter how like racy races those that was you know the poor guy lives that life like if that's his literal thoughts think about how low and awful your life has to be to view the world that way you know what I mean like in real real talk you have to be so Twisted internally to think that that's a real thing I pity you more than anything else I am happy I don't look like that right I'm happy I don't I I don't act like that it's it's sad to me you know um see being neutral is being respectful too in my opinion I think we might be I think we might be uh I think we might be putting in weird things with the word respect I think we probably all don't have maybe the same definition for respect you know what I mean and so typically when I think of respect I think of something a little bit different than say courteousness right being courteous is different right that's a very different like so what what it seems like you just said is I think we should be courteous right you're being neutral you're being maybe you're not uh I'm not really sure what neutral and how you know you know it's it's different um yeah I I do agree with that you know neutral is being uh I don't even know what that word is compassent complacent compassent having respect versus being respectful yeah yeah how dare you disrespect my definition of respect I don't know polite yeah this is maybe a polite thing like I I do believe in being polite I believe in being civil right we live in a civil society diversity is an old wooden but I mean I do mean I think that we live in a society and we should we should be civil to one another and I think that that's that's a good that's a good place to be being civil and so that's like a good step one right and so I'm just not gonna act like he does right and I know someone's uh someone was posting that he has now said hey I'm sorry for all those years of being uh a jerk I don't even know where it's at uh I get that you should be a little bit sorry because I think as you look back and as you get older you get a little bit wiser with time you know hopefully hopefully you get wiser with time not all old people are wise not all young people are unwise right and I think there's just comes a point where you go okay maybe I should have done things different and that's good you know people change that's pretty cool it's pretty cool that he could write an article saying hey maybe I should have been a little bit more polite that's good I still agree with a good portion of the things he said I think it's good to find open source projects where you just get along with people you know what I mean you just want to be there you want to work with them you get you have good banter I think there's something really powerful about that right really powerful uh there's so there's something really important about that right it's it's a um yeah I mean you should agree and disagree with everything everyone says it's like a workplace yeah you want uh the retroactive abortion line was good though I mean it's hilarious and it's in in the fact that it's just so absurd yes um you know what I mean yeah and of course of course this is also true we all we all get to talk a bunch of on the internet because we're not doing it in person right no one's gonna go up to somebody and start an actual fight who talks on the internet because almost 99 of all people on the internet they're not in fighting condition okay they're not they don't want to do that um but hey this was really weird this was a weird talk it was really weird about that one guy in the middle that just said absurd things but hey you know we gotta roll with the punches this is Twitch okay welcome to Twitch  up on here okay I just it just messed that up hey the name is the prime machine
