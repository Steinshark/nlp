[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and i've always carried an iphone with me as you guys already know but i've never been much of a watch person like i've gone on and off with a bunch of different smart watches over the years that i've tried the original moto 360 previous generations of apple watch even the new samsung galaxy watch that just came out but always on and off with them i've never been consistent with it this one looks like it might be changing that this is debatably the best thing apple announced at that latest event the biggest upgrade for sure and while i was there i spent all my time with the phones but now i've gotten to spend a lot of time with the watches over the past couple days and i gotta say it's about time we got something like this [Music] so series four is the first real redesign of the apple watch and it's massively better in a lot of ways more powerful more modern more functional and just more fun it comes in two new sizes the previous small 38 millimeter has turned into a 40 mil and the large 42 millimeter has turned into a 44 mil so i'm rocking the new larger one in space gray aluminum and it's low key way nicer than the series 3. now naturally when you hear it's bigger you'd be concerned about the watch being too big on your wrist but basically the actual size of the watch itself is nearly the same like a couple fractions of a millimeter taller and a bit wider but on the wrist you don't notice it's like if you like the old size you'll like the new size but thanks to the bezels shrinking so much you get a way bigger screen a 30 bigger screen area in the same size body no notch needed that is huge every smartwatch deals with bezels in some way and this is a great way to do it it also does have rounded corners which i'm not as big of a fan of but it matches the shape of the watch now and overall it's a less bulgy thinner more modern looking piece it's a bit thinner in that sensor area on the back too and all the changes put together make every previous apple watch look terrible in comparison this is the first apple watch that to me actually looks pretty sleek there are some other minor cosmetic changes too this is the lte connected watch and that huge red dot of paint from the last gen has turned into a more subtle red ring the sensor array on the back even they don't necessarily look at it that much is now ceramic and looks way better the mic has moved from one side to the other so it's further from the speaker that's functionally better and the speaker is now made way bigger but overall it's still a familiar apple watch shape and and the bands from the previous years are all still compatible with this new one and using the watch software is now the same but better meaning it's now watchos 5 which all apple watchers are getting now and functionally it's the same it doesn't do anything different it's still the bubbly app launcher all that stuff hasn't changed but it's now better so it's on this larger display already and then they've made all the buttons bigger and easier to press and all the fonts and texts larger and easier to read so it just makes the working surface area of the watch so much bigger on your wrist to the point where it's actually not a horrible thing to pull out maps or open photos up on the watch you can actually kind of see stuff now if someone sends you a link in imessage and you open it on the watch you might not hate trying to read it and apple's showing off these huge new displays the best way they can with some new watch faces that happen to look super good on an oled display of course with these inky blacks but there's a lot of that by design there's the infograph watch face that you've seen like in the ads and all this new promo material it has a ton of complications in all four corners and then four more in the middle plus an hour and a minute hand and it's just a ton of information i happen to like it a lot it's the one i've been using some people absolutely hate it it's like a crime against design by the amount of colors people see it's kind of meant to emulate those super high-end watches with tons of visible mechanical parts but a sort of a more digital and more colorful version i got the temperature in one corner my battery in another the uv index outside i don't check that or care about that and my activity rings i don't know it just kind of looks cool i like it i don't know why you can definitely tune it down though and there's also now a new infograph modular face that's a more digital version that still has a lot of complications with a similar gradient color style to each their own there's also a new vapor watch face and a fire watch face and a water one and these were all made this is this is the part that the video nerd in me absolutely loves these were all made using practical effects and recorded with an actual camera so they actually made a giant apple watch sized bin of metal with a camera over it and filled it with fire and recorded it fun fact and probably the most gratuitous apple thing ever i love it so the bigger screen and the new design i'd say those are the main draw the biggest reasons to get this new watch but then i'd say there are two other reasons one the new specs it's a bit faster which helps the s4 chip helps swiping through the ui which you don't do nearly as often as you do on your phone but it used to be painful on the watch so i'm grateful that they focused on making it smooth now switching between watch faces adjusting complications scrolling launching apps all that and launching siri is actually noticeably faster and getting responses from her is snappy there's also now just ways to talk so you can raise the watch up and immediately just start talking and it'll quickly hopefully answer your question if you're asking one so how tall is the empire state building empire state building is 1250 feet tall when it doesn't work though it kind of just looks like you checked the time and then just started blurting out words which is probably not the best look so i definitely still prefer like holding down the watch crown and and holding and talking and letting go even though it takes an extra hand and an extra second so uh how many feet is 100 meters the answer is 328.08 feet that's fast and you could probably also just hear then the speaker is actually a lot louder uh the big slot on the side i'd say it's significant so if you're one of those people that makes a lot of phone calls on the watch or like gets a lot of responses from siri or is just talking to it a lot or even does walkie-talkies then that that louder speaker will matter which brings us to your final reason you might want to get this watch and that's just the sprinkling of new features apple tossed in here and there like the new walkie-talkie mode is maybe the most gimmicky thing ever but in case you want to talk to people on your watch but don't want to call them there is a walkie-talkie mode that you can enable that lets you push to talk over and with that throwback to nextel in the 90s i think that falls in the bucket of old people are gonna love this features alongside fall detection and ekgs fall detection is exactly what it sounds like so it is after all an accelerometer and a gyroscope on your wrist so apple tuned this and studied a lot of people falling and with that if you take a hard fall and then don't move for a while it will automatically call emergency services and notify your emergency contact which is actually pretty smart and i'd say an apple watch for someone is way cooler than the pendant of shame you normally see for fall detection i've fallen and i can't get up but also construction workers and painters and many other people who work at heights will love this too of course and the ekg feature is actually extremely impressive it's not enabled yet but when it is you'll be able to just hold down the watch crown and it'll connect the circuit and the watch can accurately read your heart and produce an ekg that you can then export as a pdf and send directly to your doctor and it'll detect things like irregular heart rhythm afib this is a feature that when it's available could legitimately save lives so the new apple watch has a lot of things going for it but it's not all great uh there's definitely it's still very apple in a couple frustrating ways meaning there are some things that they could definitely do with it that would clearly make it better that they just don't do there there is no sleep tracking at all which you would think would be kind of a big deal in a watch that's so focused on health and fitness but it's not there there's also still no completely custom watch faces just the customization of the ones apple made now to be fair apple's made a lot at this point but i feel like if apple opened this up to developers and had an app store for watch faces it could be huge right you still can't use any assistant other than siri of course i'm not surprised by that but if i could switch it to google assistant i would be so happy there's also no always-on mode that i think they could totally do with this battery life and these oled displays it is as consistent as ever with the whole raise to wake thing but a lot of people i've talked to want it to look more like a normal watch even when you're not using it and part of that would just be showing a watch face all the time now that would definitely bring battery life down but it's already two to three days that i get now so it'd bring it down to maybe one day and that's not the end of the world i think it would be fair to give that as an option but at the end of the day this is the best smart watch by far all over again and obviously the one to get if you have an iphone it's the best productivity watch the best for notifications and responses to them the best fitness watch the best health tool on your wrist now the price ranges a lot based on what size what material and then whether you go with lte or not ranging from 399 all the way up to like you could spend eight 900 bucks on this thing i wouldn't recommend that but yeah overall i just feel like i've always been in this weird place where i know i carry an iphone and i've always been a fan of the apple watch but i never feel like i'm missing out on anything when i just don't have one but this one i'm gonna keep on me i'm pretty sure biggest upgrade to the apple watch yet and i love it and i think if you're looking for an apple watch you will too thumbs up for me until the next one thanks for watching catch you later peace
