the Galaxy Note temperance of landed and they're actually a weird mix of definitely better than the s10 line and at the same time in some ways not actually keeping up so welcome to 15 great things about the Galaxy Note 10 you should keep an eye out for there are three models here the note 10 the note 10 plus as well as a 5g version of that which in itself is a pretty interesting move considering that the note used to be Samsung's single final flagship but now even that is split into lower mid and higher tier in the end though it's more choice so we can't really complain about that you might remember that with the Galaxy S 10 there was a bit of a delta between the performance of the Exynos version and a performance of the snapdragon version well with the note that's been at least compensated for because they're powered by the brand-new X in Austin 9825 which about 15% faster there's no longer a dedicated Bigsby button and the power key is now combined with it and shifted to the left of the phone which to be honest I'm completely fine with there's no reaching or hand shuffling required to use it this is in all senses an upgrade from the s10 a single tap turns the screen off and a hole will activate Bigsby so if you want to shut it down you have to either hold down the power and volume keys or hit the power button that's been added to the status bar there's a four thousand three hundred million power battery on the plus model which is a really healthy amount but whilst that is larger than the cell on the s10 plus because something has also had to fit an S Pen inside here means it is smaller than the one on the s10 of 5g the normal note 10 has a three thousand eight hundred million power cell which is good considering the smaller size but battery size is one of those areas that competitors are really doubling down on on the subject of the s-pen this phone has yet again a newly designed stylus with the focus this time on air gestures they're likening this to a magic wand for your phone it can do all the tricks that the note 9s coat like remotely take photos but can now also do things like switch lenses and switch camera modes from a distance to be honest though even if it got better I'm not sure it's something I'd actually use now the phone feels good it's got the same boxy style of past notes but with the lower density feel of the galaxy s 10 and good weight distribution so I didn't feel like this was gonna topple out my hands unlike some phones that are this large the display on the plus model is every bit as good as you'd expect it to be it's a really similar quality 3040 by 1440 panel to the s 10 but scaled up to a six point eight inch size you probably remember the day when a seven-inch screen was considered tablet sized we're pretty much there it's also complemented by a really slick new dynamic lockscreen wallpaper it looks somewhat inspired by a bubble the note 10 comes with the ability to charge with 25 watts of power and the note 10 plus 45 watts in my opinion this is some of the best news that's come out of this launch samsung has been trailing with charging speeds for some time now but not anymore the camera setup on the note 10 is pretty much identical to the S tens whilst the plus is pretty much identical to the S 10 5g and you could see this either way to be honest it's great to see that Samsung's best phone has their best camera setup but at the same time it's hardly breaking new ground the main sensor here hasn't changed much in years although image processing has come leaps and bounds that said there are a couple of new bells and whistles here we've got a our doodle which uses the new time-of-flight camera to let you draw in augmented reality and I could actually see this being quite a lot of fun it does work better on the rear camera though because that's where the time of flight is so this right here is lighter this video taken on the note 10 plusses front-facing camera the rear camera is better for this and there are other live focus effects as well as just background blur you can add a glitch effect like this and it comes into effect when you're close enough to a subject you've got audio zoom which uses three directional microphones to focus on only picking up audio from the source that's in frame so if I were using my ultra wide lens and capturing everything I pick up a lot of noise but then if I started zooming in on let's say a car in the distance the audio would shift to highlighting the cars sound I'm relieved that the phone inherits a lot of the perks of the s10 line you've got Dolby Atmos 3d surround speakers ip68 water resistance you've got wireless charging and Wireless reverse charging as well as micro SD card supports on the larger phone oh yeah and speaking of storage they both have eight ton with 256 gigabyte options on both and a 512 gig on the plus the note m+ also comes with twice the RAM of the note 10-12 gigabytes versus six making quite a significant Delta in peak multitasking performance you know you usually get a pro model of a phone you might get two gigs of extra RAM or four gigs this might just be the largest difference I've seen also the last thing I'd say in terms of real positives here is the screen to body ratio this thing is almost all display and the time punch hole in the center doesn't really take too much away from it okay this is not a perfect phone and I'd say one of the things that really hampers my excitement is just that there's not all that much new this is shaping up to be a really great phone but more because of just how close it is to the great phones that came before this is one of the most similar feeling note phones in terms of new features over the s-line and that in itself doesn't make it a worse phone but it just feels like some of its competitors are moving on faster what's kind of weird is that all variants of this phone only have a single front camera compared to the dual we saw on the s10 plus and so front-facing portrait mode is not gonna be as good and there is still no iris scanning or secure face unlocking here's an easy one there's no headphone jack here and while something didn't directly address why there isn't I guess they're kind of implying that the audio will sound better through the USBC port but still no doubt this is going to annoy a lot of long-term Samsung fans also what's really weird is that whilst the Plus model can rest easy with a six point eight inch quad HD plus display the smaller phone is six point three inches and a little more controversial because of a 1080p resolution now you might already know that's not massive issue to me even on phones that have quad HD panels I sometimes set entertain to be anyway just to save battery but it's just a little unusual considering that this phone is priced as a flagship and that the smaller screened Galaxy S ten has a quad HD panel you can probably also tell something is trying out a new type of finish here I've got the Aurora glow versions and they scatter light in an unusual way and it's good to see experimentation but this is far from the cleanest implementation of prism like reflective glass glass is a reflective material glass picks up fingerprints but this phone in particular shows them a lot more than the s tens or even the s ten five g's okay so galaxy note n is it the most exciting phone not really is it one of the most refined solid and reliable experiences out there definitely also thought I'd give you a quick behind the scenes of the set if I'm actually recording this voice over with because it is not as glamorous as you think if you enjoyed this video I've got a really special comparison comparing every single Galaxy S smartphone so far so do check that out and there's another one coming very soon which is gonna be I think even better my name is Erin and this is mr. he's the boss and I will catch you in the next one
