reaction channels twitch ever has 88,000 views me reacting to it on my clip channel has 1.2 million views is that up the fast food of YouTube quick easy and sometimes a bit questionable there's a lot of controversy regarding this type of content where a lot of these creators get called parasites cannibals freebooters the list just goes on so today I'm going to conduct an AI experiment I'm going to create AI clones of these content creators and I'm going to make these AI clones react to the same videos and we're going to see who's more entertaining an AI clone or the actual Creator so this is going to be soulless content versus low effort content which is the worst now I know what you're thinking sloth you can't represent a Creator using AI yes the [ __ ] I can look at this xqc money spread these are the creators I'm going to use for this experiment xqc you keep speaking German and [ __ ] bro bro bro I don't even speak that fast I'm not like a Sniper Wolf Hello friends it's me asmin gold and our last contestant is going to be Hassan dude he's so good now I'm not the YouTube police I'm not going to wiggle my finger and tell these creators to stop making reaction videos I'm just here to see if AI ising better at their job if this works quel cop is about to cream his pants let me explain how this experiment is going to work the first thing is the voices so I cloned the original Creator's voices with 11 Labs as you can see here hey what's up everyone it's AI xqc here I'm better than the original you can actually uh uh understand me Po's in the chat boys if you want to mess around with AI voices I'll leave a link in the description you can do a lot of stuff with 11 Labs check this out okay now that we have the voices let me explain the cool part of this experiment so the way I'm going to get AI to react to these videos is using open ai's API with this API I can use the GPT 4 Vision model and this lets me give images to gp4 so the way this program is going to work is I'm going to split this into two parts the introduction and then the reaction so the way the introduction is going to work is AI is going to get the the title of the video and then the Creator and it's going to try and create a YouTube intro for this video the second part is the reaction itself and the way this is going to work is I'm going to extract every frame from the video and then I give those frames to GPT 4 and it's going to use these frames to create a reaction from it I'm also going to give it some of the transcript from the video so that gp4 has more context to fully understand what's going on in the video to give a better reaction and then once it generates the reaction I'm going to give it to 11 labs's API to transform the reaction text into the Creator's voice so here's an example reaction okay okay dudes are you seeing this chat look I'm on the screen dude is this supposed to be me ha what the man this is dude is this how chat sees me when I do long streams like some streamer cryp keeper man okay now that we have the boring stuff out of the way we can get started with this experiment I'm going to grade the reactions based on the two parts the introduction and the reaction itself we're going to see which one's better AI or the original Creator I also want to know who you think was more entertaining so leave a comment below my hypothesis is that they're both going to be bad but I think AI might be able to win a lot of these first person we have is xqc and the video we're going to use is this Mark Rober video so let's start with the [Music] introductions this is xqc's intro to the video 42 months really appreciate you X you really help my mental health and help my workday go by faster xqc yeah literally nothing bro gave us a chipmunk laugh and called it a day look at this sh all right let's see what AI excc can do for an introduction yo chat POG champ today we're uh we're actually going to going to dive into this this absolutely nuts video man candy thieves versus rigged candy bowl by Mark Rober and and just hypers chat hypers yeah I think uh we know who won this one chat hypers all right let's move on to the second part the reaction this is the best I could find throughout the entire video okay chat a lot of things annoy me about this video he already looked at the camera once right why does he keep looking why is he like so like sketched out and weird if he's going to go for a steal plus why is so picky he's yoinking I mean you're going to want to go fast at least a certain amount of pace why is he picky it's like rubbing a bank and filtering through the cash like no not fives nope not ones not tens like I won't even lie that was a pretty good reaction compared to his other videos I actually don't think AI will do better but uh let's see what aqc can do yo chat look at this dude this is going to be poggers I can feel it Mark Rob's out here rigging stuff again kick you all right we got this kid right he's sneaking up to the bowl like he's got some five head Strat oh no no no dude the bait is set he's going for the full send grabbing a whole handful greedy Andy kick you no way dude the candy bow is debating him hands on the cheeks Home Alone style he got jit chat actually jit LM out get baited buddy and the kid's bouncing dude scaredy cat Andy is out of there bro look at him run I won't lie AI reactions are pretty bad all they do is describe the video it's not really their own thing cuz you know they're not human but at least it's funny he got jait chat actually deated I honestly don't know who to give it to you guys can decide I'll just give them both points for this one next one up Sniper Wolf Jack films' favorite Creator it's also YouTube's favorite [Music] Creator this is her intro for one of her videos Hello friends it's me and today we're watching an episode of Love Don't Judge about this couple over here let's watch you know it's not the worst at least it's an actual intro compared to xqc so let's see what AI Sniper Wolf can do I also improved the program by giving it the thumbnail too so let's see what it could do hey it's Sniper Wolf today we're checking out he's not my feeder he's my boyfriend from love don't judge the thumbnail alone is wild let's see what their story is All About like subscribe and let's get into it wow um that one was actually really bad that sounded so lifeless um I'm actually going to give this to Sniper Wolf uh surprisingly all right time for the reaction here's a clip of Sniper Wolf reacting to the video I never really had any problems hating someone I think I just got confident at a very young age I mean that's nice good for her me and my friends have had this conversation multiple times where it's like some people just grow up to be confident they never got bullied nobody ever told them they were ugly nobody ever told them they were fat there was actually quite a bit more to that reaction but I didn't want to show all that um honestly that was the most transformative I've ever seen Sniper Wolf I think she's really reacting now ever since she's been getting called out but let's see how AI Sniper Wolf reacts to the same clip his Instagram messages because he asked about U music and that's how it's done she slid into his DMS over music that's like the perfect love story who needs Tinder when you've got that shared Spotify playlist Vibe right and look at them standing together so happy like bosses she's got that confidence at a young age girl where can I get some of that oh and we've got the kitchen scenario my man is cooking and they're just chatting it up love is cooking in that kitchen and I ain't just talking about the food it's so bad uh I think AI Sniper Wolf won this I think it was way more entertaining than the original our next Creator asmin gold you know the drill let's see what the intro is for this video most hated role in in uh in gaming what the tank is the most hated role is it is tank the worst role I don't know but let's see what AI asmin gold does for an intro all right boys asmin gold here today we're hitting up the most hated role in gaming by acon Esports man tanks get no respect they're the punching bags The Shield the unsung heroes this thumbnail just screaming controversy smash like subre and let's get this show on the road it's going to be lit I'm going to give that one to AI asmin gold only because of this part it's going to be lit time for the reaction this was the best I could find for the video I thought it was the most entertaining it's a little long he likes to Yap a lot no don't laugh oh I want have punched in your to be fair like there are a lot of tanks and I also I don't want to make this turn into like some kind of tank support group okay there's a lot of tanks that get sh because they're fing garbage they actually suck they don't know anything about the game they click their abilities they backpedal they can't hold aggro they don't know the dungeon they're using leather armor and they're supposed to be using plate and they're [ __ ] garbage yeah that was a real reaction right there that's what I'm looking for let's see if AI asmin gold can top this I don't think it can oh my god dude look at this all the tanks in chat can we get some Fs in the chat for our fallen Brothers holding it down in the trenches man as a tank you're legit the dad of the group everybody blames Dad when things go south right oh where were the heels bro I was too busy keeping these noobs alive because they can't fing Dodge a mechanic to save their life and this part here oh man tanking criticism and mean words welcome to the [ __ ] internet but real talk tanks deal with so much especially with pugs right you're in there strategizing like you're about to take the iron throne but then you forget about that one guy who's like dude why can't you [ __ ] hold aggro and I'm like bro I'm juggling more balls here than your mom on a Sunday night give me aing break break oh my God I can't believe AI generated that now even with the mom joke I hate to say it the original asmin gold one it had that pure human rage that AI just can't replicate even if it finds the right words for it it just can't say it right bro I'm juggling more balls here than your mom on a Sunday night our next contestant [Music] Hassan all right ladies and gentlemen this is the final reaction Hassan has to win both of these he has to win both the intro and reaction to prove that humans haven't lost to machines just yet this is a lot of pressure on you Hanan I hope you can pull this off so it's time for the intro let's see what he does now let's watch this video the deceptive world of ghost kit delivery apps like ooh a short and quick intro I have no idea if that was the right play Let's see if AI wins it right here all right chat we're checking out the deceptive world of ghost kitchens by Eddie burback this is going to be some wild stuff chat Let's See How Deep The Rabbit Hole goes ooh they went for the same approach but I hate to say it AI Hassan gave more credit to the original Creator he said the title and the channel name I think that gives him the win right there that means AI wins that's it that's it ladies and gentlemen okay okay hold up I'm going to give Hassan one more try if he can win this reaction I'll give him the win for both I'm going to give you one more chance Assan please do not let us humans down this is all for Humanity right here looks like if somebody drew a it looks like a cartoon D dude it looks like oh no prop dude oh my Lord oh no oh no oh no no no no no no no this real it looks like a Krabby Patty it literally does okay I have a confession to make this was not his most entertaining part in the video I rigged it you what I'm sorry I'm sorry hey I'm giving him a chance here okay I'm giving him another chance I only picked it because of the crabby patty I'm sorry I'm sorry but hey it was still a good reaction right it was better than some of the other ones maybe he can still win let's see what what AI Hassan does and let's see who gets the dub humans or computers dude chat are you seeing this they call this a burger bro all right hold on I got to pause right here this is too good this is too [ __ ] good first of all can we talk about the expectations versus reality situation here actually wait before I continue chat I'll be right [Music] back oh my God AI choked I told the AI about how Hassan walks away from videos and it actually did it humans win let's go easy low effort content wins again Baby Woo no but on a serious note it's pretty embarrassing that AI was this close to begin with right I think that really says a lot but hey I'm not the YouTube police like I said before humans won for now but who knows what could happen in a few years let's give our creators a round of applause woo they did it they beat machines my final words reaction content is low effort AI is going to take over the world and I'll see you guys in the next video see you
