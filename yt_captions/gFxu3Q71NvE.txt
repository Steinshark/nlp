in several of my movie interpretation videos i've documented the rise of propagandistic patterns in recent storytelling the new intersectional ideal coupled with the revolutionary patterns so common in hollywood tropes have merged together to create quote-unquote woke stories which use storytelling tools to impose an upside-down pattern of reality this happens through a desire to counteract the negative side effects of identity such as exclusion and oppression of margins and so although the aims are understandable there are inevitable side effects of going down that line in order to fight stereotypes and traditional hierarchies one creates characters and narratives which try to upend and counteract them but what first looks like just counteracting them becomes mainstream and even expected creating stories with upside down stereotypes so a woman must systematically beat up men the exceptional must be better than the rule the outsider better than the one inside the margin must replace the center while remaining the margin i need you to fix his suit the suit is literal perfection it will be when it fits a woman things become upside down when by social pressures and strange new taboos these new counter-intuitive stereotypes become an enforced expected norm [Music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Music] many people have complained as they watch their favorite franchises being taken over by such practices there are too many franchises to enumerate from star wars men in black james bond to different comic book characters video game series the latest being the new enola homes movie on netflix paint your own picture and ola don't be thrown of course by other people especially men one of the complaints made by critics of these strategies is found in asking why the new intersectional thinkers don't just make up new characters and storylines rather than infiltrate and take over existing ones by asking this one ignores how contemporary woke activism is born out of a deliberately parasitic approach to being the activist type understands that the current narratives are in some respect the vehicles of power and normativity this plays out in the analogy between the human body and the body politic and so like a virus can destabilize the human body so too the ideological parasite will destabilize the body politic so although one can always you know openly oppose the most powerful tool is by infecting structures and subverting power thereby acting in complete coherence with the revolutionary world view this parasitic relationship is not an accident but is the very pattern of how they think reality works and what they see as their place in the larger system normativity can only be subverted it can only be deconstructed i've discussed why postmodern thinkers think see themselves as social viruses and infections so i don't want to go into it too much here what i mostly want to look at is how there is also a secret solution within this pattern of storytelling we've noticed how the pattern of replacement has appeared in so many instances where the main characters represented as the normative ones are killed or humiliated inverted or replaced the strangest versions of this are those characters who happily see their place to others fitting in the intersectional world view so the strategy of those enacting these new story tropes is not so much for woke culture to give us new stories and characters but to deconstruct and ultimately take over existing cultural forms and stories from the inside if in religion we might not see a new religious figure but rather see christ represented as genderqueer in storytelling we will not necessarily see a new superhero but rather have lady thor replace a lazy fat self-wallowing thor just like any parasite this pattern of course cannot hold at least not for long just like any revolutionary approach to reality what do you do when you win what happens when all the superheroes and video game characters and science fiction franchises and even saints have been replaced by their woke selves when a parasite kills its host it can only move on to another house but when it has devoured all the hosts in its sight then it will itself die so parasitic patterns of storyteller storytelling must by their very nature reaffirm what they're attacking they need their host to survive for their story to make sense they know they can't win without being seen as the losers just like the progressive thinker accuses the conservative or nationalist of othering that is needing to identify outside outsiders and marginal identities in order to consolidate one's own identity through opposition to a dangerous outside the revolutionary thinker must perpetually self other this might seem like a paradox but saying the revolutionary must practice a form of self othering means that the revolutionary must repeat reenact recast almost ritually stories and tropes which he or she or the category they are allied with is marginalized and oppressed by a system of order and identity so they must be victims of an oppressive system it is in their very identity that this is so and there is even a reverse proportionality where the revolutionary voice becomes stronger as it is winning it accelerates perpetuates ad nauseum and almost hysterically stories of oppression and marginalization this was of course true of communist regimes where once the revolution has succeeded it never led to the dissolution of the state touted by marx but rather led to the need of positing a constant and powerful counter-revolution always invisibly present and ready to impose the old hierarchies so even as the revolutionary narrative is winning it will nonetheless always represent itself as the victim evergreen catches diversity checks but doesn't give a [ __ ] about blacks and so the paradox of holding the revolutionary position is that one must constantly re-posit and re-enact the old order in recent storytelling the most successful of the new franchises have been those who manifest this pattern of replacement within their own story so it's not just about showing an ideal world of diversity inclusivity and celebration of the margin one must first establish a somewhat normal body to then undermine it so the first part of a series the first movie will seem to establish a somewhat traditional pattern of storytelling but then when fans are attached to the characters the parasite is lit loose and the story is undermined the pattern is flipped upside down the main characters are humiliated and so we experience the reversal in real time this reversal is framed to act as a strange catharsis needed by woke adherents to participate in and also partly alleviate the original sin of woke religion this was the case with the recent controversy around the last of us part 2 video game in which the main character from the first game is beaten to death in early stages of the game but it was also what happened to the fans of westworld and it is the entire narrative arc of stranger things where an 80s boys club coming of age story is structured in a way to be overwhelmed and taken over by a powerful female character this could have been fine as a basic story but this same pattern is repeated in micro levels of each narrative ramping up towards the third season of stranger things when feminine characters had taken up most significant action and relationships of power one of the most important scenes in all of stranger things one which acts as a microcosm of the whole series is where we find the resolution of the arc of bad boy steve carrington presented as an insensitive but attractive and popular bully in the first season the character is humiliated as the bad guy should but he then goes through this own arc and to become a more mature character this buildup seems to be moving towards him giving attention and entering in a relationship with his coworker robin but this connection is upended by intersectional considerations tammy thompson's a girl steve another recent example i happen to stumble upon is nexflix's umbrella academy where the first season presents a story of a ragtag team of characters with positive and negative aspects and spoiler alert leads to the trope of someone destroying the world because of resentment yet the second season reduces all the male characters to bumbling idiots and indulges only the image of the pathetic father taking up the praise song of your press classes rising up to defeat the system of course the second season got much better reviews than the first and so it is dangerous to be comforted when we see some glimmer of traditional story tropes appear for what we should expect in the coming years are stories which establish a certain order in their opening stages only to then undermine that order once the story is on its way this will be repeated in an almost liturgical fashion as woke culture spread through society as we watch this accelerate the attentive person will have what some call a red pill moment and notice that the seeds of this were already planted long ago in many of the stories they once loved and so even as people cry for the subversive and revolutionary trope of woke ideas taking over star wars they will realize that the seed of this was in many respects an aspect of the story all along i bypassed the compressor of course the secret here and the reason why i am going through the trouble of explaining this is that there is also a silver lining in this for those storytellers who are attentive they need to recast the center as the enemy to defeat to do it over and over means that the space of the center is always open because identity is inevitable and because the stories that last are always those which manifest the pattern of the world there are ways to recast the central figure once the deconstruction is finished the margin needs the center to have something to rebel against and in that the smart ones on the margin will play a role in bringing it back there are a few examples of this in history the most infamous might be the decadent satanic author j.k hussmans in the end of the 19th century who wrote thinly veal veiled biographical novels about romping through degenerate satanist circles of early modern france only to pivot towards a conversion to catholicism and novels on the symbolism of christian cathedrals ending his life as a benedictine oblate there are also more modern versions in the mediocre film the libertine with johnny depp a despicable iconoclast and libertine rides his excesses to a point where his entire life is falling apart but ends his days converting to christianity and defending the king so for those watching the narratives the story trope to look for and to engage with is the story of the return of the king which of course happens at the end of lord of the rings but more traditionally is also the resolution of the robin hood story where an illegitimate and resentful king establishes a corrupt rule only to be chased out when the lion heart returns more recently this is also the resolution of the black panther movie where t'challa's cousin killmonger is presented as a resentful revolutionary who wants to use power to destroy the current social structures although one can have sympathy for his cause and the suffering he endured he must nonetheless die and make way for the legitimate ruler in the end so as we see the continual ramping up of propagandistic storytelling one must continue to pay attention to places where balance and in stories appears and to those who can remember that this is our time tell better stories it's up to us i know i will be trying so i hope this was useful
