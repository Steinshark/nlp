I think you can actually know the difference between someone who's had a true mystical experience and someone who's had a twisted mystical experience is that often the person who's had the twist mystical experience comes back from that experience and wants to destroy the world they're like I experience everything I experience like the mystical ineffable root of being and now nothing matters now all of this is trash like the whole world is just Maya like the whole world is just illusion and none of these things mattered all your religions all your communities all your things they're all nothing right if you listen to people sometimes you'll hear exactly that tone and to me it's like well I think you're on the wrong side of the bed because it's like if there is something ineffable behind phenomena then it is the source of phenomena so it should actually fill phenomena with this kind of unsaid but not destroyed like anyways I tend to always keep that in mind when I listen to people who talk about that [Music] this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] thank you so much for agreeing to do this um we've absolutely appreciate it and it's it's amazing that the Australian time to talk with us my pleasure so um we spoke with one of your colleagues the other week John vavaki and um so he expressed that he called you in a very high regard and um thinks he said to us your thinking is delicious um so one of the things that I really appreciate about brought to say the public discourses this idea this approach to religion and mythology is something that is symbolic and you're in as part of your symbolic World um I was wondering why do you think that that has been so effective as an approach to religion well I think one of the issues that people have dealt with let's say in the 19th 20th century is that because Many religious groups have tried to defend their faith based on let's say scientific methods or accepting scientific precept presupposition uh one of the one of the things it did is that it in some ways made Faith or religion arbitrary it's like we hear a bunch of things that you have to believe you know so you believe in the material world and all these weird and all these scientific causalities being the only type of structure you can describe and then on top of that you add something like so God came into the world and then died on a cross and now you went to heaven and your and if you believe I mean what are you talking about this is absolutely ridiculous thing to say if you if you just take on this like materialist type structure but if if you believe in that the world is actually that they depended on meaning and attention and that attention actually let's say at least participates in the way the world reveals itself to us and so it means then that the mechanisms of attention which which is something like stories images the way that we compress uh facts together into stories are part of the way or not just part but they are in some ways the source of how reality unfolds um and so then you can start to talk about narrative and about ritual and about images and it makes sense to people because you're coming at it from a different a different tack you're coming at it from the question of meaning which I think that if you talk to John viveki you've noticed that meaning is inevitable you can't you can't avoid relevant the question of relevance and you can't avoid the question of of Telos and purposes like we see things through these through purposes and through through relevance uh and so I think that in that frame then I can I can show how so one of the problems with this happened with religious thinkers is is that on the one hand you had religious thinkers that said something like you know let's say in the more uh conservative side you know the Bible doesn't mean anything it's just a description of things that happen so if you try to look for meaning in it it's almost as if you're destroying the factuality of it you're destroying the fact that it happened because we're scientists we believe the world is arbitrary we think things happen arbitrarily there is no pattern there there are no these deep patterns don't exist and on the other hand you had the same on this like let's say the opposite of it you had uh religious thinkers that said oh look at all these patterns none of this must have happened because all of these look like mythological stories they all they have Rhymes and their structure they have chiasms they have all these structures in them and so it's like because we believe the world manifests itself arbitrarily therefore all this is just a bunch of people stuff people made up a bunch of stories people made up and so what I'm trying to propose is saying no the world actually manifests itself through patterns and so there you have to have a pattern in order to even perceive the world and so the so the the things religion deal with are real they they deal actually with events that happen but they just don't describe them the way you would like them too they they describe them in a way that reveals their meaning as a way to say that and so so because of that I feel like I've been able to kind of bridge a little bit uh let's say Christian and secular worlds and I've helped more conservative Christians to realize and you can't the attack that they've been taking is is nonsense and I think I've helped secular people say oh okay this is what this stuff is about it's you know and and also you know all these things help you understand religious phenomena in different ways I don't know if that answers your your question it's a brilliant answer thank you very much and I'd invite anyone here to ask questions maybe if you could type them in the chat that'd be great um yeah just on this song when you talk about mythology one conversation you and I have is does it matter that all of it happened because that was the conversation didn't happen did not happen and now because of Donald Peterson Christian just got a good hold because of its talk about mythology and archetypes yeah it didn't matter that it actually happens so so I think that how can I say this I think that all religions are based on events you know and even when you just even when the ancient myth describe the God they're talking about events they're not talking about events at the same level that we're talking at right and so there are different levels of events and it's very simple like when I describe the tying of my shoe I'm not it's not the same level of event that if I say Rome fell it's like the the category of Rome fell is a is an extremely high event in terms of what it implies what it you know what it and then people could even you know argue about it because it's so big so imagine if you take that even bigger when they describe the gods I think they're describing events just very very high events or almost very abstract events the way maybe the best way to understand it uh but for sure let's say one of the things that happens in time and you see that in the Bible and you see that in the Old Testament in the New Testament is that there's a way in which people realize that there's a concretization of those patterns it's like these patterns actually happen in the world they're not just high high patterns that actually the the world that we live in is actually patterned in those same way so for sure in terms of Christianity I think that Christians I think to be a Christian you have to believe in the Incarnation and the the death and resurrection of Christ and that those are events that happen in the world now I've said many times they're not forensic descriptions and they're not trying to describe the causalities of what's Happening you know they're not trying to describe the nature of the resurrected body of Jesus you don't see any of that and they actually tried to obfuscate the capacity to to to to Simply see the resurrection as some kind of you know uh let's say forensic event that you could describe to a police officer because there's there's actually moments when the disciples don't recognize Jesus they they don't know what they're what they're looking at they don't know what's going on you know so there's a sense in which the Bible itself is saying yes the resurrection happened but don't try to box it in like don't try to to to give it a forensic description um but I think it's important to understand that because one of the the problems of wanting things to be symbolic or only symbolic or only mythological or only archetypal is that then you again have the same issue which is that you believe that the world doesn't actually exist in those archetypes that somehow the world can exist just neutrally and arbitrarily but I think what we're discovering more and more is that you're making your very perception your very capacity to perceive the world is imbibed in those mechanisms so your very capacity to link events together in order to see unity in multiplicity of events is necessarily archetypal so you could say something like there's nothing that happens which isn't to some degree archetypal or that if we don't if we're not able to see the archetypal aspect of what's happening it's it's a fault of ours and that something like the Saints you know the enlightened ones could see the pattern in everything right they could notice that the entire world is a theophany of these of these primordial patterns so I think that that's it's important it's it's an important distinction because I get a lot of that obviously because I talk about similar people they want to stay up in the symbols and they're interested in seeing the patterns uh but it's it's how it lands it's really important I think and that's what makes a difference in terms of a way to live and a way to to embody these patterns it's not just something we think about right it's not just something we read in books it's not just when we interpret movies it's that if a movie is it condensed you know very very compressed story of someone's love life let's say a love movie your your story of your love life will follow similar patterns right the difference between a story just that they compress it's like it's you take all the Salient facts you distill them into sale more Salient facts and then you compress them together so you take your love story of your life let's say and then you remove the bits where you're going to the the bathroom and where you're you know you're doing something else and you're working you like take out all the bits that don't relate to the to the pattern and then you just smash them together and that's why we have that's why when we watch movies where we we read books like let's say novels we have Revelations because it's like I'm connecting all these things much closer together and then it can reflect back on me but those patterns exist in your life that's why we care about them that's why we that's why we find them interesting is because they're reflecting something which exists in the world do you think the same thing is true with something like music um in the music is a layered sort of set of patterns and so I think this is something that Jordan Peterson talks about quite a lot and really sort of emphatically there's this idea that music sort of embodies this harmony that people should live in I think so I think so I think that for music it's harder to talk about um because music seems to be much more abstract in terms of the relations between the the say the the things that it posits and so the patterns are almost in some ways they're more they're more immediate because they're almost pure they're just basically so you have experiences of let's say you have experiences of of relationships between sounds that's what you're experiencing so there has to be a beginning there has to be an end and then there has to be some kind of movement you know of course a lot of contemporary um contemporary composers have tried to smash that or break that as much as possible but even in breaking it they're calling they're always calling back it's like I'm breaking this like I'm breaking this thing that is that will call and will create tension and opposites and and longing for resolution of the pattern and then you can tease someone with music by not resolving the pattern and then finally giving your resolution which is different from the the the the one you expected so there are there's all these things you can do to play with but I think that that's that's exactly what's going on in music uh so you have different Joys that you experience in music some of them are really more like a roundabout like a like around where you have one Melody that repeats and then you know what to expect and you kind of you it's almost like it can also become trance-like where you just keep repeating the same the same Melody over and over you you find uh also a comfort let's say lullabies all these things that that our parents used to sing to us or church songs or whatever things that find comfort then you have more let's say if you you have more complex pleasure that you can experience in terms of pattern where there is more like a novel right it's like I've set you up and then I think you think I'm going that way and then I take you this way and then oh finally I resolve it in a way that you think you didn't expect so yeah that that's what I but I'm not an expert on music but I think that's definitely true about music too brilliant I'd love to dive into some of your thoughts about Contemporary Art and music but before we do um Stephen Chan in the in the chat has asked some of what has been described reminds me of fractals with nature what is the relationship between archetypal patterns and fractals are they two of the same or is there some differentiation I think the best way to understand Somali patterns is fractals that's for sure um if people are interested in that my brother wrote a book called the language of creation which goes more into it in almost like a mathematical way but that is really the way to understand order and it what fractals do in terms of symbolism is that in some ways you basically have one pattern which is like one and many like that's that's the pattern it's like one in many and and usually it's almost like one and two so it's like Unity uh opposition and then resolution of opposition sometimes it can become more complex but usually that's just the basic pattern uh and it can be represented in all kinds of ways as a mountain as all these different these different types of patterns but the idea that it's fractal is very important which means that because you can experience the pattern at every level you can experience Unity to let's say it this way you can experience unity and Multiplicity at let's say let's take a the relationship between people and groups and things you can you can experience in within yourself we have a multiplicity of thoughts and and passions and and ideas but you're somehow able to notice that you're one person and then you can do that in a group in a family so it's like there's multiple people in the family but we recognize Unity within that family then you can scale that up into group into groups into churches or religious groups or cities Nations et cetera et cetera you can just keep scaling that up uh Until you realize it you you know the idea that for example the United States is one thing you know it's like why is it one thing it's like billions and billions of things but it's true through that fractal relationship uh and you know one of the things that modernism has done is that if I we do want to get into modernism is that modernism has tended to level the the fractal nature of things it tends to want to either re either stay in opposites you know kind of irreducible opposites often wants to reduce it into like a basic opposite where you don't have this this self-same fractal structure um and so because of that it tends to so a good example would be you know the way that traditional societies are usually set up or have this fractal nature right so a medieval village has the home with the Hearth and then those homes in the Hearth exist in neighborhoods with churches and then all those neighborhoods with churches exist in like a bigger city with the cathedral the cathedral is the highest building and then and then it it's like the center for the entire city and then now that reproduces itself all the way down and so what modernism tends to do is that it it like levels it doesn't tend to want to understand the the fractal nature and so it'll create things like suburbs like suburbs and and uh let's say shopping centers and then there's no centers and the houses become de-centered we don't even think about you know the manner in which the house the family would come together properly in a house it's just like living spaces basically that are just kind of level so modern modernity tends to do that it tends to move towards towards absolute uniformity and then also idiosyncratic multiplicity so if you look at most modern movements you'll notice that they tend to swing between those two extremes and so you can have something like let's say in painting you can have something like supremacism and expressionism happening at the same time you know you have these movements towards abstraction where we want to reduce you know if you think of malovich as painting for example you want to reduce everything to due to its absolute Essence like color field painting even all the way into the 70s or conceptual art and then you have you know uh absolute breakdown where it's like everything goes there are no rules it's just complete idiosyncrasy you know tape a banana to a wall and that's considered equal to any form of art um so so that's that's definitely what I think happens it I don't know modernism as much in in music uh so I sadly but I do see something about uh for example a tonal music in the 20th century that it has that tendency it's like it doesn't take it into account the fractal nature of of how we experience music and so you have this this like imposition of mathematical structures that are extremely complex onto a musical system that doesn't take into account the human desire for something like a like a simple round like a simple return or a simple cycle of of of of coherent experience and so you and so it's I don't think that modern music or Modern Art is um how can I say this that it's that it's stupid or that it's you know a lot of people have this idea that it's just anything goes no it's not true it's not anything goes it actually tends to be extremely like almost tyrannical in position of like systems of thinking onto the art and then you end up with with things that people actually or that very few people can enjoy because it's so high that it's it's almost impossible for it to land um beautiful um Tyree Roberts who can't beat here today and has asked um you've discussed before your view on contemporary art as an odd fetishization of the art object removed from any actual function could you say more about that one especially whether you think that contemporary music has arrived at a similar place as much crossover between these two worlds and I wonder if music might have also been removed too far from having a functional context I'd love to hear your thoughts on how music has evolved in their modern era and he says thank you so much for your work and best wishes no I I totally think that the same thing happened to music that happened to all the other Arts is that if you think about the medieval in the medieval world people struggle to understand this and they think that it's that it's actually like a diminishing of art but in the Medieval World poetry and music would always serve a function which is why for example poetry would be panageric if most poet you in the medieval times would be panageric would be something like celebrating something like celebrating a king celebrating a saint celebrating Christ and everything and we tend to think like that's lower but it's because it's actually because it was trying to serve a purpose in the world and music I think would have been the same that is most music would have been either uh let's say folk music in terms of dancing so it has a communal um a communal function it would have been composed for certain events for certain High figures like kings and and Nobles or whatever to celebrate certain accomplishments often related to poetry as well so let's say someone would compose a ballad to celebrate a great feat that would have that would have happened in a in a battle um and then you you can see of course that the highest version of that would be celebrating God and so the highest forms of Music would be used would be directed towards the church and directed towards a celebration of God and and I think that even as secular people I think it's probably possible to kind of understand why that is it's just saying we want the music to be integrated into everything else we don't want it to stand out as a just a strange like idiosyncratic thing but rather we wanted to integrate with other things and therefore it has to participate in the world and especially the church the church would have been a manner in which it participated in in in society at the highest level celebrating the highest thing but then also would have been in in relationship to the to the to the Poetry in relationship to the images as well um in the space let's say in a kind of Sacred Space so architecture music all these things would have come together into into a kind of Celebration so what we see with the modern music is first of all all already I think already with the Opera we have a problem which is that we have a problem because in some ways we're moving towards like let's say entertainment now there's nothing wrong with entertainment I I think entertainment's fine but I don't think that that's the highest part function that music can play but it's sadly that is pretty much now today with that it has been relegated to and I think that already starts at the moment at uh with a celebration of Opera as being supposedly the highest art and you see the same with dance it's like you know ballet becomes the highest dance well it's like yeah I don't know wouldn't the high stands be more integrated like folk dancing or or or Court dancing would have been more integrated into the world than ballet because ballet is just spectator and so I think that concert music already brings music into a space where it's going to it's going to reach high so it's like this is the thing when I talk about this separation of like absolute let's say a kind of tyranny and then a kind of idiosyncrasy so it's going to bring highs and so I totally agree that Bach and Mozart you know and maybe Beethoven are reach highs that liturgical music didn't uh because it kind of abstracts itself and it moves away from its its ground like the way that it's incarnated into the world but I think already when you get to Beethoven you're like in deep you're you're you're seeing the trouble like right out the door like you're just seeing the trouble coming uh and I think that that trouble starts to unravel rather quickly and so then you end up with composers that are so obscure in terms of popular capacity to listen like if nobody listens to they burn that doesn't study art like nobody listens to all these these these contemporary these modern uh composers uh and then and then what happens is the music that becomes popular becomes more and more let's say uh trite and more and more almost like all in the all in the hips right it just kind of moves down into the hips which was there in the Middle Ages like it would you know there was dance dance was part of it but there was something kind of holding it together but now he moves just into the hips and then it's like basically you know uh whatever electronic dance music is the is the the end of that it's like it's just a beat basically it's just a beat pop music it's just it's it's like it's just the same especially now these like new AI jet they sound like AI gender I think they've been working using AI for a while because you have these like Melody tropes and then you're listening to a song you're like what the hell like I just heard that you know and then they they people kind of they they pull out certain tropes from each other's songs and then all this song just end up sounding exactly the same it's pretty it's pretty it's very weird um so I think that that I think that the the Incarnation music has led both to its moving towards something completely obscure and that nobody cares about except for people that study music and then coming all the way down the one that's the most incarnated in some ways it was I think Jazz was the most incarnate because it had it did have because it stayed with dance I think it was still the the best the best of what the the modern world had to offer was was Jazz uh but even that gets like it's like yeah I don't know like I I think I like listening to Miles Davis but then I don't it's like I just like I was like what am I listening to they're like I can handle 10 minutes and then I'm then I'm done you know um just coming back to the question of liturgical music yes also texts where no compositions have been returned written yet for the Liturgy and as new composers are taking it all in this day and age uh what advice would you give to them to write for liturgy yeah it's rough because I'm not like I don't know I don't think I know enough about about music um I think one let's say hmm foreign I would say one of the one of the tropes that I see happening you know because in the Orthodox church right now there is a kind of renewal or desire to renew and I'm from the I'm from the Orthodox tradition so there is a there are some music musicians uh composers even in the United States benediction who actually was nominated for two Grammys his release his recent Vespers composition uh is an attempt to try to create something that is both fully liturgical in in the best sense but then also takes into account some of the modern some Modern development let's say puts it to the service of the Liturgy um without blowing it up right and so in some ways offering something also that is accessible to people uh I know big fashion let's say in the Orthodox church right now is to is that use Melodies it can be sung by the congregation because even in in the Catholic church and in the Orthodox Church as the modern world kind of became more and more present what happened is the music became more and more difficult and more you know more professional and so because of that it also at some point going to church became a show um so we have that now too on the other end which is like the Evangelical churches that just kind of keep they just like make up new songs every two weeks and then nobody knows them and then they they just like sing these songs and they're all they're all pretty much the same anyways in terms of like their Melody structures and stuff so I don't I that's I would say look at some of the people there Vladimir morozan is one of the people right now that I know in the Orthodox Church who's who's working on that um and then benediction those are the two in the U.S I think that are at least the most uh effective so I was thinking I haven't fully fleshed out this question in my head so I'm sorry if it's going to be confusing but a common theme of what your of your sort of criticism of modernity and also of recent artistic development where is a sort of disregard for meaning and for pattern right so no no well there's both there's actually like a hyper pattern you could say a pattern that is so that is so in that is so abstract that that it almost no one cares about it because a lot of the modern yeah and then there's the opposite then there is also like anything goes whatever you can do so both these scenes have seem to happen at the same time okay so what I was thinking was sometimes when let's say a person whose Outlook of the world may be a Christian uh that sees meaning and pattern in the world as something object objective that exists and that reveals the truth that is the independent of me um a conversation between this person and a person who is a complete relativist for example and doesn't believe in any meaning or any pattern um usually what I find when I have those conversation is uh the person that doesn't believe in any sort of pattern feels very much restrained when they when they are sort of pushed to believe in a pattern but if they don't they have to disregard for example human nature because human nature is a form of a pattern right yeah they're stuck you know it's yeah I totally agree I I agree with your with your sentiment that is that you can see it like in the modern in the modern uh world this desire to free ourselves from the pattern has led to things that are so abhorrent and absurd that you know for a good example would be you know uh let's say deconstructive deconstructive architecture in the 1980s and 90s and so you know Architects would create buildings with like just a massive hole in the living room it's like okay you know there actually are patterns you cannot live in a house that has like a 10-foot hole in the living room because it's just not not going to happen right so so it actually it's like it's as if some of the modern I think some of the experimental music in some ways it actually reveals the pattern and so it's like you can make an effort and listen to like uh it's a minimalist acoustic music and listen to you know someone like grading the site of a counter for an hour like you can do it it's not impossible to do it but it's like it's it actually reveals just how difficult it is to to get there and so and so we have for example like for someone who doesn't who doesn't think we have patterns like we have a certain frequency of sound that we're able to hear it's very simple we have a certain level of decibel of of volume that we're able or that we can sustain hearing that we're able to hear that we can sustain hearing those are patterns you just cannot you cannot avoid these patterns like you could you could destroy someone's hearing if you don't if you don't pay attention to these patterns and so and then there is a certain level of variation which people find Pleasant and those are probably um they're probably derived from the human voice they're probably derived from our thousands and thousands millions of years of hearing human intonation and hearing the space that exists in our in our intonations and so their derivations and probably concentrations and derivations of the the the the possible tonalities in the human voice and so I don't think I don't think like I don't see how even the most secular person could think that that's absurd it's like the these are just these are just kind of like natural you know and you could say something like you could say something like uh you know there are certain birds that make certain sounds and if the the male bird makes certain sounds to attract the female and if they're off they won't get they won't they won't reproduce themselves and I think that that's true about music like I think that there are certain there's there's a certain like you know I mean I don't mean I mean yeah of course there's a musician getting laid or whatever but that's not what I mean but I mean is that there's also like what I mean is that just that if if certain sounds don't continue let's say there's a there's a certain perseverance of of sonority and and distance between sounds then those will become one-off experiments and then they'll go away uh whereas some things will just continue the things that continue is because we like them and we care about them and we want to we want to kind of uh perpetuate them so so I think that even like from almost like a darwinian perspective you can argue for patterns basically what I think what I get from that is that we all live whether we believe in patterns and meaning or not we all live as if they exist we just can't escape Escape it so they exist and we live according to them um but in this sort of conversation that I was talking about uh the person that doesn't believe in them or or rather the person lives as if they exist but feels restricted when they have to accept the truth that comes with those with those meanings and those patterns so I wonder if you could talk about the relationship between or the the necessity the necessary relationship between truth and objectivity and these patterns and these meanings what's Pride and and I think it's like if you want to understand all the like the source of sin you could say you're right in the world that's what it is it's saying I don't they're like I I there are patterns that have authority over me and I don't care like either you just can't get away from it right you can't eat rocks you can't there are a bunch of things that you cannot do there are some patterns that have authority over you and you exist within that that uh that's the scope of those patterns so that exists both objectively in the natural world but it also exists in the human world like we have we necessarily have people that are authorities we have our parents that were that had to guide us we have different structures of authority um and so I think that I think that there's just a it's just Pride it's like it's that's why we see that as the root of sin it's like the idea of self-causation it's the idea that I can cause myself right I can completely contain myself I can be free from any type of constraint um and you know there was a moment I think like there was a moment maybe in the late 19th and early 20th century whereas people could credibly believe that um I really don't see how anybody can believe that anymore because one of the things that happens too which is hilarious because like in the early 20th century really I mean I can have sympathy for them like I have sympathy for the for the artist in the early 20th century they're like we've got this we're going to do this but then whatever happened between like let's say 1900 and and uh and maybe 1925 maybe I don't know in music but in art in visual art it's like then that set up a new way of doing that nobody has changed it's like experimental music or experimental art is no different now than it was in like 1920. it's like the Dada artist did everything anybody can do now it's like not explicitly everything but every idea that any any contemporary artist has you know installations or whatever or or breaking these rules or whatever art that that doesn't last long that that that uh you know that it's like all of this was this all this happened in 1920. and so what happened is like even the counter called for like even the people that wanted to like break all the patterns which rule over us created like a kind of weird anti-pattern that now people just follow it's like ridiculous and so you know it's like who's more conforming someone who goes to church or a punk rocker I'm not sure which one is more conforming like they both have uniforms they both they both you can recognize them you can you know it's just that one is like a kind of anti-pattern but it's still a pattern and so I think that's what happens it's like that's what happens with a lot of the with a lot of the Contemporary uh or the idea of not wanting a pattern is that what you end up is you create an anti-pattern which is still a pattern and you can recognize it right you can tell it's like yeah yeah you're just doing it upside down dude that's all you're doing because you turn something upside down doesn't mean that it's I can't still recognize it and still recognize it this this sentiment Echoes a lot of um some of the things we're talking about with Samuel Andrea who is another guest on John Gibson's podcast he was saying to us that as a professor of um composition and he in his students work you can't see any sort of innovation um something that's necessarily new compared to what's happened in say the last 50 or so years of contemporary classical music and he he says he said to us that he thinks that the um the contemporary music world and I wonder if this is true about the Contemporary Art world too is in a period of consolidation rather than Innovation and just on on top of that is there a way that we can get back to looking at something like Beauty as something that is objective you mentioned there's a sort of darwinian sense to that pattern is there something biological that we can ground Beauty in so that we can get back to this sort of sense of consolidating the Arts I think so I definitely think so and I think that there are certain I think that I think now we're in a good position in terms of beauty because we have people let's say people like Christopher Alexander for example or what we call the New urbanist Movement you know these are you know these are credible and so what they're saying is this fractal relationship these fractal relationships are necessary so if you can't make a building in any way there are actual there are actual forms that you inhabit a space so it's like if you inhabit a certain space you will be prone to do certain things in that space and you can't com you can't make a person a blank slate like if you if you if you have a dark Crypt like place you know it's not the same as a grand staircase going up and into a two-story building it's like these two things you're not going to be the same person in one space or the other and so design now I think the almost like a it's like almost like a scientific approach to design is bringing back the I think the idea of beauty and it's breaking down so if you think about house for example I'm sorry I'm just an architecture right now in my mind but do you think of Bauhaus for example in brutalist architecture you know they were thinking that they were going to be practical and and it was all going to be scientific and everything but it turns out they're not it turns out the imposition of like uniformity in the world actually kills the human Spirit like it really it really destroys living in in in Baja's buildings will destroy you and so right now I think that we're people are kind of waking up and think oh no actually these spaces like they they they relate to something that we exist in and so I think we're in a good place honestly in some ways uh I don't know in terms of music though but for sure I know that um it's going to start I think that the fact that it starts with architecture and City Planning is probably inevitable because that's the space in which we live and so if we can see the the if we can see movements like the new urbanist movement and these kind of these these uh rediscovery of neighborhoods rediscovery of City centers so there are several projects in the United States like that of very interesting projects then I think that we're going to slowly see other Arts follow and so in my own world that's a in the world of Church of iconography what what I'm seeing is that the top the top iconographers in America are actually issued from Contemporary Art they're actually issue issue from the academy right they're not just like improvised mom and pop people making making icons they're people who studied in New York studied in the big schools and then finally decided to move towards incarnate uh you know let's say art at the service to this at the service of the community um and so I think that I think that we're in a good position and people like like John viveki for example and his idea of relevance and these questions like these types of of uh of categories and you think of Ian mcgilchrist as well and his and his vision of how the brain works and how perception works all these thinkers I think are opening up the possibility of really saying so it's like beauty is not a is not one thing beauty is it's like a it's a pattern right and so there's a flexibility it's like a poem there's there's a form but there's also a kind of improvisation so that's how we that's what beauty always manifests itself as it's it's like there's a pattern and then there's an there's a spice like an improvisation part to it if we can find the the right balance between those two that's when we that's when we that's when we knock it out that's when we hit it so I just wanted to point out in in something like um the study of um remember what the name is to study of animal behavior um and basically there's this idea of fixed action patterns which are something that is sort of naturally selected for the animals um you know will inhabit if um how do you say because of their evolutionary history so for example like on on seagulls you have these little red dots on the beaks that the the the baby seagull packs to get the food out for the mother's mouth um I would expect something like Beauty as a pattern as you describe it in a darwinian sense to be something that's built into our biology is that is that um no you're right that it would it would deeply connect to the way that we're made and so that's why uh and I think I mean we have plenty of examples the old world is just full of examples just go to a medieval village in Europe just go just go to a very old city just walk around and then you'll understand what it is that's going on there's like a there's a clear pattern but it also there's also a kind of whimsiness through the pattern and also an adaptivity so it's like one of the things I think humans find beautiful is the the adaptation of the pattern to a particular is the best way to understand it it's like there it's not just a pattern and so it's like how does the church fit in that landscape like how do what's the relationship between the the between the the city hall and the church like if you go to London for example and you stand there and you see the Parliament and you see the church and it's like these relationships of build of things that we know what they are but how they're how they come together and how they're related and how how one is you know how you have this building next to the river and you have a bridge and so it's like I think that that's what that's what's beaut that's what beauty is it's like these this interrelation of patterns to their particular and so so yeah so that seems to be exactly how evolutionary I think that's how evolutionary selection works too right it's like if it's if it's properly adapted you know then it gets selected and then it gets and it gets it gets moved up and so and it's not like we it's not like we're going to reproduce London in another city but it's rather that we see how it's properly selected and that that very those relationships they kind of inhabit us in a way um it's a pleasure to have you with us um I have sort of a three-pot question um the sorry to bring us back to modernism uh my first part of the question is do you think modernism is inevitable um and the second part you sort of already touched on when you talked about beauty and you also talked a little bit more I feel on the criticism and detriments of modernism but I would like you to talk all about the what you think is productive uh about within it and the third part of the question is what do you think is coming next if we continue the way we're headed yeah they didn't get me in like apocalyptic mode here it's not great it's not good for you all right so yes I do think modernism is inevitable I think the best way to understand um it it's always there so the thing that's the problem is like it's a fractal pattern so what modernism is has always been there let's say but as a spice or as a as an excess or as a as a as a movement towards something which is a little too much so that's how I think that that's kind of how tradition works so if you so like I and it and there's been there's Cycles like that so for example if you listen to 13th century you know High music in France I mean it is CR it is wild it is wild it it's like the mathematical patterns are extremely complex you know there's like there's rhythmic they're like different rhythms and so and when you listen to it you know it's almost like it's so difficult to listen to because you have you have you have like text you have someone singing Melodies and then other people singing and there seems to be no relation but there's like this strange mathematical relationship between the different voices and it's like but then that it's like could so what I mean is that these things happen and then and at some point it it kind of let's say it breaks and then it feeds into a more a more embodied world and it's always kind of there there's there's gonna be a little bit of that experimentation I always kind of think of um you know if you look at uh Church architecture again like middle-aged Church architecture so you'd have the Saints and you'd have you know the Biblical images and then in the fringes and the margins then you'd have all the crazy stuff like you'd have you'd have like lewd images and you know monsters and things eating their own tails and and like just all this kind of there's kind of experimental space which was held in the margin and so the same with manuscripts for example so you had the main image in the center and then you had an experimental space in the Border where you would you could go you could go wild like do any do all whatever it is like you know knights fighting snails or scatological imagery all kinds of of stuff that is that is usually not explored in everyday life so I I think that what modernism did is it basically took that and just like put it out there it's like that's what the world is about now it's about it's kind of about the extremes um and so in some ways I do think that in big Cycles will will come to moments where these extremes will manifest themselves um so you know we saw that we saw the same happening in the late Roman Empire for example you know or like let's say the the the late Roman Republic and early Roman like at that transition there was some really wild things like there were mosaics that made um they would make mosaics of crumbs and so they they would make like a mosaic where it looked like somewhat had eaten the day before and had left crumbs on the table and like that was their decorative element uh and so they would they would have like images of yeah like decompose things and there was this this this experimental space that was opening up that was becoming really uh really intense um and I I think that you could even argue that ovid's metamorphosis is a very modern text you know uh and that's why Augustus hated it so much she's like it's like he hated of it he's like just talking about sex all the time and then talking about so it's like these moments have happened before you know so I think so so what is its use so one of the things that that it does is that it does it exposes the pattern in some ways because you could say that in a normal traditional world um things are just natural like people don't necessarily think about these these questions they just live them right it's like animals like animals don't ask themselves about the patterns that they that they inhabit but when things start to go awry and things kind of start to sh to go into extremes where you actually see extremely extremely like difficult uh obtuse patterns up here and then you kind of see idiosyncrasy down here you're like oh wait a minute like you can you can kind of see what's going on uh and I think that that scene can then be fed back into a more embodied world and so that sounds abstract what I'm saying but so I I do believe that I do believe that let's say the future will be an integration between embodied you know kind of Incarnate art with enough understanding about what modernism proposed to be able to integrate it in a way that doesn't call attention to itself completely and so a good example if you're interested there's a there's an iconographer his name is um father sillywan justiniano I think he's one of the best icon painters in America um he was an abstract post-modern kind of post-modern abstract painter in the 90s and you know he had all these Scholarships in New York he was he was doing great like he was he was on that on that um path and then he became a monk um so he began painting icons and what he's been doing is integrating let's say extremely um sophisticated color field Theory and let's say the principles that were developed by the abstract expressionists into his painting and so the way in which like in the 70s the theories about color like that they came up with were crazy about you know they went really deep into so they would make these pains that no one could ever care about right just a bunch of squares like a bunch of squares of color but it was the theory that went behind it was an extremely sophisticated understanding of color relationships and vibration and how colors affect each other and so it's like you can take that and put it back into something great you can think the same about literature it's like the modern writers if you think of Beckett or you think of Joyce you know they're they're they're deep understanding for example of both like pattern and abstraction and and also of idiosyncrasy at the same time like that kind of relationship that extreme relationship they're able to to create can feedback I think into into the modern world so if you want a good example of that I don't know if you know there's there's a author's name is Paul kingsnorth and and he does that like he he writes something like Beckett meets Toki I mean it's crazy he wrote a novel called Beast it's like it's an astounding novel but he he actually grammatically he actually trans he actually changes the grammar of the words as he's so his character as he's losing his mind like the gramat the the grammar of the the sentences starts to break down in the story so he uses modern tropes of actually playing with grammar and playing with punctuation and this is like really avant-garde stuff but he's ultimately telling a story that follows the the the the mythological pattern so um so I think there are ways to do it I don't know in music I'm afraid I don't know enough about music that'll be you guys people point to arvo Parrot a bit like I know people point to arvo Parrot as a possible solution to the conundrum as someone who is integrating you know avant-garde into a more kind of embodied and and uh and celebratory uh music so oh someone's racing yeah uh yeah uh do you believe that uh the art form or music is uh created or it's rather discovered so if there is I've seen it as an objective Beauty uh that uh I suppose it's uh derived from natural uh patterns so that uh we just would you say that it's a more closely to be like discovered like as if you were like I don't know as of um yeah yeah I know I understand exactly what you mean um and then and then uh yeah uh then we say the contemporary music uh because it disregards for um the PC and the natural um patterns is as such more closely to be creative because it's more of a random chance yeah yeah um so I would say I would say to your fur the first part of your question I would say that it's both I know that's boring as an answer it's like I'm not going to answer but I I think that anybody I think that anybody who has an an intuition um a real intuition feels like they are not it's not doesn't come from them like if you like when that happens usually you're on the right track at least in my in my case like when I have an intuition and I feel like that intuition isn't from me that like you said I feel like I'm it's like falling into me or right it's like I I'm being I'm being assaulted by the idea you know it's like you it's like it just seizes you and then I think most of the time you feel like you're discovering at least I do um but then there then there's also the implementation and I think that in the implementation then you have more of this kind of giving birth or this this forming and the shaping right because usually what you have um as an Insight doesn't have body at least I don't know about you guys I'm not a musician like I'm talking about my own experiences so usually what comes to me is inside doesn't have body it's like almost like a yeah it almost is like a like a relationship right a pattern a relationship and then and then when I put it into the world then there's a shaping that comes so I think that that would be the way that I would at least uh I would I would you know um describe it let's say you know so an example like I've been I've been just for a while now I've been wanting to like rewrite Fairy Tales um and so and I the way that I want to do it is I want to get to the fairy tale like I want so for example like I don't understand Jack and the Beanstalk I never understood Jack and the Beanstalk since I was a kid I was like what is this story about like why is this the hero he's he's like he's stealing from the giant like what why so why why like what is happening in the story and so it's like I've basically just been that question has just been in my mind for 20 years I mean not more you know 35 years or whatever 40 years um and so but recently I'm like no I wanna I need I need this like I want to write a version of Jack and the Beanstalk so I just let that there and then I don't know how it works I don't know how it works at some point you know I'm sitting there I'm like and all of a sudden it just like it's like a lightning bolt right just strike through and you're like oh I get it I know what that's about like I don't know what that story is about uh but then I have to write it like I haven't written it yet you know um so in terms of contemporary music like your second part of your answer I think it I think then again I think that this is what I see about contemporary music is that I see that some contemporary music is actually hyper patterned like it's it's not it isn't idiosyncratic some of it is like I'm gonna have this pattern and I'm gonna like I'm gonna shove it down your throat like I'm gonna just like make you listen to it you know even though it's unbearable but it's like here's my idea I have this idea and it's like this idea that I'm just gonna like like just force into the world almost and so I think there's a lot of that in Contemporary Art in general and and I think contemporary music especially and then then but then there's also the other exactly what you said there's also the other part which is just like this kind of like noise where you know like oh like yeah I dropped this whatever like I hit the side of the bowl and it's like so you have these you have this sense of like idiosyncratic sound as well so that's what I see in both and so I I do I think that I think there can be an excess of both I really see the modern world as something like a move to into excess and if we if we try to understand it too much as one side which is moving towards any secrecy and if we try to understand it too much it's kind of authoritarian uh patterns that are imposed then we we miss one part of it but if we if we see it just as like a radicalization of the two sides which is like which one which is the internet is the internet the most the freest most chaotic space to ever existed or is the internet the most authoritarian space that has ever been thought of by man it's like it's just both at the same time I don't know exactly how that is but it's just both at the same time uh so the thing uh like uh a sin of a contemporary music is that it's too much of a following that's right of course too much fun do you think it is I think that it's I think I really do think that it depends on the music I think that it's it's a so you think about this think about two sins right think about one sin and both of them have to do with pride right the first sin is saying I don't want to submit to any rules you know I'm my own person nobody's gonna tell me what to do right that's the first sin the other sin is oh I'm gonna make this happen I don't care if the whole world resists me like if all reality resists this thing that I want to do I'm gonna do it and there's nothing you can do to stop me it's like you can see they're both they both come from the same the same uh Source but one one manifests itself as an authoritarian desire to impose a pattern on something that can't hold it or doesn't want to or or you know will just get crushed by it and the other one is refusing all natural patterns and wanting to move away so I think that it's just both at the same time I just want to ask uh about you as a Christmas iconography and an artist I know correct me if I'm wrong I understand in Orthodox tradition icons even in the Catholic tradition icons are seen as a window into heaven and each uh you know symbol of the hanoid color is seen as a very theological expression and any changing or innovation of that could be even seen as heresy so how do you as an artist uh kind of break those boundaries so you know express yourself and how do you move forward with that Earth yeah so I think that some of what you said I think has been vastly uh like exaggerated in terms of in terms of just how strict it is and I think and I and I understand why you know it's like I think that I think that some people who uh felt like most Contemporary Art which is anything goes and that you know there was no there were no rule Rhyme or Reason and no no meaning then look back at Medieval art and thought wow these things have pattern these things are meaning these things have have a sense and then they just want to hold on to that but the reality of traditional iconography is that it is extremely uh variable there's a lot of variation variation in Styles variation in in tropes now it's not an absolute variation there are there are uh limits and there are troves there are patterns that you have to follow in order for it to be recognized by the community in which you're trying that you're trying to serve and so that's probably the best way to understand it it's almost like you could understand it like um you know English has certain grammatical rules and if I if I don't use those grammatical rules then people won't recognize that it's English and so if I make an image and I'm like well you know I want Jesus to have a pumpkin head well I'm sorry to tell you that no one will recognize that as Jesus and therefore it will be seen as heresy and so so it's so there's a so there is a way in which we recognize something as belonging to the tradition uh but you'd be surprised to what extent there's variation um and I think that the way that I see it is that Innovation is neither good nor bad Innovation is a neutral thing innovation has to serve a purpose and when Innovation serves a purpose usually the strange thing that happens is people recognize it people recognize it as being traditional having been traditional the whole time they they have us they have the feeling that that they've seen it before but they haven't so it's like I've created images which absolutely never existed before in the church but I've never had anybody complain because let's say the spirit in which I did it the reason for which I've done it was was in order to with love towards the community it's like I don't want my purpose isn't to like show you that I'm the like you know call attention to myself show you that that I'm better than you that I'm smarter that I you know I thought of this new thing that I want to kind of shove into your face it's like no I want I want to serve this community I want to participate uh and so a good example would be so for example in the Orthodox should we have an image of the of the Resurrection so we have an image of Christ going into death and saving Adam and Eve right it's like it's a you see you see Christ like holding Adam and Eve he's like pulling them out of death and so and so then we also have the image of of the crucifixion of a cross and so at some point I started making crosses that had that image on it and and I had never seen that ever and I don't think that actually exists but no one ever said anything it was totally fine and so priests started wearing crosses with this image on it and like no priest in the history of the world had ever worn a priest with that image on it but it was totally fine because it's like I'm not I'm not putting a cat there but I'm not putting Justin Bieber I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm doing something which is like it's like a it's like a poetic reformulation of something you already participate in right it's like it's like oh wow yeah an image of of of of the descent into death on the cross like maybe they don't even think it they just see it and it's like yeah that makes sense so I think there's a lot of that where it's a lot of the problem that modern religious artists had is that it doesn't it acts out of the sense of Genius Like the sense of of trying to keep up with the times like it's not acting with the desire to to integrate and to make something participate in the community but if you do that you'd be surprised at what you can do you can actually do quite a bit I think I think it was Isaac Newton who um always carried a Bible as a nafis is his arm or something like just like this idea of like constant serving his genius to something higher than him Magnus in the chat asks a mystical question he says do you experience something under the symbolic layer something ineffable numerous and hard to Define but something which can be experienced in the body in moments of silence and death and the transformed and so I I yes I do I do believe in that and so I think the best way to understand that is that is the source of the actually the symbolic patterns so you can understand that let's say at the core is something like a that they had transcended transcended something something which actually cannot be described something that cannot be said something that cannot be expressed and you can access that you can have access you can have access to those experiences where you all of a sudden feel transported into that space um but then what happens is that when it expresses itself so as soon as it expresses itself when you when you talk about it when you when it comes back down into your art or when it comes back down into the world that's it actually will inhabit this this kind of symbolic World um and so yeah so I I I do think so um and I think that you can actually I think you can actually uh know the difference between someone who's had a true mystical experience and someone who's had a somewhere or a Twisted mystical experience is that often that when the person who's had the twistical mystical experiences comes back from that experience and wants to destroy the world like they they're like I experienced that everything I experienced like the mystical you know you know ineffable root of being and now nothing matters now all of this is trash like the whole world is just Maya like the whole world is just illusion and and none of these none of these things mattered all your religions all your communities all your things they're all nothing right so there is you see it like you can you if you if you if you listen to people sometimes you'll hear exactly that tone and to me it's like well I think you're on the wrong side of the bed because like if that if there is something ineffable behind phenomena then it is the source of phenomena so it should actually fill phenomena with this kind of unsaid but not destroy it like anyways so that I I tend to I tend to always keep that in mind when I listen to people who talk about that um I'd love to get your thoughts on um psychedelics we talked yesterday um yesterday we talked with um Carl Rook who's one of the authors of the um road to eluses and one of the experts on the Palestinian Mysteries we were talking to him about the difference between um so in terms of old states of consciousness sort of mystical experience in this kind of thing we were saying we were comparing say playing a musical instrument to sort of achieve an altered state of consummate Consciousness requires a level of skill dedication discipline practice this kind of thing but taking a psychedelic is is very easy and it does something to you which people come back and say that was a mystical experience um do you think that um there is a fundamental difference between something like um how would you say genuine religious illumination or a mystical experience and and the kind of experience that people describe coming back from psychedelic chances yes I do think so I think very much so um I I do think that it's like for all the love of the people that I that I mean that I exchange with today it's like it's like everybody's talking about psychedelics it just everybody talks about it and uh and I feel like I feel like it's misplaced and I feel like it's dangerous um so so a good a good example the LCD ellucinian mystery is actually a good example of this very problem which is that let's say the ellucinian Mysteries had a psychedelic in their ritual right and so people tend to think that that's true and they tend to think they have proof of that if the Dallas Indian Mysteries had a psychedelic the Ellis cinemistry lasted I think was it three days three days of rituals and fasting and attention and maybe like sleeplessness and whatever it is that they did it like a whole huge like ritual that lasted days and also lasted a millennia in time and so if at the end of that to like tip them over whatever they took some kind of substance like now why the hell is everybody just talking about that substance now now that's all people care about it's like what's the formula what's the chemical formula like what's the what's the chemical right because because exactly that like we just we're just that we we we're we're I mean we're materialists and we're lit we think that that's that that's what Transcendence is it's like you know and so I've seen so but I'm not saying it's completely I've never taken psychedelics right so uh but I have met people that have taken psychedelics and it transformed their life for the better to be honest I admit them I've also met psychedelic people who've taken psychedelics and that it turned them into psychos like just turn them into complete cycles and they lost their they lost their family they lost their jobs they became they've just lost it uh and so like whatever psychedelics are if they rip the veil away or whatever I think that like you said I think that the discipline of practice whether it's prayer where whether it is music whether it is uh you know dance whether it's all these different things is is far more integrated and far more useful for your life than just having like a tourist experience in the in the Transcendent it's like here I am you know some tourists walking and walking through this world of spirits I don't know just to me like it just sounds very dangerous also because I have met people that have just completely lost their lives because of the because of them well thank you very much um Winnie did you have a question yeah I did um I will backtrack our conversation a little bit so um uh earlier when we were talking about modernism and also when you were talking about Innovation you sort of brought up twice in different ways you you sort of talked about this concept of having something new whether it's caused by extreme Visions or where it's caused by um I like just fresh ideas um and then sort of uh finding that is more traditional and compatible with it and then um sort of marrying those two um as sort of the middle ground um how do you identify what is compatible with what is there some sort of identifiable law or pattern behind that uh yeah I think there are um there are there are in the sense of they are in the sense of the practicality you know I think that's one of the reasons why I talked about this idea of like embodiment in a community and so that is usually part of it it's a I think the one of the I mean I it's not easy because it's like the the opportunities to create embodied works of art right now are very are very you know far in between it's not like something that we that we can do it's not like a lot of people get commissioned to like write you know a piece of music to celebrate the anniversary of something or whatever like it's it's difficult for that that to happen but like usually that would have been part of the the the meat of the of the art right part of the the consistency of it would have been its integration into its purpose so like what is its purpose so like let's say I write a piece of music for a dance is not the same that if I write a piece of music as a national anthem right if I write a piece of music in a church you know it's not the same as if I write a lullaby for a child like those actually can are recognized by people as participating in their world so it's like it's not a it's there's a part of it which is objective which I think has an objective pattern and so it's like lullabies usually aren't fast and fast tempo they they're slow and you know they have a kind of a way to to modulate sound that that is appropriate to the to their to their use but then there's also just the historical reality of what you live in right the world in which you live has certain traditions of of sonority certain traditions of space certain traditions of images that you just kind of you just kind of continue and you you you participate in now in terms of an actual pattern usually the pattern is is like uh you know it you can understand it like a wave you can understand it like uh like a circumambulation right so you you start at the center you move out and then you return to the center not exactly the center maybe another point which is similar to it that tends to be the pattern of pretty much everything all stories tend to have that pattern um you know uh images have that pattern in in space so they have a central focus and then they'll have a an edge or a margin and then that edge of margin has characteristics and the central Focus has characteristics um and so that's the way that I would see it in terms of music I it I don't know like I said the technical aspect of it enough but usually that's the way that's the the pattern you can impress it different ways it can be a mountain like a coming up or coming down the mountain it can be like I said it can just be this like a like a serpent moving around an axis so it's like a a pattern that cycles and returns it changes a bit and cycles and returns and changes a bit so a mix of recognizability and difference right so if you have enough of that like I mean I think Bach is the best for that like a few is fugue is like almost like the perfect vision of that right it's like he's he gives you something he States it and then he's like let me play with this and he plays and he plays and at some point you're like where where is this going I don't even know what's going on anymore it's like oh and then all of a sudden you're like wait a minute no no I see it I see it it's here it's coming it's coming and then all of a sudden it comes not exactly maybe even the way you wanted to and it's like that's that's like probably in terms of the way I would understand like in terms of Music one of the best versions of that pattern just uh coincidentally next door someone's playing the piano um they're playing a mystical piece by screaming and it just made me think of um some things we haven't wrote in his diary because he was very interested in this sort of um similar to you talk about like the the Orthodox the theory this idea of like sort of becoming sort of united with god um but squealand writes in his diary uh I am God um this is this is something that I think um could potentially be a problem with this sort of new understanding of religion as a sort of symbolic language that people will try and like we were talking earlier about like the modernist like they try and create the music instead of Discover it um in this way with religion people are sort of I worry that people will start to create um religions out of this sort of symbolic um substrate um do you think do you worry about the same thing and how how do you how how do you just on top of that like how do you then defend a religious belief without it being attached to something like a Dogma yeah um I mean I see it happening it's happening now it's happening all the time like the religious is crashing back into our world you know with speeds that are hard to that are hard to deal with uh and it's happening in ways that are very um that are kind of chaotic and kind of messy so you know we saw during covid kovid was an acceleration like an accelerant of religious patterns I mean it was nuts in terms of watching you know taboos get set up and then you know scapegoating and then also George Floyd during during the the the um during covet it was crazy it was like it was a religious event I mean it was circumambulation and and uh and like you know kind of EX ecstatic Union after fasting so think about it like people had been like isolated in their houses for months and then someone gets sacrificed and then all of a sudden it's like it's like it's always like dionysian in terms of of what was going on during George Floyd and so we're seeing it happen all around and it's it's kind of uh you know it's scattered and it's messy and so I think that it's that we are definitely in danger of seeing because religious patterns you know it's like religious patterns are super dangerous like they're so dangerous so like most Dogma like dogma and rules and taboos like you know thought out taboos and rituals are there in some way to mediate the religious in the world because it tends to burn like a fire right if it comes through it's not it it can leave you know if you if you read the Baka the Baka you can see what religious patterns do if people kind of let themselves go to that inebriation you know it leads to uh asparagus right it leads to ripping a part of the world um and so I do think that we're definitely in danger of seeing that um happen and we have I think covet was really an example where we could kind of see a glimpse of what was possible in terms of a religiosity in a in a secular kind of uh technological World um and so I do think that I do think that document Dogma is a is actually a good thing to a certain extent like if Dogma is if Dogma is is understood in its proper place right and so you know for example in Orthodox Christianity we have we have a Creed we have a statement of faith we have things that we believe and we also understand that it's apophatic which is that these are not positive statements they are in some ways protective statements or negative statements to avoid us from becoming crazy but ultimately the Transcendent is beyond that so God is beyond like it's like you know I can I could I'd say I believe definitely believe in the Holy Trinity but I could also say God is not a father or a son or a spirit like that is not heretical at all like because we know that these are kind of negative statements to help us understand so I do I do think that Dogma in religion is is inevitable and necessary because without it it leads to like like new age insanity but it leads to it leads to like Crystal like just you know Cults and and gurus and like you know like neo-tantric ins like Madness that we've seen happen in the past you know you know 10 20 years uh which leads to really I mean it really destroys people like I know people that have been destroyed by new tantrism like really like psychologically messed up so I think a lot of the so I do think that dog was important because or else or else we're we're in trouble so sorry I I hope we're not disappointing you guys too much with that  I come from a very religious country from Sri Lanka and uh the biggest religion is Buddhism and there there's giantia and Islam um but there was always a respect for each other's religion but as I came to England especially to University it could be because I lived in such a religious country I saw so many um forms of religion in University in the secular form meaning or here's a belief for example gender is a spectrum you have to believe it if not you will be you know it works in the old days of the heretic and this there's a big it was on the levels or you need oh I see even there's this kind of negative uh view on white male as if the white male is the worst thing to exist and all opportunities are given based on you know sex or based on color and not anymore unmarried so I feel yes it wasn't a conversation I wasn't expecting coming to the west but in the west how do you think we can have just more conversation between uh different beliefs and just more respect for different beliefs yeah it's hard I mean because the the religion let's say the the the ascendant religion you know right now uh I would say there are different versions but that the the woke kind of ascended religion is definitely one like it's definitely one it's it's part of it's part of it because it has a it has a kind of a Zeal right and right it has that that that oh like fundamentalist Zeal where you can't question there's something you can't say like if you if you if you ask even just ask questions about certain things like there's a there's a kind of you know fire Divine fire that just like rushes out of people and so I think I think we're definitely in that in that world now it's really a problem because you know all religions will exclude like all religions will have dark skeletons in their closet but the the the way religions are set up is not arbitrary and so they actually have there's a reason why they're set up the way they are and so for example if you take I mean I'm a Christian so obviously I understand Christianity better you know the the notion of the the of of Christ for example the notion of the crucifixion right is in some ways a way to safeguard against the things we're hap we're seeing now which is that it's like I I see myself as the one who crucified Christ for example right I see myself I see in the one that is beaten and rejected and and refused I see in them an image of God um and then I try not to to do that let's say but now we have this it's like a weird the the modern one it's like almost like a weird parody of Christianity where you know Christianity has always had a deep compassion for victims and a deep desire to love the the oppressed and the marginalized but now it's like we it's like being weaponized where it's like let's flip it upside down we're now the marginalized in the oppressed you know have the right to demand of the of other people this have the right to let's say exclude uh the the the the the others and so we we're returning to more of like an ancient like religion and Purity like a almost like a like a yeah you know you know in the in the uh in the Jew in the Jewish temple for example in the Hebrew Temple you know strangers weren't allowed in to the temple at all like they weren't allowed to come in and so it's like we're returning to that type of of behavior so um yeah hopefully I mean we all hope that it'll just kind of play it'll play out without too much violence I guess is the because in some ways it it can't I don't think it can sustain itself that type of thinking at on the long term but uh yeah and it's a we're in a strange situation that's for sure but actually the solution I think though the solution and this this has been the solution that I've been pruning is to help people understand the function of the margin and the exception and the strange and so you know I talk about monsters a lot I talk about margins and I talk about idiosyncrasy and it's like you know or talk about Carnival in a lot of my talks about with the function of Carnival in the traditional Society so it's I think that because what happens is that the right or the the conservatives or whatever the people reacting to this woke thing I mean they just go full on too and so so you just create these two these two opposites that just can't talk to each other it's it's horrible uh and I think the best way would be to help people to understand the role of of the strange but then also understand that it's strange for a reason it's like you know the margins are marginal and the marginal has a function in the world and that function has positive and negative aspects to it and it's like if you want the positive aspects of the margin you kind of have to live with the negative aspects of the margin if you want the positive aspects of the center you have to live with the negative aspects of them so you can't have it all like you just can't you can't be a margin and a tyrant at the same time that doesn't that that leads to Absolute Madness so we need we need to find the I think the proper balance so um just as a Orthodox Christian you're saying Dogma has its place do you think then that right action or orthopraxy requires Orthodoxy I think so I mean I think they go together for sure um because you know the the especially in Orthodoxy in other types of Christianity maybe not so much like in Orthodoxy it really is the Liturgy you know and so so for example like we sing the Creed during liturgy we don't just abstractly think it we sing it together and so as we sing it together we're manifesting our unity and so that's actually moving us towards communion that's why you know in the the the the Creed for example it's place in the Liturgy is moving now because there's the first part of the Liturgy uh which is which used to be for kind of everybody and then there's the second part of the Liturgy which used to be just for the people that are baptized and so the second part of the Liturgy is like this like compression moving towards the meal where we all share the same you know the same uh sacred meal and uh and I think that we have to understand that the Orthodoxy and the the orthopraxy they just they just go like that because it's a celebration of what we have in common both in practice you know and in love of one another but also in mind to a certain extent and then kind of moving towards the the communion childhood so yeah I think you need both um um what is your opinion on the current movement of uh spirituality without religion do you think those two things are separable no I don't think I don't think they're separable and the and the reason why is you know we talked about this fractal pattern you know we talked about how these these the patterns of the world they kind of exist at different scales and one of the problems with the like spiritual but not religious is that the spiritual but not religious person says I don't want this spiritual pattern to bind me to others I just want it to be my own individual thing and so the only way for it to bind you to others is through common something that's how you're bound to others you're bound to others through common action through common attention through common singing through common movement and so that's religion I don't know what to tell you and so if we stand together if we sing together if we if we process together if we bow together if we do the things that we do together then the spiritual is not just binding me as an individual but it's binding me to my family and my family to a larger communion etc etc and so and so the the spiritual but not religious is just another version of of modernism because it it doesn't like the fractal relationship it wants to reduce to the individual it's like I want to be I want to be an individual in relationship to the Transcendent complete transcendent right and see that uh that extreme that I mentioned it's like I want like the absolute Transcendent like you know uh non-being of Nirvana and I just wanted me I don't want it to buy me to others like I just want it to be me and so and so I I don't think I don't think I mean it's better like I I'd prefer spiritual but not religious to I don't know to someone who goes dancing at the club every day like you know it's like I prefer someone who who who who who has spiritual practice even if if there's if they're idiosyncratic and personal rather than someone who drinks you know gin all night like it you know it's like there's a hierarchy of things but I do believe that that that true spirituality will have religion attached to it because it's a it's a binding agent in a way it's the the same answer as you you gave before it it comes from Pride isn't it uh spiritual religion in a way is like wanting to keep the meaning without accepting the truth and without having to submit to Authority a lot of it's that too it's like well I don't want to submit to any Authority I just want to have my own experiences and you know it's like I want to have my my own thing but that's just not how the world works you know what happens actually it's and I know it sounds weird it's like what happens is the opposite it's like you're gonna end up submitting to authorities that have never existed before we're going to end up submitting to levels of authority that have never existed in the history of the world like we're moving towards like weird authoritarian systems that are that are going to be total and it's like it goes together like the extreme you know I always say it's like a punk rocker can only exist in in a world that is ex completely buffered and completely controlled and completely maintained on a schedule because if you put a punk rocker in the Amazonian jungle like they'll die in one day two days because they're not bound like so you need these extreme systems of like control and so if you if you if you try to move towards idiosyncrasy and you're like I just want me my spiritual thing my own thing like I'm just gonna take a hodgepodge do whatever I want it's like you're creating that Rift and what's gonna and it's it's actually it's going up too it's gonna it's gonna create yeah systems of control I know it sounds weird it sounds like it's a contradiction but if you look if you think about modernism that way it actually will solve a lot of problems for why modernism happened the way it did because that's what it looks like is necessary relationship with the Transcendent how and do we avoid the Dark Side of Dogma I mean Saints I don't know what to tell you it's like I mean you need developing your own life instead of focusing on others like I think that's probably the best it's like it's like loving others and then you know seeing sin in myself I mean that's for sure like I'm talking way more from a Christian perspective I'm sorry but it's like I think that from a Christian perspective uh you know there's a joke about how there's a joke about how you know Protestants think that you know no one's going to heaven except for me right or except for my game and there's a joke in Orthodoxy which is that everybody's going to heaven except me that's that's probably the best approach right is to see your own sin and to to to to to to always focus on your own on your own lack and then and then and then you probably will be able to avoid the problems of Dogma if you do that right can I just uh sorry it just like with the last thing you just said then so then how do you avoid the psychological problems with that what do you mean just I guess the association like everyone is going about it's mostly a mental immense state where you're just trying to not see yourself as higher than others you know and so we we obviously you also yeah you wouldn't if in that state you're self-flagellating then that's Pride too by the way it's like self-flagellation is pride you know most people that are like because you think you think you're so important Frank you think you're that important that you should flog yourself uh but I think that just the this this sense of like attending to your own thoughts and attending to your own uh and not thinking that you should be better than you are because a lot of the psychological problems that we have is that we think that we should be better than we are so it's not that it's not that that it's not that we actually think we're wretched is that is that we think we're wretched but we think we should be awesome like we should be heroes but we notice we're actually wretched uh I think that that's the problem but it but if you just kind of see your own sins and you're like okay I mean from a Christian perspective you just see your own sin you're like yeah you know just give it up like I don't know like when we confess our sins in Orthodoxy we confess our sins like it's like we're sinning constantly so we always say for all the sins all the sins you know that known and unknown like all my I don't even know that I'm sinning like I'm just sinning all the time and so if you're in that state where it's like you actually think that you're just sinning constantly so much that you don't even know how much you're sinning it's like and you know it's like are you is there even room to sell flashlights you know it's like you just that's how it's how it is and so all you do is you kind of just give up and you just you know yeah so I hope that I hope that but it's like by the way I don't do that because I'm not a saint I've got a lot of Pride don't worry like I'm not I hope you know I'm a hypocrite like that's for sure I just hope that's clear thank you oh no it was I guess it's a question to both of you because you seem to be in agreement uh you you were saying you were talking about the problems of Dogma or the Dark Side of dogma and I wonder if you could elaborate on what this is no but the Dark Side of Dark Minds that he gives you an insight to judge other people that's what it is it's like it's like as soon as you you you have something which binds you and it's not just Dogma it's the problem of any Unity so as soon as you have something that binds you together as soon as you have any group anything that you see in that you see that you have in common with others and binds you that immediately creates an outside there's no way around it you can't you can't have it all right it's like I know that a lot of the like weird post-modern moves to just try to integrate everything into everything but that doesn't work it destroys the world so so so you could say so you could see it in in all kinds of things right if you think of a sports team right you you if a sports team will have things that bind them together and then they will have adversaries that are outside them that they're fighting and so that's part of any type of unity now the problem with religion is that it does that too it does it in the absolute because it's like I have I have access to God through this and so now it gives me Ultimate Weapon to like to judge other people if I if I let myself go to that so that's the danger of Dogma uh and I think I mean I do think that I think that we have the tools you know I know for I think for sure within Christianity we have the tools to fight that and I think part of the nature of Christianity is is to avoid that problem in in the image of Christ himself in The Sermon on the Mount and all these these aspects but that's definitely an issue and you know if you'll catch yourself doing it all the time thank you so I think it's come up a lot tonight that pride is kind of sort of behind a lot of the sources of many problems exactly so what's so what's your antidote to Pride I mean I think I just formulated it right I think it's it's to to try to see your own lacks first right to try to see what what you're missing yourself and so practicing humility in the sense that you know if you see like a an easy an easy trick to do and it's like when I'm in my best moments I can do this but it's not often but like usually you catch yourself thinking something right you know you know you look at someone and you catch yourself kind of judging them or you know whatever or even if you're in relationship you can't just you know you judge your your partner uh and I think it's like the discipline of right away asking yourself like could I say the same thing about me right and so it's like you know someone lies and you're like yeah they're lying it's like yeah do I lie yeah okay yeah okay so it's like I'm not saying that this that say the thing that's happening to me or the stuff let's say someone's doing something to you it's like it doesn't justify it it doesn't mean you'll justify it but it's like it's like if I've been crappy to others right you know if I lost my temper if I so it's like so just kind of remembering yourself in a way so that so that you so then it what it does is it kind of mediates I think the issue now I'm not saying you should it doesn't mean you should accept everything I don't think so unless you're really like a monk or something but it I think that it just the discipline of always asking yourself what aspect of what bothers me because often the worst part of it is that sometimes when something bothers you with someone it's usually because you've got a little seat of that yourself right and so it's like oh that person's really cocky it's like really why are you noticing that you know like you might have a little bit of that yourself and that's why you're noticing it uh and so yeah so I I would say that that's probably the best the best way to go about that I think Jonathan gave a solution here early as well as he was talking about sitting and catching yourself sitting all the time and then you know when you see your you know sitting all the time just kind of give up and that's also surrendering to your higher power is also a big advantages not quite making sense to me is that this at the end of the day still sounds psychologically detrimental because it's still referrals like self-referential um like in in all the examples that you have given so maybe I could maybe I could I could uh I could take the same thing that I said but now flip it the up the other way which is that what if what if every time you you come in the morning and then there's someone who's impatient or there's someone who's annoying or whatever then maybe try to notice something about them that that that is positive do it that way do it do it the other way if you don't like the like the seed on yourself like just try to remember that that person is a human being that has a life and experiences and that you know that that so if it's hard for you to say to see how you're the same in terms of the negative part you can maybe rather try to see the mirror no the mirror of the good in the other person um I mean there's I'm not saying that it's it's always possible but but I would say that that might be uh uh yeah a better maybe another way to do something similar that would be also kind of humility just one thing that uh Peter graved I'm sure you do maybe you've talked to him personally I don't know uh but Peter Graves really uh showed in an interview or a book I don't remember humility is an arrow that points outwards whereas pride is an arrow that points inwards and so I think it's in this sense that the over judging ourselves and over criticizing in this posture of I'm so bad I'm it's really me me me me yeah so put it very simply humility is whatever points outwards and yeah this one [Music] I remember hearing the Dalai Lama actually say that someone asked him about about um people who are are shy and he said it's Pride it's like it's fried because you're too self-conscious you're thinking about yourself way too much I do it's like you think you're so important that people are looking at you like you think people are like concerned with you and your presentation and all these things and like that's what makes you shy it's interesting I mean I don't know if it's if it's it's completely true but I just thought it interesting that he totally like switched it in terms of the way we think of it now um yeah I mentioned that because like when you meant when you mentioned the prize and then answered those and initiative facility isn't there reminded me of uh there's a cartoon called The Avatar of The Last Airbender and there was a quote in there like with a high roll basically saying uh and paraphrasing um pride is not the opposite of shame but it Source uh the only true humility is the only antidote to break yeah I think something could be on YouTube for that as well because true beauty is always taking you out of yourself isn't it and and what you are saying earlier about organism is that is Inward and not pointing to something outward yeah yeah well there's a definitely an aspect of of modernism that's like a kind of radical yeah you know a radical subjectivity you know and so it's like you go to a museum and some artist has their whole thing like they just have you know they probably wrote books and books about the thing they're doing and then you walk up to it and it's just I don't know it's like strands of hair hanging from the ceiling right and and it's like and it's like yeah this person spent like 20 years working on this project and it's like and then it's like why so really I should care like I should care enough about your little idiosyncratic world to like dive in and like discover all the references that you're like I'm sorry I just don't have the energy for it and also like really are you gonna subject me to that like your own little like your own little idiosyncratic world I don't know I'm not interested it points outwards like to me that sounds a lot like compassion right in a sense like everything should sort of yeah there you go it's good um and and for us as musicians then do you think that how how do we I guess be compassionate performance are we in service to our audiences is that compassion I would hope so I mean I think that you have to be careful like when you say service your audience of course you there's like a there's a balance I think there's a balance because also you're trying to like let's say you you make a piece of art so on the one hand you are trying to to let's say reach out to have compassion for your audience but there's also a way in which you're also trying to kind of take them by the hand and and kind of pull them into something there's so there's a there is both there's like both you know you you can find I think a nice middle ground because it you know I think that modern pop composition is like it's like it's like the worst of trying to please the audience because they're just like you know what can I get people to click on and then you know it's it's just like things songs appear and then vanish you know within within a few months but it has to do with that problem of like trying to like really hit what people want right now you know and just kind of give them what they want uh but I think that that true art is not that is not like that like there's a there's a yeah there's a balance between let's say kind of teasing how can I say this it's all it's I mean you think of think about it really like a meal right it's like so I I'm I I will I'm offering something of sustenance to the person but then I will have Spice in it in order to make it attractive and make it taste good but there also has to be like substance to it you know so so element of you inputting part of yourself um is well that's going to happen inevitably I tend to think people shouldn't put too much effort into that like I mean that's like the opposite of of contemporary thinking it's mostly in service of something I hope like in service of something higher right in service of some so it's like for example if you if you say I mean I'm just thinking out loud here because I it's difficult for music now like I said to but if you let's say like I want to bring I want to bring joy to people like I want or I want to I want people to experience longing like I want that them to kind of move into that experience of longing and have a sense of that and so it's like you're serving a higher purpose you're like trying to you're basically like training people to have these experiences and these subtle experiences um and so and so you want to do it in a way that they'll recognize what you're doing that they're seeing that that you're they see the breadcrumbs right or they can get the little breadcrumbs as they're moving into what you're doing and then once they're there then you can kind of take them on a trip I just want you to know I need I have a meeting at three so I have like about you know yeah I just wanted to say just on top of what we were just talking about which is such a beautiful part of the conversation it echoed very closely what we were talking about with John viveki which was this idea that love is the opposite of addiction and so I was this idea of Pride being something that's Inward and humility but using this outward John viveki was saying that addiction um is something that is reciprocally narrowing and narrowing it sort of like thing where your framing comes increasingly closer and closer but the opposite of that is reciprocal opening um and he calls that what love is and I think that's a beautiful line of agreement with with you and and John yeah definitely I think for on that case we really agree I I really recently I've been using Dante a lot as an image of that and I think that for art it's probably a good image to understand let's say what Dante was trying to do in the Comedia which is exactly that would it has to do with your question about so you could understand that let's say I I make a piece of art and I do it in service of a higher good right you know in the celebration of God the celebration of of Love or the celebration of something beautiful beautiful um but then I understand that like that people don't have access to that and so what I do is I engage lower lungs right in order to draw people in to this higher this higher celebration and so you know so then you can use let's say you can almost like seduce people into the experience so you use tropes that people recognize or you surprise them or you do different things but their purpose is actually just to draw them up into something something more and you see in Dante you see that because it's something like he starts with poetry right he starts with Virgil it's like Virgil is that's that lower love these structure these artistic patterns that we use in order to create our work right that's what Virgil is that's what Virgil represents and so it's like the craft the the you know the techniques all these things that we have there's nothing wrong with them you know especially we have to think about that especially in the modern world because people have seen these techniques and these this craft as being factitious as being like tricks and things that you shouldn't use because you know they're cliche or whatever but if they're in service of a higher good then all of a sudden they find their purpose and so you you you can use these these techniques in order to draw people into higher loves and so you know Dante moves from Virgil to Beatrice which is a woman that that a lot that awoke love in him when he was a young person then he moves up towards uh towards Saints ultimately towards towards God himself and so it's like these embedded loves it's a good way to understand it but you can also understand that in in art which is that this is because I I remember a friend of mine who's a contemporary painter that I love very much at some point he he was basically saying like why are you doing this like the icon thing like why are you doing this stuff it's all it's all done it's all been done right it's all these these these tricks and and tropes and images that have all been done and it's like I can do it because I'm I'm making an image for someone's baptism but I can do it because I'm making an image to go into a church like I have a reason that that's an actual reason like that this object will enter into a community will participate in the life of it of a church of a family or whatever and so and so the lower loves these lower aspects these techniques the the the the way the lines work or the way you know using a Halo and all these things are in service of a higher participation and so there's no shame in using them right I'm not um I'm not pretending that they are that they are uh that they are new or Innovative or whatever it doesn't matter beautiful I think that would be a really lovely place to end and especially because you've got something coming up but thank you so much it's been an amazing chat thank you thank you [Applause]
