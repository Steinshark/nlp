one of singapore's iconic tourist destinations is the marina bay go there to see the stunning marina bay sands casino ogo the merlion shop expensive goodies and more i've done all that and it is a blast but something most tourists are probably not aware of as they snap selfies with the casino in the background is that they are standing at the edges of singapore's 15th and largest freshwater reservoir in this video we're going to look at how that came to be how the singaporean government damned the entire marina bay and how their experience might inform other countries trying to beef up their water supply but first i want to talk to you a little bit about the agenometry newsletter the newsletter is a fine companion to the asian armature video catalog i know that there's a lot of videos so that is why i write the newsletters check them out for the full scripts as well as additional commentary for after the fact you can find a link to the newsletter in the video description below or you can just go to asianometry.com you can expect a new newsletter every thursday at 1 am taiwan time much thanks the marina bay is located in singapore's central area and has been styled to be its new downtown this central area has been around since singapore's earliest years and used to host wet markets and bazaars alike starting in 1969 the government embarked on clearing out the space and adding 360 hectares of waterfront land they intended to create a venue for staging international water events and celebrations on top of this prime waterfront land the government began adding hotels business offices and convention areas the vision would be that it would serve as a 24 7 live work play area water flows into the bay from upstream rivers like the singapore river the gaelang river and the kalang river the extensive land reclamation redirected the river's flow so that they no longer empty directly into the ocean but instead into the bay in a previous video i went into detail about singapore's 50-year march towards water independence part of that strategy involved the expansion of local catchments for the country to store its fresh water of course being a small island opportunities to build such reservoirs are limited in 1987 minister mentor lee kuan yew had a proposal for the marina bay in 20 years it is possible that there could be breakthroughs in technology both anti-pollution and filtration then we can dam up or put a barrage at the mouth of the marina the neck that joins the sea and we will have a huge freshwater lake in order to do this the country had to first barricade the entire marina bay to keep the fresh water from flowing into the south chinese sea once that dam is complete then the bay can slowly be transitioned from a body of salt water to fresh water singapore is subject to large torrential rains that water tends to come fast and unpredictably because all the rivers now flow into the marina bay a dam would rapidly need to open up to release storm water into the open ocean to prevent water from flooding into the surrounding low-lying area minister mentor lee's vision would be accomplished with the 250 million singapore dollar marina barrage project the barrage spans the entire marina channel roughly 350 meters wide construction began in 2005 and was completed in two phases over three years the dam is made up of multiple components first is the barrage itself it has nine crest gates and a six meter wide pedestrian bridge on top of it each of the gates are nearly 100 feet or 29.75 meters wide individually they weigh nearly 70 tons or almost as much as your mom the other components help the dam do its job there is a drainage pumping station a lift for taking boats in and out to sea a hydroelectric power plant and of course a visitor center with a green roof at the time of their installation the pumps in the pumping station were the biggest in the world each capable of emptying an entire olympic size swimming pool in a minute they are to engage to remove storm water during high tide the first phase began with the construction of a coffer dam and four of the nine gates a cofferdam is a watertight enclosure built onto the seafloor that allows for construction under the waterline the marine barrage cofferdam is itself a pretty cool achievement double walled and 40 feet or 12 meters wide the inside is filled with sand the barrage itself was built on top of a foundation of 850 board piles each pile is 4 feet or 1.5 meters long and went up to 240 feet or 74 meters deep the coffer dam itself had to have sheet piles drilled a hundred feet or 31 meters deep into the bedrock installing the gates was pretty impressive each of the 70 ton gates have to be lifted from a crane barge floating outside the coffer dam into position between the dam piers the precision of the placement has to be accurate to just two millimeters as phase one completed a 100 meter section of that channel was left open for storm water and ships to pass through upon completion the coffer dam was removed and the gates left in an open position the second phase saw a second coffer dam for the completion of the last five gates as well as the installation of the pedestrian bridges nine segments on top of the barrage one of the world's biggest cranes had to be commissioned to lift and carry the bridge's segments into place with the barrages completion in 2008 the reservoir was separated from the ocean but held a mix of salt and fresh water the reservoir needed to be desalinized this process happened naturally over a span of 15 months as rain water flowed into the bay and salty water was flushed out into the ocean the marina bay today provides up to 10 percent of singapore's water supply thus far it has accomplished many of the goals the government had in mind for it but it is worth noting some of the consequences and concerns associated with barricading marina bay the first has to do with the cleanliness of the water a lot of reservoirs are located far away from population centers for a good reason humans are dirty disgusting creatures the marina bay is singapore's biggest reservoir and the only one located right in a downtown urban area it is inevitable that trash and waste will wash right into the reservoir the singapore government asserts that the reservoir's water is cleaned daily water samples and analyses though found perfluorochemicals in the reservoir sediments and waters these chemicals are used to make coatings resistant to oil heat or grease the long-term health consequences of being exposed to these chemicals in high levels are unclear the second major concern has to do with the environment as an estuary zone where salt and fresh water meet the marina has provided a home for several animal species fish traps set up during the dam's construction found 138 fish species from 57 families only 25 of them can survive in fresh water without access to the sea another 17 can survive but require access to the sea for breeding of course i'm not saying that we should forego the freshwater benefits of singapore's largest reservoir solely for the sake of a fish the trade-off in singapore is pretty cut and dry but for other countries around the world with different environmental wildlife and fishing conditions it is something to think about not every reservoir has to be built out of a massive towering dam in a gorge hong kong's plover cove and singapore's marina bay demonstrate the possibility of making coastal reservoirs by barricading estuaries and coastlines as other countries find themselves more water challenged due to the effects of global climate change locations for traditional leak-style reservoirs are few and far between for countries finding themselves in such situations it might be prudent to look at coastal reservoirs has an alternative structure the marina barrage is a tourist attraction a valuable piece of infrastructure and an engineering marvel i hope to be able to visit it one day alright thanks for watching that's a short one for now if you want more content you can like and subscribe to the channel i would like it if you did and remember to check out the patreon if you want to support the work or watch any of the early access videos including some that i will not release want to send me an email drop me a line at john asian arbitrary dot com i love getting letters from viewers until next time i'll see you guys later
