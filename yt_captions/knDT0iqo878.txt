from 1960 to 1973 the Soviet Union launched 15 probes and orbiters to Mars locked in competition with the United States the Soviets struggled to match NASA's incredibly successful Martian program they lost the race to fly by Mars they lost the race to orbit Mars and they lost the race to safely land on and clearly photograph the Martian surface the Soviets won Venus there is no doubt of that but they lost Mars in this video we're going to look at the Soviet missions to Mars but first I want to remind you about the newsletter I do try to keep it up to date with new things that I've been hearing the full write-up for videos that you haven't seen before and so on the sign up link is in the video description below I try to put one out every week maybe two all right back to the show it is 1950 and Stalin wants a missile that can hit his enemies in the West so he turns to Sergey korolev born in Ukraine Corolla started off with gliders but later moved into Rockets this put him in a unique position to reverse engineer German V2 rocket designs during the 1940s eventually corollev delivers the R7 missile for successfully fired in 1957 after Stalin's passing the great Leader's death also loosened the political climate allowing korolev to pursue his dream a dream of space early on in the Rocket's development he said to his young Engineers the purpose of this rocket is to get there this is not some military toy and he pointed his finger at the ceiling at the Moon Venus and Mars in January 1956 after much lobbying the public Bureau finally allowed the development of an artificial satellite called object d this radio-equipped sphere is better known as Sputnik after three failed launches they managed to put the satellite into orbit on October 4th 1957. the Soviet Union had no idea the kind of hubbub their little satellite would set off Soviet media regularly reported on their space exploration progress but few in the west seem to have believed it then suddenly the thing was up there in the sky passing over their heads the New York Times used headline font size has not yet seen since Pearl Harbor American political Elites pondered over their failure and sought to catch up Soviet political Elite basked in the unexpected success from sputnik's launch and so Corolla and his team sought to capitalize on it on January 1958 they sent a letter to the Central Committee proposing an expedition to the Moon a few months later in July 1958 a second letter expanding on that to create a vast new program it would begin by sending robot spacecraft to Mars and Venus upgrading the R7 to being a three-stage rocket for the necessary power after that the program would develop a four-stage R7 rocket with enough power to send people to the Moon Venus and Mars the final step would be to establish colonies on these planets the Soviet space program spent the majority of its resources in 1958 and 1959 on their lunar probes however their real Target were the planets Venus was the closest planet but Mars was the real prize the goal here would be to take advantage of an orbital window that occurred roughly every 25 months for Mars originally set for 1958 it soon slipped to 1960. a decision more easily made after the Soviets learned that the Americans also pushed back the launch of their Venus probe Mariner 2 to 1962. we knew nothing about space travel back then just theories robots would have to fly over 100 million miles of interplanetary space to get to Mars even within the orbital window the sojourn would take seven months interplanetary travel also required far higher speeds 11 kilometers per second rather than seven kilometers per second thus the need for additional stages for the R7 rocket to reach such speeds the spacecraft needed to launch safely this was not guaranteed at all there was also a political aspect to the launch we were in the space race after all in January 1960 Khrushchev told korolev that he was concerned about the growing American Space Program he wanted a launch to Mars and Venus within the 1960 window a month later Corolla Drew up a plan to Mars project 1M scheduled to launch by September 1960. the two 1M spacecraft were about 2 meters long one meter wide and weighed about 640 kilograms they would be launched with a new more powerful four-stage R7 rocket the 8K 78 rocket or mulnia in February 1960 this rocket only existed on paper corolla's team would have to build this fourth stage from scratch they rushed everything in order to make the Autumn lunch date it was a dumpster fire the factories produced everything wrong and the probes arrived in pieces forcing the team to take everything apart in order to repair them on September 27th the ideal launch date the Landers radio system didn't work right with the television cameras and failed to pass ground tests the probes carried a radiometer charged particle detector and a spectro reflective meter for detecting life they originally wanted an UltraViolet spectrograph television system and an infrared spectrometer too they had to dump those due to integration issues a member of the team said with typical dark humor forget about that radio unit and all the Mars problems the first time we won't fly any farther than Siberia he was right the crash effort to build rocket and probe was too much too fast it was literally the first time they ever fired the monia for real launched in October 10 1960 the first rocket suffered heavy vibrations during the second stage burn causing it to break up over Eastern Siberia don't you hate it when you're right the second probe never made it into space either the Rocket's third stage failed to trigger about 290 seconds into the launch due to a frozen kerosene leak and it broke up in the atmosphere supposedly Khrushchev had brought models of the Mars craft along with him to United Nations as a bragging gift for U.S President Eisenhower since they failed the models were never given critically both the 1M launches failed before they even got to try their newly built fourth stages it bowed ill for future flights a few weeks later tragedy struck a prototype launch for an r-16 missile went horribly wrong a short circuit in the test missile caused the second stage engines to fire detonating its first stage tanks the explosion incinerated an unknown number of technicians working near the rocket at the time the missiles designer and program head m.i nadellan was also killed they never found his body just as melted golden star and a wristwatch the horrific tragedy is named after him a few months later corolla's team launched to Venus apparel craft similar to the 1M probes the 1vs the first 1V Venus probe entered Earth's orbit but awkwardly could not leave it the second successfully entered Venus's orbit though no data was sent back and was thus eventually named Venera one launched in February 12 1961 Venera 1 was Humanity's first true interplanetary spacecraft but kurolev had no time to rest he plunged into the 2mv project Landers and flyby probes for Venus and Mars Soviet scientists were struggling to get the Molina rocket working reliably the Rocket's lower stages suffered from manufacturing issues furthermore there was its critical fourth stage it launches while the rocket is in zero gravity whilst orbiting around the earth Engineers struggled with forcing free floating fuel particles into their tanks for ignition it wasn't just the Soviets who struggled with their rocket the Americans did too between February 1961 and September 1962 seven straight probes failed to reach Venus two of them were American the Soviet space program built six two MV probes three of which were for the next Mars launch window in autumn 1962. these big probes weighed about 900 kilograms and measured about 3.3 meters long and one meter in diameter They Carried some of the largest cameras yet as well as instruments for detecting life though some were removed to accommodate the Rocket's fourth stage the first of the 2mv series 2mv 4 number one or Sputnik 22 in the west launched in October 24 1962 during the very midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis corolla's Deputy Boris chertok recalls I was at baikonur readying a spacecraft for a launch to Mars suddenly Colonel Anatoli kirilov Deputy Chief of the baikonur test range told me to get the launch vehicle off the pad so that they could replace it with an ICBM that there was some kind of National Emergency crisis at the time the baikonur Spaceport located in what is now Kazakhstan had just two launch pads so military icbms and civilian Rockets had to share talk says all of the phone links were being used by the military so I couldn't get through to Corolla who was at his home in Moscow ill with a cold I told kiriliov how difficult it would be to remove the Mars vehicle that there was a limited window for the launch he said he'd get court-martialed if I didn't move the Mars vehicle away There Were Soldiers with machine guns all around quote in case of attack by U.S paratroopers end quote we were told so we all went to corolla's house I remember that we ate a watermelon and thought we might be waiting for a U.S thermonuclear strike eventually the crisis was resolved and the Mars probe launch went ahead but sadly to MV4 number one failed in Earth's orbit due to an issue again with that Troublesome fourth stage launch looking back at it it was kind of nuts that they launched the rocket considering the geopolitical situation a warning station in Wyoming initially picked up the Rockets debris fragments has a swarm of nuclear missiles but fortunately this was quickly dismissed the Soviets did not give the mission a name until it succeeded in some capacity so when Mars 1 was launched on November 1st 1962 it was originally referred to as just 2 MV number four or Sputnik 23. things started good at first the probe separated from the Rocket's fourth stage and then unfurled its solar panels however one of the gas engines in the orientation system started leaking Ground Control managed to spin the spacecraft around and stabilize it for a while but finally on March 21st 1963 a few months before its arrival to Mars the orientation link with Earth broke and they lost contact the silent Pro might have taken photographs of the red planet but it had no way of sending them back to Earth perhaps transmitting the data vainly into Eternal space nevertheless the probe did enough to earn the name Mars One troubled by the engineering failures in the 2mv series the Soviets tried new improvements for their next Generation products the zon series but those probes turned out to be just as Troublesome two were sent to Venus but only one of those two named zon1 made it to space and it too suffered equipment failures at the end of November 1964 the Soviets launched Zone 2 which was intended for Mars but it also suffered fatal onboard failures a month into its trip one of the solar panels failed to unfurl due to a cord break stinging failure was then worsened by the news that the Americans had made it to Mars Mariner 4 had launched just about the same time as zon 2 but unlike the Soviet probe the little probe flew by the red planet in July 1965 sending back 22 incredible photographs covering about one percent of the Mars surface the Mars and the Mariner four photographs was a cold and dead World much like the moon there were no canals no magnetic field and the atmosphere was very thin we earthlings have long dreamed of sophisticated Martian life those dreams were drastically downgraded somewhat dampening enthusiasm for future missions to Mars at this point the Soviets realized that the Americans were very serious about sending a man to the Moon in August 1964 the post Bureau told korolev and his teams to do the same entering into direct competition with the U.S a race to the moon was probably unavoidable however it threw the Soviet space program's plans out the window resulting in managerial chaos the consistent failures of the early 1960s and the race to the moon meant changes had to be made corolla's number one goal was now to send a man to the Moon he no longer had the bandwidth to send robots to the moon and the planets so in March 1965 that was reassigned to a new firm Lovato famously he told the team I hand over to you the most valuable possession my dream I expect you to work hard but if my faith is not rewarded I'll do has Terrace Bulba once said I gave you life and I will take your life the Tara's Bulba mention refers to a 19th century novel written by Google the main character Terrace Boba kills his son for betraying the country Corolla passed away less than a year later in January 1966. the circumstances of his death are somewhat unclear A botched operation or a serious untreated tumor but he received the country's greatest funeral since Stalin and his death was profoundly felt in the Soviet space program Mariner IV had changed everything the new team at lavachkin decided that the first generation of marscraft had fundamental flaws the teams at the previous agency okb won were spread too thin so the same issues kept happening and no significant progress towards Mars was made the Soviet Mars team realized that would not be enough to Simply replicate Mariner IV they wanted to surpass the Americans by Soft Landing a probe on the Mars surface and produce groundbreaking science by looking for microorganisms there in October 1965 the Soviet program leadership decided to reboot the whole program this decision meant that the Soviets would miss the Lex launch window to Mars in October 1967. but time was short the Americans were pushing forward with more flybys orbiters and Landers in the early 1970s so if the Soviets wanted to do something first then something had to get up into space by 1969. the new project was called m69 nice the two m69 probes ditched the old 3mv Zone designs this was partly to get a fresh start and partly because Mariner 4 had shown the Martian atmosphere to be too thin for the Lander design to work I should note that the Venera program ongoing throughout this sequence of events continued on with the 3mv designs the Soviet Mars program quite literally received a boost from their new rocket the UR 500 or proton originally developed as a super large ICBM the rocket allowed the Soviets to send four to five metric tons of stuff on an interplanetary trajectory the original m69 plan sought a Mars Orbiter and Lander to study the Mars atmosphere achieve soft Landings and search for microorganisms but the team had so little time to work with before the launch window they first tried to adapt a previous lunar design the year 8 bolting the Lander to the probe side however there were several fundamental issues with the propulsion system calculating the center of the balance as the probe consumed fuel became challenging the membranes did not seal correctly causing leaks and so on thusly in February 1968 the Mars team engineering head Georgie babakin made the risky decision to scrap the current design and redo the whole thing just 13 months before the launch date it took balls but it was the right move to make the team Drew up a new cleaner design centered on a single spherical tank at the system center at the Tank's base and engine at its top a big antenna a pair of solar panels and instrumentation packages were attached to each side Mar 69 carried three color cameras with various sized lenses and it was also the first Soviet planetary device with an on-board computer the original plan wanted to include an entry probe and a Lander attached to the system's top but the engineers had trouble getting the prototype to work within the timeline they ultimately took it off due to weight and Landing test issues m69 certainly suffer from weight issues the new design ballooned to 4850 kilograms or over 5 tons most of this was fuel but lacking Advanced semiconductor technology it was hard to shrink the instruments on top of all that the mission plan an extremely complicated launch a three-stage proton rocket would take the probes into Earth orbit and then separate after orbiting the earth once a fourth stage would fire taking the probe into space then after all that the m69 probe would fire its own propulsion engine to take it on its merry little way that engine would need to fire two more times during the journey in order to adjust its trajectory such a wild sequence had never been attempted before and accordingly it involved a great deal of risk the Lovato team worked under immense stress the Communist Party of the Soviet made it absolutely clear that the 1969 launch date had to be met issuing a special military-industrial resolution to back it failing such a resolution had unpleasant consequences as things went along the Central Committee got increasingly concerned about hitting the deadline and demanded weekly updates if someone missed the deadline their managers were called in to explain themselves underperforming suppliers and individuals were put on a blacklist divisions worked Around the Clock teams often sent out cars in the middle of the night to pick up Specialists from their beds for troubleshooting folding beds were installed in the office and the cafeteria was made to open 24 hours a day providing free meals none of these workers receive overtime pay for their Blood Sweat and Tears they were considered to be working out of their own enthusiasm for the nation tragically all this work was ultimately in vain the first Mar 69 probe m69a launched on March 27 1969. 438 seconds into the launch a rotor failure and a pump inside the Rocket's third stage caused the whole thing to explode the poor probe's wreckage was scattered all over the altea mountains in Central Asia the second probe m69b launched on April 2nd 1969 and it too failed due to a rocket failure the right engine on its first stage failed right at launch tilting the rocket in the wrong direction the whole thing fell back to the ground and exploded spewing toxic materials all over the launch pad area the contamination was so bad that top military and civilian leadership had to be called in to be briefed on the incident the sad conclusion was that nothing could be done except wait for the rains to wash the stuff away imagine what happened to the mountain environments with probe a proton Rocket's High rate of Rapid unscheduled disassemblies continue to take the lives of Soviet space robots into a major overhaul the following year dramatically improved performance the mass of political pressure levied onto the program by the Soviet leadership had come back to haunt them yet another failure in the Soviet missions to Mars it was exactly the wrong way to run a space program the bitter taste of defeat was made even harder to Bear when the Americans triumphantly landed on the moon with Apollo 11 in the summer of that year July 1969. and then NASA follows that up a week later with the marvelous Mariner 6 and 7 missions the two probes Flew Over The Martian South Pole and equator took hundreds of photos and then studied its atmosphere disappointed the Soviet program turned its eye towards the next Mars launch window in 1971. unfortunately m69's failure meant that the engineers lacked atmospheric data necessary for achieving a soft landing on the Martian surface and 1971 would be a special year in Earth Martian relations a brief time every 15 to 17 years when the two planets get very close to one another an ideal time to send something so the Soviet program managers face two options should they try to redo the m69 mission to get the necessary atmospheric data but in this scenario they wouldn't launch the Soviet Martian Lander until the subsequent window in 1973 and due to the greater distance that would take an extra rocket or should they take advantage of this special year and send the lenders now but what about the data it was finally decided to send three probes the first would be an Orbiter the Orbiter called Mars 71s with the S meaning Sputnik or Orbiter would be launched as early as possible it would not carry a Lander like its siblings but rather 800 kilograms more fuel so that it can get to Mars as fast as possible m71s would launch and arrive at Mars first so to take the necessary measurements of the planet's atmosphere then two Landers called m71p with P meeting possatka or Lander would arrive later and use that data to calculate the correct entry trajectory to soft land their entry probes sticking that Landing in the thin Martian atmosphere onto an unknown Landing ground would be the hardest part at the time the Americans were designing the entry system for the Viking landing craft they chose a controlled gliding type entry what is that by shifting around the Lander's center of gravity at a specific angle to the incoming airflow you can generate g-forces to stabilize the ship earlier and lengthen its breaking path this in turn means that you can deploy the parachute earlier and higher up which gives you greater control over The Descent you can gently Glide down like a leaf on the wind or something the Americans can do this thanks to detailed knowledge of the atmospheric conditions gleaned from their previous Mars missions which didn't blow up in space or on the launch pad the Soviets on the other hand didn't have this and the Americans weren't sharing so they would have to go in hard and loud with what is called an uncontrolled ballistic entry what is that rather than a leaf on the Wind you are a bullet punching through the sky an uncontrolled ballistic entry meant that the entry trajectories of the two m71p entry probes would be entirely determined by gravity atmospheric drag and the conditions with which they entered the Martian atmosphere this includes the initial velocity the angle at which the entry probe hit the atmosphere as well as the inherent properties of the probe itself and its 3.2 meter wide brake cone the plan was to first release the entry probe some 46 000 kilometers above the Mars surface the probe would then fire its engines to assume position for atmospheric entry at an angle of 120 degrees this angle allows them to deploy the probe's parachute as high as possible about 35 kilometers above the ground however said parachute would be deploying while the probe hurdles towards the ground at Mach 3.5 or over 2 600 miles per hour which perhaps unsurprisingly has never been done before to test the parachute mechanism they lifted a probe model into the air first up 32 kilometers using a balloon and then later up 130 kilometers using a m100b weather instrument rocket then they dropped the model for the test then whilst in free fall they fired gunpowder engines to accelerate the probe model to Mach 3.5 for the parachute test deployment they did this 15 times about 12 seconds into the sequence the entry probe activates a radio altimeter on its bottom to monitor how far away the ground is a soft Landing engine would also fire to control The Descent when the probe gets low enough about 200 seconds into the sequence much of the whole sequence depended on timers the probe drops the Lander onto the ground then two more sets of little Rockets fire one set of rockets on the parachute fires to carry it away then another set of rockets on the remaining bits of the entry probe fire to push it sideways away from The Landing site this is so that neither the parachute nor the entry Pro bits block the Lander m71's gunpowder engines were fabricated at the scientific research chemical technological Institute as with any explosive production was dangerous a team member recalls visiting the line and noticing one of the walls missing he asked someone about this and they said that a gunpowder cartridge exploded the previous day but the wall that fell down was specifically engineered to do so in order to keep the larger structure intact Nifty bit of engineering anyway back to Mars in order to make sure that the Lander would survive this thudding entry they built five models and a big catapult to fire them onto simulated Martian ground at a vertical speed of 30 miles per hour once settled on the ground the Landers would open up like one of those eggs from that movie Alien exposing the instruments it would then take scientific measurements of the atmosphere and ground as well as snap pictures of the Martian surface they even built a little Soviet Rover robot the prop M marsok kodnik was about 10 inches by 10 inches and quote-unquote walked around on two little skis it would measure the density of the ground and do things to the soil again the Soviet team did their work amid strong political pressure due to their competition with the Americans the Americans had plans to send Mariner 8 and 9 to Mars in 1971 so the Soviets engineered the m71s Orbiter to reach Mars first to score a propaganda win that pressure seemed to ease off at first on May 8 1971 when Mariner 8 failed to enter Earth orbit and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean sadly the Soviets launched the day after on May 9 also went wrong again the Rocket's fourth stage was supposed to fire about 1.5 hours into the launch sequence sending it on its merry way to Mars however the operator coding the sequence in a quote most gross and unforgivable mistake and quote erroneously coded it to fire the fourth stage at 150 hours instead of 1.5 hours whoops launch sequence totally screwed up the Rockets stayed in Earth orbit for two days before crashing into the ocean this naturally sucked the two Mar 71p missions took off without incident on May 19th and May 21st 1971. the Mar 71 SS loss meant that the Soviets would not have the atmospheric data to calculate the entry trajectories for the two forthcoming entry probes this was worrying the Americans Mariner 9 launched a few days after May 30th however it took a faster line allowing the Americans to claim the first Orbiter around Mars the entry probe's launches went off without a hitch and despite some issues with some of the transmitters the two spacecrafts seem to be operating quite well but their greatest challenges were still yet to come then in August 1971 Lovato chief designer Georgie babakin died of a heart attack shortly before turning 57. babican lived to see Venera 7 safely land on Venus but would never see how his Mars missions turned out he was a worthy successor to corolla's dream his death was an ill Omen made worse when Mariner 9 arrived at Mars to report a massive storm raging across the entire planet the two entry probes would have to try landing on Mars in the storm's mids no data from the Orbiter meant that the entry probes would have to rely on a backup system for entry positioning this whole thing worked without human intervention an optical angle measurement instrument would take two measurements of Mars's position in space an onboard computer then interpreted the data in issued course adjustments the team started on this system late in development and while the optical instrument passed all the necessary tests there was insufficient time to test the computer programs which was concerning and as it turns out rightfully so the first Mar 71p Lander arrived at Mars on November 27 1971 and was thus christened Mars too they went ahead with the landing but sadly while the instruments did their job the programs misinterpreted the data as feared the Mars 2 entry probe entered the atmosphere at the wrong angle and hit the ground before the parachute deployed it is at least the first Earth made object to reach the Mars surface trailing Mars 2 by a million kilometers Mars 3 arrived at Mars on December 2nd 1971. again the optical navigation system executed its instructions and this time it worked the whole Landing sequence with the parachute and the Lander dropping and all that went off as planned the Lander settled at 2 50 PM universal time on December 2nd in the midst of a violent Mars storm it opened up its four petals and began transmitting to the Orbiter which then transmitted back home to Earth but just 14.5 seconds after starting the television camera system failed managing only to send 79 lines of a single photograph the reason for failure remains uncertain but one Theory blames electric discharges from dust Another more Sinister Theory suggests that the transmission was fabricated to allow the Soviets of propaganda win but I didn't find evidence of that it is hard to make out anything from the image perhaps you can see if you enhance it but many insist that the Lander sent back nothing but noise Soviet sensors likely deemed it Unworthy of release so it remained secret until the late 1980s thus we would not have the first good image of the Martian surface until the Viking missions in 1976. so the entry probes failed nevertheless Mars 2 and 3 continued to do good science for the next few months as they orbited the red planet sadly their scientific findings and simple images were overshadowed by the stunning success of Mariner 9 which took 7 329 beautiful photographs of the Martian surface covering some 85 percent of the planet the Americans chuffed by their Mariner 9 win announced two new probes named Viking back then the cold war was in a state of De taunt leaders Nixon and Brezhnev had struck deals for a number of joint missions in The Sciences biology medicine and Planetary Exploration perhaps the crowning achievement of this collaboration was a now largely forgotten joint manned mission in 1975 known as Apollo soyuz but as part of the joint agreements the Soviets and Americans agreed on a data swap the Soviets would provide the Americans with the data gleaned from their Mars to Mars 3 and Venera 8 missions and the Americans in turn would give the Soviets the atmosphere data that they were lacking nevertheless the race was still on the Soviets knew that Viking was launching in 1975 and they also knew that it was going to be big some of the most sophisticated systems ever to be sent to Mars so even before the results of the m71 mission were realized the Soviet leadership hatched a plan to boot the Americans using an all-out assault on Mars in the 1973 launch window originally a vision has two Orbiter Landers like with Mars two and three the plan turned into two orbiters and two Landers this was due to the challenges associated with the 1973 window which were not as ideal as those were 1971. it would require more speed and fuel to get these craft to Mars four and five which serve as orbiters like with that first Mars 71 robot Mars 6 and 7 would fly by Mars and drop their Landers onto the Martian surface after that they would zoom off into the nothingness of space the forecast adopted largely the same designs as the earlier m71 devices Mars 2 and 3. so in theory production and assembly should go off without a hitch of course that never turns out to be the case all four spacecraft launched in the summer of 1973 without incident their embarkments were marked with great public Fanfare but the engineers knew that a flaw lurked deep within the system near the end during the integration phase tests uncover repeated failures in the Power Systems due to fundamental faults in the 2t312 transistors extensively used throughout all four spacecraft fabricated out of a rural site in vodoneshki the transistor was supposed to have gold leads the specification called for gold leads all they had to do was just use the gold leads however the Fab either for material shortage or cost reasons swapped out those gold leads for aluminum ones brilliant idea I bet someone got a gold medal for it or maybe an aluminum one anyway thanks to This brilliant idea starting about 1.5 years after production the transistors start failing at high rates due to corrosion in the aluminum leads by then those transistors were already a year old the engineers gave it a 50 50 chance that the transistors would catastrophically fail before accomplishing the mission tearing them all out of the various engineering and science systems was not an option the ministry decided to take that bet and go ahead with the launch they had no choice delaying the mission would have been a political shame show and with Viking looming in 1975 1973 might be their last shot at Mars unfortunately the engineers 50 50 fears eventually came true the Orbiter Mars 4 flew by the planet on February 10 1974 without entering orbit due to a failure and disproportion brake system likely related to the faulty transistors but that is not entirely clear coming within 2 200 kilometers of the planet it took some photos before it eventually entered orbit around the sun where it remains to this day that is some sci-fi horror stuff a similar thing happened to Mars 7 it successfully reached Mars on March 9th and released its Lander however transistor failures in the Landers computer systems caused it to miss the planet by about 1 300 kilometers on the bright side the Orbiter Mars 5 successfully managed to enter Martian orbit in February 1974 but right about then a slow pressure leak sprung somewhere in the sealed onboard instrument module this forced ground control to accelerate its three-month science program to just three weeks Mars 5 eventually took 108 high resolution images of Martian valleys craters and more it also studied the atmosphere detecting water vapor in an ozone layer finally on February 28th pressure levels declined too far for the craft to continue despite this the mission was largely considered accomplished the landercraft mar 6 has the most impressive story so I saved it for last about two months after launch in September 1973 Mar 6 lost the ability to send Telemetry data back to Earth in other words it lost its ability to speak about its own status Ground Control could only send up programs and pray that the spacecraft receives and properly executes them and remarkably Mars 6 did the Plucky craft autonomously measured its position calculated a correct trajectory and in March 1974 entered orbit around Mars it then released the entry probe towards the surface the entry probe had a backup working radio channel it was only through net channel that ground control learned that Mars 6 was still alive and had completed its Mission an incredible achievement sadly the Lander failed to land safely transmission abruptly cut off as it approached the steep slopes of what we believe is the margaritapher sinus region it is not entirely clear why the Lander died out the weather was pleasant a martian spring with a light Breeze the probe was falling faster than expected about 135 miles per hour perhaps the final Landing rocket failed and it smashed itself to bits on the Hills we don't know the Soviets did glean some science from the 1973 missions but despite that leadership largely saw the all-out assault on the planet as a failure they dismissed the program's chief designer vasili Mission and elevated his rival Valentin glushko pivoted the Soviet space program towards a Soviet space shuttle the baron and its launcher the energia the two failed as well but that is for another video as a result much fewer resources were made available for the Soviet planetary Space Program triggering what is called a War of the Worlds the Soviet Mars people still fervently believed in Mars and planned yet even more ambitious Mars missions ahead for instance 1975's project 5nm would have used one of the world's most powerful Rockets ever created to try and return Martian soil for analysis in the end however leadership pragmatically felt that they should concentrate on Venus where they had a clear Advantage for the next 10 years the Soviets mostly launched Venera missions achieving some of the most amazing feats in venusian science there was a final last gasp launch to explore the Martian Moon of Phobos in 1989 has the Soviet Union stumbled towards its end Phobos 1 failed to enter orbit around Mars due to a faulty command and a Computer Logic error Phobos 2 arrived and managed to shoot some pictures of the Martian moon but a malfunctioning computer prevented it from releasing its Lander there the Soviet Mars program was defined by its competition with the United States this competition made the program politically important which was a good thing that it granted them substantial resources however the arduous political requirements The Limited number of launch Windows poor execution and just plain bad luck foiled Soviet success on Mars what achievements they did have were far eclipsed by those by the United States nevertheless we shouldn't discount the Soviet Mars program they did something truly incredible they tried to send 15 robots millions of kilometers out into space to another planet they lost the race to that planet but we should admire those incredible efforts I sure do all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the
