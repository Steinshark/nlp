this animated series about nfts may be cancelled after its main character aboard ape was stolen the announcement came at v-con which if you don't know is where a bunch of influencers gather together to worship gary v and one of the speakers this guy seth green came to show off his world premiere trailer of a show about nfts whose main character is in nft this show features seth green's board ape as the hero of the story a crying monkey named fred simeon now i can't play the whole trailer because they have some copyrighted music that's going to be claimed in a micro second but let me describe it to you it's a bunch of nfts in a bar with humans it's kind of awkward and not in a funny way i mean i get they're going for a mix of real life and cartoons but i can't take your show seriously when one of your characters has aetherium for eyes not to mention their love interest is about as believable as the couples in 90 day fiance but there was one part of it that got a chuckle out of me and that's when gary v appeared on screen pretending to be a human hey gary i too frequent pubs often fellow kids anyways as soon as the trailer ends seth green reveals that there's a bit of a problem a few days before he'd actually had his main character stolen from his crypto wallet or as he says fred was kidnapped july 21 and have spent the last several months developing and exploiting the ip to make it into the star of this show and then days before his name is fred by the way days before he said to make his world debut he's literally kidnapped now i don't understand why the crowd is laughing here at seth losing his main character because this is actually a really big deal the show is possible because he owns the board ape nft see every board ape nft comes with a commercial art license that is it allows the owner to create sort of anything they want shoes clothing even tv shows with that character now what this means though is that when the thief stole this nft they also stole those ip rights meaning seth green is no longer the owner of those commercial rights which makes his show kind of illegal and this whole thing is so ironic because that's the whole pitch of nfts isn't it like you truly own something you possess it but if a scammer steals it from you in what sense do you now own it it isn't clear especially since that bored ape that seth owned has now been sold on the secondary market to somebody by the name of darkwing84 seth green has tried to reach them on twitter saying quote looks like you bought my stolen ape hit me up so we can fix it now darkwing hasn't responded to this and technically until he does he's the real owner of these commercial use rights not seth green and all seth can do is tell people he's going to make those scammers pay saying he's going to kick down any door he has to to recover this nft if there's a door to kick in but let's be honest with ourselves the only thing seth is going to be kicking is himself because i'm going to tell you guys right now not much of a chance they find this guy even though seth green says he has the best people on the case uh i'm already into the best authorities that you can get i've got the um the means to be able to chase this a little bit it's a matter of whether that where it is a person there's some foreign financial conglomerate or some massive scam house somewhere we'll figure it out i got something on the job now of course i don't know who this crack squad of crypto investigators are maybe they hired liam neeson to find the hackers i don't know but in my experience the first thing most investigators are going to tell you is that the only way to track down hacks like this is if the scammer kind of makes a mistake i mean it's possible to track down the wallet you know where the stolen nft went of course but finding the actual people behind it is nearly impossible in a lot of these cases so yeah seth green probably isn't getting his nft back any time soon unless he pays for it and hopefully isn't extorted until then his crypto nft show looks like it's probably on hold which honestly may be for the better i mean i'm sorry to seth green i'm sorry that happened to him but for the world for humanity i think it might be overall a good thing just me personally i guess i don't like shows built around nfts kind of for the same reason i don't like the minions movie it's a whole piece of art built around only selling you some kind of stupid cartoon figure at higher and higher prices like don't get me wrong i get it art has to make money sure but when the entire purpose of the thing is to make the price go up go to the moon it's just never that interesting the only real difference i can see between this new show that was going to come out and like those hacky merch movies is just really that when you buy a minions plushie and it gets stolen you lose 10 bucks if you're seth green and you lose your board ape you lose hundreds of thousands and you might lose your tv show anyways that's basically all i wanted to talk about see ya
