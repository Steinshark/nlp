hello everyone and welcome in this video we are figuring out whether or not my supercharged s2000 has a hot air intake so you can see the air intake right here it's towards the front of the engine and it is you know within the engine bay so perhaps it's not in the greatest spot as far as drawing in cool air so it's also kind of near the exhaust and so what i'm trying to figure out in this video is do i need to do anything about this and so in order to figure that out i have four different thermocouples which i've wired around the engine and so i'm going to be using this device right here essentially it's just a fancy thermometer i've got thermocouples which i can attach to it and read off what the temperature is in various locations so the four spots we're going to be looking at we've got a thermocouple on the front side of the air intake which is you know towards the front of the car we've got one on the back of the air intake which is closer to the exhaust so we'll see if there's a difference in temperature on the front and the back of that air intake i've also got one kind of smack dab in the middle of the engine bay so right up on top of the engine that will probably get fairly warm since it's in the center right above all the heat and it also has some insulation above it on the hood and then finally we have our control which is going to be up front so you know best case let's say our air intake was routed so that it could pull air directly from the front of the vehicle we'll know what temperature that area is and then we can compare it to the temperature on the air intake itself now i don't know what the results are going to be i'm certainly interested in finding out i don't think it's going to be as bad as it looks i think you know when the vehicles kind of come to a stop then it's probably going to get pretty warm in there but then once i'm moving i think you know kind of turbulent air is going to be mixing all around this engine bay and keeping those temperatures down i don't know that so we're going to go test it and find out what actually happens okay so here we have our four readings you can see they're all floating around 20 degrees celsius before the engine has started so the engine's been off it's been sitting in the garage overnight nothing is warm on it and they're all kind of floating around 20 degrees celsius so here on the top left we have our ambient we'll be comparing that to our intake numbers which are the front of the intake and the back of the intake and then here we have the top of the engine so we'll be monitoring these as i drive around at different speeds and see what impact it has on our intake temperatures okay so just sitting here idling the engine's all the way warmed up i've driven out to the middle of nowhere we're going to do some different tests with this so i'm actually surprised i've been monitoring it as i've been driving and it's more of a difference than i expected it to but anyways just sitting here idling ambient temperatures reading about 20 degrees this fluctuates depending on if the fans are on or not our intake front is measuring 40 degrees so 20 degrees warmer and our intake back is reading 55 degrees so about 25 degrees celsius warmer so a significant difference but again we're just sitting here stationary so i'm going to start to drive and then we will see where these temperatures go okay so cruising at about 20 miles an hour we've got about a 17 degree difference between the outside temperature and the front of the intake and then the back of the intake is about 30 degrees warmer than the very front of the car so best case scenario you know you could be dropping probably 30 to 35 degrees celsius with having the intake mounted directly up front now it's probably going to be some average between the intake front and the intake back so probably somewhere in the 20 degree temperature differential on average that you're going to have between the front of the car and this intake traveling at 20 miles an hour so we're gonna speed up 240 and see what it says there all right cruising along at 40 miles an hour it's about 15 degrees difference between ambient and the front of the intake and about 30 degree difference between ambient and the back of the intake so again you know that's actually a pretty significant difference in temperature uh probably at least about 20 degrees celsius cooler air that you could get if you rerouted that intake or perhaps put in you know a heat shield protecting it from the exhaust portion uh so that that backside of the intake was pulling in cooler air all right so now traveling at 60 miles an hour we are seeing less of a difference so it's about 10 degrees warmer on the front of the intake from ambient and it's about 20 to 25 degrees warmer on the back of the intake from ambient so certainly as you get into these higher speeds the differential becomes less as you have more turbulence within that engine bay and you've got cooler air coming in all right so now we're going to do something a little bit different i'm going to do some hard acceleration and then you know brake a bit get back on the acceleration brake a bit get back on the acceleration try to get the engine really hot and see you know if we were really pushing the car what sort of temperature differences would we be seeing all right so it seems to somewhat have leveled off pushing the car fairly hard uh we're getting about an 18 degree difference between ambient and the front of the intake and about a 38 degree difference between the ambient and the back intake so you know 18 to 38 so we're looking at somewhere around a 30 degree temperature differential which is significant so if you're pushing the car hard this is saying that you know you could potentially be getting around 30 degree cooler air uh celsius by relocating that air intake so this has been pretty fascinating for me i actually wasn't expecting to see numbers in the range that i saw you know it's actually a pretty significant difference uh where the intake is versus ambient conditions if you were to be able to get best case air flow into that intake so interesting to see i think two potential solutions would be to either relocate that air intake kind of draw it closer to the front of the car or perhaps put in a heat shield between that air intake and the exhaust to try and block some of that hot air from coming over and reaching it so if you guys have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below thanks for watching
