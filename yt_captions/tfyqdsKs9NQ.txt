okay layoffs pushed down the scores on Glassdoor this is how companies respond several tech companies face a fresh problem after cutting jobs their ratings on Glassdoor no nose Dives let's go Netflix you know I work at Netflix but by the way I work at Netflix I don't know if you know this but I work at Netflix and we pretty much have laid off nobody you know why because Netflix is a great Rand company Shazam um but there's a way to uh manage to fix this and I'll show the companies are doing and why okay okay hi uh let's see how let's go down here let's see I got a message from a software engineer working at a company which laid off 30 of its staff in 2020. dude how many okay type one in the chat if you've been laid off in the last two months watch this this is crazy this is crazy right here like there's been a lot of people that's I mean that's that's a lot to me how about this one laid off in the last six months type 69 in the chat 69 in the chat if you've been laid off in the last six months okay that's a lot of 69. you survive the left yeah it's still it's crazy right and I hey I'm sorry for everyone that's been laid off honestly that's tough type 69 if you're uh wait what shut up TJ uh I I don't know about off oh damn all right anyways I see it's a late stage startup valued around 3 billion which had around a thousand employees before the layoff engineer wrote my uh my company is removing Glassdoor reviews because their rating has gotten so low the company score went from a 2.3 and they started let's see and they started doing this I don't think my company is alone in this practice to protect themselves from Bad press but a lot of my colleagues had had their reviews deleted effectively we've been silenced oh interesting oh interesting people are review bombing companies because of being laid off do you think it's better or worse than the rings of power review bombing which one do you think is worse rings of power review bombing Cleopatra review bombing or Glassdoor layoff review bombing which one do you think is probably the probably the worst one this is worse okay this is probably the worst one Well here here's the one about rings of power that made it so yucky on Amazon Prime Amazon just took off the rating rings of power was so review bombed that Amazon's specially programmed rings of power to have no review like that like I mean just blatant lying like that's how bad it was just blatant it's just so awful the HR team's Target was to get their score above 3.0 and so they got to work flagging negative reviews for removal and encouraging staff to post five star reviews to balance out negative reviews turns out this company is not alone in doing so uh in today's issue uh we'll look closely at what is happening and also investigate a specific company cyber security company trustwave oh I really hope trustwave is doing untrustworthy stuff nothing is more like 1984 irony funny is when companies I have this Theory by the way that the more words a company uses to describe itself the more opposite it is to those words or and this is also with governments anything if you have to say that you're a trustworthy company it makes me think you're untrustworthy uh to find out what happened uh let's see uh so the company had reached an all-time high glass score raid Glassdoor glass ceiling glass door rating uh here I think you can just say continue reading so what happened here look at that look at that graph look at that they did something they went down and Shazam trust trust is just accelerating look at the trust go look at the TR look at the that's oh why can't my stonks look like this I want my songs to look like this some tech companies are in glassdoor's crisis management mode after layoffs I've talked with ctOS and HR professionals at five tech companies who all tell me they're doing something similar to having set a Target score to improve to or did so in the past I'm not naming these companies as I believe this is a widespread Trend that's not limited to just a few players and to be clear trustwave is not in this group I do not have information of such uh mandates at the company also there is business sense in doing this for reputational reasons but first let's talk about what they are doing and whether it's fair so I I do want to say something real talk who the hell gives a review at a company on Glassdoor okay first off that's already strange to me okay I've I'm not writing reviews for almost anything second off you pretty much never write a review because you're happy at a place right you like never write a review because you're happy if someone super pisses you off that's like the only time people write reviews and so it's kind of like naturally if you have a way to review companies say glass door like it has to be like glassdoors rating of a company has to be complete nonsense like it can't even mean anything because of the motivation problem right like it just seems crazy you write good good reviews on GrubHub sometimes that's nice very few people are good reviewers most people are I review when it's shitty and so it's like for me it's just impossible like it's impossible to know if something is good based on on user on X employee feedback of a company some data is better than no data disagree bad data or bias data is worse than no data the reason why bad data or bias data is worse than no data is that it sends the wrong message if you have no message you have no idea if you have bad data you make the wrong decision right at least with no data you can coin toss a decision you're at least right more often like bad data is the worst bad data is by far the single worst thing ever for any decision you make because it's a lie like I hate that like I add Netflix I recently had some data problems recently with the stuff I'm working on and I'm looking at data right now and I have no idea if the data I'm getting is data that is good or data that is flawed I'm trying so hard to figure out Ed do I see a bug that I need to report or is it simply a loss of data it is extremely hard and it is extremely frustrating bad data bad data is the worst uh the Glassdoor site makes it very clear companies cannot remove reviews on every Glassdoor review page there is this message okay companies cannot do that well the statement is somewhat inaccurate as Glassdoor does remove some reviews I've talked to several HR folks whose mandate was to remove unfavorable reviews this is possible and here's how it works game the system boys Glassdoor will remove reviews that violate its Community guidelines or terms of use employers can read flag reviews and Glassdoor does all removals at its sole discretion and shares no details on why they decided to remove a review there is no appeals from employers users uh whose reviews are removed are not notified I asked Glassdoor for a comment on this fact the company responded with a generic statement that did not answer why they don't notify users when taking down the reviews great example let's see this is like I like this stuff is the actual worst right this is the whole like you know YouTube Just bans people and they just give you generic statements like we did it because you violated our terms of use and you're like well what was it they're just like we did it because you violated our terms of use like I hate this type of stuff like if you can't directly point to something then it totally sucks and so I understand that they're a private company and that we should all let private companies do private company things but at the same time they're influencing public and they can totally make some companies look better than other companies you don't know what kind of behind the doors handshaking that goes on right you don't know what's actually going on you don't you know I'm gonna go Rumble we're go Rumble boys I don't I honestly have never been to rumble uh so that's I mean the behind the glass door right you don't actually know what's happening and that's the hardest part about these type of decisions is that my like in my head I like to pretend that what they're doing is they're actually just trying to do a good job but we know for a fact that anytime there's power decision making and money that intersection point always has the possibility of becoming corrupt right so there's a corrupt incentive here to do things for certain people not for others uh paying customers seem to get priority in action on flagged reviews although although any company can flag reviews to be removed and HR person told me that their experienced Glassdoor uh takes no action until the company is a Glassdoor customer huh it's almost like the intersection of power and money breeds corruption uh that's why that's why my stream's uncorrupt because there's just I haven't taken I I real talk I have been thinking about taking a sponsor real talk what would you guys think if I took a coffee sponsor right because guess what remember you know like how there's there's talk about like can people actually have Tech sponsors and be you know objective will happen if I just took a coffee sponsor okay that I can recommend whatever the whatever the for for Tech and you can't argue that I'm biased but I just have coffee I'm like yo bye bye coffee right like that's totally different uh you know I don't know just a thought yeah that'd be great like a non-tech sponsors are would be great I am sponsored by this keyboard but to be fair I've been using this keyboard for a decade practically and been sponsored for a couple years right very very different I feel like uh even if they took away my sponsorship I'd still use them like coffee often uh uses slave labor yeah well exactly you'd want to find out what the good coffee is like I would actually want to do some good ones uh I have a couple that I'm looking at um I'm gonna try to make it work out it'd be great but we'll see I have no idea um anyways there is no let's see hold on I wanna I wanna actually go on this one uh but real talk I've been thinking about it really hard lately and that's kind of where I'm coming Network Chuck coffee so yeah Network Chuck coffee is one of the people I'm currently talking to right now I have never tried the coffee I asked for I want to know I I want to know what it tastes like I want to understand what it is make sure I really like it yerba mate I actually did reach out to guayiki guayeki said they just don't do sponsorships I would have done a yerba mate sponsorship hands down Black Rifle and rust stream oh just Russell some jimmies that's just called the Jimmy rustling stream that all that is if I did Black Rifle and rust they'd be like the rust Foundation would literally melt in half foreign it'd be fun I mean I would do that just to troll rust Foundation like purely to troll rust Foundation I would do that you hear that Black Rifle you want a Black Rifle at rust stream you let me know okay we can wrestle some jimmies together a real talk though my cousin is a war vet in uh Afghanistan uh Restrepo uh he was in this movie called Restrepo uh this unit saw the most firefights in Afghanistan he was in there he's in the show he talks about the ranch that we both uh spent some time growing up on great guy love my cousin um good he's not on this list so this is good I don't want him because he wasn't one of the main characters in this but nonetheless uh I I bought Black Rifle stuff purely to support vets because like it is rough out there for them they have no support and so that's why uh that's why Justin Russell Jimmy's I'd have no problem doing it but nonetheless man I still look back at those days like I feel genuinely I I love my cousin I think he's a great guy and man the stuff that he had to go through it like hurts me to know what he had to go through you know and I barely know anything like I barely know anything you know it like you know thoughtful pets yeah sad times man sad times anyways let's we can keep on going sorry for the complete like I don't even know how I got here okay we were talking about coffee and we got here uh what repo is arrest repel it's rustrepo it's not rest repo I called it rest repo to begin with but it's wrist repo doc Restrepo right uh the person's company flagged reviews that were very clearly in violation but Glassdoor only took a review down when the company started paying Glassdoor responded and said they allow non-paying employees or employers to flag reviews but the company did not say if they treat non-paying employees with the same priority as paying ones in all fairness doing so would make no business sense yep again you know uh there is no way to pressure glass door to remove any single review however a chief people officer I hate this title I hate Chief people officers it's such a stupid term uh who has worked at Tech firms for more than 10 years told me their success rate for removing reviews is about one in three this person said that their experience rude and abusive reviews can be successfully challenged otherwise Glassdoor won't budge um Glassdoor is pretty good at reducing spamming uh the same Chief people officer said that they are satisfied with how well glassed or removed spam or fake reviews spamming uh copy pasta style review is a common problem and they do not do not feel Glassdoor take a back seat in battling this okay the most common way to get a review removed is for a company to claim that it violates glassdoor's terms and service an HR professional who used to be tasked by with removing as many reviews as possible told me the most common method is to flag a review for one or both of the following reasons impersonating another person that makes sense that seems like an easy win right there employers frequently uh flag reviews claiming what the review was said uh by an imposter or impersonator pretending to be a staff member should Glassdoor agree it will ask the reviewer to approve that they are currently an employee and it will hide the review until this happens naturally some employees will not want to identify themselves even the glass door defamatory libelous fraudulent or knowingly misleading con content oh see like this is like this is where things like knowingly misleading like that's going to be hard right because that's like such an individual basis kind of thing you know what I mean this is such an individual type thing rest Rebel used to be on there right because let's just say you're a big company Netflix right and at Netflix we have hundreds of a hundred managers hundreds of managers I have no idea so you can imagine that there's teams that are amazing at Netflix and there's teams that are probably not amazing at Netflix I mean managers make teams right like we all know this that a good manager makes a good team and a bad manager often makes a bad team a good manager has so much impact on how good a team is and Netflix is extremely discretionary with like their their managers have our managers have a huge amount of autonomy and so you could have someone who has a terrible experience and says management is terrible at Netflix is that misleading yeah that's the problem the problem right there again employers can flake content that falls into this category this could be abused by some employers putting glass on the position of deciding whether or not they agree with the employee employer's opinion yeah Glassdoor is in a tricky spot but it doesn't make the situation easier for itself Glassdoor is a semi-anonymous site where employees post reviews on the understanding Glassdoor will protect their privacy the site makes good on this promise Glassdoor went as far as going to court in 2022 to push back on a toy maker zuru which wanted to know the review reviewers identities unfortunately the pi the Privacy fans zuru 1 and US court ordered Glassdoor to disclose this information so if you leave a review consider the non-zero chance that a court order could force Glassdoor to reveal your identity even though it's clear clearly aims to protect this as much as possible foreign thank you uh TQ I appreciate that Tiki wee wee I appreciate that that's you know like this is actually a kind of terrifying statement you know what I mean kind of a terrifying statement uh imagine the situation where a review claims something and the company tells Glassdoor this is deliberately misleading information what is Glassdoor to do it needs to enforce the terms of service so either it takes the employer at their word and removes the review this review or Glassdoor has enough knowledge to know that the employer is incorrect and the information is accurate however when a review is in question contains internal company information Glassdoor will not have prior knowledge to fall back on so it has to remove the review or else it fails to enforce its own terms of service interesting that's Trixie to be fair the HR worker I talked to said the same the person flagged every single one or two star review and Glassdoor only acted on clearly defamatory or fraudulent ones or ones which violated guidelines Glassdoor could make the process a lot clearer by publishing a moderation log which details when and why it removed a review you know you know it's odd this feels just like the rust we just got done going over the whole rust drama this feels just like it you know what I mean this is like the same problem it's always the same problem right we just don't have information and people don't make information public and so it's very easy to assume bad intent right lack of transparency leads to more shadowy cabal assumed Behavior that sucks right because it's it's technically not fair to Glassdoor Glassdoor could be doing a great job right Glassdoor could be trying to do a great job and that's the worst part is that you could feel like they're they're not this log only contains uh redacted parts of the affected reviews to ensure terms of service are not broken such a log would build confidence that Glassdoor is a neutral platform which only enforcing its own terms and conditions and could uh validate this Wikipedia edit logs or the moderation logs on the programming website Lobster are both examples of bringing transparency to moderation and content editing policy but Wikipedia also has categorically incorrect things I have a good buddy uh and he was at an event that took place historically and when he went to it uh this was in Russia I believe it's in vladivastag somewhat from India had already written up about the event and it was clearly incorrect in a couple places so he wrote in and said hey these things happened I was there I sat and watched this thing happen and the person took down his edits like that's the problem about Wikipedia is Wikipedia suffers from the same problem which is even if it's transparent it can still be wrong that's the worst part right companies encourage staff to leave more positive reviews in a uh is a common way to increase the score yeah so this is like Glassdoor hacking which I'm not opposed to it's kind of interesting it's an interesting uh that's like open source yeah uh do I have a problem with this I'm not sure if I have a problem with this long as it's not fully forced by a company if it's forced at the point of a gun meaning like I'm gonna fire you if you don't do this then I don't like that but interesting glass door itself naturally encourages company to have more employees ad reviews in order to combat negative reviews in this article I'm an employee employer what can I do about negative reviews the company outlines four steps flag reviews okay uh respond to them responses are shown under the review nice that's actually a good way to do it I think a company would look best as responses versus getting them taken down because then you can see how the company responds Under Pressure I think that'd be good uh post more reviews yep interesting take legal action uh this is always a possibility but is the most time consuming and probably cost assuming approach an outcome of legal proceedings is uncertain yep I've talked with several ctOS and HR professionals who told me their companies encourage employees to post reviews in various ways send a reminder to new joiners during the first months asking them to leave a review on Glassdoor this is the Smart approach I like this approach as new joiners are often in their honeymoon period and are likely to leave a positive view uh remind managers of the importance of Glassdoor views when hiring staff and ask them to consider sharing their experience on the site again smart as managers tend to sell the company anyways and are likely to share positive things okay organize a Glassdoor review event asking employees to leave honest reviews I always get asked in YouTube comments what do you mean music clearly there's good music here anyways this is interesting uh I'm not gonna lie to you I don't want to keep reading I get the idea I don't feel like I I want any more any more information about this but this was fantastic thank you very much I appreciate that that was a great article and it's kind of really thought-provoking of I mean I think the biggest thing you should take away from this is that reviews about companies are really difficult real talk I think the best thing you can do if you want to know about a company find someone that works there and ask them questions right Real Talk find people that work there ask them questions that's going to be your best way to know what a company's like there is no there is no other way because again reviews are largely motivated uh by some sort of external bias right like I I got I got fired therefore I'm Gonna Leave a mean review that's not going to tell you if the company's good or bad you're just going to get this crappy one what's Netflix like I love Netflix Netflix is great in fact we just hired a new person and I had a little one-on-one with him and he was just asking me about things that's that's kind of trying to up level his JavaScript chops because he's gonna be working on a JavaScript library uh and so I was like all right I really want you to understand some things so we kind of did we walked through it and afterwards he was just like you know no one's really told me what to do they just told me to go and and work on stuff what do I do and so I gave him the Netflix talk which is freedom and responsibility baby this is where you need to determine what you're going to do to make Netflix better you need to get out there and you need to come up with a game plan that's what we all do and you need to do that too and you've obviously been tasked to work on specifically this product so why don't you go and figure that out and you know here's the problem with Netflix is they give you a lot of rope for Freedom right you're running around freedom is amazing but they also give you enough rope to hang yourself and it's not for everybody right this type of this type of management this type of company is not for everyone right that's how Jay diesel started that's the problem this it's true this is how J diesel starts uh which is you get enough rope to have an amazing time but you also get enough rope to hang yourself and so you gotta know how how to like do a good job and so it's it's not easy it can definitely not be for everybody there's plenty of people that hates uh and then they pre-tie The Noose yep that could be tricky that that's a tricky one when they give you a lot of rope and pre-tie The Noose uh Freedom can destroy well I wouldn't say freedom can destroy I'd say that some people thrive in Freedom some people need to be told what to do uh I've always been someone who thrives when you say figure this out I need us to be able to debug what's happening in production figure it out like literally that was so five years ago when we or seven years ago when we started to do Originals really heavy at Netflix um uh my boss came to me and said hey we're really struggling with images in production we have 10 different languages we have no idea how any of them like we have no idea how the images are actually like if they're even present for our Originals we don't even know anything can you just make something for us to figure out if we have images in production or not that's all I'm asking so I figured that out it was fun I came up with an entire system uh and the entire system is now used all over the place at Netflix it's fantastic it's fun right and so that was just like an example of responsibility right there's still direction right the freedom is like or the freedom is in the sense of we're going to give you a large problem you figure out the large problem I me to tell you tell you a do it say like hey you need to do it this way you need to use this technology you need to talk with this team you need to be with this person you you get Tom on the line and Tom figures it out everybody knows that because Tom is a genius uh do you have any tips to find companies that work like Netflix no I don't I fell into Netflix by a complete accident you know like people always there's a lot of people that anytime you say you've had a success in life they go oh yeah but that's luck it's lucky that someone at Netflix asked me to to interview right that was the lucky part I got I got the chance to take an interview and so very happy about it right do you have mentorship program in Netflix no uh we don't have any mentorship at Netflix none at all um none that I really think is good at least there's been some attempts at it I'm not quite sure if it's really good because a lot of it is geared towards making uh software Engineers into management and so that does that's not quite mentorship that's more like career coaching I agree uh it was lucky that someone at Netflix knew you Noah agreed it was lucky no one knew me I was all about my lonesome I was from Montana uh mentorship is really hard at companies so I try to I do try to Mentor people at Netflix and so now that we have this new hire that is our our first non-senior engineer on our team so we only have senior and staff level Engineers on our team and so since this is the first person not on there and he doesn't work with anything with me I just literally go and I make meetings with him and just chat with them about stuff that's it so that's like being a good Mentor right I you know I can't read okay I'm gonna turn back on the alerts hey the name is the prime engine
