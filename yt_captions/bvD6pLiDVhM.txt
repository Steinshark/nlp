the video here we go with an absolutely legendary breathtaking 300 ELO chess battle between vitzel from Brazil who has a profile photo of a very cute dog and Alex from Germany who also has as a profile of a very cute German Shepherd except German Shepherds are not very cute they're kind of terrifying I was bitten by one when I was 11. uh the game begins with E4 and black responds with a knight to the center of the board already as far as I'm concerned for beginners just the pure inaccuracy like you really should be putting one or both Pawns in the center early there is no reason to try to reinvent the wheel white plays Knight C3 either copying black uh or uh playing the Vienna we don't know right we don't know what white is actually doing white is rated 296 I'm not sure white knows what white is doing and black plays Knight F6 so again I don't like when beginners put knights in the center but not their pawns because uh two Pawns in the center will always be two knights and just generally as a beginner if you can put two Pawns in the center in the first few moves you should try to do that all right just a good rule of thumb but okay white plays D3 which is a baby version of the move d4 and it blocks in the bishop uh but you know it's not a bad move it's not like a horrible movement and black copies Pawn to D6 and now white plays Bishop F4 uh which is kind of like an UGA London is what I would call this it's like a King's Pawn London I've really never seen something like this before um I uh I don't know I mean generally the you know the pawn is on D4 and then the bishop is on F4 this is definitely kind of weird uh and black immediately puts a Pawn on E5 and attacks the bishop so another good rule of thumb do not move your Bishops into the center of the board if they can be attacked by enemy Pawns in a way that does not weaken the opponent's position so essentially if your opponent can play a very natural good set like developing move and attack your Bishop forcing it to move again don't put your Bishop there it's a total waste of time white could have just gotten Bishop E3 E5 and it would have been White's move Instead This is this position but it's Black's move so black gets extra time and we do not like that black plays Bishop G4 as always you can develop a bishop you can attack a queen it's probably a good move and now white has a pleasant Choice a white could move the Queen White could block with the bishop white could block with the night like a block with the Knight Wicked block with the pawn uh White chooses to play Bishop E2 which is a perfectly reasonable move and now the Bishops are traded and I really like that that in this position white continues develop doesn't take with the King uh doesn't take with the queen although taking with the queen is completely fine now what should black do either play Queen D7 and Castle long or Play Bishop E7 and Castle short or as a very very very last resort you can now change your plan and try to put two Pawns in the center because in this case you actually can do that I also don't hate Black's next move which is Knight to G4 again you really shouldn't try to move the pieces that you've already developed a lot because you're going to run out of pieces and then you're going to fall behind in development but Knight G4 is not a bad move you know what for 300 I really I really don't hate this move uh White plays H3 and black juice grabs the bishop okay and again black should play Bishop B7 in Castle or queen E7 or or whatever in Castle um the thing about this move is it it looks really good but it it's not it it's not as good as it looks um you know the incredible thing is you play a move like this and okay white blocks right but let's say white plays King D2 the king is actually shockingly safe this is a really powerful bunker of Pawns and black does not have a way in if you play a five that's just a free pun I'm not afraid and what's what what funny thing happens here is you know we have G3 kicking out the queen and now obviously this Pawn was just used to block against the queen chat it's it's a very scary situation right you don't want to you don't want to move the pawn again because if you move the pawn again Queen's gonna come back so you can't Castle now because this is weak but you can go Queen D2 and oh oh uh or you can maybe move the Knight and try to trade the Queens what you definitely don't want to do is exactly what happens in the game G4 Queen H4 and now you learn the hard way that pawns cannot go backwards so you have to play King D2 uh and uh I mean you don't have to play King D2 but it's actually better to play King D2 than play King F1 because your king is wide open and black can already start opening up the position and uh it can go from bad to worse here like black and play Rook H6 and then Rook F6 and all of a sudden I mean there's a very very powerful attack Brewing so King to D2 all right this is kind of our first fascinating development of the game white just has a king in the center of the board and we're just gonna act like it's okay but the position is very closed how do you determine a position is very close in chess you look at the pawns both sides have eight pawns so the only opening for white is the f-file uh everything else is kind of deadlocked and then you've got to start looking at the pawn breaks right where can a side make a pawn trade to open up the position black plays Bishop E7 again this is so far so good I gotta say like I was making fun of the 300 elos these two are playing very well okay and uh Knight to D5 long Castle now either black got super lucky here uh or completely remember that the Knight is defending and so on and now white plays Knight EC3 so white transferring the horses this way at some point white will need to move the queen and bring the Rooks because right now we've played about 15 moves and you're not using any of your heaviest artillery okay so black plays the best move the top engine move Bishop G5 top engine move putting pressure on the pawn in front of the king and in close position sometimes brilliances like this like this happen 300s are able to find by accident the best plans because uh because you can't move anything so they just try to move what they can I mean for example they click the bishop I don't have this setting on but many of you do many of you play like this in general many of you play like this where you touch a piece the highlighted squares appear and then you know you play Bishop G5 so Bishop G5 uh now white plays Knight B5 okay so the knights are teaming up we sort of see the justification of the last idea one night move two night move three night move tunnel vision but not the worst kind Queen to G3 black is infiltrating and responding but I got news for you there is actually no threat because the Knight is defending and white gobbles upon on C7 I mean this is spectacular stuff I have to tell you uh really really impressive now black completely malfunctions black realizes that this plan does not work so they're gonna play H5 and white just takes and white just takes because you cannot play Rook H5 because it's a full loss of a rook so black plays H5 and then realizes I mean the fact that black even realized that this was defended from that far away is kind of a miracle uh I I don't even I don't even know what to say then black plays F5 and white could have taken this too white could have just won three pawns the only reason the position is not even that much winning is because of Knight D4 which is just a really weird move it's pinned so you can't take it gets the Knight closer but nobody's gonna play Knight T4 otherwise white is completely winning so black completely malfunctions black loses one pawn two pawns three pawns three moves in a row one Pawn lost on each move this is typical 300 ELO stuff like you you play 15 great moves and then you play three completely horrible moves and you play 15 really more horrible moves but you know what's incredible white in this position does not even take white realizes the pawn is no longer covering that square look at this look at this this is incredible now black either by accident or by genius realizes I don't need to guard this I need to attack the king F takes E4 is a genius move it's a genius move because you need to create some sort of attack otherwise you're busted up the computer here really wants white to trade Queens but white of course takes the Rook because that was the entire reason that they went there now black takes with the rook and white plays Queenie too just a nice little subtle Improvement guarding the king white has a better move though here and this is just a mini this is this is a little lesson for some of you chest noobs take a look in this position white is completely winning one way to secure a victory in chess is simplification simplification and here you can force a queen trade how you can force a queen trade by looking for checks the most forcing move in chess is a check Queen G4 just so happens to be a check and a hit on the queen and it's defended so you would trade the queens and be a major step closer to winning this game plus by removing the queen from the board your opponent can now never attack you your king is completely safe the king is kind of scared of a queen he's a bit of a beta so Queen to E2 Rook f8 now D take C4 and ladies and gentlemen let the fun begin this is a 300 ELO game we have had way too much of a normal intro wait it's been way too normal we're overdue for our memes I'm looking at my watch the memes are overdue so black plays Rook Cafe and by the way this is the punishment that white has for leaving the queen on the board the Queen is the bully right the queen is bullying everybody look at the most forcing moves you have checks but you can also use your advantage another mini lesson in this video a lot of you chest noobs don't use your advantage what does that mean what is white up white is upper Rook for a bishop white is up a rook you're not using the Rooks they're just standing around right it's like buying a really fancy piece of furniture and just leaving it in the package gotta unpackage it right you gotta gotta use the Rook otherwise what are you doing all right so he takes C4 played in the game and now Rook to F2 and white is in trouble white is in trouble because white is going to lose the most powerful piece after losing the most powerful piece white is then going to have a king in the center you see if the King was going to be tucked away over here maybe I wouldn't be so concerned but the problem is the king is going to be stuck in the center of the board which is why you should probably go here and try to do something like this and Evacuate the king that is probably what you should do but if the opponent is sharp they're going to hunt down all your pawns and remove your defenses white fights back with Rook ag1 finally just to move too late now here black does something that I completely don't understand okay I completely don't understand black just played Rook F2 which threatens a queen now black completely panics and realizes their Queen is hanging and instead of taking with check and just moving the queen to safety which maybe they missed black decides well my queen is hanging so I might as well lose my what why why would you do that I don't even what well Black's idea was to escape with the queen so black black is going to escape with the Queen by giving up the bishop the incredible thing about this move is it loses to King D3 which is so ridiculous the point is this is no longer a check so you take the queen oh my God yeah I mean no no one no one on the planet is fighting this and the point is there is no discover check because you win the queen so Bishop E3 accidentally walks white into a victory but instead we have the following position now this position is equal uh it I mean it's equal according to the computer it is the farthest thing from equal when two three hundreds are playing it's probably not even equal at Grand Master Level it's very complicated uh the Eternal question of would you rather have a queen or two Rooks it depends on the position um Rook takes G sub Queen takes H5 check and the King again should be hiding over here King is beta King is afraid of the queen let alone the enemy Queen so the king should hide white should try to push the pawn and white has two Rooks so pinning an enemy King in the back rank is absolutely not out of the question so the king absolutely should not go forward it does go forward and folks I told you I told you the memes were going to be very very hot hot like hot and heavy in this game this was a very intense game Knight to B4 check black delivering a check with the Knight because the King has just arrived but suddenly King C3 and there is a major major problem here the problem is that the Knight is hanging and it cannot go here because it actually just gets trapped so King C3 I don't really know why black did not go backwards maybe black was afraid of Rook F1 and Rook f8 so instead of that black tries to play the ultra sneaky Queen H6 Queen H6 is a fork and you can't take the Knight because your Rook is hanging I don't even know what the best move here is white plays Rook to G1 which is not a great move but it's a move and now we have Queen E3 check King to B4 the white king bold and courageous and brave probably crapping his jocks though and now Rook can slide over and Rook to G8 is mate I mean both kings are on the absolute Verge of perish Queen to D4 check of course it would have been better to take a pawn with check I don't really know why that doesn't happen and now King to B3 and our second big meme delivery with overnight international shipping Queen to D5 check black played Queen to D5 check in no less than one second black had way more than that on the clock Queen to D5 check on the board Pawn takes D5 ends the game King to C3 spectacular stuff back to equality now the game is probably a draw but this King could Escape out this way for example Queen C5 and maybe we have A6 Rook F7 and the King could potentially Escape now it really can't escape but that's neither here nor there black plays B5 the move B5 actually threatens Checkmate believe it or not it threatens Queen C4 King A3 Queen A4 mate the white king needs to escape white gives a check I don't love that move because now the king is gonna run you don't always have to give checks in particular when you are restricting a king's movement as you are now when you give a check you might relinquish that control and the King will run up to A6 and be completely fine so Rook check King B7 Rook G7 Rook G7 check King A6 completely avoids checks and black is going to probably win the game instead the King has a choice of three moves one is amazing one is okay one is Bozo level and black chooses Bozo level giving the queen a hug from behind and Rook C8 check and that is that and our battle has concluded whites picks up the queen and now will simply win the pawns and make another queen okay or play Rook G2 um I don't really know what that does King to D4 played by black attacking the pawn on e4 white can just gobble everything but be careful about stalemating okay white chooses to play defense Pawn to D5 I would just take that but okay H4 takes H5 white is lucky black cannot do anything absolutely nothing there is nothing that black can do nothing literally you can push by pawn it doesn't matter rookie for it none of it matters the white king is always safe now we have h6h7h8 and seasoned Veterans of watching my content obviously are watching at this point going Levy you're not slick we know that white doesn't win this game and look I would say looks can be deceiving just because you know since I did something in the past doesn't mean I'm gonna do something in the future all right there's not going to be maybe there isn't the stalemate maybe white just wins this game right it's how to lose a chess sure plot twists happen but then maybe a plot twist happens within a plot twist it's an absolutely fascinating thing are you ready to see how this game concludes because I'm really not sure you are Pawn to H6 Pawn to B4 on to H7 Pawn to A5 on to h8 King to B5 oh oh are you seeing this oh wait a minute Queen E8 check King's okay well now you just take all the Pawns yeah wow just no plot twists take this Pawn take those Pawns okay fine Queen D4 check King to B5 yeah again keep you give a check give a check give a check ladder made very quickly you're probably like all right Levy well show the plot twist now yes you caught me you caught me this game white didn't win this game um white with an absolutely overwhelming amount of material potential to have Four Queens and a rook on the board and quite enough time to deliver a ladder Checkmate not only did It win this game white got checkmated by a pawn um
