in today's video we're going to be talking about something that's not programming related but something that's fairly important if not more important at the moment and this has to do with the earthquakes that have been going on around turkey and Syria right now the death toll is around 45 000 if not more but I just thought with my minor power on YouTube of around 60 000 followers I would try to spread the word to help find some support for this unfortunate situation now personally I'm not really a fan of sites such as Red Cross or a lot of these mainstream associations because they do take a lot of fees to cover their personnel cost and not a lot of it goes to the actual disaster as much as I would hope for so I tried to find a website that is much more local such as ABAB and here most of it is in Turkish as you can see so I find this to be much more authentic and I've already donated some but then I thought why stop there when I can also get the whole Community involved and that's exactly what I want to do with this video is convince you to donate something small or actually anything that you possibly can if you have some money to spare because it will help these people a lot every little bit counts and that's actually all I wanted to promote in this video I'm going to be leaving a link to this site in description box down below here you can choose to donate whether 20 50 100 or 200 Turkish lira and you can also pick some other amount I will leave a link to this page as well it's the same website except here you actually enter your name your email address and then you can pay by card or by bank transfer that is up to you but you can decide how much you want to give and you can also select different currencies such as Euros or Swiss Francs or pounds so you can choose what you want to put there and you can even put five euros or 10 euros I think that any amount you can support with will go a long way for them and I'm mostly making this video because I'm very privileged to live in a country that does not have to deal with earthquakes such as these and it's probably the most boring country in the world in terms of natural disaster and economics it's just been flat as the country itself in case you didn't know I currently live in Denmark so there are literally zero issues here but that doesn't mean that other countries don't have issues so yeah I think I've been talking a lot about this earthquake and I finally want to stress that I have no association to this website I don't earn any commissions for mentioning this this video was just put out to raise some awareness for what's going on in Turkey so if you have something to spare the link is in the description box down below I would highly appreciate it they would highly appreciate it and yeah that's actually all I wanted to cover in today's video so as always thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
