alright guys I am in Barcelona right now with you ho chief product officer of a Tandy global and we're going to give you a world exclusive unboxing of the brand new Nokia 9 PureView don't do the honors you've probably done by all purpose what is the most exciting thing about this firms it has to be the unique camera you might have seen the leaks there are how many cameras on the back of this phone five cameras five cameras it's not a joke okay five cameras what why when who how there's a lot of questions but to start with this is a robust phone it is seamless ip67 rated and encased in Gorilla Glass five using a 6000 series aluminium chassis it's got one dominant curve across the back which makes it pretty comfortable to grip it's got a USB C port and a single speaker and what I do like here is that the cameras are flush with the body there is no camera bump but I'm gonna save you some time and get the biggest question out of the way why do you need five cameras on I think it's gonna be the biggest question that most people are gonna have sure very good reason for it so the more cameras you have the more detail you can capture so first of all two of the cameras are color right so we combine those for a very vibrant color information but then three of them are actually monochrome so each of the monochrome cameras get 2.9 times more detail than the color wants to do each of them captured with different exposure value you get benefits like astonishing dynamic range yes extreme detail all of that good stuff so this is gonna be incredible for portrait mode you're gonna get just ridiculous amount of information in the photos so the depth map is gonna be crazy and you can actually refocus shots after you've taken them it can shoot native monochrome video instead of shooting in color and then converting it to black and white and this can result in sharper more detailed lookin shots it's got the same both II feature we've seen on past devices from the company and it can also record 4k HDR video with spatial surround sound there is even more to the camera but a few other things I like are the display which is a five point nine nine inch quad HD plus OLED panel crisp is the word I'd use but also right and vivid Android one and running the latest Android 9pi which means that the phone is running this blissfully clean and blow to a free version of the software it'll get you three years of security updates two years minimum of key software upgrades and here's the kicker this is the entire list of applications that come included with it bloatware is at an absolute minimum which should also give the three thousand three hundred and forty million power sell a little bit of a leg up as there are no extra processes eating up your battery it's got an in display fingerprint scanner and if you're not a fan you can also scan your face for a I assisted face unlocking but the main differentiation here really is this camera and a big part of the experience is not just the base photo that comes straight out of it tell us a bit more about what you can do with the photos after you've taken them all so two things first of all one thing that we wanted to cater for is more like a professional photograph or audience we captured that fool twelve point four stops of dynamic range that's astonishing anything you can decide on how you represent that in the final image with the Adobe Lightroom that we've pre-loaded on the device and then secondly all of the detail from the five cameras so when it comes to DNG or raw file quality you haven't seen anything like this on a smartphone before bold claim indeed let's find out a little bit more about this camera alright so i'm also here with constable Kerr who is a professional photographer and he spent some more time with this than I have and how did the five cameras help you well I was shooting wildlife and one escapes in Scotland and five cameras it's a high dynamic range so you have utility disguised yeah okay so you have everything you could have with DSLR you think that this sort of leapfrogs any other phone you've used yeah definitely on camera wise us I should always throw files myself and with this one the RAW files are massively big files and you can work on that for a while more affordable according to the company this camera setup can capture 10 times more light than a standard single camera and I know I kind of skipped over the unboxing experience so if you're wondering what's inside you get an 18 watt fast charger which is pretty cool and aside from that you get a pair of earphones and a headphone jack adapter and then just the standard instruction manual okay so to finish this video off there was really just one more question that I wanted to ask you ho all right so this is a complex and a different camera setup so oh yeah how do you kind of where do you even start by trying to build something like that we actually have a couple of brilliant partners so I'll start with light you might know these guys from VL 16 camera that they need so one way of looking at that is that we compress the same technology in the 8 millimeters beam body and then Qualcomm has done a lot of heavy lifting for us here we're actually using the DSP more than were using the CPU so we can do noise reduction three times faster at 10 times lower power consumption so really complex system like you said yourself and multiple partners bring you together aside from all this the phone is powered by the Snapdragon 845 chip six gigs of RAM and 128 gigabytes of storage so what do you think to the device let me know in the comments down below and as always my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
