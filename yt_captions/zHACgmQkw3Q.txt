click the link in the description or just go to betterhelp.com gothamchess now let's get back to the video Pawn 2 E4 by the random Noob and Gotham sub responds with the caroon defense that's how you know we are back do we do let's look at it from the Gotham Subs perspective D4 D5 E5 C5 good stuff good stuff undermining the center of the board Knight F3 is a good move Pawn takes Knight F3 is either a really beginner move or a very high level move there's a line here uh at top level recently Knight F3 so I don't know takes takes Knight C6 okay okay this has all been played before this has all been played before fine okay Knight C3 is not a great move so the Knight C3 is a very natural move but it's not a great move because the Knight actually has no role okay Knight G6 no uh this move loses immediately to what YouTube comments I can't read them live but this move every time you push a pawn you got to think it used to guard something Bing and it is over because after this you get hit with Knight D6 and then it's real bad then the Knight is ravaging ravaging the position what you you have to do here is you have to keep this Spike you have to go here and here okay C5 I'm getting like 13 12 1300 Vibes not found George eight A3 now how that how y'all got a queen two Rooks Bishop Knight what is this and black responds with the equally powerful C4 I I can't explain these moves I I'm just yelling them I don't that's it oh my god dude played A3 A4 that's that's crazy that's crazy wow thank you finally develop the bishop that's crazy bro was straight up afraid of Knight B5 that's is the challenge to just move pieces one square oh my god oh yeah but see but see black is worse cuz Black's just not castling like black is doing fine but uh uh oh this is about to get really crazy EF Queen F5 oh my E6 you got to got to open up the king when it's there Bishop C5 uh you could take the bishop and probably castle that's what I would do I would go here and then after Queen F2 I would just play O and then I would survive take wait is that what happened no no 95 Queen F7 95 Queen F7 oh oh Castle finally finally oh my goodness that's it you're safe take rookie eight pin pin pin yes Check Yes Knight Knight anywhere Queen C5 yes but they could take yeah they could they could take but it's yeah King G8 nice nice and now you're going to win with no memes you are going to win with zero memes there will be it's going to be no memes there going to be no no memes just it's going to be no memes bro okay if there was more than three minutes on the clock when the move d4 is played just delete the account like I don't even like guys please oh my God bro oh my goodness why are you such misogynous s y'all gave away your Queens y'all gave away 18 points of material for one for one for one one point of material oh my goodness you misogynistic pigs yeah now what black just wins right yeah oh my okay so the crazy thing is this is a cutting it this is the amazing thing about Chess Knight F3 Knight D4 is like a a Cutting Edge theoretical discussion in a sideline of the caroon and yet it's also like a 900 going I'm just pushing my PS and developing some piece of trading Knights and my bishop and a castle and the Knight and the bishop and like the incredible thing about Chess is that it could be 2,800 and opening was definitely 100% luck and then like I mean this is this is this is some it's got to be three digits there's no way this is a four-digit game I mean it's just too scatterbrained uh I would still say like 800 I would say high 800 is what I'm thinking I think it's it's definitely like a 800 game uh I do not think it's it's higher than that uh and it it's uh it's it's it's not me this is okay let's see ooh low 900s I was very close 915 versus 9913 wow I I don't think you can see it I don't think you can see Black's ELO hold on let me uh let me bring this down a little bit uh uh there we go there we go yeah let me move this a little bit chippy all right yeah it was a it was a 10-minute game and how much time was on the clock when the queen was blundered how much time was on the clock when the queen was blundered oh God I said less than three minutes oh oh I said if less than three I said wait I said if more than 3 minutes you delete the account don't actually oh oh 320 oh oh oh you don't have to delete the account because there was 249 on the clock oh that's clutch that is crazy though I mean you played this move to push the pawn and then you just forgot your queen was hanging that and how long did it take white to blunder a queen that's tough oh that's tough Good Start oh it's good to be back it's good to be back wow all right that is that that was that was a very exciting game game of chess amazing that was good that I said High 800 so I I was close I was close but uh you know I said I said like 880 you know that's what I thought I low 900 I'll take low 900s ch.com thought it was a 700 and a 500 that's correct yes yes yes yes good start solid start two queens blundered for a pawn you know impressive all right um Gotham sub versus random Noob by the way check out our sponsor whoever sponsored this episode of guest the ELO maybe it was me nice Sicilian with C4 okay uh and then white plays in English so white is basically playing in English that's what white is doing uh never I don't know what white is doing all right this is the we hate horses variation this is the we hate horses okay yeah this is not for digits no no nobody nobody at four digits is playing like this they're just okay they're just trading off okay POG uh Castle okay Bishop I you know you you you can already start like giving some checks out here okay e oh oh oh open the center open the center okay wrong Pawn decent idea but you know you see a rook you see a queen you you got to you got to play E6 not a bad idea unless that was was completely not the idea uh White doesn't even you know I don't even know if white saw that black plays Queen V6 and white does not even defend the pawn and black doesn't take the pawn and white defends the pawn and hangs The Rook I love that you guys you you know what you guys do here's what you guys do basically you guys have a have like a bicycle or a car that has a squeaky wheel right and and when when a bicycle or car has a squeaky wheel it's a pretty fixable problem needs a little oil might need to be you know something needs to be what you guys do is you drive the car off a cliff and then you say Well it it's it doesn't squeak anymore you know that's what you guys do you know in in in in instead of just fixing the problem you just drive it off a cliff because because then well I mean it's not squeaking you know B3 nice good takes okay nice A5 good move now it's not over because there's dark squired weaknesses around the king very close position as well eight pawns each when you have eight eight Pawns in chess you want to trade pawns right so A4 right you want to when when you have a close position maybe you want to trade some pawns open things up I like A4 Queen B2 now of course this is game over black ever plays E4 but if black doesn't play E4 look at look at this look at look at how desperately how desperately look at this this is the this is this is the one track mind right here like oh my God I'm so smart if F this is how you guys think okay you guys are like all right my opponent's like destroying my house over here and everything I'm going to play F4 because if he takes then I'll play Queen B2 all right that's what you guys do all right and of course none of that happened black doing a ve take it of course take that sure take that too oh don't take that what so if you take like this it's bad but if you take like this you might be able to but you got to be careful cuz there's some Queen G2 stuff uh yeah I don't I don't quite understand why you decided to hang a rook I don't understand why he decided not to take it so you understandable have a nice day just understandable have a nice day uh all right Bishop D7 now you're never going to get mated uh now uhoh oh maybe you are going to get mated Oh no you're going to get mated ow you're going to get mated what why did he not just like you can't go Queen H2 cuz of check bro why he sacking The Rook oh queen1 check Queen one check on the board it's just checks it's it's it's now you can take wow wow wow wow oh wow and now there's no check accident or genius oh oh oh w wow now I think four digits I think four digits because they resigned I think the tactics there were were actually pretty sharp that was not bad that that that felt four four digit like wow but the opening was trash what was this opening no no no no I I actually I don't think it was four digits I mean why none of this felt four digigit like if it was four digits it's a thousand I'm going to say 1,000 1,50 I'm going to say 1,50 because I just feel I just feel like like what kind of a 1400 plays G4 can I ask would anybody in this chat at 1400 play G4 in this position there's no wa it's for it's like 1,50 it's it it it's 1050 to 1100 maybe let's see 1050 to 1100 no 1194 and 1330 boys girls what what is this come on it's a 30 minute game oh it's a 15minute game a 15-minute game what what cool play just like this just no openings at all oh my goodness oh my goodness G4 I mean ah y'all underperformed I'm not happy about that I'm not I'm and and what does chess.com think let's see let's see if chess.com agree chess.com recently has been doing these estimates kind of close to the elos mine is also going to take a while I have like a my game review has to uh take some time to load which is annoying maybe I can turn the settings off settings um game review maximum standard and it thought oh it's like what I said I said 1050 11100 me I there you go I'm the goat I I mean I didn't say 1150 but I said 1050 1100 that's a that's pretty damn close so you know I would say I'm the man I would say I'm the man I would say I I would I would say that was impressive I say I'm the best guest ELO player of all time what do you guys think anyway I am himothy exactly all right next game Gotham sub with the white pieces Sicilian normal Sicilian okay Dragon wow this is like this a real opening oh my God this is like real chess what do you wow that's not a that's wrong you you are not you're supposed to go Queen the whole point of the Dragon is you play F3 Queen D2 and long castle that's like what you're supposed to play in the dragon um but if you're supposed to that's not a move that's that's definitely not a move okay so probably like 1,200 and down uh I'll be very very very very frustrated and upset if it's above like 12 1300 uh already we have established that the players don't remember you don't know your openings if you cannot explain them to a 5-year-old it's not just about the news uh not about the moves it's also about the ideas the ideas of the Sicilian Dragon are not to play Pawn 2 H6 why are you playing Pawn 2 H6 the ideas are to advance on the queen side to play on the C file I mean think about it your first move is intending to fight for the center and should you ever take your C file is open your queen comes out here it's not to play H6 and then King H7 like it's not this stuff you know okay Queen C7 I like what white is doing white white is playing this is this is good intermediate chess uh I think like 12 1300 already I would literally finish guessing here just because like or maybe a 1400 that doesn't know openings that well okay Free Pawn by the way on B2 okay E5 take take okay yeah that's just been a free Pawn by the way I I don't know like I don't know why we didn't just play B3 uh learning openings is useless okay okay well that's fine you're a twitch chat member and I'm the largest chess teacher on the internet so we have slightly different levels of credibility I would argue but that's neither here nor there takes takes you know we're all entitled to opinions opinions are like anuses I want to say everybody has one but I feel like that's like what there's got to be people in the world that like don't have one and then I might get cancelled because I'm assuming everybody has an anus and at this point you can get canceled for anything so I'm I'm going to be really careful I I am not excluding any anybody that does not have an anus you are more than welcome you know to uh to to watch the channel you know um and that doesn't you know Crohn's disease like folks have to use like the the colostomy bag or whatever that's a very that's a very different you know thing and and you know my heart goes out to folks that have that that have that anyway we're going to stop top talking about that and you know we're instead we're going to you know take the Rook on f8 Queen d8 okay Bishop C5 check that's not a queen hang that's a check um King H1 and uh The Rook is hanging ooh nice zishan zuk forc the king to the back Rank and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is a huge threat or this not that because then takes and then I would block on G8 okay trying to set it up trying to trying to look for the chance uh oh I would have wenton A5 this move wins because what it does is it sneaks into the back rank you can play like Bishop some some bishop move all right um Bishop B6 okay we're going to an end game black is better Flex you you don't want to deal with two Bishops and a pass Pawn you don't want to deal with two Bishops and a pass Pawn uh so uhoh uhoh uhoh oh this is really bad white is totally busted I mean white has nothing yeah black got everything oh my oh my Bishop B3 that was actually wrong what black should have done is trade Bishops you want to remove the blockading piece anytime a piece is blocking your pawns you just just get rid of it just get rid of it that's what you got to do you got to try to get rid of the blockade um apparently the stream crashed but I think the YouTube video is still going which is quite funny so the chat is going to return at some point I'm just going to keep going because we are recording and twitch crashed but YouTube isn't going to know because we're just you know we're just recording this for YouTube so look at that t twitch is crashing right now there's now now now now the stream is returning it's a beautiful thing about you know doing uh live stream and uh anyway uh they're going to all come back anyway instead of playing E2 what you want to do here is Play Bishop E4 and even if even if this happens um you can slowly take your time and unwind you don't want to get Rel blockaded because then you're definitely not going to uh but you know then you're not going to anyway King F2 um Bishop B6 Bishop B3 and the no wrong pawn it was better to go for this one so you can get a new passer but King F4 all right King G4 nice get the no no no no you got to push the pawn No No No No's running away oh my goodness what he never even oh Rook d8 is crazy Rook d8 to stop Bishop to D4 oh that's crazy wow wow oh he hung his Rook he hung his Rook oh my God oh my God he hung his rook in this position white apparently had to play Rook D7 so that if Pawn to G3 happen happened Rook H7 is mate that is crazy Rook D5 or Rook D7 threatening Checkmate if the pawn advances that is like unfindable he hung his Rook what oh my God what oh my God oh my God what why why did that happen why did he hang his Queen for no reason he could have just went here and there was no more checks wow this was crazy this was uh oh my God this was like a good opening it was a good game I mean I I very controlled I mean B2 getting blundered was weird I want to say like 12 1300 I mean I I I I I think I'm going to say like 1,400 1375 to 1450 that's the range of this game 1375 to 1450 as the chat is still slowly finding their way back from crashing 1375 so 1450 no not nah this is the wrong game what 1983 versus 2100 what are you guys sure SE 1750 that's black underperformed according to chess.com by 450 points I mean yeah what were you guys smoking what I guess the rest of the game was logical but you guys didn't know how to play the opening at all like I I I'm like shocked I mean like how did I guess the idea was Rook B2 something like Knight D5 maybe I guess that was the idea I don't know wow that is uh that that is I that was I did not expect that I did not like I If I ever guess your ELO from a game of chess you submit here's the incredible thing about gu the ELO y'all will deliberately submit games where you played poorly and I will guess low ELO and then I'll feel bad about it but you're doing it to yourself you and at the end yeah I mean at the end it was even crazier right like at the end hanging the queen to a mate I mean that was oh my goodness that was that was wild 2100 just like blundering like that is crazy wow all right Gotham sub I I'm sorry I I do not mean to insult any of y'all but sometimes man y'all just submit some wow wow yeah I don't know what's been going on with the stream today but uh anyway all right this is normal kind of f4 take take take okay this is bad black is just better now black is better because they have more activity this bishop is very passive the dark squares are up for grabs yeah just give a check nice I wouldn't even yeah good move what Knights are looking really nice here oh oh God what is wrong with Knight F2 check by the way nothing there is nothing wrong with this okay so they didn't see Knight F2 I mean any human here plays Knight F2 check right Knight F2 right I think most of us would play Knight F2 all right uh-huh okay so black emerges up and exchange good I straight up said good and it's plus seven what what how is this really just Checkmate okay the number one line of stockfish is F5 the second line of stockfish is sacking the qu and then getting mated oh my goodness oh my goodness that is yeah my bad yeah yeah listen I it's been a while all right oh man oh no no you got to get your pieces out you can't just make weaknesses all right all right Knight D5 no because the queen is protecting what are you doing oh there goes the attack yep black is just a rook up now yeah just play like Bishop F5 and that's GG damn wow yep oh Bishop D5 oh my God over wow no no come on man I was having a good day oh God God oh my oh no no no no that is so crazy how did you not see that coming oh goodness all right I mean the opening understanding was like pretty low but not horrible the ability to conjure up an attack was nice but how many points do we deduct for not seeing Queen takes right like that's how many points and then blundering the fork oh I'm going to say like I'm G to say uh okay but in the opening being smart enough to like use all your pawns like this like F4 that's a good move I feel like most noobs here wouldn't play F4 so I want to say like I want to say like 1130 I'm going to say 1100 in this game let's see 10 1020 yeah and not and a thousand I mean all right I mean listen I'll take it you know and what did ch.com think did did the did this person delete their account after this game by the way okay yeah chess.com thought you were trash but uh please don't tell me they closed the account after this game no they they they they lost some more January 24th they closed their account shout out to Jazz Mouse and when was this game played oh this was ages ago W dude D 2022 oh my god dude was uh dude was saving up for a minute for guess the ELO oh my goodness all right I thought that person deleted their account because of you cuz that that would have been sad but uh wow oh that was fun thank you thank you wow somebody's saying it's the best chess book you've ever read I appreciate that and you know if you bought it and you're too strong for it then just give it to somebody you you like you know you want to impress somebody on a date be like you've ever seen this book and they'd be like no I don't know how to read and that will be the end of your date all right E4 last game of Our Guest the ELO return and we have a Scholars mate ladies and gentlemen that very nice very nice if you guys want to um mate somebody you got to play Queen H5 all right you got to play Queen H5 you also got to like take a shower dress nice be yourself unless you're a scumbag in which case pretend to be somebody else um yeah that's what I would say uh Queen F3 is yeah that's not okay D3 nice Bishop G5 okay there there's no tactics here by the way if takes then takes and then if takes then takes and then you get your Rook trapped so that doesn't quite work oh now there's a tactic nice now is that a problem that looks like it could be a problem oh oh boy yeah you definitely don't want to trade the Queens if you're down material oh boy all right well white is now completely winning and takes that too oh this is hanging you go for danger levels but be careful doing that if suddenly you create two problems for yourself oh goodness oh they didn't do that no two pieces for a rook is not a good deal okay all right well we just pushed the pawns nice we okay white you could tell from right here White had eyes for the bishop white was just like me need Bishop even though you know we could have went for that or take it and then you know we just okay take take the bishop all right and now yes we trade everything and now what Rook on the seventh but I I think this person's like 500 so there's no way they learn this Rook on the seventh not right now Rook on this where you going where you oh my God you're going to hang The Rook oh my God he lost all the pawns oh my God he's going to hang The Rook again oh God he's going to hang The Rook again oh go oh how did the Knight eat all the PS oh he's going to hang The Rook okay the king is there now what the what why would he come on man that's crazy oh clutch clutch and is there a checkmating technique sort of almost stalemate all right oh no he walked into mate I mean this was this was got to be like 500 right like we we were ending on a good note got to be like got to be 500 you know active and then like I mean there was there was you know how they say there's not a thought behind those eyes it was it was more than that I mean it wasn't oh goodness all right um that was you know that was chess attempted that was attempted chess um I'm going to if this is like 900 I'm going to cry but it was a lot of just one movers and I mean okay if you're playing with white what you got to realize you just got to just got to go just got to get the Rook maximized an ability keep the king and Rook far apart when you're dealing with a knight that just just get get your pawns to the like you got to win some pawns it's very easy see like white white just like took and then like didn't defend any pawns and then still didn't play Rook C7 and then just proceeded to lose every single Pawn right you go to I don't there's no way it's 900 there's no way this is 900 um I would say like 650 is the absolute ceiling but I think it's like yeah I I think it's probably like like 500 let's see is it 500 I think it might even be like 480 but let's see oh 450 versus 496 damn I had a feeling I was like it's felt even more UGA than 500 bro if any of you are 500 you know 500 is Elo hell it is Elo hell it is crazy in the 500s nowadays you could be studying openings for white and black and have a coach you still can't get out of 500 cuz everybody's 500 yeah white played pretty well white played 750 black played like 500 wow all right it is good to be back it is good to be back with you
