hello everybody i am delighted to be here with father maximus konstas father maximus is really uh one of the world's most renowned scholars on st maximus the confessor of whom i talk about a lot on this channel hopefully even non-orthodox people by now will know who that is and how important he is he is has translated many of uh saint maxwell's work he's also written his own book in particular the art of seeing which is a powerful look at icons and so he has this interest in chatristics in the scholarly work but also in art which is why it seems like our stars were meant to align at some point and we get to this discussion um he is right now he's a professor of patristics and orthodox spirituality at a holy cross seminary he was a professor at harvard he was a monk for many years at simon petra on the holy mountain he's the director of the pappas patristic institute right now and so as you see he is someone who not only is a scholar but is also a a a monk and a spiritual practicer and so i'm really excited to be able to talk about uh say maximus and also about art and about how these two things come together to help us understand the world today [Music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] and so uh father maximus thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me today sure thanks for having me it's a pleasure to be here and so uh my first question is you have become the one of the world's most renowned scholars on saint maximus of course you come at it as an academic but also you made these discoveries as a priest and a monk i would like to hear a little bit about your journey and how the work of say maximus informed your academic career but also your own spiritual path your own spiritual discoveries yeah i mean i should say that there are many people uh in north america and western europe and in other places who have distinguished themselves as uh really great scholars of uh saint maximus the confessor i may or may not be one of them but there are many people who deserve that kind of uh praise uh he is a complex thinker and writer as you know and uh it takes a a a group of people to approach them from different perspectives to you know really begin to get at all the issues there so one person can't do it alone so hopefully scholars work together as a team as part of a community and we do what we do um my sort of doctoral work was in uh futuristics so this kind of a natural fit there though my initial studies were on the kind of classical christological controversy of the fifth century and it wasn't until some years later that i became a monk and received the name of maximus after maximus the confessor that i became increasingly curious about my new sort of patron saint and uh so i began to read uh because years ago it was very little that was available in english and uh i never had a course on maximus the confessor so he was for me anyway somewhat you know uncharted or unknown uh territory then i received an invitation from uh dunbar oaks which had just launched a new uh text and translation series known as the dumbarton oaks medieval library and if you're your viewers are interested in uh some patristic and byzantine texts there's a growing number of volumes there that they would find to be of uh interest so i had an opportunity to contribute something to the series and i decided i would choose a work by saint maximus that wasn't available in english and i chose the ambiguous of course i found out after that that the greek text needed to be edited and all of that so i'm not going to get into those details right now but uh the book was completed and finished in uh 2014 and uh it's it's in two volumes in that series and uh if i can toot my own horn a little bit uh they tell me that it's it's it's consistently been the number one best seller in uh the byzantines here with dumbarton yeah so that sold an incredible number of units so in case anybody's jealous or envious i don't get any royalties so so uh the other part of though the other thing that's worth mentioning maybe is that this was a project that i began and completed you know at the monastery and it it'll forever be a part of that experience for me because i think undertaking and trying to complete a project like that outside the monastery for me anyway would have been much more challenging and maybe even impossible i mean the monastery provides you not only with the stability and the routine without you know significant disruptions and interruptions but you also have a particular focus or clarity or quality of mind that is hard to find outside of that uh environment i mean you forget what that quality of mind is or what that clarity of mind is and then you then you need to remember you forget to even remember to so you have to remember to remember what it is that you are or who you are so i think it was really a gift of the monastery that enabled me to engage all of the complexities of his language and uh concepts because i often look back on that project and i sometimes wonder how i was able to do it because i live in boston now and i teach and it's just a different world and your energy and attention is just a very different thing so yeah because i i if i understand correctly when you started translating the ambiguous you had never fully read it before like you really kind of dived in all feet first let's say i mean it's a lengthy word and it was available only in greek and uh it's very difficult to read so you start at the beginning and you just don't get very far um without a translation or a better text and uh so it was it was a voyage of discovery definitely i mean it was sort of a because i was not familiar with the text it often felt like there was a revelation on every page it was all new to me at the time so that's amazing and you didn't you didn't mention but you did have to do yourself collating some of the greek texts themselves you had to find these different manuscripts and texts and try to read that to find the best version or to bring about a good version of the greek itself yeah i i going into it i thought it was going to be a quote easy translation project and then i found out that the text was in just terrible shape the only the the greek text that we had published in the standard greek petrology was just riddled with errors in places it was saying the opposite of what you know saint max has written so uh fortunately i had the training for my doctoral studies and i had to round up uh the actual manuscripts and collate them and and uh establish you know a better addition of the text which is what you see in the volume so it was it was a big project it took three years but uh i enjoyed every minute of it um and so like i mentioned at the beginning we both have several things in common of course one is a love of a maximus me let's say as an amateur um but also we have uh both have a love of liturgical art and icons in particular and there is a deep connection between the two in works uh like the mystic where say maximus creates this strict analogical relationship between a human person and the actual architecture of the church the church building and this is of course in line with how my house maximus creates this microcosm macrocosm relationship all through his writing and so could you help us understand a little more how sam maximus does this how he links the visible to the invisible the architecture to the body uh these types of relationships in his work yeah um i don't know if unfortunately it's the right adverb to to begin with but this is a when you're dealing with anything in maximus the confessor always tends toward kind of a thorny complexity so uh there's always multiple steps you kind of have to negotiate and uh i think the first thing to say is that there's definitely what you would call a sort of aesthetic dimension to his writing and to his worldview i mean he sees creation as a theophany as a literal manifestation of the divine so how could this be devoid of something that could be fairly called you know an aesthetic but the problem is is that that aesthetic so-called is really part of a much larger phenomenon and it would really be reductive to uh isolate it from uh that larger let's just call it phenomenon right now i mean it would be like separating the body from the soul or sensation from intellection and focusing just on one dimension of this larger kind of organic uh a whole i think something similar happens when people identify saint maximus as a philosopher and there's definitely a philosophical side to him but to reduce him to that i think is to impoverish all the other things that uh make him uh who he is now it's intellectually very respectable to say you're studying a late ancient philosopher but it's not really an accurate representation of who he was or what he did so again so aesthetics just should not be abstracted from this kind of larger metaphysical and cosmological uh fabric i mean there's also a liturgical fabric that's part of this too so it really needs to be seen in these in this larger kind of uh atmosphere or uh environment but but the question though is really interesting because the relationship between the visible and the invisible it's a very old kind of question or problem finds an interesting development or clarification in uh maximus and this is important i think because many people think that christianity is some kind of dualistic religion or that it's somehow hostile to matter or hostile to the body or things like that now i mean that might be true of some christian traditions i don't know but i think it's very difficult to level such a charge against orthodox christianity or or against uh maximus in this particular case i mean it's true and obvious i think that the greek fathers made use of the platonic uh tradition which is why they often get implicated in this charge of dualism but the platonic tradition was not nearly as dualistic as most people uh imagined i mean for the first thing you have you have sort of the early platonic dialogues which do tend toward a greater degree of dualism but the later platonic dialogues the times and so forth move in the direction of a very different construal of let's say the physical and uh the spiritual and by the time you get to a writer like platinus is kind of the so-called father of neoplatonism he's writing about 300 years or so after plato platinus i mean is so far beyond any kind of platonic uh dualism that he consistently avoids plato's spatial categories of above and below for example the the forms are above and they're reflected sort of in this lower world and he really avoids that kind of language and he replaces it with words and concepts that begin with this the greek uh uh uh uh preposition prefix scene like simpson or synthesis or synergy or synoptic or synaptic right this is a this is a part of speech that unifies things so platinus likes doesn't like to see things separate he likes to see them coupled in some way i mean united or unified in some form because he he himself sees the unity in all things and this is the way his sort of philosophy unfolds not as a kind of you know disjunction of the spiritual and the physical but they're on a kind of a continuum and i couldn't tell you where exactly somewhere in the amiads he makes this great quote where he says sensations here and by here he means in this life in this world sensations here are dim intellections but intellections there he means in the spiritual world are vivid sensations so they're on this kind of continuum and they're they're sort of the same thing but just in different places and therefore they have different uh sort of valences now i mean here's where we can here's what we need to locate maximus i mean in this later neoplatonic tradition that is decidedly not dualistic at all but uh uh embracing this kind of formula or model of uh unity and this is we see maximus everywhere interested in uh the immediacy of things and the kind of you know mutual presence of things to one another and even a kind of mutual interiority that things have uh to each other not their opposition whether it's spatially construed or uh otherwise and this is this makes sense because he was partly reacting to the originist tradition which was more dualistically platonic uh in that sense that i just described and there was no real difference there because in the kind of gnostic ascent of the mind you know back toward the one i mean differences would fall away so gender would fall away and the body would fall away individuality would fall away and there would be this return to a kind of you know homogeneous collective state in which there was no person or individual and of course maximus is pushing back against this so he comes down hard on uh particularity here but you know within this kind of uh union so i think the key here maybe is is the is the christological teaching of the council of calcium that many people are familiar with because it's the position that christ's two natures are related to one another through these famous four adverbs that the two natures are neither confused or altered so that means they retain their integrity one is not elided with the other or confused or conflated with the other so they're without confusion and they're without change but they're also they also coexist inseparably uh and uh undivided indivisibly so it's sort of like wanting it both ways that they're totally one but they're also at the same time totally uh distinct i think that becomes his christological model for this unity without uh confusion among the constituent elements of whatever it is the body the world the church you name it so and it's what's interesting at least to me in his in his theory his approach is that you can really apply it fractally at almost all levels of reality and it it actually becomes like a theory of becomes a theory of reality which is even today people are noticing the problem let's say of unity and multiplicity but same access really offers this capacity for things to both exist to a certain manner as one but also without containing their multiple elements at the level at which those multiple elements are real but that this doesn't prevent them from joining up together and so it creates like this this massive movement where all things can both exist at the level they exist but are united to their different purposes coming together up all the way into into christ and into god himself right i think it's funny because i think in our world at least nowadays we're trying to sort that question out politically and that may or may not be the best place to do it but we have our own version of this dilemma let's say not in terms of metaphysics and the one and the many and so forth but in terms of the kinds of you know social identity cultural politics and things like that so it's funny how the the kind of the the language or not the language but the the conceptual structure remains in place but it's it's construed on a very different level yeah one of the theories that i've had about the modern world or like let's say late christianity and modernism is that it is a kind of deincarnation where you start to have ideal idealist forms to manifest themselves and at the same time you have this kind of gross materialism but both of them seem to kind of split you know and so at the same time as you have people being all these types of materials you have theosophical ideas and all these esotericists going on at the same time whereas say maximus just offers this beautiful capacity for synthesis you know where where the highest spiritual insights are not contradictory to the phenomena in which they are embodied they actually are they hold them together in a very similar way as the way that platinus was mentioning it uh how you quoted planets at the outset yeah i think i think you could see this as a kind of almost baroque philosophical construction but you could also say that you could also see it as a kind of exegesis on some very basic principles in the gospel so because something like something as small and as minute as a mustard seed right can somehow be a symbol of the kingdom of heaven or that a human being a human person can be the image of god suggests that you know there's some sort of analogical world here that contains symbolic uh correspondences in other words that there are particular entities or things in the world but they're not unconnected or unrelated so what i'd like to look at is you know we see how say maximus draws these analogies across different levels of being and so he says things like the you know the liturgy that we encounter in the church is also happening happening invisibly in you and just as christ manifests himself the eucharist you know christ manifests himself in your heart he does these plays where he's he's constantly moving you know across different levels of being to show something which is not just an interpretation of scripture or an exposition of tradition but really ends up being like we're talking about a theory of reality itself but what i'd like to because he does talk about this liturgical space and then the inner space um and so i'd like you to talk a little bit about how liturgy and asceticism shape the world we live in you know how we embodying these practices can help us make sense of things that you know that we don't usually attribute to the sacred or to religion itself sure you had mentioned uh saint maximus's work uh the mr goji and that's really where so much of this kind of comes to the fore and i'll take advantage of the opportunity to mention that uh the patriotistics institute that i'm directing these days is uh will be holding a uh sponsoring a conference on the mr goji in early april you can find out more about it on our website we have a great lineup of speakers and we have more speakers that we'll be announcing and we're hoping it'll be a very exciting uh and important uh event so sure liturgy and asceticism are two things that most people might not associate because like so many other things they get separated that liturgy is over here and a cynicism is somehow somewhere else perhaps even in tension with liturgy so i mean in the mysticology maximus describes this sort of movement across the three spaces or places of of the church building which for him are not northex naval sanctuary but nave sanctuary and altar table so it's not spaces but it's three places i suppose around which liturgical activity unfolds so the movement for him though is not simply a liturgical movement but it's also an ascetic movement now how does that happen that happens because he takes the convenient number of three three liturgical spaces and he correlates it to the three classic stages of the spiritual life or spiritual progress by which i mean what evagrius would have called the first stage which means practical asceticism base basically it's the keeping of the commandments it's the sort of entry-level kinds of aesthetic practices you need to kind of get on the path and start moving forward that would be the the activity that takes place in the nave is sort of asceticism let's say basic asceticism then the sanctuary is the space of contemplation which is what you arrive at after ascetic practice has somehow purified consciousness to the point where it's it's able to see certain things that it couldn't see earlier and then after that mapped onto the altar table and the eucharist is the experience of union uh with god so the liturgical movement now becomes simultaneously a sort of ascetic and contemplative uh movement and people see this i think rightly so as an attempt to get to synthesize the kind of dionysian tradition that maximus inherits which is all about hierarchies and liturgies and clerical orders and religious services and these kinds of things heavily ritualistic right and heavily hierarchical uh that's the one element that he takes the other element that uh max has sort of inherited is the kind of the evagrian spiritual tradition which is where the stages of the three stages of spiritual progress come from and he basically fuses the two together he maps the one onto the other uh so we have this kind of interesting convergence of let's say ecclesiology church structures with the ascetic life and the spiritual life and the mystical life again things that are often subject to a kind of disjunction he has brought together in the place in the church in the place of the liturgy so i think some people might be familiar with uh the way he's mapped this same ascetic trilogy or contemplative trilogy onto the clerical orders of the church because he says that the deacon is the one who has purified his consciousness through ascetical practice and the priest he says is the one who has illumined his mind with the knowledge of creation that's the division beyond the surface of creation into the intelligible structures of creation that he calls uh the logi then the bishop he says is the one who has perfected his mind mind in in union with the trinity so it's the three architectural spaces of the church it's also the three clerical orders that all coalesce in this kind of contemplative uh uh moment that's sort of the first step of all of this and you see with maximus it's always you're always playing what is it three-dimensional chess or something or right do you see do you see because i see uh something similar in the life of moses by saying gregor nissa where he creates this uh ascetic movement up the mountain you know into the divine darkness but then when he reaches into the divine darkness he receives the plan for the tabernacle and it's very fascinating because when he receives the plan for the tabernacle saint gregory describes the tabernacle as a church and he says things you know like the pillars of the tabernacle are actually saints and he actually he has the architectural pattern but then he also has a human pattern where he he maps on you know the different participants of the church onto this architectural structure right that's a great point yeah i mean uh that's actually definitely something that should be brought into the way the body and the temple correlate with one another in uh the mystagogy look on the one on the one hand this sort of percolates up from christ in the in the gospels identifying his body with the temple right so we have a very good precedent for these kinds of analogies and you have paul saying things like well the body is your body is a temple of the holy spirit so that the later writers like maximize develop this connection in the way that they do is again it's not it's not it's it might seem exotic or unusual but it does have deep roots in scripture i mean in these cases yeah because we are the body as a church we are the body of christ christ says that his body he lose his body being like the temple and then our bodies are like temples the analogy is already there in scripture you know most of you know most of the analogies that the fathers uh will kind of open up for us already there in the text you know but they they they just help us see them when we don't tend to see them in the first place right my impression is that these writers took scripture very very seriously i mean literally too but not only literally but they began there and they would read things like the lord saying you know the the mustard seed is is is a an image of the kingdom or whatever and they would say all right uh we'll accept that is true but now the question is under what sort of conditions might a statement like that be possible to be true for that to work what exactly has to be going on what sort of a world does it need to be so that a mustard seed can somehow have this relationship with this sort of noetic reality called the kingdom yeah when what you see is that they think that way like their mind is scripture it's amazing that all they don't even explicitly sometimes make parallels and you almost have to know scripture yourself to realize that they're connecting different images together like and when i read saint ephraim i get that so much he doesn't tell you where he's getting it but you almost have to know all scripture to then see oh why he's saying this because of this text in the psalms and this text in scripture and he's connecting them without telling me that he's doing it the other day with some students we're reading origins prologue to the commentary on the song of songs and origin gives you every impression that he knows the entire bible by heart and can move between books and chapters and verses i mean faster than a database could uh it's really just extraordinary to see i mean someone with that i mean he was rare it was a rare gift that he had but it's extraordinary to see what can be done when one has that kind of awareness of the text let's say that deep knowledge of it but i wanted to go back to what we started to say about the movement through the temple space the liturgical movement because if the goal of everything is the vision of god which is you know sort of unity with god then you know whatever stands in the way of that vision needs to be addressed which is why so many of the church fathers spend their time talking about the passions and other kinds of obstacles to the vision not because they're fixated on the negative aspects of human existence but they want people to be well so they can have this relationship with god but if you're saddled with all kinds of we would call them things like addictions and self-destructive behaviors and so forth you're not going to you know get very far down the road toward the vision of god i mean there's they'll quote the the attitude that blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god so the vision of god then presupposes purity of heart so before we sit around like fools talking about the vision of god we need to talk about right what's what's obstructing that right that vision right how do we attain purity of heart because that seems to be the proximate goal that will get us to the ultimate goal that we've been called to uh arrive at and this is i think a big part of of maximus's approach to it's not it's not all sort of beatific visions there's a there's a labor that has to take place there's a kind of agony of of birth uh that consciousness has to uh uh go through so our disordered desires he would say are kind of misinterpreting the world to us we're seeing the world through the lenses or the filters of our disordered desires of our passions as he would call them these places in life where you've gotten stuck or fixated on uh certain things and the passions are interested in pleasure not the truth so they'll never get us to the truth of what's out there what's in the world so there has to be this reformation in a sense of of uh consciousness of awareness which they call you know purification and other uh kinds of uh terms like that and the way that i think of it is through to a helpful kind of phrase in which we could say that every depth has a surface but not every surface has a depth so that's why we need to attend to the depth of things and not just to the surfaces and i think this is a particular challenge for us in our day and age because we are obsessed with surfaces fascinated with surfaces and uh have a very hard time seeing past them because all of reality has somehow been absorbed into these surfaces and we take the surface of the phenomenon as the kind of ultimate object of uh a desire but once you're able to see through once the surface of creation becomes transparent and i'm not just seeing what i'm projecting onto it based on what my own libido wants to do once i'm able to you know see through the the transparent once the world becomes transparent to me then i i'm able to begin to see what maximus calls these intelligible principles or structures of uh creation which is the presence of god in the world it's the presence of god to the special way that god makes himself present to that world and once the saints or the artist grasps that or intuits in some way that intelligible structure then he or she is able to begin to transform the world on the basis of i mean that again that principle of divinity that is kind of informing the form that we see and one of the things that's important is these patterns or these structures they're not just the way we think of scientific rules or these these kind of abstract patterns but they they call us right they they are modes of being modes of engaging in uh with the world these are not the laws of nature right and they're not even subatomic elements they're they're they're spiritual principles it's actually i mean he calls them the logi which is the plural for the logos so it's the particular way that the logos makes itself present to a thing which is to say that the logos is not present to a rock in the same way that it's present to a tree in the same way that it's present to a human being in the same way that it has a particular mode of presence that is analogous to or in proportion to particular beings and to take it a step further that mode of the logos is presence to particular things makes them what they are it's that act of creation in a sense right so so he calls them the loahi and so through the created form one has the possibility to to to see the logos particularized by the uniform logos made multiforme in the plurality of the world and from there to proceed to a more direct or immediate understanding or relationship with the logos itself and ultimately the one of the secrets is that these logi if you pierce them enough they're ultimately the logo the logos himself that that ultimately behind the multiplicity of the of the logi you find the the one uh divine logos right he says it's quite clearly that you know the the many logie or the one logos and the one logos is the mini logi and yeah yeah and so so one of the things that surprises a lot of modern christians that i've noticed is they have this idea that uh the incarnation is a reaction to the fall right the incarnation is their god you know we sinned we did all these bad things god send god descends into the world to take our to take our place all of that type of language but in say maximus and not just him but definitely say maximus it appears very clearly that the incarnation of the god man is not only a reaction to the fall but it's actually the very purpose of creation um and so how can christ and the incarnation and the as the culmination of all things help us make sense of our our purpose our lives and our ultimate destiny yeah i think that's exactly right i mean without without reducing it to a caricature i think a western christian tradition has concentrated on this narrative of redemption in other words on the story of the fall and then the redemption of the fall through christ and through his suffering suffering crucifixion that seems to be the kind of major narrative of so much traditional western uh christianity but from the perspective of a writer like maximus the confessor and i think you could say more generally from the perspective of the orthodox theological tradition that story fall and redemption is actually a smaller story within a larger story sort of a smaller arc if you will that comes under this much larger arc and the larger art is really it's not fall and redemption but creation and deification so god creates the world what brings beings into existence for no other reason than to ultimately unite them to himself that's god's purpose in creation if you read say basil's uh hexahon his commentary on the opening verses of genesis he says well he comments on the verse here when god saw that it was good and then he asked well what exactly is god looking at that he thinks is so good and then he has this beautiful sort of kind of romantic passage about is god seeing purple mountains majesty and you know red sunsets and you know these kinds he says no he goes that's what we would think might be beautiful right but that's not what god is seeing at all god is seeing he says the purpose for which he brought things into being and that purpose is union with himself in christ and that's what he sees and that's what he says is beautiful so that's the divine plan for the pre-eternal divine plan is for creation and deification this is interrupted there's a parenthesis that opens up a smaller arc as i'm calling it of transgression and redemption and state maximum says that okay uh uh the the the manner or the mode of god's plan had to change but the purpose never changed the goal always remained the same god never took his eye in a sense off that aim even though he had to get at it from a slightly different way because of the contingency let's say uh of the fall so it was modified by human free choice and sin but not done away with in its sort of you know larger former features so and there's a way in which we also he goes very far so max because it's not just us we have we people will might tend to accept that humans are meant to be deified or meant to participate in god but there's a sense in his writings that it's it's everything like all of creation somehow at the level at which that's possible is meant to be united and be you know be part of the life of god participate in the life of god right i mean this is kind of a common idea among the greek fathers that the human person who was created last in the biblical account is kind of the the sum or the summation of the creative effort because it's in the human person that creation retains consciousness that matter attains consciousness in the human person so the human person now becomes the agent within creation that has the ability to uh recapitulate let's say within itself uh the whole of the created order this is i think really important for people today because one of the problems we have is this tendency in in scientism to try to view to view things and view meanings as apart from man but what same access offers and it's actually an interesting solution to the problem of emergency the problem of all these phenomena is the notion that no man is like a funnel where all of this meaning gathers into and there's no way to see the meaning of the world and there's no way to see the purposes of things in creation without going first through man and it that can really change a lot of the way in which people it brings us back to the more ancient way of thinking we can understand what aristotle we can reconnect with some of the things that aristotle talked about in terms of final causes if we see them as coming into man as this fulcrum which joins the two the invisible and visible together yeah absolutely and i think we can give this another twist because it's not simply the human person that's the the key or the linchpin here or one of the one of the words he uses the workshop and all of these things sort of are kind of you know maybe it's an artisanal or an artistic metaphor but it's the human person in christ because we failed to attain the goal that was established for our nature which is why christ came and did it for us in a sense or uh and showed us the way and made that way available to us so it's not just a human thing it's a human divine kind of work um you know you hear you hear lots of words today like justice or equality or i don't know truth or righteousness or whatever they are and they're largely detached from any kind of context and of course we that we proclaim them very loudly and we demand that demand them and insist on them but i think you know in in the in the christian tradition not just the orthodox tradition now but i think in the whole christian tradition those words don't exist not simply apart from human beings they don't exist upon i mean they don't make sense apart from christ in other words the whole tradition is this personalist tradition there are no abstract categories out there like justice or righteousness or uh uh equality or identity or you know you name it and all of these things have their locus in this redeemed humanity uh that we find in christ so it's his truth it's his justice it's his righteousness and you know i think a lot of this kind of language this sort of this fragmentation of the language has crept into many christian traditions but i think we adopted at our own peril because it's to forget this larger context in which those words originally were defined in a sense and and made sense yeah we see it in the in the modern attempt to demyth d mythologize the scripture and to try abstract these moral principles out of the narrative but uh we can see where that leads you know we can see in the in the 20th century and the 19th 20th century with the revolutions and all these this chaos we can see where to remove it from the narrative from the ritual from this participation you know it it uh it leads us into scary places right because that first you abstract the categories of the concepts then you impose them on societies or communities and uh you know as you said we we there are more than enough examples just from our own recent history to to illustrate what can go wrong so exactly so one of the things i mentioned at the outset is that we both have uh a love for art a liturgical art but art in general culture and how it is that christians can connect to culture and this is really something that i'm seeing that many artists especially christians artists today they really struggle at how to position themselves in the world and one of the the images that you bring about in your writing which i found very beautiful is you talk about the gifts that is the you know when people bring the gifts into um into the liturgy to for the bread and the wine to become the eucharist you mentioned that it's not just about giving up the raw materials but it's also bringing up you know human activity because these things have already been transformed um and so you get a sense in which it is this art which is also being brought to then be offered back to us as the blood and body of christ but there's also another important thread in the ascetic tradition of the church you know we see it in hezikazim is the suspicion towards imagination and i've seen many artists who kind of approach orthodoxy become completely bewildered when they read the philocalia or they read these ascetic writings and there's the they're completely strong they struggle on what to do because they don't understand the relationship between human making and this also suspicion of imagination and so um one of the things that i was surprised to men to notice is i saw your name in the credits for a recent movie a hidden life and uh and so i thought oh interesting to see that you have some connection with this project which many people have seen as um as being a powerful example of a christian story being told and so you know what advice do you have for artists for musicians architects you know uh but also writers filmmakers people who want to create culture today whether sacred art or secular art and how is it that they can do this as christians or even as secular people who want to act in truth and make beautiful things yeah i think i think i hear two sort of broad questions there and the first thing you started to talk about was the role of art i suppose or what can artists take from let's say the liturgical experience or the life of the church and i think you mentioned the gifts that's why i say this and it's interesting uh i mean one issue is that under under pressure from a certain form of scholarship we have to say we insist on this idea that well the eucharist is a meal and anything that detracts from a kind of you know dinner-like atmosphere is somehow wrong or bad now obviously it's a meal historically it began as a meal but we always want to avoid reductionism right so if you think about the eucharist i mean what happens you know maximus describes this liturgical movement through the church that climaxes on the altar table with the consecration of the eucharist which he covers in silence by the way he doesn't comment on that particular moment but we don't offer wheat and grapes alone we offer bread and wine which means what that we take the gifts that the creator has given us and with the the the power of technology and mind that the creator has also given us we transformed those gifts into something more than what they were and again that rests on the ability for the mind to see okay what what qualities in here within this wheat and within these grapes that that can be transformed or they can bring out something even greater about them and we offer that back and as you know uh we we offer that and we say thine own of the i don't know your own of your own your own gifts from your own gifts this is what we offer back to you we have nothing else to give god everything we have we've received from him but we don't just say okay are we gifting the same gift you gave us we express our gratitude by transforming it and offering it back in this remarkable truly remarkable way and this liturgical moment let's say this liturgical act i think becomes paradigmatic or should be paradigmatic for all human activity so i mean this means that something like work in science or in society should be based on wisdom and reason and not on another kind of a calculus or the organization of the the social world it should be justice and compassion not expedience or profit or something like that and for me the examples that come readily to mind are how this kind of paradigm inspires human art and human artists to sort of unearth the spiritual potentials just like what was in the wheat and what was in the grapes there are spiritual potentials within all matter within marble within wood within pigments within all kinds of things to unearth those principles and then to sort of show them forth in the place of the church in monumental art and uh uh architecture so that's that's the work of the artist at least as it's understood within uh the the the futuristic tradition in the orthodox tradition to enable in other words i think it's dimitri stanley stanley who talks about this and he speaks about it very beautifully he says the the the inside and the art of the artist the techne of the artist is that thing that practice which enables the elements of creation to join in the magnificent chant of the liturgy right they're voiceless until we give them that voice that they have there's an inner potential that we bring out and then we and that enters into the space of the church where everything is transformed there's no there are no raw materials lying around in the church everything is polished and carved and worked and drilled and painted and right it's this it represents a transfer it represents an icon in the sense of of the whole universe in a state of transformation there are two images that come to me right away is in reading this description of the gifts being brought up first of all the first thing that comes to me is the parable of the talents which i would never would have connected to this but seems to really uh join into this image of bringing you know god giving us things and then us having to make it fruitful and then bring it back and the other is the the new jerusalem itself there's an amazing uh little description of the new jerusalem where it says that the glories of all the nations are gathered into the holy city into the new jerusalem so this idea that all these positive things of what of human activity are gathered into this this final image of the of the holy city well the other idea there though is that is that it's not a return to a garden but there's a movement from garden from a quote natural state to what to this urban fabric yeah to this magnificent human artifact in a sense it's not a human artifact but the the image that's used is not of a forest or a grove or garden but it's it's it's a it's of a built environment right a structure an architecture and so sorry yes that's what i wanted because that's the hardest part for artists is the aesthetic part is this the aesthetic part of the assembly well the part the part where you read how because we know like let's say i let's say i create things and i know that there's a buffer there's a place like between any and the tradition and and the making which would be something like imagination and and i know that i use my imagination to create things and so it's hard for us when we read the texts that are so suspicious of imagination to know how is it to live like how how can we join these two things together right you know uh yeah that's right so that's a big there's a lot of people i've heard from others that talked about this the other day i watched with some of my students tarkovsky's uh andre rubler anyone who hasn't seen it you know was encouraged to run out and do so but it's largely about i mean obviously tarkovsky has projected his own artistic struggles into the figure of andre rublov who despite the fact that it's a three-hour movie about an iconographer he never picks up a paintbrush right because the problem that rupalev is facing which is the problem tarkovsky was facing is how can one be an artist how can one create or be creative in a world torn apart by violence and hatred and suffering under oppression so so there's that it's sort of like that famous statement by teodoradorno that poetry after auschwitz is barbaric which actually adorno retracted at some later part but there is a question about just how does one proceed to be artistic or creative in a world uh uh such as ours but i think the precondition to go back to what i said a moment ago the precondition for artistic uh uh uh vision or creativity has to begin in that place of asceticism in a sense a kind of self-denial you know there's there's a a great passage from one of tchaikovsky's uh journals from the from the 70s and he says extraordinary things about artistic talent because he was nothing if not a great artist and he says that talent is not so much a gift from god it's really it's it's a cross that the artist is doomed to carry right because there is a kind of you look at there's a demonism in art right i mean great writers and alcoholism and all these other cliches that we have or you know rock stars and the stuff that the trouble they get into and whatnot i mean there's something about art that can be that could be dangerous let's say or or you know uh you pay for it with your soul deals with the devil think of all of the popular cliches and stuff right so he says it's it's a cross to be carried which i think is that that uh ascetic moment where whatever we have like st maximum says everything needs a cross because it's either too much or too little nothing is quite right and it needs to be crucified in a sense is that great uh it's a buddhist once said that i like the cross because it crosses out the eye right so you know the the you know iris murdoch talks about the unselving of the artist that has to take but she uses the image of marcias who's played by apollo which again is sort of the price that the uh uh artist uh uh has to pay or should pay and since you mentioned uh a hidden life i think one of my favorite scenes in the whole film is where the main character franz jaegersteiner is in his church which is being uh the wall paintings of which are being uh refurbished i suppose by an artist and jager center is sort of the church warden so they spend time together and they're talking and the artist is this very interesting uh figure he's a voice for somebody or something and uh he's uh he's almost like theophone by the way in andre rubler because he's a little not exactly sarcastic but maybe a touch cynical or world weary whatever but he says at one point he says he's talking about revolt the role of the artist the role of the the iconographer in a way and he says at one point you know how can i how can i be painting these images he says how can i paint what i haven't lived and then at the end it becomes a voiceover it's the same artist speaking and malik plays the voice as a voiceover as oh this beautiful landscape with a setting sun and the last thing he says is one day i hope to paint a true christ which to me is just that was worth the price of admission alone so it's like i have a friend he's a he's a painter he's a priest in california he's a fantastic uh painter he actually painted the portrait of me that you see on the inside flap of the art of seeing book i was camera shy at the time so i had a portrait commission but he didn't he did it as a as a as a favor as a expression of his friendship but he said once i asked him what i said what is art right he said he goes art he said without even thinking art is the search for an archetype which is sort of what the paper in hidden life is saying right one day i hope to paint a true christ and we have this theology in the church of image and likeness and the ima it's kind of thing where the image bears uh a resemblance to or to the to the archetype to the source but the image longs for the source it yearns for the source it's not it's not a visual thing only it's a relationship of desire that's created because the image that emerges from the archetype longs for reunion uh with its source that's why i say that art is this sort of search for an archetype um i mean we're still having to imagination yet but we're getting there okay do you what do you think i mean i i think that what you're saying is very powerful i on the one hand i see it on the other hand i have these immense contradictions you know because i in my own experience let's say like in my own experience i've i've found the strange moment where you know that the works that say i'm making icons i'm making icons for churches i'm making icons for people and the the works which are objectively better sometimes and that when people look at them they'll say crazy things like you know oh this the holy spirit you know did something and i know that that when i made that i was not like i was not there like i was in a massive fight with my wife or i was completely off the off off off the off the road and then the opposite sometimes isn't necessarily true like those moments where you know i'm really rigorous with my daily prayers and i'm doing the jesus prayer i'm doing that won't necessarily produce better better icons and so i it's like i struggle because i i can see what you're saying in the ideal but in the practice it seems like there's a strangeness about our path which doesn't necessarily i sometimes i i see it almost as in a way it is kind of grace in the sense that just like you know a priest can let's say the the liturgy is efficient no matter what the priest is going through and so sometimes i get the feeling that maybe that's what's going on because i can't account let's say for the quality of my work in my spiritual life that's a very strong confession i'm making but it's true oh i mean there are different moments right i mean you're right i'm i'm talking about the ideal because that's sort of like the point of light that i'm gesturing toward that's the goal that's the aim that's the the idea without ideals without these things where would we be um but that's not all there is i mean you know that's the thing every day in the life of a married couple over 50 years was like just an ongoing honeymoon right i mean if it was that by the way it would mean they never grew in their relationship either they say oh it's not like it wasn't when first got married well thank god for that right because you're not supposed to be standing still so i mean what you're describing is so sort of somewhere else on the map it gets back to the the struggle it gets back to this kind of you know burdensome sort of mixed situation that we're in that paul describes you know in terms of the things that i want to do i don't do and the things that uh uh well you know how the rest goes yeah um sort of at st maximus describes this as we're in this kind of middle state right now between creation and then deification and you know there's this being and then there's uh well-being and then there's eternal well-being we're in this middle place where we're trying to be well we're trying to live properly but of course no i mean it's like the parable of the wheat and the tears i mean everything is mixed together in this life and saint paul says if there's another law at work in my members that's hostile to god that doesn't want god right that doesn't mean that that's all there is to you just because you're having a bad day doesn't mean god can't work through you i'll spare you the uh injurious analogy of of of god speaking through the ass in the old testament i'll take it that's okay i'm fine with that oh i can do better you're a nice guy i'll do better than that it's even even the high priest spoke prophecy that that year not knowing what he was saying but because of his office right so who can i mean who can who can unfold all of these mysteries of life i mean they're just the complexities of what we're called to sort of try to work through but what is your advice for the proper use of imagination this is the hardest one i kept the hardest for the last for the ending well i i think i think there's a lot of confusion about this word in the first place and i think when most of us hear that word and use that word we're probably conditioned by i don't know the roman the romantic period people like coleridge and what they have to say about the power of the imagination it's also coupled with this kind of particularly modern understanding of the artist as a sort of isolated creative genius so all of those things get you know mixed up with all of this and in english imagination isn't a nice sounding word so this image is a nice word then there's imagination and we're always talking about reimagining things and that's always a good thing or whatever but in funny in it so it's innocuous imagine image imagination in greek though the word for image is icon or igor right in the modern version but imagination in greek is fandasia where we get our english word fantasy from so we're not we're not even in the same ballpark anymore so imagination you know that sounds good right that sounds nice but fantasy that's already a different kind of idea or uh experience and i've heard many uh modern day church artists whether they're iconographers or church musicians or church architects and they're all saying look we don't want to be condemned to repeating the prototypes of the past right we we are creative artists we have our talents we have our gifts and we want to do our own thing right that's what that's what people a long time ago did right when where did those prototypes come from somebody conjured those things up so why can't we do the same i've heard that i've heard this many many times i'll come back to this but before i do i want to lay out a couple of things that i think are critical in this conversation just play two points basically everybody knows the story of jacob's dream where the poor guy goes to sleep with a stone for a pillow and then has this uh dream of the heavenly ladder now when he wakes up what does jacob do the bible says he raises the stone and he anoints it he builds an altar he basically he builds an altar so the vision that he had which is not a product of his fantasy or imagination or because he was sleeping on a rock or you know his food he had for dinner is somehow influencing it no we understand it to be a revelation that's given to him so the the the the divine revelation that he receives somehow spontaneously results in the creation of sacred space that's that's the kind of the minor example that i have the major example that everybody knows is and it's the best one is moses's entry into the dark cloud where he sees what the archetype you mentioned it earlier of the celestial uh tabernacle this is revealed to him and god gives him specific directions about how to construct it and on what days and what materials to use and an entire plan a blueprint for reproducing in in matter right this immaterial reality right for this material image of the immaterial and invisible celestial uh tabernacle so we have this heavenly archetype or this heavenly form that now becomes reflected and built in the represented in the uh material world now most people if they heard that sentence alone they would say oh he must be talking about plato it sounds like there are forms up there and then they sort of have their material shadows down in the world where leave it where we live right but moses lived about what is it a thousand years before plato right so so this is why you have that great saying by the second century philosopher rumenius who gets it from an earlier alexandrian hellenistic jewish thinker aristotle and he says well he says don't get too excited about plato he said after all what is plato if not moses speaking attic greek yeah so so this is not the platonic view of the world this is the priestly view of the world right and we we deny ourselves as tremendous resource if we dismiss it as so much uh platonism so the idea i think in other words any artist who is who thinks that art is about putting across an idea or propagating a personal thought or some sort of prayer i mean i would ask that person to think about these biblical passages and what they've meant to the church right and that that maybe maybe iconography is not reducible to art in the modern sense and maybe the making of icons is not simply some private creative thing that i do or that you do to sort of satisfy some creative impulse now having said all of that i don't want to deny a place for the imagination but it has to be tempered it has to be disciplined it has to be educated it has to be part of this larger liturgical movement that uh we've been talking about uh here which is why nearly all so many iconographers in the church are are saints i mean andre ruble was recently yeah so yeah no i think i think that your insight is is is right and i the way that i kind of see it is that there's a there's a hierarchy to say it that way that is there's a way in which you have like an imac you can imagine something like you have uh you know the life of the saint and then you have the ideography and then a little bit lower down on that ladder you'll have something like legends of about these saints that are yeah you know they end up being a little more fantastical you know and so there's a sense in which we don't we kind of look at these legends we find them fun and amusing or we we find them uh interesting to help us kind of see a bit further but then we also have higher versions of these stories and you see it it almost seems like you see that even in apocryphal literature right where we have scripture and then we have certain apocrypha which are pretty that's a pretty kosher in a way and then you it kind of comes down into all these more and more fantastical versions of apocrypha but even in those fantastical ones we might have some little glimpse there's a little seed that will be carried and will be kind of kept in the tradition um that's at least the way that i i try to uh to see it um and so the what it does is it leaves a possibility for something like a hidden life which is obviously not a liturgical work it's not it's not liturgical art but it it connects through little seeds to something that we can find at the let's say at higher levels of of of participation in the liturgy for example i know that if that layout makes sense to you yeah there's definitely to use your word there's definitely sort of a if you want a hierarchy of forms let's say uh everything from you know things revealed in scripture to apocryphal stories some of them have greater value than others and so forth so but i i think the thing to also say is that often these very seemingly naive kinds of stories contain you know tremendous wisdom right there's a one of my former colleagues he's since proposed god mr soul was an authority on the uh gospel of luke and uh francois bovan he was a swiss uh scholar of the new testament and his work was remarkable because i mean he knew the gospel of luke better than most people and he was also interested in these apocryphal traditions that that were based on the gospel of luke and he he saw these not as aberrations let's say or departures from the canonical narrative but simply different forms of exegesis because if you really thought about what the story was saying it wasn't some hokey kind of you know i don't know uh aesop's fable or i don't know what i mean something will be sounds famous this is really just another way of unfolding uh the the the biblical account by either by expanding it or by right so it doesn't always work because there are some apocryphal texts that the church has you know condemned or dismissed or whatever but others it's been happy to make use of so yeah we sometimes don't think there's christian would we midrash you know but i think definitely there is which is this interpretation through storytelling right we don't tell you the meaning we create we we expand parts of the story that are invisible or that are in between other facts and by expanding those you can actually see the connection that exists between the different aspects of the original story more than you could before and it seems like that's definitely something which exists in in christianity there's there's amazing legends in jacques varajin's golden legend you know this legend of the cross which describes how the cross was you know taken and then it became the rod of moses not across the tree in the in the garden became the rod of moses and all these different things until it then becomes the cross of christ and you think okay that's wild and crazy exactly but you think it's crazy but then if you look at how the exegesis is like how the the fathers will interpret the meaning of the cross you'll see that no it's actually doing in a narrative way what the fathers would do in a more just in a more descriptive way which is you know there is a connection between the rod of moses his staff the cross and the tree uh and so you can do that in a manner that that that brings it all together in a story so yeah right i mean there's a romano melodious very famous sixth century liturgical uh poet has a poem on the crucifixion and he talks about the cross being planted on golgotha and the roots of this because the word in the word for wood in greek siloam is the same word for a tree so when you say the cross was planted you're saying this tree was planted just the wood in other words was planted the wood of the cross the tree and the roots of the thing of the cross penetrate deep into the earth and they puncture the body of death so it's sort of like the world's tree in a way yeah and whether or not romanos knew about that i have no idea but the idea presented itself to his mind and there it is in that in that konjac in that poem so it's wonderful well we've been going for much longer than i'd planned because this is just a great conversation but i think i think that we've given people quite enough to to think about uh and to explore uh and so i i encourage everybody to to look into the conference which is happening this spring if you can go the people that are going to be there are really the summits i've mentioned many of them on this channel before and so i think it would really it would be a good place for a lot of the people watching these videos to uh to learn more about zimax and how it connects to the world today and so father maxwell thank you for your time thank you for for taking this time with me i really appreciate it it was it was a lot of fun and maybe we'll do it again i hope so that would be great thank you as you know the symbolic world is not just a bunch of videos on youtube we are also a podcast which you can find on your usual podcast platform but we also have a website with a blog and several very interesting articles by very intelligent people that have been thinking about symbolism on all kinds of subjects we also have a clips channel a facebook group you know there's a whole lot of ways that you can get more involved in the exploration and the discussion of symbolism don't forget that my brother matsuya wrote a book called the language of creation which is a very powerful synthesis of a lot of the ideas that explore and so please go ahead and explore this world you can also participate by you know buying things that i've designed t-shirts with different designs on them and you can also support this podcast and these videos through paypal or through patreon everybody who supports me has access to an extra video a month and there are also all kinds of other goodies and tiers
