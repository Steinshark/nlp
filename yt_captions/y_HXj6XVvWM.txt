you worked really hard to get where you are in 
your career whether you are just starting out or   further along and you don't want the reason you 
end up resenting your career or where you're at   because you took the wrong promotion what do you 
mean took the wrong promotion how can there be a   wrong promotion it's more money better title 
tiff you're crazy trust me as someone who's   been in the industry for over five years i have 
seen software developers get pushed into areas   into promotions that maybe wasn't right for them 
okay okay i'll listen to you i'll hear you out   what do you got for me today we are going to be 
talking about some tips that i always use before   accepting a promotion these are tips that 
i have learned from other mentors in the   industry and a promotion can mean so many 
different things and before we get into   some of the main tips when you are looking at 
a promotion and if it is right for you or not   i want to go through what some of the main 
career paths are for software engineers   and as a side note i feel like i always need to 
say this there always are exceptions to the rules   so these are just some roles that are very popular 
roles or career paths for software engineers   also of course before we go any further make sure 
to hit that subscribe button for more tech coding   career videos it's free and it really supports 
me and i love you all okay let's get into it   speaking of engineering leaders and getting 
promotions i really wanted to share with you   about a conference coming up i am so excited 
about for some of you you might remember i was   part of the interact conference for their last 
one and another one is coming up on october 25th   this is a completely free conference it's 
virtual and it's a great way to learn from   other engineering leaders network with 
others and there is so much value that   you can get from attending this conference one 
of the things that stood out to me for this   conference coming up is there are two tracks that 
you can focus on dev interrupted which is really   focusing on listening to stories of failure and 
redemption panels that will be featuring some of   the biggest name in engineering leadership there 
is also a live recording of the dev interrupted   podcast which by the way is a great podcast for 
anyone looking to listen to a developer podcast   and some tips on how to grow in your career 
then the second path that you can choose from is   linear beyond so you can learn about the tactical 
practices insights and success stories that linear   b customers have used to transform their value 
delivery pipeline two really great paths you can   choose from and i think both of them have a lot of 
value packed into them not to mention some of the   top companies will be there including slack stripe 
shopify and so many more one of my favorite things   about this conference although it is virtual they 
have a live chat so you can connect with speakers   and other audience members so if you see me there 
make sure to say hi and as far as networking goes   you get access to the dev interrupted discord 
channel this discord channel is filled with   other engineering leaders that you can bounce 
ideas off of learn from and it's a great way to   build your your virtual community i have linked 
the interact conference down below make sure to   sign up today as i mentioned it's completely 
free i will be there so i'll see you soon   and here's some more information about it it is 
an all-day event and yes it will be recorded but   make sure not to miss the real thing as there 
will be so much opportunities for networking   and virtually meeting other people also don't 
forget to tell your colleagues and your friends   this event is for everyone it's completely free 
so make sure to register okay let's get back into   promotions one of the most popular career paths 
for software engineers is project management   but what exactly is a product manager a product 
manager wears many different hats and the role can   vary company to company but on average the product 
management role consists of being responsible for   the development of products for an organization 
product managers really own the product strategy   and specify its functional requirements and 
manage future releases future releases i think   is a huge role of product managers and it's also 
a really great way that software engineers can   grow into that role coming from the understanding 
of how long features will take to build what   complexity is required all of that you can bring 
with a software engineering background another   very popular career path that software engineers 
go down is solutions architect this is actually   kind of a fun fact the career path i initially 
thought i was going down i've kind of pivoted   which i think is important to do but it's still 
a very popular career path for software engineers solutions architects are responsible for creating 
the overall vision and strategy when it comes to   a specific solution for a business problem now 
for example when i was working in consulting   as a software engineer there was a lot of 
solution architects needed because we were   working with different clients who had different 
problems and solution architects would come in   and find the best way to solve those problems 
and also in the solutions architect role it   can really vary on how much coding is done 
when i was speaking to solution architects   uh when i was interested in this career path one 
thing that stood out to me though is there isn't   on average that much coding of course you're 
going to go from software engineering into a   different role many of these roles won't be to the 
same degree coding but there is still some coding   required in solutions architect roles now that's 
on average of course some solution architects   don't code anymore and one of them really put it 
well for me which is you code as much as you want   to meaning you can get your hands in there as much 
as you want to another very popular career path   that software engineers it's actually a newer 
one when i say newer the role's been around   for a while but something that more software 
engineers are going towards is developer advocacy developer advocates have been around for a long 
time but have really recently become more popular   and in demand and i think that is because as we 
continue to move everything over to the digital   world the need for onboarding developers creating 
content around products is becoming more and more   essential companies are realizing that they need 
people to do developer advocacy like work now what   does a developer advocate do and that can really 
vary as well based on company to company developer   advocates though wear different hats when it 
comes to public speaking creating coding tutorials   documentation blog posts creating this community 
online and also to teaching developers how to use   their product and i think a really important part 
of developer advocacy is being able to do this   in a very authentic and genuine way so you don't 
want to come across as though you're part of the   sales team where you're like hey this is a great 
product but rather really building that authentic   community the first thing you really need to ask 
yourself is why do you want this promotion and   this can be for a ton of different reasons whether 
it be from the money the title maybe you just feel   like you're stagnant and you want to change this 
is really important to ask the why the why you   want this promotion because it will really depict 
if this promotion is right for you for example if   it is for more of a money aspect you want a higher 
salary a bigger bonus whatever the case may be   you might be asking yourself are you enjoying what 
you are actually doing but just not getting paid   enough for it if that is the case a promotion 
might not be your best next step maybe talking   to your manager about the situation about how you 
feel for a number of reasons why you need a higher   salary or if that doesn't work then maybe start 
looking at other places as well if it is because   you're actually interested in what the role 
entails that you will be doing in the promotion   that's a different story then that means that 
you are actually ready for this promotion you   are looking forward to it and you also understand 
that with a promotion it also means a change in   what you're actually doing on a day to day the 
next question that is really important to ask is   will you be managing people and this is a question 
i always say it's really important to ask because   a lot of times when you get the next promotion or 
get that manager title director title whatever the   case may be you need to really take a step back 
and see is this something you want as far as   managing people and sometimes it's not necessarily 
managing people sometimes it's managing processes   and i think there needs to be more clarity 
because when you're coming from a software   engineering or a software developer role into a 
management position it's easy to say oh managing   people will be great this will be so this will be 
easy but managing people is a whole other a whole   other world in itself comes with a lot of highs 
and a lot of lows and a lot of new challenges so   before you accept a promotion you really need to 
take a step back and also understand is managing   people or managing processes something that you're 
interested in and if so why what going back to the   first point why is so important because that will 
really depict if this promotion is right for you   and on the note of managing people if you are 
not managing or just managing a few people   you will need to understand or undercover 
where your time will be spent because if   you're not managing people or processes what are 
you going to be doing and these are totally fine   conversations totally normal conversations 
to have with your manager or people who are   going through the promotion process with you okay 
so i'm not going to be managing people what will   i be doing with my time how will it be different 
than what i am currently doing this will also give   you further insight as to what the promotion and 
the next step in your career will look like and   if it is a good fit for you or not for example ask 
about the types of decisions you'll be involved in   what meetings you'll attend if you'll be involved 
in the budget or decisions when it comes to   the actual product uh building features whatever 
the case may be but what does this role really   look like because i can guarantee if you are 
seeing someone do this role it is very different   from what you are viewing from the outside versus 
when you're actually doing it and that brings me   to my next point is ask and get clarity of what a 
typical day would look like and this is super easy   to do whether it's through someone who is already 
in that role or if no one's in that role if you're   at a smaller company speaking to others about what 
their expectations are for you in that promotion   and i think this is really important and it 
kind of touches on the next point i'm going   to make so i'll kind of combine them into one 
which is how technical will this role be i think   one of the things that as software engineers 
we get really nervous about or many of us do   is losing our technical skills and will we be 
continuing to grow them and build upon them or   as we grow in our career are is that aspect going 
to be lost for me i know that's something that i   really struggled with for a long time growing 
in my career especially in the direction i'm   growing my career with developer advocacy is 
will my technical skills be lost and the answer   is absolutely not for myself anyways but in the 
promotion you will take or are considering taking   you really need to know how much technical aspects 
will be included in this and are you okay with   that because it's one thing to say yeah i'm fine 
with it i'll build projects on the side but do you   really have the time to do that be very honest and 
candid with yourself have a very hard conversation   with yourself because if you accept a promotion 
and there's very little technical aspects involved   you might find yourself really resenting it 
or finding disdain for it and the reality   is as you grow in your career unfortunately it 
doesn't have to be this way but a lot of times   software engineers get pushed into roles that 
are not as technical and i think that's because   people are still figuring out how to 
grow in different areas when it comes   to software engineers for example i think 
a very common as we spoke about earlier   career path for software engineers is to move into 
product management and you can get into product   management without any software engineering 
skills or background but it's a very common   path for software engineers that i see and of 
course with product management if you come from   a software engineering background the skills and 
knowledge you have will really set you apart so   there is something to say for that but 
it's not needed and you will be using   very you'll still be using your knowledge but you 
won't be for example coding on a day-to-day basis   so you really need to step back and say are you 
okay with that because i also know some amazing   software engineers who were like no managing 
people managing processes that's not what i want   to do i want to code i want to code for the rest 
of my life you know nine to five coding and grow   that way grow into a senior engineer grow into 
a dev team lead but stay on the engineering path   okay let's talk a little bit about performance and 
this is something that is a huge shift for going   from a solo software engineering job where you are 
kind of working for the most part independently of   course you are collaborating with different teams 
designers product managers but for the most part   there is chunks in your day that you are focused 
on by yourself your coding whereas when you get   promoted and you continue to grow your career 
how will your performance be measured because   it will look a lot different from when you were 
solo coding people reviewing your prs to now   as more of a managerial or director level 
being evaluated based on your team's output   okay i hope that gave you some really good 
insight as to different things you should   look for before accepting a promotion because it 
can seem all great at first especially new title   maybe new salary new role it sounds really 
great but at the end of the day you need to   take a step back and really make sure that this 
aligns with your career and your vision for it   of course i think it's important to not have focus 
too narrow minded that you don't see opportunities   that you least expected come up of course that's 
important but you don't want to be forced or   pushed into a promotion just because it seems 
like the next step a lot of software engineers   don't want to go into a manager role or want to go 
into a director role they want to stay coding and   there are tons of different career paths that 
you can stay coding as well and grow that way   but before you accept that promotion you really 
need to know what the day to day looks like what   is involved how are you going to be evaluated 
speaking of leadership roles make sure to join me   at the interact conference i linked it down below 
it's completely free virtual and it's a great way   to network with other software engineering 
leaders or leaders in the tech industry you
