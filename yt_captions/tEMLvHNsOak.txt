all right five reasons why we should all be excited for the Galaxy S 10 as do this Samsung experience 10 which has already been leaked and shown by XDA months ahead of time the version I'm about to show you is ashy running on a Galaxy S 9 but is pretty much the software you'll get when the S 10 shifts there's a night theme aka dark mode which changes things up visually but also saves battery on AMOLED displays you've got a rounded card aesthetic which is a little closer to what we've seen on Google's pixel phones not to mention a completely redesigned multitasking menu and different looking navigation keys speaking of which you can also hide the nav bar and stick to gestures only something we're starting to expect on phones in 2019 but when XDA were digging through the code of this update they found something else which was pretty interesting number two options and just before we carry on today's video is brought to you by app matcom with a smarter way to find mobile apps on the Internet the weird thing this time round is that Samsung seems to be planning not two not three but four Galaxy S 10 smartphones we know that the code name for the s10 is beyond and this code that has been discovered talked about beyond 0 beyond one and two versions of beyond 2 which seems massively excessive but I think I have an explanation for it beyond 0 will apparently come with a flat 5.8 inch display which is a bit weird because Samsung hasn't used a flat display in a flagship phone since the galaxy s7 but there is a group of people who really don't like these edge displays because they distort the image make the phone more fragile and register accidental touches so it does make sense for Samsung to give people the option it seems like this device will be targeted squarely at the iPhone 10 ah it's gonna have a single camera like that phone and the fact that they're sticking to a flat display and not their usual edge displays kinda makes me think they're gonna angle it as an entry-level Galaxy S 10 they might call it the Galaxy S 10 light maybe even the Galaxy S 10 are depends how savage Samsung is feeling then you've got beyond 1 which would basically be the real s9 successor with a curved 5.8 inch screen and dual rear cameras up from single last time but then it gets interesting we've got two versions of beyond - each with six point four four inch curved displays as else which brings us on to number three triple cameras which is something that started off as little more than Chinese whispers but is now a legitimate and likely possibility you might know that something has already released its first device with three cameras the Galaxy a7 2018 and I suspect this was just the start as it is a mid-range phone its overall camera quality probably isn't the best but it does have an ultra wide lens with a 120 degree field of view this would be a great addition to the s10 the ability to get super wide angle shots is massively useful if you're trying to group photos or even just landscapes and on the subject of cameras it almost sounds like Samsung is getting a little bit trigger-happy with them the beyond one and both models of the beyond two are partly coming with two front-facing cameras but I could only find one source for this so I wouldn't put too much weight on that rumor now I mentioned that there were going to be two versions of beyond - what's that about well it leads us quite nicely on to number four 5g the top-tier Galaxy S 10 should be packing 5g functionality and to be honest I think it makes sense that they make two separate versions of the phone one that supports it and one that doesn't this 5g would need four to five more antennae in the phone than 4G and so will make it more expensive and seeing as 5g will only just be getting started when these phones come out it's not a feature that everyone will want but for those people who are willing to splurge the quoted specifications of 5g are miles ahead of 4G like to the point where it's not even funny theoretical speeds are as much as 1,000 times faster and real-world rates are pitched up 50 times faster the caveat being it's a bit of a gamble we don't really know when it's gonna reach full-scale adoption okay number five new design obviously this far ahead of launch samsung has been pretty tight-lipped about what these phones are going to look like but for some reason DJ code the CEO of Samsung Electronics decided to publicly confirm that the s10 phones will be a massive change which is a bit ambiguous but we can infer a few things given the hard time that something has given Apple for their notches I've no doubt that all four phones will be Nautilus as for the highest end phone you'll notice displays are getting consistently larger so the s9 + had a 6.2 inch display this time round we're looking at six point four four and bay what Samsung has done in the past few years they'll probably keep a similar body size which means higher screen to body ratio a leaked benchmark suggests we are now moving from an eighteen point five to nine aspect ratio to a 19 to 9 aspect ratio a taller screen and so combining this all together take the s9 Plus display stretch it vertically and this is roughly what to expect the other area I think we'll see a change is in the finishes you've already seen leaks for a wider variety of colors but this time around Samsung might actually try to do something that's a little bit more than a plain glass bath it looks like they've been experimenting with their less important devices like the China only Galaxy a nine star which can now be had any gradient finish that looks suspiciously like a huawei phone we've seen not too long ago literally every company has been stepping up their smartphone color game in 2018 so I think it'd be good to see Samsung follow suit okay so obviously this is not a comprehensive list the high-end s10 phones are also getting a next generation 7 nanometer chip not to mention is supposed in-display fingerprint scanner and I hope a better performing battery but nonetheless as you can probably tell there is a lot to be excited for and according to the rumors it's happening a lot sooner than it has in past years so let's take a quick tour of that match which is maybe the most personalized way to find apps anywhere on the internet we start by going to app matcom on your mobile phone and clicking start quiz as you answer questions at match starts to understand your preferences and their proprietary technology will then match you with applications that it decides you will enjoy using also additional quizzes will unlock based on what it is learnt about you for example I said I was into gaming and now the gaming 1.0 quits has unlocked and here it is learning my gaming preferences and like most platforms this works both ways they also have an odd platform for developers who are trying to get in front of the users searching for apps so check out our match comm in the description below there's no other app recommendation service out there quite like it [Music]
