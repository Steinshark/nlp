ladies and gentlemen whether you follow chess or not you may be familiar with the name Magnus Carlson that is because Magnus has been the best chess player in the world for about a decade and a half at this point and he will likely go down as the greatest chess player of all time but just like in any sport we are constantly searching for who is the future generation who is going to be a part of that next wave of athletes and players and participants who's going to ultimately hold the throne one day now in chess The Grandmaster title on average is now getting awarded at an age younger and younger every year people who are 12 and 13 years old are becoming Grand Masters in fact at the beginning of 20124 this news broke Andy Woodward became a Grandmaster Andy Woodward is American and his coach is yaroslav jobu strong Grand Master as well but if you notice the blurb at the bottom it says that hearu Nakamura has been generously sponsoring weekly lessons likely multiple sessions a week so hearu Nakamura himself streamer YouTuber top three player in the world and a candidate in chess has basically been raising a protege to take the throne from Magnus and in this video I'm going to show you a mini match that Andy Woodward played against Magnus Carlson a couple of days ago in chess.com it's the beautiful thing about Chess right now you used to have to to wait for the young Grand Masters to play the best players at the major tournaments now they can just play online and they played so many games and Andy beat Magnus Magnus lost to the youngest Grandmaster on the planet right now who's 13 years old nobody else is younger now he's not the youngest Grandmaster of all time to get the title but at the moment he is the youngest Grandmaster in the world and he managed to beat Magnus Carlson in a few games that doesn't mean he gets the title or anything like that but so I'm going to show you a few of the games they played this is the first game Andy Woodward ever played against Magnus Carlson he opened with D4 and Magnus went for the Dutch defense he's playing very provocatively Bishop G5 uh is the move that Andy chose by the way 3051 I mean that is a monster rating uh his um ches lcom username I believe is a Biblical verse Psalm and actually I looked it up and um it it it says do not be anxious about anything but in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving present your requests to God now um no God from any religion would be able to help me with my chest but it is a very religious time uh at the moment it's a holy time right now uh in the world we have obviously people celebrating Ramadan uh so I believe it's Ramadan Mubarak to those uh those participating and celebrating also Easter is coming up just a good time all right so sending uh all of you uh well wishes now let's get back to this brutal chess action Magnus went for this really aggressive approach to kick out Andy's pieces Andy struck right back all right that's the thing about these young players is that they're very good positionally but they're also very aggressive and uh you might be shocked in this game the science clashed and Magna sacrificed material he gave up his Knight in the center to shove Andy's pieces backwards but Andy is up a knight his first ever game against Magnus Carlson and on move 15 he has an extra piece now he just has to defend himself Magnus traps Andy's Knight on the edge of the board magn uh Andy jumps it into the position and Magnus keeps firing firing away with pawns you'll notice Andy is down about 40 seconds on the clock that's half nerves and it's also half just like I got to make sure I play all the best moves in this position look at Magnus with the discovered attack and all of a sudden we see the evaluation drop back down to equal as Magnus bulldozes the position and sacrifices a bunch of material and it seems like he's building The Edge on the clonk he's building The Edge on the position but Andy is staying calm and maintains a very big Advantage 1.4 first ever game against Magnus 13 years old and he's winning Bishop E6 and Andy goes straight into an end game where he is just up like no questions asked he is pinning this bishop to this Rook the only problem for him is he has 33 seconds B6 from Magnus now F4 here is probably required it looks like Andy's completely winning Magnus can't move anything but he's the best endgame player of all time and he's probably the best defensive player of all it's very close but between him and hikaro and it's probably hikaro on a given day it's one or the other and I mean he just gets out of the way and he just goes for an endgame of Knight and Knight and Rook versus two Rooks and Andy's winning and he's just got to get the pawn moving but he just can't he's stuck look at Andy he's got 20 seconds he's going for Magnus first ever game he's going to get a win but Magnus is just too Elusive and Andy here panics 18 seconds versus 104 he just doesn't he's not feeling it you know he's trying to p but if he pushes Magnus is just going to trap him over here and make it really difficult so he sacrifices he he unfortunately enters kind of like panic mode he tries to clear out the pieces and uh Magnus tricky as ever and by the way can we talk about Bad Manners right here Magnus plays Rook D1 check and promotes his Pawn to a rook I mean we talk about disrespecting the future generation this man is trying to make a statement or he's just trying to have some fun and game number one unfortunately or fortunately goes to the goat one to nothing versus the future generation but oh my goodness they kept going next game Magnus has white he's like you know what that first game was a little bit shaky let me see what this kid is made of we have a grunfeld defense all right this is one of the most well-known openings most studied openings black gives white a big Center but what black is going to do is strike at the center with the flank pawns by the way it's like if you can hear rattling it's pouring rain right now in New York so what better way to spend it than inside watching people who are better than you play chess and we see here Andy doing exactly that right we see Andy carrying out the plans of the groomfield but if we talk about experience Andy Woodward probably has about 20 games of highlevel groomfield experience meaning playing people better than him or equal to him in strength Magnus Carlson has been playing the grunfeld since he knew what letters were okay he could he couldn't even spell grunfeld he was studying grun felds and so he's going to try to make it very complicated and he goes directly at Andy's King but Andy actually to his credit is like not concerned a massive uh Clash of pieces there happens but again we're in an end game we're in an end game with Rooks Knights and Bishops Knight to G5 Magnus still Andy defending Andy needed to defend against Knight F7 and he's doing it Knight E6 Rook D6 position is still very much in the balance but you'll notice that this game Andy's the one up on time so he changed he changed what he did last game now he's up 30 seconds on the clock and all the momentum is with him he plays Rook C8 but that's a mistake and sometimes when you play too fast that happens what what he had to do here was he probably had to trade Bishops and just suffer in an end game where Magnus has this beautiful horse it's beautiful Norwegian stallion just that would be his fighter Name by the way um it's Norwegian stallion just standing over here defended defended right like this yeah unfortunately he goes here and it goes from bad to worse Rook takes C6 is just game over he wins a bishop you can't take this back cuz if you take back you can't take this is back because you get mated this Knight is too powerful stops the king's Escape hits the bishop and uh that was a very different game that was a very different Magnus two to nothing all right the series between the future and the present the first game was shaky but now it's two zip all right and they keep playing D4 this game Knight F6 last time it was a Dutch this time it's a London all right it's a queen Pawn London system G6 Knight D2 and I mean Andy just playing literally what you're supposed to do no London it doesn't matter if you're 3,44 or 30. 44 if your ELO is 30 you still learn the London if your ELO is 3044 you still learn the London Andy takes the entire Center because Magnus is not touching it Magnus plays E5 uh to the untrained ey that's a free Pawn after Pawn takes E5 but magnus's idea is that actually white cannot go here he cannot go there because when everything opens the bishop dies and that and Andy is too strong to fall for that so he gets chased around a little bit both sides castle like his principled and now we have a slow maneuvering game and I think this is sort of what Andy wanted he was like you know what the last game was a little bit too open it was a little bit too too much of a shootout versus Magnus so in this game let's just play a solid position unfortunately like you don't really have that luxury when you play Magnus he Maneuvers his Queen over here which looks beyond stupid but actually it's completely fine because the Rook pressures you're going to D double the queen will get out very quickly at a moment's notice not not over there that would be illegal and the pressure over here is really really strong so Andy goes here Magnus takes and plays Knight H5 and I mean his position is just is just crisscross applesauce all over the board Andy Knight G6 the problem is he spent 40 seconds on that move he sacrifices the Knight to open up the position now very simply if Pawn takes Bishop takes there's a fork however it's like poker you can call the bluff of your opponent and basically see what they're made of and so Magnus thinks for 26 seconds himself now both players are under a minute and a half we have this Knight F4 Magnus gives away the rook and a big train happens but black just has pressure you know like this is just annoying black has a knight and a light squared bishop and white has a rook and two pawns so theoretically Andy is up a pawn of material but it's a really tough position Queen F I mean look at magnus's Material the knights are just Bulletproof the bishop is trying to get rid of them and here Magnus is winning if he plays Bishop C8 Bishop C8 actually traps the queen straight up the queen is just trapped in the middle of the board which is kind of disgusting uh Magnus plays here and the reason that doesn't work is cuz Queen G4 and suddenly Andy's back in the game so now both guys have a minute Queen G6 Magnus decides you know what I'm going to win because I'm going to trade the Queens we're going to win an end game he's young right let's trade the pieces and he gets rid of this now he's got a rook his Rook enters the game Knight C6 Bishop F6 50 seconds versus 40 Knight Knight E5 and now we have rook and six versus knight bishop and four should be a draw but much easier to play with the two pieces also much easier to play when your name is Magnus Carlson F3 look at Magnus coming down that board and before you know it before you know it it's really really it's really bad King H2 B3 because you push your Pawn as far as possible the point is Bishop F5 and it's just a matter of time until you get to this Pawn Andy tries to fight back but he's down to 20 seconds Magnus has made his life really difficult and he's just not letting up Bishop F5 Andy down to 17 14 but Magnus stops the pawn and it's just a matter of time and even if he doesn't get to the pawn he's going to Simply win on time it takes 53 moves he cuts the communication he wins the pawn how by the way how incredible is that like from this position white is just a touch better and at the end of the game wh's pieces are completely cut from communicating with each other and Magnus get in protecting the bishop and the pawn and gets in over here and just wins because the pawn is queening I mean it's rid and and he does it with a 20 second time Advantage 3 to nothing so he beats Andy in a crazy back and forth game he beats him in a game he was losing but because he managed his time really well and kept things close he's now up three to nothing now I know what you're thinking you're probably thinking oh all right well it was just a drubbing nope three to nothing but this was the game Magnus played by the way Magnus to his credit did not have to keep playing playing this time he plays a C3 Sicilian he's trying not to let the kid have too much fun D5 is the main line takes takes uh okay Knight F6 I suppose is possible as well I I thought he just played Queen D5 I've never seen somebody play Knight F6 okay but there is Queen D5 anyway Bishop G4 Andy developing all his pieces this is a line where uh there's a lot of pandemonium you can like trade the Queens but instead white accepts the damage to the structure but has open lines has the light sored Bishop as well and clearly Andy a little bit on on a tilt this game as he allows Magnus to get a completely winning position in 10 moves it happens all right how many of you have lost three games in a row right every literally and I'm not think about this this video is going to have wherever it is if this video is on YouTube Facebook Instagram you know we we upload a short raise your hand if you've lost three chess games in a row I'll wait just right now do it I don't I have no way to verify this I've lost three games in a row you remember how debilitating that feels and then you lose like three more in a row that's what's happening to Andy right now he's allowing all of this to happen because he's a little bit on tilt Rook C1 and Knight C7 I mean many of us would just resign here we have no idea what we're even doing he plays E6 Magnus straight up takes a full Rook no questions asked it is literally plus five look right there you see that says plus five Bishop B4 check and he gets a pawn back but that's Checkmate super lowkey but actually Andy has a little bit of counterplay and sometimes in chess even if you're the greatest of all time the most difficult position to win is the one where you're winning like completely winning and you think it should be trivial but all of a sudden you know your opponent's trying to make a cut but Magnus is still doing a good knight C7 you can't even take the Knight if you take the Knight what I'm going to do here is I'm going to play Rook D1 you can't take my queen because it's a fork but Magnus doesn't do that and all of a sudden despite there being a lot of pressure on the black position Andy starts consolidating and again like I said this entire game the most difficult position to win is the one where you've been winning the whole time F5 and he just grabs a pawn now Magnus is like wait a minute what is happening let me take the pawn on A7 let me push my A and B pawns Rook A8 check King F7 A3 this is literally where Magnus has beaten Andy three out of four games this is the fourth so he's beaten him three out of three games scramble some sort of end game 50 to 40 Rook D4 Rook C4 Rook H7 Magnus completely winning 30 seconds and 13 seconds up that's it put him away Bishop B4 Rook H1 it's just a matter of time Andy's doing his best Andy this game is to his credit keeping pressure on the clock but I mean mag's just Unstoppable Rook H2 Rook whoa Andy creates counterplay all Magnus has to do is walk his pawns up he decides to sack The Rook for the Knight and push Andy Woodward from the top rope Counterattack stops both pawns oh my goodness magnus's entire position has been stopped he now has to play defense Here Comes Andy G3 equal material actually not even equal material Magnus is a pawn up but he's about to be down upon Pawn he has to play Rook D6 or Rook B1 he does but here comes Andy now the most insane defense is Rook B4 check the bishop blocks and now the only thing you can do is push it's the only thing you you have to push lose the bishop accept the draw Magnus is like accept the draw I'm up three to nothing but unfortunately his ego and also split-second decision-making gets in the way sometimes that's what happens you're like nobody is thinking I'm going to make a draw here but after Bishop C3 Andy plays the s Le Rook H1 and Magnus out of nowhere literally five moves ago completely winning like just put but because Andy created just enough counterplay all of a sudden nobody can stop the pawn you have to sacrifice your Rook but it's just not good enough and Andy Woodward wins the game because he Queens first and even though Magnus can get a queen his king is dead Andy Woodward has just beaten Magnus Carlson the youngest Grandmaster on planet Earth right now 13 years of age takes down Magnus Carlson not the oldest grandmas in the world no no it there's nothing like that but Magnus is uh 33 which is ancient in chess uh no jokes aside unbelievably impressive and by the way they kept battling they kept going they played a handful more games against each other and I'm going to show them all to you so that that that that was this was the first win let's see if Andy can build on he's got white in the next game he goes right back to work in London Magnus plays this line CD Bishop F5 and this very provocative line where you give up upon Pawn this is Theory theory in chess is stuff that has been studied many many times and it looks like a side might be blundering and it looks like a side might have lost the right to Castle and all of that is true but you can tell because players have studied this already they know that it's fine this is what theory is H5 we see Magnus building up a nice Fort for his King and ultimately after a massive Clash of pieces Andy castles but Magna starts hunting him on that side of the board and in this game Andy experiences something that everybody experiences which is an adrenaline rush after a really nice result sometimes you win a game and you're like and you try to play again and you treat the chess board like a casino and in 20 moves you get forked and you lose and Magnus right away sees control of it right back so 4 to one you're good but you got Lu lucky and I intend to make you realize you got lucky all right you got lucky in that game I would have let you on zip all right 4 to one let's go again all right Andy Woodward looking to write the ship it's 4 to one right now this time Magnus playing again into D4 C4 Knight C3 like I said we just saw this opening this was a grunfeld and like I said in that game he's got a lot of experience Magnus has a lot of experience being very annoying on the white side of a grunfeld he's played people like Maxim lra for example I mean he's been up against this legendary opening time and time again in his career Andy in this game gets real real hostile C5 trying to attack the center Magnus just walks right into the black position E6 knocking on the door Andy takes slides the king to safety but who's protecting the Knight well apparently the best move here is to play Knight to B6 lose the pawn with the tempo play Knight A4 lose this Pawn with a Tempo Knight C3 hits the queen sacrifice the Knight take on A1 and allow white to have a pawn two squares away from queening for the rest of the game and a bishop that's I mean yeah Andy doesn't do any of that he goes here but he just loses the Knight and this one is over in four moves earlier than the previous because if Bishop A1 Rook A1 he's just going to take this and two Bishops are just better than a rook and Andy won a game but all of a sudden it is back to 5 won and Magnus is in Cru I mean he just wins two games super quick doesn't break you know very nice win with black against the London very nice win and um in the very next game uh something really incredible happened D4 and uh Andy W in four moves I don't know if magna's disconnected I don't know if he played these games on a plane I don't know if his internet went out I don't know if he got a food delivery that took more than 3 minutes because he was arguing with the I don't know what happened but his time literally ran to zero and he lost I found this very funny can you imagine the clickbait of the video Magnus loses to the world's youngest grandmas in three moves yeah I'm not I'm not that I I'm not that ridiculous uh maybe I should you know what never say never that might be the name of this video I haven't even decided do we count that one I don't know but we should count the next one uh this game was played uh I think uh yeah like 10 minutes later I think Magnus reconnected I think Magnus won one more game D4 Knight F6 and this time Magnus played this so he kind of played an anti- London he did not want Andy to go back to playing Bishop F4 so Andy went Bishop G5 and as we can see in this position uh Magnus just says I have the queen side I'm very happy I'm going to build over here and then I'll probably develop my Bishop on this diagonal so Andy says right away I'm not going to let you be comfortable I love that just like attacking the World Champ right away I can't let you get comfortable Pawn takes A4 Bishop takes F6 the queen takes so black doesn't get the pawn structure damage C3 is played to block the queen from taking the pawn queen B6 is played to counter at the pawn again Queen C1 is played to defend the pawn bishop B7 attacks the pawn on D5 now that the queen went over here to defend the pawn over here that went when the queen went over to B6 now we defend now we undermine the center right chess is a logical game every single move these guys are making response to the previous bishop C4 defends the pawn and both sides Castle okay now it's time for Andy to take the pawn back he does and he has a slight Advantage it's a little bit difficult for black to develop pieces white kind of controls a lot of the important squares in the black position so Magnus goes backwards and he plays Queen F4 I mean he's got a very active position got a very very active position I really like this position D6 A5 now is a tough moment what do you do takes A5 well that's the end of the queen side pressure and now Magnus might have a thing to say on that side of the board so Andy decides I can't wait let me open the position even if it means my queen being under attack I am attacking the pawn on E6 Magnus says no you're not Bishop can't attack it anymore takes takes if we don't count that game it's six to one cuz he won another game that I didn't show you in the interest of time it's 6 to1 technically it's 6 to2 and it looks like it's about to be seven Bishop D3 Bishop F6 he threatens this and he says you know what I'm going to sacrifice I'm sacrificing a bishop Bishop to open up magnus's position worst case scenario I have a draw Pawn takes Queen takes Magnus blocks Knight G5 that's mate so magnus's defense runs his king queen H5 now the threat is Knight H7 you could go back you could make a draw right we already saw this Magnus had a draw maybe in hand if he if he played the right way but that was a little bit different he could play King G8 here it's probably a draw but he can also play King E7 and he doesn't have to make a draw he plays Queen A4 and decides I'm going to allow Andy to give me a fork and I'm going to allow him to take my Rook but I think I'm winning because I think I'm going to protect my king and then I'm going to block and then I'm going to push so Andy plays Rook e one and queen F5 I mean this is a very dangerous position but Magnus is defending it perfectly the queen rotates like a pendulum goes to G5 because like I said a queen trade wins the game for black queen trade wins the game for black like it's plus7 after this it's minus .1 like it's it's going to win the game from a practical standpoint so Andy keeps the queen on the board magnus's King meanwhile is on a spiritual journey and he's being protected C4 Oh What A Move sacrificing a pawn to open up the king Magnus says no thank you but now Pawn takes D5 Knight takes D5 Rook he blundered he needed to play King to D7 C4 was a brilliant move to make it practically difficult just make it difficult for Magnus to make a decision and all of a sudden The Rook is on E6 and Andy in this game No Nonsense picks up the win he gets another win versus Magnus so if you count the the game that he won by four moves he won three games if you don't count that game it was 6 to2 but here's a bonus they played one more game a day later this was just in the it's like a bullet brawl it's a speed tournament on ch.com this one was a one minute game so six to2 25% win rate 13 years old not so bad this is a game that they played a day later it started out as a very simple kind of double fing ketto setup C4 and he played extremely principled with white D4 C4 both Knights out Bishop out Bishop out very solid very straightforward life is good E6 Queen C2 both guys bringing the Rooks Magnus trying to take a little bit more Central space because you have to you can't just sit back in a chess game and hope for the best Andy playing it slow Magnus not playing it H5 taking some space disallowing G4 and he plops the Knight on B5 he plops that Knight there cuz it's actually really hard to get rid of cuz then you weaken this by a lot so you can't do that Queen C8 Knight C6 let's trade Knights okay but I'm going to put my Bishop on this diagonal it's a very tense position that attacks the queen so I got to get out of the way now we're we're shuffling there's a lot of shuffling going on and it's a bullet game and he attacks the queen side with B4 not allowing Magnus to be comfortable Pawn takes Pawn takes Knight to E4 Knight E4 Bishop E4 Bishop E4 Knight E4 okay what's going on there was a big exchange we both have a knight we both have a dark squ Bishop I have two you have three I have more space on that side of the board you have three I have four so dynamically the position is in the balance but and he's going to try to attack magnus's King by trading and he's going to try to attack over here Magnus is going to try to defend himself Rook D5 both guys about 40 seconds on the clock the queen goes back now we trade believe it or not the best move in this position for Magnus is not to take the bishop but to take the Knight as a human that looks really stupid because you just allow yourself all these weaknesses but the computer is unafraid just says take the pawn I'm never getting mated because I can sack the rook and then I take one back so that's the pro but Magnus human being King G7 no Bishops we have the following position 36 versus 38 equal but we know what happened yesterday in the couple of games that they played King H7 here we go Rook D1 wait a minute Rook D1 that's a fork Andy set a trap and he set a trap and I don't know if Magnus voluntarily set fell into this trap because he thought the Trap didn't work he thought that he was trapping the Trapper but I think Andy knew that maybe Magnus thought he was trapping the Trapper but actually he was trapped it's crazy Knight C3 is a triple Fork it's a triple Fork it hits three but it opens the line toward the the king Rook takes H5 one Rook is now escaping from the fork you can't take King G7 you pin the Knight to the K that's the best move by the way played in point4 seconds Magnus has to take Andy now gets a knight and a pawn for The Rook which is not enough material but the king is butt naked F6 Rook D5 going for the H5 Pawn Magnus defending himself the Knight hops in oh my goodness this is completely nuts the attack is so powerful the king is also safe Rook E5 it's a great move by Magnus trying to trade the Rooks and he plays the best move here too Knight F3 forcing Magnus to move the Rook if you take take then the queen opens up the line of sight on the C7 Pawn so when this train happens you can't go here because I take if King G6 I take on B6 and I have too many pawns Magnus notices that plays Rook E8 Knight to oh my God Knight to G5 is incredible Knight to G5 is such a ridiculous move it is utilizing the pin on this Pawn to disallow the capture the the queen is threatened if you just go here I play Knight E6 my knight is going to live there forever but if you take the pawn on D5 disallowing Knight E6 then I take on C7 which is the pawn that your queen was protecting Magnus decides I have to go for it but now all of a sudden his King is really weak King G6 now Andy Woodward here can simply back his Knight up and play the game for the rest of Eternity but instead he goes for the glory he thinks for 12 seconds and he plays Queen H7 check he goes all in and the King is out in the open Andy Woodward has sacrificed his Knight he is down a full Rook but it's only a draw he has a draw here by Perpetual check if he creates a fortress around the king and makes a draw by repetition instead he goes all in and it's losing but Magnus has to find why Queen G3 is literally mate G3 King H3 there's mate swirling Queen F6 there are mates swirling Magnus unfortunately finds the best move not only is that a threat on the queen it is a threat of checkmates so Queen F6 has to be check and now the only winning move is Rook G5 if you play King G4 Queen F4 is literally mate Rook G5 is winning Queen G5 is a draw Rook G5 is winning because if you play F4 now Queen G2 is mate it's crazy I mean there are mates all over the board but Magnus goes here thinking the attack is done but it's not Pawn to G3 and queen G2 is a mate so now the only winning move is Queen G7 Magnus with 14 seconds does not find it and not only does he not find it he walks into a fork he loses his Queen he loses the rest of his pawns and on the 50th move of the game he loses the entire game and Andy Woodward beats Magnus Carlson two games in a row he beat him in the last Blitz game that they played and he beats him in the only bullet game that they have ever played in a crazy position where he sacrificed material to bring magnus's King forward this is awesome you can add Andy Woodward to the list of the young players that have managed to get a win against Magnus he has never played him over the board I would imagine it would go differently in a serious face- to-face tournament but this is so cool cuz Andy became a Grandmaster 2 months ago and he's 13 and never before history could you play a player that was 20 years older than you 20 and get a couple of competitive games against them and even beat them Andy Woodward was not even born when Magnus I think cross number one in the [Laughter] world that's all I have to say uh I hope you enjoyed get out of here
