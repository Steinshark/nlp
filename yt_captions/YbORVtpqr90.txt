you are just a machine an imitation of life can a robot write a symphony can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece can you I think we need to talk about AI then the video I made about how I learned to code in four months at one point of that video I said this so many jobs of software Engineers I know it's not going to be replaced by AER anytime soon I was always getting all these comments in that video being like Oh but what if AI actually takes our jobs and I was always like there's no way that's actually gonna happen and then over time those comments sort of like died off until at one point I started getting them again and the thing is that at this point they weren't used in that video they were in like all of my videos and they were all mentioning this one thing called chat GPT a new artificial intelligence tool is going viral for cranking out entire essays in a matter of seconds chat GPT is poised to change the way we interact with computers in fact chat GPT wrote everything I just said I want to understand what this thing actually is what can it do and most importantly for you right canny replace or threaten our jobs and I also thought that rather than just giving you some speculation I have this exact job that we're all thinking that is going to be replaced by this AI so why wouldn't I just try it why wouldn't I give this AI some of the things that I regularly have to do in my job and see if you can do it so that's what we're going to be doing today but first let me do some research and get back to you okay so you might think that the whole story with artificial intelligence started with like computers and like internet and stuff but Humanity's fascination with artificial life actually dates as far back as the ancient Greek mythology that imagine this giant bronze man called Talos built by HEPA Estus the Greek god of invention and blacksmithing today however AI is not a myth it's very very real the thing is that the potential for AI to Revolution Our Lives is only just beginning with the AI already does a bunch of things for us right but the thing that we're all trying to get to we AI the thing that I guess really scares most people is this idea of General AI it is AI that can do everything and this right here is I think the biggest step that I've ever seen in the evolution of AI because it's not like it can just give you information it can draw images it can give you video scripts write code you can do a whole bunch of things and like that is the thing that is is making it so scary for many people so with all of this understanding can you do my software engineer job for me now unfortunately I can't exactly show you the exact tasks that I'm doing in my job because I will be fired and possibly sued so what are we going to be doing instead is I've created Five tasks for this AI to complete that are equivalent for the kind of things that I'm doing every day in my job and I promise you I haven't tried this before filming this section so you're getting my live reaction here task number one I want the AI to create a nav bar for a react website and here is an example dude that's actually pretty good okay so the first version he gave us gave us this nav bar but didn't have any style so I would still have to make the Styles myself except I didn't because I just told it to make styles for the above so I just copy pasted this the full number with Styles into my application and it renders and it looks pretty good okay so the next thing I wanted to do is let's say I have this block of java code with some endpoints and some of them are deprecated so one thing I had to do in my job is like find all the deprecated endpoints for like a bunch of repositories and then just delete all of them he found them and he removed them I guess that's not like the most complicated thing to do and the thing is you know this code block right here it wasn't written by me what I did is I asked the bot to give me a Java controller with some deprecated endpoints to use as an example because I couldn't be bothered to do it myself and it just did it just like that um okay next task for task number three I told the bot to create uni test for a piece of java core because to be honest creating tests is pretty boring and I don't want to do it myself and it did it absolutely perfectly for the next task however I brought up the difficulty by telling it to complete the hardest problem in cs50 and it did it in less than a minute oh my God now everyone who's doing all these courses can literally just cheat I really couldn't believe my eyes at this point and with one task left this video was definitely heading for a much different conclusion than I initially thought these works are literally I quit build me a budgeting application that is better than any other budgeting part but the budgeting application out there complex tasks that requires a lot of plan okay so it's not actually gonna do it for me it just like gives me ideas but these ideas are pretty damn good like okay okay okay let's let's let's just stop if you just stop and if you just think about this like one observation I have is that in a way this seems like it's kind of like a very fast Googling machine I don't know exactly how it's finding these but like it is from like human input from the internet like from a bunch of data in a way you give someone access to Google and that person knows exactly what to ask Google already even without this book they could Truly find answers to a lot of these I don't think this can replace jobs at least not anytime soon if ever here's why when you're writing code the value is not being created when you actually write the code the value is being created when you formulate in your mind what you want to build in other words when you know what to ask and you think of coding like building a house when you build a house the value isn't really being created when you lay down the bricks because before you lay down the bricks to build the house the house needs to be architected it needs to be designed you need to know exactly where and how to lay the bricks to make sure that the house doesn't fall down right so even if there was an automated machine like there already are they're like cranes and like tools and whatever we still need humans to actually architect the house and that's sort of how I see the situation here with this AI but I suppose the question here isn't whether AI can replace our jobs now but whether I can do so at some point in the future I guess that's what we're really concerned about here we can think of all human tasks as sort of like this bucket where all the tasks up here are very high in complexity and all the tasks down here are low in complexity so like very repetitive tasks and then up here are very complex things like architecting a suite of microservices or architecting a multi-story building or understanding how women think and at this point of time all the tasks below this line have already been replaced by technology so yes now with this AI what's happening is that this line is just taking a leap upwards up here but again like this is nothing new that this has been happening since the dawn of human progress if if you are here what you have to do is make sure you stay above this line you need to move yourself above this line of technology and yes that means you have to do work that means that you have to keep learning to keep your skills up to date but that is just how the world works as Humanity moves forward with technological progress but okay so why despite of this why do I actually think that this actually is one of the worst thing that's happened to the coding industry most people are lazy right don't lie to me you're a lazy piece and as a beginner programmer the thing that's gonna pull you up from the beginner stage is forcing yourself to go through the immense pain and discomfort of solving difficult problems but because now we have access to this amazing tool that can just literally help us do these beginner level problems for us what you are tempted to do like and don't lie to me you are tempted to do this right now if you're going through cs50 for example right now you are tempted to just give chat gbt it's a very difficult and uncomfortable problem sets of cs50 and just let it spit Your solution and then submit that and that is terrible that TBT is sort of like a calculator when calculators were invented that obviously replaced a lot of tasks for mathematician but there's a reason why calculators aren't given to you in like grade one is because in order for you to ever become a good mathematician you will have needed to go through the basic arithmetic at some point in your life and what chat gbt risks is giving coaches access to a calculator way too early use it to save time not to try to shortcut the process of learning that's what I think about chai gbt if you want to learn the code I recommend you watch this video right here and I will see you in the next video if I'm not replaced by AI by next week bye bye foreign
