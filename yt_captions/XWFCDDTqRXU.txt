ladies and gentlemen welcome to the best chess tournament not just of 2024 but oh my goodness maybe of the last decade plus this is the 2024 candidates and this is round number 13 of 14 rounds it is a very tight race to determine who is going to win the entire event and play for the next World Chess Championship title and round 13 was everything we could have asked for and more and I'm going to get into the games if you give me one minute of your time today I am sponsoring my own video a lot of you have my book this book came out October 2023 now I've got a new thing for you this is called the chess deck this is a very beautiful and elegant deck of cards and essentially what this is is a bunch of different openings puzzle themes chess puzzle and so on and so forth and it is called the chess deck and it's kind of a sibling product of the book and it's on pre-order right now it's a very beautiful present it's very elegant very nicely done I'll put a link in the description if you'd like to add it to your collection of things that I have made related to chess please do uh if you buy it to learn things you might already know a handful of those things but it's a very nice present for somebody just looking to get into the into chess and it makes for a very nice uh little coffee table top uh my friends here we go today we're going to do our recap in Reverse I've always started with games like by Hikaru and some of the other you know players out of respect for the people that are playing to win the candidates right now I'm going to quickly go through the other games kind of as a quick erf if you will that was one of the worst pronunciations you've ever heard so we're on the women side to start humpy Koro versus Anam musuk this one a Queen's Gambit decline we're going to go through these quickly because these players are not playing for a first place finish and at the end of the day that is what matters in the candidates tournament these two play to Queen Gambit declined very early traded some pieces it was Bishop versus knight a weird King positioning by black and the players are fighting to their credit but like I said at this point in the event we need to respect the players that are contending for a first place finish this one goes to a long Queen end game and they played for quite a long time black was definitely putting some pressure But ultimately the player made a draw also nurul salimova and Katarina lagno for some reason I took away a point from nurul in this game uh she had 12 uh and um nul versus lagno neither of these players by the way very similar looking game in terms of the Catalan to the previous uh this game also ended in Black having some sort of pressure on white and then actually you know Nuru being under severe pressure uh but she manages to safeguard her King and in a low time scramble LNO goes from completely winning to all of a sudden not winning at all and it's a draw because Rook H7 and queen C7 are threatened it was dramatic it was tense but there was games all over the place now here is perhaps the craziest sequence from the women's side tandi versus ganka was a relatively straightforward game it was a relatively straightforward end game and it ends in the draw so tanong has 8 and a half points out of 13 so she is 8 and 1 half out of 13 going into the final round leting ja can catch her with a win and she's playing by shali who's on a three-game winning streak but after a relatively boring opening it was white who emerges with an advantage so black takes massive risk in this game to try to play for a win I also just realized I did not have peace sounds enabled now I do queen D3 and Vali had pressure this entire game she knows Lei has to win to tie tanr for the lead going into the final round and lay was a fighter she fought and she fought and she got back to the advantage now what was insane about this game is that it got to an end game of minor pieces and there was no chance ever for black to play for a win takes takes Queen in F versus queen and five Le is just going to have to take the draw and she's going to have to be half a point behind tanong Yi except she just loses the game she loses she blunders a queen trade in a queen end game and white just puts her King in the center and is completely winning she's winning cuz the pawn dominates the two pawns that's it she's just winning A4 King E5 and black literally resigns because I go D6 and I run and I eat those pawns and I win so instead of going into the final round down half a point Lei loses right at the end and is now a point behind tandi so if tan makes a draw in the final round she wins the candidates that's it it's it's her and lei and that's all and that's why you know like I said I mean I the the summaries are getting shorter and shorter because in the candidates you're either first or last except last year when second place mattered but tan jangi is very close to winning it's probably a 90% chance at this point uh in the open we had a boss of invid now I love uh these guys and they've put on a a very good display but they are not playing for first place abasov is playing you know obviously for pride and rating and you know who isn't vidit had a very pleasant position from the early opening But ultimately uh he was unable to capitalize he had a very nice space Advantage look at abasov by the way I mean abasov showed up today like he had a doctor's appointment uh he played so fast then he started thinking obviously he got out of his prep and uh yeah they just repeated the position so we got here and vidit was like I don't think I can make progress without taking much risk and they make a draw and um you know vid could play for more but it's a little tough after losing two games he opts not to play for more and that was your six minutes of introduction all right that was your six minutes of introduction and the three most important games of the day just took place and they were absolutely unbelievable I'm going to take a sip of this and then I'm going to get into these games also seriously check out the chess deck it's sick it's really nice they worked for like a year on this thing okay yanomi 7 and a half versus Hikaru 7 and a half tomorrow Fabiano kowana with white versus yanomi with black tomorrow Hikaru with white versus gukesh with black so here's what has to happen Yan needs to beat Hikaru okay Hikaru for the first time in this candidates according to statistics has a 40% chance to win the tournament this game kowana needs to beat Prague with black to even be in the conversation and if he loses it's over if he draws it also could be over and now gash has to beat fuja because fu is struggling and also gukesh needs to stay in the running three guys have seven and a half and one guy has seven we begin with Yan pishi versus hkar Nakamura Pawn to E4 and I was pretty sh like I I I was pretty certain not shocked I was pretty certain hikaro was going to go E5 hikaru's approach to this game was going to be I'm okay with the draw because tomorrow if my boy gesh gets it done if I'm half a point behind gesh I can still beat him with white that would be hikaro strategy so this didn't surprise me Knight F3 Knight C6 Bishop to B5 this surprised me because you can play the Berlin Hikaru if you look at hikaru's database over the last few years when he doesn't want to lose with black bro plays the Berlin all right bro thinks his name is like hiku all right like like the way they would say it in German I mean he plays the freaking Berlin now I think nepo probably did like eight hours of homework and also he showed earlier in this event he had that very interesting idea against uh vidit in the Berlin endgame you might remember it was this this it was Knight C3 and then he played like H3 Knight H2 F4 G4 this kind of concept iaru plays A6 iaru plays a Spanish and here this is a move that no one plays no one plays like that and the idea of Bishop to C5 I swear to you is to not put the Knight on F6 Knight F6 is a Mainline Spanish played millions of times Bishop C5 is the turbo Spanish you play Bishop C5 and then you are not playing Knight F6 you are playing Knight to E7 which is crazy you reinforce your knight with a knight your F Pawn frequently needs to go to F6 and your knight goes to G6 to support the center Hikaru plays into E4 E5 which I expected but then he deviates he doesn't play the Berlin instead he says Yan Bishop C5 baby you're going to have to beat me in this surprise weapon of Spanish this is a gangster move by Hikaru who continues to surprise people every single round like so it seems and he's won three games in a row now Yan plays castles and C3 he also could have played C3 D4 right away the idea for black is after C3 the bishop goes there and then you reinforce your center with the Knight and with this Pawn uh with the Knight on G6 and with the pawn on D6 that's kind of what happens but in a different move order Knight E7 Knight G6 and now the bishop goes back to A7 now to the untrained eye this move wins a pawn okay dc6 Knight 5 Knight E5 D5 I mean it looks like there is a pawn to B1 but black gets very active play with Queen to H4 targeting this Pawn very strong bishop and the bishop on A7 is just a menace I mean this position is very tough and there's even a move here Rook G8 with as you might imagine the intention to play G5 and Bishop to G4 so very tough position there's a lot of very complicated lines Yan plays a move that has been played many many times before F6 comes back to E3 castles Knight 2 we're in a position that has been explored some hundred times prananda actually himself this guy plays this line a lot but in Rapid games mostly so we have Bishop E3 hikaro castles Knight D2 King h8 getting off of this diagonal and this is where we begin the middle game so this position has been reached before Yan plays Rook e one so Yan spends three minutes all right according to Theory the move def 5 has been tried Bishop C2 has been tried and Rook E1 has been tried Rook E1 now black has two choices open the position or lock the position like this D6 play a long maneuvering game you're not worried about moves like D5 as as black but you are worried about moves like H3 and your Bishop just can't really go anywhere goes to E6 you get forked so Bishop D7 might be possible then might will play Knight F1 and Knight G3 and the thing is like at some point white has more improving moves than you so Hikaru takes on D4 and takes on D4 again and then takes on D4 again and then he plays D5 so as it turns out this is the idea and now nepo takes on D5 okay Hikaru takes back on D5 and Knight to E4 is played with the intention of playing Knight C5 and Knight C3 now as you might imagine something weird happened here okay D5 Ed and for some reason Hikaru spent a lot of time on that and maybe he was thinking Knight F4 to take or go to D3 he'll probably talk about it in his own coverage but Yan went here and at this point the engine was saying that the line for black is B6 first so there's no Knight C5 Rook C1 Queen d8 and now there is no Knight C5 Knight E6 Karu played Queen d8 pretty quickly and suddenly the commentators were like oh Hikaru messed this up and he did it's plus one it's plus one did Hikaru mix up the move order like did he remember that he was supposed to play Queen d8 but forgot that it was with B6 because now the best move here for white is D5 and the point is Knight C5 Knight E6 is suddenly very powerful like now you're getting a pawn here which you're not supposed to be doing with black and suddenly after Bishop to uh excuse me after Knight C4 and queen d8 D5 is a very powerful idea I don't know what hikaro had prepared there B6 then white can play Bishop C6 Rook C1 Queen d 2 maybe Queen C2 Queen A4 something like that but nepo spent a long time after Queen d8 and he went here it's been 12 minutes and this move D5 is a major question mark he didn't play it and Hikaru according to deep analysis was quite a bit worse and I do Wonder was it an opening mixup I don't know obviously he's going to explain he's going to talk about it but there was this moment here that this move D5 with a very clear plan would have posed very serious problems but in the game this this misstep and Hikaru now takes over he says Yan let's go get in you know why he says that because there is no Pawn now there is no Pawn whereas if there was one O Let's just say like this this would be a huge problem for black the Pawn's two squares away from queening it's a massive problem all right so B6 and Yan does something inexplicable here everything in white position everything is pointing toward going to E6 as I just showed you this move D5 to go to E6 in the game to go to E6 Jan goes back 13 minutes spent and he backs up and this is when you realized Hikaru is about to take over this game because this is not what we want I don't know what Yan didn't like here he obviously didn't like Knight F4 but he's not losing like the game is on here it's a game but he goes back the idea being that if Hikaru takes this Pawn gets greedy there's this nice move Knight E5 you have to trade queens and then I can do takes takes Rook D1 I'm down a pawn but these bad boys are getting on the seventh rank it's going to be terrible for Hikaru so Hikaru just doesn't do it he says I don't want the pawn now nepple plays Knight E5 and Karu is threatening to mate Jan so the game has completely turned around Yan plays D5 disconnecting The Bishop's Vision but allowing the pawn to become a Target and now he has to defend his Target and Hikaru here spends roughly 20 minutes and comes up with this move C5 it's a really nice he doesn't spend 20 minutes on Rook D he spent 20 minutes on Rook d8 I apologize but the com 20 but the combination of these moves C5 it's a very clever idea now the pawn snuck past the blockade can't take I mean I know aant is forced but sometimes it's not and C5 is really clever now karo's taking over what do I mean by hikaro is taking over well let's say white plays like Rook C1 black is going to threaten a mate somehow like let's say Knight H4 and then black is just going to play F4 and B5 C4 like again just very hypothetically this is what black is going to get pretty soon and then you're going to take this and you're winning so here Yan attacks the queen iaro goes here Yan goes back and we have a very tense moment there's footage of the players not wanting to take a draw they're watching the other games you understand like the insanity of that no other sport has this you don't know what decision to make in your game because no other sport is a tie in in this kind of a high stakes event ties are broken by penalty kicks and overtime you're watching the other games and you don't know if you want to take a draw because what if one of them wins and suddenly the chances tomorrow are completely different but they think for a while and they ultimately repeat moves and the game ends in a draw and actually Jan has to claim and play Knight back to F3 and they do repeat uh and it was funny because this position occurred three times but this is a different position because here the legal move of vasant is possible which is very funny so this position this position and this position are not the same because in this position white has this move very clever but it was a three move repetition they both have eight now these guys have eight and they're going to watch the other two games gash has has a chance to get to 8 and a half Fabiano's only chance is to win this game and get to eight if he loses or draws his chances are less than like 2% okay Prague versus Fabiano Fabby does what any good man does when he needs to win a game he plays the Sicilian Defense Knight F3 Knight C6 the same Rosal Lio Knight F6 Fabiano's played this the third time in this candidates all right [Music] takes takes D3 Queen C7 Knight bd2 we get a very locked position very normal stuff Knight goes to C4 and now we have this transformation of structure dark squared Bishop type of game holes in the white position on D4 holes in the black position maybe on the light squares over here Knight f8 back Queen G4 and Fabby is under pressure early and Prague has a very pleasant position here and right here was the biggest moment of the opening where Prague did something I will not understand at all I do not understand it because I see a queen and a knight I see a bishop who is the only piece not participating The Rook I'm not talking about Rook B1 but that move is fine too I'm talking about F4 I don't know why he didn't play F4 F6 Knight F3 G6 Queen H3 ef4 and then here you play E5 and what you do is you just you you bulldoze the position you can't take because Rook e one wins the queen and basically if you're Prague you you play this position maybe he didn't like it maybe he thought I'm just down a pawn right he didn't like this but you got to go for this because I got news for you you see how black is going to play these two moves if you don't play them he's going to play them anyway and this is just a Turbo Charge version and suddenly my man Prague watch the next five moves dude is backing up like he is just getting attacked in an alley fiana Carana put on a mask and just started throwing fists at him and trying to take his wallet all right I know they're playing in Toronto it's probably not that bad but I'm from New York it's a fair analogy uh look at this the Knight is darting backwards this Knight is arriving on D4 F4 now he's got to he's got to try to get his Rook out of the way to put his Knight on F1 to go Knight E3 Knight F5 now the queen has to go to E3 now the queen goes to E2 now the Knight goes to F1 he's just all every move is backwards Fabiano marching him down on the side of the board with G4 and H4 but Prague was ahead of his he was ahead of the curve here because he baits Fabiano into the only thing that he can accomplish Fabby did all of this and as fate would have it the best the absolute best that Fabiano Carana is going to get here is the night in the center is the weakening of the light squares and is the winning of the rook and that's it now black can't move any pawn and guess what I have the Knight now and I'm putting it right there and who's getting rid of it and guess what then I'm going to go F3 and then I'm going to trade and then I'm going to get my Bishop out I'm going to support my a pawn and then I'm going to play Rook F1 and suddenly you're like wait a minute I'm up a rook for a knight why am I not winning and over the course of the next 10 moves Prague fights back from an absolutely atrocious position the players Shuffle they Shuffle they Shuffle Fabby probably should have played B6 or A5 they both make it to the 40th move and on the 40th move Prague breaks out and prague's Advantage is at its minimal like away from Fabiano since move 15 in this position it was minus point you know it was like right here it was minus point8 it was a terrible turn of events and Fabiano somehow lets it slip and the pawn going to A5 combined with Knight F5 the engine is saying white can't even lose anymore what has Fabiano done oh my goodness now neither guy wants to touch his Queen side computer is constantly streaming for A5 but you never really want to play A5 because if black starts trading he's going to break out of his position so Bishop D2 Queen H5 Queens are off the board who does that benefit why would fi do that look Prague just completely seals it the only thing Fabiano can do now to have any hope in this game is accomplishing the move B5 that's it and he has to open things up let me just tell you if fabbi plays something like B4 oh actually A5 by you know like let's just say something like A6 now this is a draw this is a draw this is a fortress and there's other types of fortresses here the computer doesn't get it cuz black is up material and there's even more pure fortresses like if black has a pawn in A5 like this and you know like this is a complete draw it's a draw so Fabby has ruined his chances and frag just has to wait Fabby goes King A6 and in this position there's still like a way maybe to defend against B5 but Prague kind of allows it and he has an idea in mind his idea was very clever it was Fabby can't go B5 CU I take on C5 I go here here and I take Fabby can't get through and I'm going to put my knight here and here and I have very good chances Knight to E3 Bishop d8 Bishop A3 this was prague's idea but he misses something insane Rook B7 Bishop D6 attacking The Rook black is winning with Rook B1 what because when you trade everything the pawn promotes if you try to stop it A4 what have you seen hero double pawns like this and you can't stop A2 and if G5 A2 G6 A1 queen queen G1 stops oh my God Prague misses it but soras Fabiano and suddenly within the span of a few moves it's no longer even that bad Bishop C1 now still absolutely still fiano is in the driver seat but he's lost one of his pawns if he loses the a pawn he's not winning this game so he defends it Rook A3 Bishop to B4 Rook A2 Fabby trying 64 moves have been played Rook B7 Bishop B2 it's back to equal oh my God Fabiano's messed it up oh my God Fabiano's messed it up rook B5 now C3 that is a big mistake Prague in this position needed to go G5 removing the defense of the center and then King G4 and all three of Black's pawns are on fire leaving black with one remaining Pawn that's it this was apparently the right defensive idea BR goes here it's too slow suddenly we have a quick Skirmish and Fabiano gets in with his Rooks and then he sacrifices one of them and the Knight is falling and Fabiano Carana is in the clear but it's not over yet it is not over yet he wins the night but look at this if I turn off the eval bar here you would all lose this position with with white with black excuse me and so would I how are you stopping these pawns B goes Bishop C5 Rook C1 attacks the bishop the king protects G5 how do you stop these pawns okay the bishop stops this Pawn but how do you stop this Pawn okay very easy Rook B2 G6 Rook G2 then you lose you lose because your Rook is not on the eighth rank oh my what so what is the evaluation here well it's winning but they don't know that and you don't know that right cuz you don't have the eval bar anymore so Fabiano plays Bishop 2 E7 he has 3 minutes this is the most clutch that he has to be in his entire chess career King G6 the king is going to F7 and Prague is about to save this game when Fabiano Carana plays A4 PR plays Rook C8 to try to get rid of the bishop to get his pawns through P plays Rook E3 uh Fabiano plays Rook E3 Bishop is hanging but the pawn is the hero prg tries to stop him if takes there was just A2 takes with check and you offer a rook trade and as fate would have it both of them Queen at the exact same time but Queen A2 check is played a queen trade is unavoidable this this Pawn promotes Prague resigns Fabby has eight oh my God Fabby Hikaru and nepo are tied for first going into the final round of the candidates and they wait if kukesh Will Win Lose or Draw E4 E5 Knight F3 Knight C6 a Berlin a Berlin by the way D3 Bishop C5 and from the early opening Ali Resa came better prepared Anish giri on the live broadcast in this position said this idea of A5 and putting the bishop back on A7 targeting the white king not C7 is not something that gukesh was ready for and he chooses a plan where he runs into big trouble D5 Oli res is better from the opening this is a worst nightmare for gukesh he's in a worst position with the white pieces in 15 moves the idea is that if you take A4 removes your control of the center and suddenly I'm completely dominating you here now gukesh is the youngest player in the candidates he's 17 he's the actually I think the first or second youngest player to play a candidates ever at some point his nerves and his lack of experience and his youth have to interfere and they have interfered in the opening of game number 13 right surely right I mean he's so young no says you know what all right maybe I don't have the best position in the world we still have a whole lot to play for Bishop B6 e d CD H3 maybe I'm going to G4 and now Ali Reza plays Rook E8 and for the life of me I do not understand if he blundered this move Bishop A4 nine times out of 10 a bishop attacking a rook like this is stupid it's just a waste of time but in this particular case if the Rook goes to E7 you lose the Knight if the Rook goes to f8 that's just stupid and you lose control of the center if you block I win the pawn on D5 so the only alternative is the one thing that Ali Resa fua does best take his shirt off and get into a fist fight he doesn't have any documented instances of actually doing that but the analogy works all the same Oliver as a fuja is a fighter he's going to fight E4 takes takes and he is attacking gukesh over the next like five to seven moves from all angles the pawn on A3 reminiscent may I remind you of another Pawn on A3 and let me tell you something right now if we go to an endgame gukesh is going to have a migraine because of that pawn which is why gukesh says no alyza you can't come here and in fact I'm going to just not even let you you know I'm going to leave that pawn right where it is and I'm going to come back for it in the future Ali Resa plays F5 and he is better this is a very very bad situation for gukesh all right f4 on the way now let's not forget gukesh lost to fuja the most heartbreaking game that he's played in the 12 games that he has played in the candidates bad memories yes he's looking to avenge them but this is the biggest moment of the young man's career he takes on C5 and he plays Rook D1 and Ali Reza is in Prime position to uncork savagery on the white position you give one more move to Black it's over it is over the attack has arrived gkes has to act now one of the the things he can do is play Queen D2 and try to get a queen trade he says no I'm not trading the Queens why would I trade the Queens that's what Gotham chess would do and that's why he covers my games Queen to E7 and my man gukesh says if F4 is so damn good I'll play it myself he plays F4 himself destabilizing the position in front of his King ready to put the Knight on E3 you cannot take on pant because I take this this is a big move there is an argument to be made that Ali Resa should have played F4 right away he should have not even allowed this to happen he didn't like F4 because he didn't like Queen G4 probably fair but now gukesh plays F4 himself Ali Reza plays Knight F6 and in this position plays G5 straight away and blows open the position completely if you take on G5 Knight D7 Knight E5 Knight F3 is one of the worst things that you can allow so G5 computer's not a huge fan because of Knight E3 now both guys have an open king queen F7 King H2 Knight to H5 both guys have no time they have three more moves to make alza has two and a half minutes but Ali Reza did this once to GES already Ali Reza now has one minute to make two moves or he loses the game on time and in this position ukash plays Rook G1 Rook G6 and the players repeat they repeated you saw that they repeated they make 40 moves extra 30 minutes everybody take a deep breath relax and to my shock in this position after spending 20 of his 35 minutes gash repeated the position and for the first time in history going into the final round of the candidates four players are tied with a no draw kukesh says we play on and one of us will lose Rook G1 King G1 Five Pawns each this Pawn begging to be let through potentially going to get cap Ed a protected pass Pawn a majority of two onone imbalances Galore alza plays King h8 Kesh plays King F2 computer wasn't a huge fan of King h8 it really wanted the Knight to come to E6 and then after this it really wanted Queen G7 and then an infiltration of the white position it really likeed that Ali Resa doesn't do that he puts his King on h8 King F2 and now gcash is winning what a genius it's paid off he needs to play Queen H6 he doesn't a massive missed opportunity and now Ali Resa fua finds Knight to E6 Queen F5 and queen G7 giving up his Knight but the infiltration arrives and the game will end in a draw but instead of that he offers a queen trade and this will probably go down as the strangest move of this candidates tournament because the speed at which Ali Resa fua traded the Queens was about a minute he didn't think about 96 he must have been very down about his position but after takes takes maybe he only calculated these two three moves but Rook D6 is the ideal and the point is you just put your knight on D5 defend yourself pressure this and March your pawns Oliver zarua blunders after the time control and with less than 10 minutes to go gukesh is winning Knight to D5 is coming he has won the Pawn Ali RZA darts in with his own Knight and there's a pawn promoting oh my goodness kukesh plays Rook B6 with 5 minutes remaining on the clock Knight to C2 from Ali res E3 E2 E1 you can't take the pawn on B7 because then E3 Knight D4 if King E1 there's Knight F3 need2 and the pawn is getting through which is what makes it all the more absurd that in this position my man GES played Rook B7 anyway because if E3 King E2 Knight D4 King D3 E2 Knight F6 Arabian mate Unstoppable on H7 white allows a queen and mates their opponent Rook B7 and gukesh just has to calm his nerves one minute on the clock he's been here before and he messed it up against fuja and it was Rooks and knights but this time no matter the amount of Tricks this man gukesh was so clutch I cannot understate how clutch this man was the pawns go together it doesn't matter that Ali Resa can get in on the second rank the King goes to G3 the pawn will fall B7 Rook C8 and you Queen before your opponent and this man gesh for the first time in six years another person not named Yan Bishi leads the candidates tournament by themselves I'm getting emotional even talking about it lukash is ahead with eight and a half out of 13 the final round Karu versus gukesh Fabiano caruana with white versus Yan pishi if gukesh beats Hikaru he wins the candidates the other game doesn't matter if Hikaru beats gukesh the winner of the other game will play him for a tie break if Hikaru and gukesh make a draw the same thing that I just said Fabby nepo they will play GES for a tie break Fabby versus nepo somebody has to win somebody has to win what an incredible tournament and if you're still here seriously check out the chess deck I I got to get like pre-orders in they got to count this stuff and you know check it out you don't I'm just telling you they get mad at me if I don't talk about it I'll see you all tomorrow and if the players are tied there is a tie break on April 22nd get out of here
