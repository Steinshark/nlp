ladies and gentlemen welcome back to Freestyle chess a new type of chess tournament championed here in early 2024 by none other than the best player in the world Magnus Carlson it's an Invitational eight-player event where they play Fisher random chess or chess 960 or chess 9lx or whatever other trademark somebody wants to put on it to try to make it sound unique when it's not and they play a mix of rapid and Blitz we've got Magnus Carlson we have Fabiano caran we have dingl ran leavon Aron and we also have Ali Resa fuja no abdur Vincent kimer and GES from India Today is the second day of the round robin portion I will give you an update I will show you some games and today we have a very interesting matchup a matchup that we have not had in an official capacity in a major tournament since dingly Ren took the title from Magnus Carlson without taking the title from Magnus Carlson Magnus Carlson abandoned the World Chess Championship and now dingly Ren holds that title but he never beat Magnus to do it now we get a chance to see them playing a game uh I've got incredible story lines the young guard is absolutely on fire beating up the senior citizen chess players here we go digly R plays F4 now you may be wondering why this back row is shuffled that is because we are playing Fisher random chess 96 9 LX there are 960 possible setups they're all shuffled the Bishops have to be on opposite color and the King has to be with between the Rooks not exactly between the Rooks but as long as the Rooks are on each side of the king so in this type of setup players very frequently especially when the Bishops are in the corner they like to open up the Bishops and then they have to figure out what type of a structure they want in the center before they bring out their Knights right and before they they they end up committing their kings to to to somewhere so Knight D3 Knight D6 knight3 kn6 both players bring out their Knights and now ding jumps in with Knight to E5 against Magnus Magnus plays this very interesting move G5 trying to destabilize ding's grasp of the center and now ding strikes back with C5 it's a very complicated position we have takes and we have takes and now Magnus plays Knight takes F4 losing this Knight but because ding's Knight is hanging in the center what's he going to do he plays D4 and basically ding is just opening up the position for his Queen and his rook and then ding is going to be very happy because he'll bring his Rook over here and attack the king and maybe he'll castle using that rook and life is going to be good now Magnus tries to remove some of the pieces and then he plays Bishop to G6 so Magnus trying to alleviate some of the pressure that's building in the position ding plays this move E4 defending his Knight Magnus plays D5 looking to destabilize now ding is a principled man when he sees on pant he plays it pawn takes D6 Bishop F2 and essentially What's Happening Here is it's sort of a question of what's going to happen over in this territory like will black find a way to to to trade something and create some weaknesses for white let's not forget that the kings are still kind of clustered here together uh and Magnus decides to send the game to an end game and ding decides let's send the game to a Super End Game let's trade the Queens let's remove the Queens I don't want my my queen on the board to potentially be a Target I don't know what he didn't like probably he didn't like this so he decides all right instead of that I'm going to trade the Queens we're going to trade and Magnus here plays a move that I think caught ding a little bit off guard he played this and that just looks like you're hacking the game but that is how you Castle in Fisher random one of your Rooks is used for short castling the other is used for long castling so if Magnus had gone here and then here he could have castled and put his King in Rook here he could have done this and that would have been fine as well but he decides to Castle short and now all of a sudden he has the initiative he has the initiative he has very active pieces is and he's about to beat people the way he normally does by taking and taking and now he's just the pawn up the bishop has been summoned from the corner ding finally gets to Castle himself but Rook G8 look at that move that is a fancy move if you take my Bishop I take your Rook if you take my Rook I give you a check then I take back so Magnus plays this exactly like he would a normal game yes the Bishops are of opposite color but black has a better structure opposite colored Bishops frequently mean a draw but not in this case Rook G4 and we go to like a like a real opposite color Bishop endgame now one thing we're not going to do is this all right we're not going to run to trade both Rooks this has a much higher chance of being a draw look 0 five whereas in this position is minus 1.2 it's a big Advantage for black to keep Rooks on the board when you're trying to win an end game you should try to keep one Rook on the board Rook G4 Rook H4 four and ding resigns what that's that that's what about this yeah I guess ding just was like I'm going to lose Bishop D6 I'm just going to lose he resigns because he's going to lose two pawns and just be lost what what what wait I don't yeah apparently he just was like I'm going to go two pawns down there's you know I'm not even going to like he could play F6 here to try to win this Pawn if black plays King F6 you have Rook F2 you might you know you might be able to sneak onto the back rank but yeah ding just straight up resigns the game after Magnus plays Bishop C5 wow Dingle ran is 0 and five I'm not sure you actually quite understand he has lost every game in this tournament yesterday he went 0 and four today he is 0 and five after losing to Magnus SC that is nuts that is unbelievable I was wondering has the world champion of Chess while reigning lost five games in any format like Blitz rap I mean it is so sad to see I now on the flip side the rapid technically means nothing which is kind of weird like they're not playing rapid to eliminate each other they're playing rapid to determine seeding for classical chess which doesn't even why are they doing that I don't whatever I didn't organize the I'm just confused like normally you play Four something but whatever anyway uh similar setup by the way in the game between kimer and gukesh kimer absolutely on fire uh plays like this which is a very funny way to play A5 taking flank space trying to bring his Queen to the party they both bring out their Knights Knight D7 and now kimer starts attacking on the queen side GES plays Bishop F7 kimer plays a very interesting move very deep positional move here from kimer and this is how you improve a chess your opponent has 1 two three four five six pawns on light squares almost seven because that that's a very natural move six out of eight pawns on light squares that means that black has a very bad light squared bishop and a pretty good dark squared bishop and a pretty important dark squared Bishop to fight for the dark squ so you don't even you don't even think about you Bishop you got to get the bishop off the board even if it comes at the cost of maybe getting attacked a little bit because the truth is your opponent should not be playing on the dark squares cuz their dark squares are very weak they should be playing on the dark squares if their pawns reinforce the dark squares but they don't and even though that looks like an active move after takes takes Vincent explodes the center and black has a bunch of dark squares that are not protected I'm not saying the queen could do all of that it can't just send arrows at all those pieces what I am saying is that E5 D6 and f8 are completely unprotected Pawn takes Knight takes and the position opens up KES tries to look at look at oh yeah too bad white can do the same thing and the pressure is not off white is moments away from opening up the entire board gcash plays Bishop C4 to attack The Rook Vincent gets out of the way this board is going to be opened up and oiled up rookie eight and Vincent just comes right back and and and like like I said the attack is just is it's it's arriving Queen B7 Bishop H3 the Knight goes back and Vincent kimer opens up the board Queen is coming in Bishop is coming in Rook is coming in and Vincent kimer absolutely torches gash gash yesterday beat Magnus and ding when's the last time somebody beat the the world champion of both formats in one day he beat the classical world champion and the rapid and Blitz World Champion and not only that he beat the goat like but today I mean sometimes it just doesn't go your way Vincent kimer is playing very very very well Vincent kimer understands these positions and he is playing very high quality chess and unfortunately gukesh runs into another young guy who is on fire I have more games for you leavon aronian versus dingly Ren this is round number six dingly Ren is 0 and five and I don't want to I'm not I'm not showing games to pick on digly Ren but this was just an unbelievable game and I got to show it to you it started again this one a little bit different you'll notice the the Bishops are now moved to the other Corner they're not meing on us this is just they randomly draw the positions that's that's how it works the way it actually works is they'll randomly draw a position everybody who's playing white gets to talk about the position which by the way I don't like that I understand we're playing with a new format but so like let's say you know leavon Magnus Fabiano all play White they get to talk about the the game for 10 minutes they get to go what do you think are the best openings can we play this can we play this because there's no prep nobody knows any openings so that's how they do it and it's really interesting uh I I don't know if I like that cuz you know it's a sport make them all hate each other make them all you know talk trash about each other and their abilities and families no I'm just kidding we're not we're not cage fighting um but uh yeah this time you know we have the opening of the Bishops you're best believe you're going to see this and we do right both guys opening up their Bishops you know it's important F6 so ding blocks the dark Sor Bishop Queen F2 also very you know frequently they get the Queens out and now in this position you know leavon can Castle but instead he plays G4 and I mean that's basically like a declaration of hostility upon dingl Ren uh he's trying to go there he's probably going to Castle this way is probably is what he's thinking now to me the most the most natural move here is played by ding the ren your opponent attacks you in the in the you got to strike back in the center cuz in one move you're going to open up everything leavon takes and takes and basically says okay you opened up the position now deal with this bro I love Fisher random look how idiotic this position looks there's like obscure tactics everywhere you got snipers you got the H Pawn coming in and now ding plays a move that I for the life of me do not understand um white has declared that he you know he's clearly going to attack you now you haven't castled that way so you could go Knight D6 H5 Knight f8 get all your pieces and then suddenly this and you're like oh well all right I mean I have a space advantage over there but I'm not mating anybody great they're chess players we were never expecting to mate anybody castles what dingly Ren says leevon just played F4 G4 H4 and I'm castling into it yo this is a man on tilt like this is a man who's like you know what the universe is against me come get some Leon's like okay I will come get some yes absolutely and now Knight E2 and Knight H G3 and levon's just got a king sitting in a little safety bunker he bought one of those like $25 million bunkers have you seen all the stuff there's like the stuff like billionaires have no idea how to spend their money so they buy like underground bunkers for the apocalypse I love reading like completely idiotic stuff like that and uh and then debating whether I should tip a dollar at my local coffee shop because that's the type of economy I live in you know and these guys can just spend like 25 to 50 million on a bunker in case the world starts shutting down anyway my my my point being this is one of those billionaires and you know he's just sitting here while the rest of the pieces and like look Knight F5 right but there's no attack there's no attack just yet I mean it looks very scary you have G5 and so on but you do have to be a little bit precise nice idea from ding by the way he doesn't want his opponent to open up the file so he plays Rook D7 yeah yeah Levon Levon is is is is opening dingl Ren's door without knocking and he's not taking his shoes off in his house Knight takes G7 good Lord oh my God he just sacrifices the Knight and the point is when you attack somebody you need more pieces than they have defenders in this case I'm not even I'm not even sure it matters you need more attacking pieces than they have Defenders but black can't stop the attack he just can't he can't move because of the way of the peace configur he just can't move Knight E4 doesn't even do anything this is double check my friends you go here this I'm mating you man I'm the I'm mating you so ding plays E5 Pawn takes King goes to the corner and leavon leavon leavon shows no mercy and in this position he oh my God bro just played Queen G7 check I mean it's made it's literally made except you got to take his Queen and then he's going to go a and then bro might promote to a night now Queen is m in three but leavon might straight up do this nah you can't be seen anywhere in the playing Hall if a man promotes to a night against you in an over theboard game online is one thing you can't do anything you sit here with your screen you feel stupid stupid somebody promotes to a night against you and it's a good move oh and it's not a meme yeah you can't no no no oh my he's Levon with a brilliant attack and ding is 0 out of six he's 0 out of six how is that even possible this poor man what what is I I am rooting for ding because he's a nice guy he gives calm respectful interviews he's a gentleman he's a scholar he's a big reader he's like a lawyer by educ like ding is a great guy not controversial whatsoever how is he 0 and six now I have more games for you by the way I have Fabiano leevon and then I have this absolutely unbelievable game which um which we will get into um we saw this first game Magnus winning nice game over dingler Ren Fabiano Carana versus leavon aronian uh Bishop's in the corner now I just wanted you to Bishop's in the corner but look at this it's not the same position Bishop's in the corner Rook Knight King Rook Rook Knight King Rook it's not the same uh this was the same but not this Bishop's in the corner I know very confusing so like very different meta strategy when your king Starts Here versus when your king Starts Here Right the game we just looked at Bishops r on the opposite corner every round they have a different set of position uh pieces but the way it's played fbby brings this bishop out and you best believe that at some point he will play G3 to get the other Bishop out but in the meantime we're going to have a little bit of a scrap all right Knight F3 he castles D3 Knight D2 Knight B3 he takes and there's G3 okay so Fabby gave up his dark squared Bishop however Levon has not had an opportunity to get his dark squared Bishop out the corner Bishop he's going to try his next move will be G6 but now E4 and basically Fabby wants this that's what he wants he wants and he prepared a mummification of this bishop which is very interesting like the fact that all the way back here fabbi decided you know what if I just try to play chess he's going to come over here and I'm going to be very I'm going to take even if it doesn't damage his structure and then I'm going to try to wall off his Bishop very interesting stuff and these Bishops will have a conversation at some point Rook f8 now Queen B1 remember Fabiano doesn't have a dark squared Bishop but he has three pieces that can fight for the light squares one two three right whereas Levon only has two so you could play on the light squares H4 Fabi instigating Levon Queen A6 Fabby Queen C2 slowly A3 okay there it is H5 the attack is continuing Levon calls the buff plays GH oh my opening up the King Double pawns but he says Fabby I'm up a pawn you gave me a pawn Knight E4 and leevon is like come come get some I am not afraid Rook F5 is two extra pawns but then he would go here and win The Rook by the queen so Bishop E4 Queen E4 and levon's completely unbothered like Levon clearly I mean the thing is when you play Queen G7 right like when you sack a queen the previous game you're playing with house money so he's like I'm not afraid I mean I just sack my queen I'm going to just fight right back yeah that King does not look very good and Fabby begins opening up the position Knight to F6 is a huge threat you can take the bishop Knight F6 the king will run out Knight H5 you know King will go back Knight F6 you just hunt yeah no it's very bad Rook A7 Knight F6 take take what did Fabby Miss he should have brought the bishop back because now he's going to lose his Bishop but he's going to win The Rook oh my God leavon covering up Queen E6 trying to go into an end game but Fab's King is safe and leavon resigns because if he runs his King over here nobody can protect the back rank like you could protect it for a move then I will go here nobody can protect back rank Rook D7 F7 is game over also this is mate in three so what a win by Fabiano Fabiano had a great day you know who also had a great day the winner of this game the winner of this game which might be Magnus Carlson we never know I mean obviously he's included in a lot of games might be norer ner Abdul sator the youngest ever uh male chess player to win a world uh Championship 17 years old the youngest person to ever win a world Championship I think is actually ho fun who won the Women's World Championship in classical Chess at the age of 16 16 some of you are 16 and all you do is sit around going Levy never fails to never fail so you know there's there's levels to this I mean I wasn't doing anything when I was 16 but you know I have to be the educator here by the way you know who else played like this you remember this you remember this game wait you remember this game does this look familiar in fact it's the exact same opening look at that that's a fascinating game huh Knight F6 A5 and Magnus plays B5 on passant and imbalance right instead of trading the Queens Magnus does this because that's how you got to play for a win against Norbeck you got to create a little bit of imbalance look at it nck plays Knight A4 and I got to tell you there is no easy way to guard that pawn for some reason because it's Fisher freaking random and if you play B5 he's going to go Knight C5 so Magnus takes he gets rid of it but that looks that looks I mean what about the Bishops you I mean in the Fabiano game when he lost the bishop he walled off the other one this is not the same situation Magnus is in a precarious position but let's just see if he knows what he's doing I mean he did not need to play CB he could have played AB they could have traded the Queens there would have been a whole bunch of nothing this would have been a very very solid game but instead Magnus takes a risk opening up his Rook and nck just puts three pieces on the a file and now it's just better and Magnus can't Castle oh my God nck off to an early start gets the bishop out Magnus opts to trade pieces so that Nock doesn't have the bishop pair now the Knight goes back look at this move Knight D4 Queen C7 and we go to an end game Rooks and minor pieces King D2 strong move when there when no when nobody can really attack your king you can put the king in the center and active King is useful in the end game plus the king's a bit of a bozo and overweight like he needs a bit of exercise it's just truth he you know he he's he's he's got no excuse he just sits around all day doesn't have a job like let's get let's get out there let's go to the gym let's let's let's let's start benching let's do a little little cardio on an incline come on E6 remember the uh the gesh game yeah I mean seven pawns on light squares to counteract the light Square Bishop of course C3 and now this is a position we would normally see Magnus white nobe black and putting the pressure on the players himself but Rook A5 this is Magnus now under pressure and nck voluntarily put his Rook here because The Bishop's first move of the game was meant for it to die because now too many weaknesses Knight B4 is the purest of forks you're going to have to lose a pawn Magnus knows he's going to have to lose the flank Pawn you can't lose the C Pawn he's going to lose the pawn but as I said if you want to win an endgame you cannot trade all the Rooks this would land you in a bad situation you are only left with a very immobile Knight the way you have to win an endgame especially with Rooks on is only trade one so if it was possible this would of course be very good for white plus 1.5 but you can't take with a knight because now you pinned yourself stupid which is why noer break is a smart man doesn't trade any Rooks and now is going to just Advance on that side of the board Knight G4 Magnus creates counterplay Nock says he can't have me look at this move by Magnus by the way who knows how to hold an endgame Knight H1 the point of this is that no is going to lose the pawn he has to take and Magnus will simplify this into a rook end game take and now this is the position and basically Magnus says I have six pawns you have seven good luck beating me in a rook end game which is a draw H5 Magnus takes counterplay ner defense Magnus goes back ner keeps advancing when it's time when it's about Pawn end games like this rook and pawn it's about creating the imbalance of the pawns what I mean by that is just so you understand if black loses the H Pawn right let's just say something like this this is closer to a draw look at the advantage it's 04 because both sides traded off they're big BG weaknesses however look at the advantage here it's 8.9 and the reason for that is this is a major liability for black and white is going to try to advance right so you see here it's about keeping more on the board leaving your opponent with a weakness you don't take their weakness if it costs you a Pawn King D2 Magnus meanwhile is trying to trade off a bunch of Pawns but C4 might be rushed he might have needed to play something else like B4 he plays C4 and you see noer back is not taking not pushing he's just trying to come up to D4 King C5 King F3 you may be wondering what about take take Rook H5 you can't do that because the you know but King F3 Rook F7 everything's protected right we could trade everything down but one on two it's still a draw so King F3 Rook D7 take take Rook H5 Magnus active King G2 Rook D2 now a big moment do you take you have to everything else is hanging nck takes now he has a pass Pawn Magnus brings the king back to the pass Pawn notbe plays Rook E5 and Rook E4 King protects Rook slides back wait a minute who's protecting this Pawn nobody Rook D3 Magnus is choosing to play this end game in a way that's going to leave both guys with passers and it's basically going to be a tossup he's going to try to play active defense which as you see according to the computer is completely fine but you have to be precise Rook E3 Rook D7 check the King goes back nobe plays Rook D4 baiting the pawn to come forward and baiting the king to come forward so he would zip around back and play Rook C8 and the crazy thing about this position is that before you push the computer wants to go here for a reason I can't quite explain this might be losing No Matter What by the way this might be losing no matter what in fact as you can see there the the evaluation just jumped up right but the computer can't super precisely find the Win It Takes a very long time it's probably winning and no does a very nice job creating the best type of imbalance for himself plays F5 rook d8 and his pawns are just too strong his pawns are just too strong he's going to sack The Rook for the pawn when it queens and the pawns are going to go the black king can't simultaneously support the pawn and protect these King C4 but he could have played Rook D5 as well doesn't matter and my friends Nock Abdus satov defeats Magnus Carlson on the 63rd move of this game because he will promote take and make another queen not only did no abdor defeat Magnus Carlson no abdur won the entire round robin the world rapid champion of 2021 winning it at the age of 17 won with an undefeated score of five and a half out of seven defeating Magnus Carlson Magnus Carlson got fifth in the round robin Fifth and these are the playoff matchups dingl Ren managed to draw lza fua by the way in the last round to stop the bleeding your matchup for tomorrow in the quarterfinals no abdulov will take on dingl Ren Vincent kimer will take on lean ronian Fabiano Carana will take on GES Ali Reza versus Magnus oh my God fourth and fifth is probably the Marquee match up that is nuts Magnus once said he would not defend the world championship unless it was against Ali Resa fua if Ali Resa fuja won the candidates that didn't happen so we get to see them fight here now I just have a question I was looking at the standings I was looking at the the the the settings of the event why did we just play this round robin stage like I get it we need to seed all the players and I guess it's fun but like that was weird like why we just spent two days but nobody got knocked out well anyway so hopefully dler Run's confidence is not shot he's going to have a lot more time tomorrow is classical 90 minute not 25 minute like this and um yeah all the young guys were at the top gukesh lost today a lot of games I think he might have lost all his games today he lost to nobach he lost to kimer he lost to Carana yeah he went 0 and three I think that's crazy so a rough end for him but I will see you tomorrow for the classical get out of here
