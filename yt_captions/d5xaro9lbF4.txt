ladies and gentlemen I've got an absolutely amazing treat for you today many of you enjoy my AI chess videos where I cover games by the worst chess Bots like Martin or chat GPT up to the best chess Bots like stockfish or more recently torch torch is a new chess bot that chess.com is in the process of developing and it's played some unbelievable games including the one that I'm going to show you in this video normally I cover like five torch games in a video I'm just going to cover one and you are going to learn at least five things from this game normally when Bots at 3500 play chess we just watch it's like zoo animals we don't understand anything but this game is actually an amazing game to learn from it was one of the most highlevel AI games that I've ever seen that I understood so I'm going to show you the game but first i'm not going to have a sponsored segment here I'm just going to say thank you because this book comes out tomorrow it's October 23rd 2023 right now maybe it's like 27 when you're watching and my book comes out tomorrow and um I've got two towers back there behind me and it's also there's one resting on the top I've also have a huge poster board in case you can't tell I'm super proud of it I think it's going to transform the way chess is learned in written form for new and Rising players it's the first jazz book in history that has QR codes and over 20,000 of them have been pre-ordered by you so if you're lucky enough to catch this video in the first couple of days that it's out I'm doing three live fan events in New York City if they do well I will do more I'll come to London I'll go to California I'll go to Texas I'll go to Europe I'll go to Asia go to Africa maybe even Australia I don't know how many Australians play chess let me let me see in the comments I want I want a big thread in the comments of all of the Aussies that play chess uh support the Live Events one is already sold out check out the book for Christmas just thank you thank you for supporting the book and uh I'd like to return the favor with more free content like this video all right um torch was playing with the white pieces ethereal was playing with the black pieces and I took your advice I'm going to let you in on a little piece of information chess computers play games against each other in pairs meaning they play a certain chess opening for a certain amount of moves and then they start to think on their own in this game this is the final prepared move so now the Bots are completely thinking on their own now this opening was a Queen's Gambit and a Catalan this is a Catalan system where white is trying to play Bishop to G2 before playing Knight F3 completely fine completely reasonable stuff black has many lines here one of them is giving this check just trying to disrupt White's development and white went Bishop D2 now here traditionally black will play Bishop takes or go back to E7 and argue the bishop is misplaced this is what top level chess happens now what happens at top level chest now C5 okay um now some of you may wonder why this is not played actually this makes developing the Knight very annoying and if you play A3 uh black is just going to like play Knight C6 and get the Knight there in the future so Bishop G2 is played white doesn't take now black does this trying to play Queen takes Knight C6 white goes Knight F3 to take back with the Knight does exactly that and now black plays A6 which is trying to prevent white from playing Knight B5 okay both sides castle and torch plays Knight C3 so right away we're going to learn uh something here right white has a lead in development white has a lead in development white has more Knights out white has a very powerful bishop and white has what is called a queenside majority so you have more pawns on a side of the board now you could argue this Pawn fights for the queen side like it's fighting for so technically black has more Central pawns but white has the potential to advance on the queen side and put the Rooks behind the pawns and in general you should play in chess where you are stronger and where your pieces point and right now white is pointing that way you don't want to go here that is like not like you're not attacking the king you're also not really attacking the center so white plays this nice move Rook D1 this is such an engine move completely losing the pawn on C4 just totally utterly just Queen takes C4 Free Pawn the reason it's not is the queen is going to get stuck it's going to get very tough to get the queen out all right now the Queen's going to go to B4 it's going to get hit with with a with a with a pawn all right then it's going to get hit with a knight like you're just going to have a roaring attack so the computer plays Rook d8 ethereal goes here safeguarding its D6 Pawn now white plays Rook C1 you'll notice it brings both Rooks another instructive moment have you ever wondered in chess which Rook to move to which file right do do you move this one here or do you move that one there and then wait like should this go you want to put your Rooks where you think the board will open up in the future I know that's kind of difficult to predict but this Pawn will likely take and there's a rook and a queen and this Rook will support whatever's pressuring there the Rooks behind the pawns might not Knight bd7 now torch plays a gangster move it's a gangster move coming up by torch SE I mean that's that's just that's a that's scumbag territory right there I no human I mean in a long game maybe maybe a human plays C5 um that move is so ridiculous I think it's much more human to play like B4 and then put the Knight there and try to play C5 I told you play where you're stronger but C5 is so disrespectful I mean you just lose the pawn it's three things could take that pawn you're not going to take it with the queen because then Knight D5 and again your Queen's going to have to scadaddle and Knight C it's a really unpleasant position um so you're not going to do that but it's just a free Pawn you cannot take it with the Knight though because if you take it with the Knight boom now you got to go back and then and I got the same discovered attack so ethereal has to go here torge gives away a pawn for seemingly nothing not only has it given away a pawn for nothing it's given away a pawn that now attacks a knight and The Rook is now no longer hitting the queen so this must be like the dumbest move of all time but it's not cuz it's torch all right if your cousin played that move you'd be like you idiot you literally push the pawn to a square it could be taken three times and then your cousin could go use torch and be like well actually turns out I'm a genius I have a question if you play the top engine move but you did not know was the top engine move and you just blundered a pawn did you make the top like are you a genius or are you an idiot I don't know Knight A4 torch utilizes the pin torch does not care that that pawn was taken you cannot take my knight because of this and I'm going to go B4 so if you play B6 in this position I'm not going to go B4 I'm going to take your Rook because of my Bishop because the the opening that I played and if you play something like Queen D6 un pitting yourself I'm just going to trade and look at this how do you evaluate in chess who has a better position material King safety but he here's something you don't know about Chess peace activity peace activity is the last thing when it pertains to who has a better position and right now look at all of this pressure it's white and I didn't even I didn't even do that right so Queen B8 torch just goes back and torch is relying on open defile open C file powerful Bishop black has no space look at how restricted Black is Black can't move the queen black can't move the Rook black can't move the bishop black can move that Rook I guess you can't move the Knight can't move this can't move anything so black plays Rook E8 cuz it's like the only move black can play right slide The Rook over one square there's not much black can do now torch can take on C5 and not only can torch take on C5 it it B6 is not a threat because then white goes here so first torch actually prepares something now what it's preparing I don't don't know I don't know I actually have no idea like is it going to go Queen C1 and double up is it going to double up on that H6 black makes a useful move now white apparently is improving the evaluation look at that point4 couple moves ago uh no it's just point4 never mind it's just point4 I thought it was 0 2 that was my mistake not going to edit it out though because I don't want to hide my mistakes now seeing that torch was oh no it's 0 five for a second it was 0 five so slightly better position Knight D5 now torch goes bang bang bang so it got its Pawn back it has pressure on the position this is how you win a slightly better position in chess if you look at this position White's King and Black's King are equally safe but black is restricted pieces are a bit stuck B6 doesn't quite work like I said because there's Knight C6 at all times you're going to get the Rook back at least so here torch goes Rook C7 restricting Black's pieces now we trade and we come back and black here is basically just on high alert white is going to Target weak pawns and weak pieces and weak squares the way you win a winning position or just a slightly better position is by exploiting squares and targets because white has much better prospects black is always going to be on the back foot so black plays A5 A5 creates light squired weaknesses and potentially this Pawn in the future so so torch just plays a slight improving move slight improving move and maybe trying to go there and hit this F7 Pawn in the future centralizing the Knight it does not want to trade there is a rule in chess Bishop for Knight trade might be good not at all times so we try to get the Knight out of there Rook f8 trying to defend torch plays A4 taking space controlling the light squares centralizing the queen always a good idea to centralize the queen Pawn is pinned and by the way this was not taken because after Pawn takes Queen takes there's actually Queen E7 and black gets activity so instead of taking that KN Queen D4 just centralizing now look at this slow and steady improving move H4 just taking a little bit of samide space your king does not get any weaker cuz none of these pieces can actually get to the king and in the future I might have an attack I might black goes for a queen trade black is doing what you're supposed to do when you're restricted you're supposed to try to trade queens and try to trade pieces the more pieces you trade the better let me tell you something you get some sort of endgame which is like um okay just very beare with me Rook C8 obviously that's not what's going to happen uh black plays like G6 uh take take okay look at the eval the eval is dead zero whereas in this position the eval is s not all trades are the same for example Bishop B7 Bishop takes Knight takes white is still better here because white can get the Rook white can get like this right right if white just plays a couple of lazy moves and black gets some activity right like E3 and so on suddenly Knight C5 and black is totally okay chess literally is a knife's edge you have one to two moves to prove your advantage just like in your favorite sport it comes down to a couple of shots all right in football it comes down to a couple of runs down the pitch a couple of crosses maybe a penalty goes off the crossbar maybe there's a corner kick that goes wide not the corner kick but the shot off the corner kick right like so white has a limited amount of time Rook C7 active Rook on the seventh rank black plays B5 looking to make a trade the less pieces that exist the better it's going to be for black super instructive move now Bishop to G to H5 what you are trying to do is play where you are stronger black goes here you are inducing a weakness now Black's pawns here are held together by the F7 Pawn which might fall Bishop G4 another threat do you know what the threat is the threat is a tactic the threat is Knight F7 Rook F7 Bishop E6 winning two pawns and pinning The Rook to the king while these pieces are stuck on this side of the board so now black has to play another pawn move and by making black push two pawns torch just dips to the exact same position a moment ago this was the position now look at the position a couple moves later it looks like black made two more moves but those moves benefit torch takes a pawn has fallen near the the black king and now several moves ago torch began operations here G4 same side play do you know what the idea is the idea is not to open let's say black just plays Bishop B5 the idea my friends is potentially something like this to get a pass Pawn maybe even H5 I'm not saying this is the best move there is Bishop 2 E8 in this position but look at you could literally get mated you could get mated because of the way your king is open King safety is everything G4 take take Rook D6 recentralizing it's it's completely even material this is why this game is so fascinating and so instructive it's four pieces four pawns each and three pieces each but look at how effortlessly Rook A7 Rook on the seventh rank patrolling every square and all of these pieces Knight F4 E3 Knight D3 I told you is it worth trading well now this Rook is overlooked loaded and there's a very nice tactic here Rook takes A6 you may wonder why did ethereal even do that right like why didn't ethereal just go back to F6 then white would have went Bishop F3 and let's say black just repeated moves King H2 King G3 these pawns are stuck if black plays Rook B6 trying to win this Pawn White's not in any danger whatsoever like Rook takes B2 Rook takes A6 so white would just slowly white might even walk the king Bishop I'm not even I think white could straight up just play King G4 I mean I guess there's Knight F6 check but then you would start hunting off these pawns blackb player like Rook B4 Knight A5 right so you're just losing the pawns Knight F4 Knight D3 and now look at this nice little tactic two pieces versus The Rook win eight times out of 10 the only time they don't is if you allow pass pawns if you allow this Pawn to be taken and then A3 for example Rook B6 in this position King G2 there could be a tactic it doesn't exist but there could be a tactic in some positions where Rook takes B2 is possible and this Pawn sneaks in because it's either queening or taking and queening and you can't stop both so there is a world in which white can save this position by sacrificing the bishop checking and coming back to stop the pawn and then as the king comes in you play E4 E4 4 King B2 E5 King takes E6 King B2 E7 and you Queen when they Queen but my point is if you don't blunder that watch the way torch does this torch walks its king to the center then it brings its Bishop back to win the pawn all torch needs is a pawn trade one Pawn trade just one it needs one Pawn to go up the board it just needs one Pawn its Pawn now is going to march in coordination with the king and the Knight and the bishop and the only thing that needs to be prevented is the loss of this Pawn if that pawn Falls black is going to win for example Rook B4 like something like this I mean this is a a very bad situation for white it's only losable because the pawn will get to A3 at which point I mean it it's a nightmare to defend it so Knight takes F4 King F5 check H5 we do that to create a blockade everything is guarding everything else the Knight comes back to D3 Bishop D1 defending the pawn and kicking out the king and there goes White's e- Pawn White's E Pawn is now four squares away from queening and everything that black is going to do has to do with this Pawn this Knight is defending that pawn which is stopping both of these pawns from coming forward Rook C7 the pawn is now three squares away from queening but black still has a good G you know grasp so how is white going to win this bishop D5 Bishop C6 trying to sneak around back and now rather than repeating the position like let's say Rook C4 white would have gone here kicking out the king king would come forward and then E6 would be next let's say uh Rook H4 E6 King F6 Knight F4 Knight G6 or Knight D5 and then E7 and these pawns just never made it by the time you go here it's too late I'm queening Bishop C6 black tries to sacrifice the pawn and stop like this King E3 Bishop B5 Bishop A6 you're trying to sneak around back Knight F4 controlling and Shing the king allowing the king to come forward King E4 Bishop C4 the Pawn's going to go to E there it is two scores look how effortless this is it's so amazing how well coordinated whites pieces were King F3 now you just got to give a check there it is Pawn's going to come you don't even have to push it yet you don't have to push it yet Bishop D5 it's going to happen maybe you're not even going to push it at all Bishop B5 now you may you may wonder why E7 is not happening uh it it's it's it's I don't know the computer WS this move is better maybe E7 will never happen maybe torch forgot it has a pawn there it is torch did this the perfect way it blocked Black's King from even touching the pawn and The Rook is not on the back rank so The Rook cannot get to the back rank at all the Rook is trapped everywhere it would go it would get taken now white is going to Queen Rook takes it gets closer but unfortunately it is too little too late I wish it would have promoted to something else here but an Absol absolutely Flawless technique by torch to win this game and what made this so impressive is normally these Bots are playing like ridiculous refuted openings against each other and you know trying to survive this was just a Catalan position if any of you want a new opening play D4 C4 and play G3 Bishop G2 Knight F3 and castle like the Catalan and the pressure you put on people is so annoying doesn't matter which defense black employs you just put your Rooks on D1 and C1 and you advance you the fact that you can even sack a pawn to three pieces is just so absurd it's so utterly ridiculous Knight to A4 with pressure and you don't even win the pawn back you just completely restrict Black's play Slowly methodically then you win the pawn back then you trade but the enough pieces stay on the board that things create threats look at the way white galloped into the seventh rank even with the queen trade the second Knight took it eye off C the be black wanted to trade Queens because black knew they were under pressure but the second the Knight took Rook C7 you know that's the best Square to put a rook and then you go out that way and then you induce a couple of pawn moves to get kicked out but now you know they're going to be weaknesses and just the second your opponent let you simplify like this how effortlessly you coordinated use that pawn to to to to to get a pass Pawn on the E file in no man's land not closer to that one final instructive thing about this F4 Pawn takes Knight takes is better than Pawn takes because the pawn is closer together it's all close here but a pawn in the center is harder to defend cuz now your attention is drawn in and the rest of the board can fall apart on H6 and on A5 what a game I mean I saw this game I was like I got to share this because this is a game that even 500s can understand maybe you won't play that well like you know 500 you might you you you might go here but it it's a game that I can break down to you and you can acknowledge the skill and the level at which this is played and you can enjoy it like watching athletes and be like that was amazing I would never do that because if I did I would break three bones but I get what they're doing and it's spectacular so uh great game and every time torch does something or stockfish does something uh I'm going to keep you posted I hope you enjoyed and um once again if you want to have a chance to meet me in person get a signed copy of the book uh Live guest the ELO sold out that was on October 24th uh we have November 4th coming up I'm doing an event with Dylan lame many of you may know him as the guy that throws ice cream uh here on YouTube and on YouTube shorts he has an ice cream shop in Manhattan called catch an ice cream uh and um November 14th in New Jersey at Barnes & Noble I will be doing a little event fan meet and greet book signing and things like that and if these do well I might come to your city but I wanted to start around New York City first cuz that's where I live so my friends thank you so much to those of you that pre-ordered this um I and and and tweet at me send me a photo of you with the book when it arrives uh I'm going to try to retweet as as many of you as possible uh those of you showing your support I appreciate it very much the holidays are coming up get it as a present ask somebody to give it to you as a present uh I think this book will be the book that people talk about in the future when it comes to learning chess as a noob as an early intermediate and you're going to have questions about like what ELO the book is for it's all online you can just go to the book page and it says what ELO is for uh 0o to roughly 1300 it's two parts and there might be another one in the future so on that note get out of here
