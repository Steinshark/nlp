excellent thanks again it might be a bit of a stretch to call this a lightning talk I think I'm going to eat into David's time as well so we'll see how this goes and this is none of this is going to be specific to C plus plus of course this is just about speaking in general so from nervous wreck to Pro speaker in five easy steps we would like lists don't we and even if you don't consider yourself a like a nervous speaker um there's always room for improvement there's always things we can learn most of the things that I'm going to talk about I'm still working on and I've counted them up briefly I think I've done about 170 talks now I'm still learning I'm still improving so these are just some of the things that I've I've come across along the way that have helped so these are the the five easy steps we're gonna break these down uh now so we've got uh preparation breathing posture contact with the audience and the free PS we'll find out what they are so let's start with preparation seems to be a good at least to start so obviously this is what's going to happen before you you give a talk and that the better your preparation of course the the better you're going to be able to get up and give a good talk and be confident in doing that now I've put this quote up I'm sure you're familiar with this quote no plan survives first contact with the Enemy and I put this up for two reasons the first one is no matter how much preparation that we we do if we've not really done much public speaking before when you first get up and actually start trying to deliver your material we're going to find that feels very different to how you imagined so be prepared for that don't assume that um just you know you're practicing at home and then getting up in front of people it's going to work the same way if you're prepared for that that's going to get you a long way and we're going to have some tips to try to to work through that to accelerate you too be more confident but bear that in mind now the other reason I put this up is um well who actually originally said this so apparently it's been attributed to a helmet from malt key uh from 1871 except actually he he didn't quite say this um it seems to have been a combination of these two uh Recollections from 1961 no plan survives contact with the Enemy or from 1969 no plan survives the first Contact of War put those two together uh actually over these things are what Helmut said either what did you say was this no plan of operations extends with any certainty beyond the first encounter with the main enemy forces and then all the others are just derivations of that the point of going through all this is to say we can't over prepare it's very easy to go down rabbit holes and pick on things that aren't actually that important and I spent a lot of time researching those and that's fine it can actually add a bit of color to the talk like I'm doing right now the trouble is you're likely to end up running after time for your main preparation and then getting to your talk on the day feeling you're not quite prepared because you spent all your time going down these rabbit holes I've been guilty of this over and over again so I know what I'm talking about so do try to avoid that uh do try to uh time box what's your you're going to be talking about so you do need to know your subject well the core subject uh you should be very familiar with um do extra research if you need to about that beyond what you're going to be talking about because you're going to get questions as well things are going to knock you off so make sure you know that core subject well don't spend too many too much time going down those extra rabbit holes another say time box your your research so that you still have time to actually put together the The Talk itself um now there's different ways that you can um organize all of this I often will make an outline um or I'll um just put some rough slides in and I'll tend to use Comic Sans so I know that these are not the final slides otherwise I can be tempted to sometimes just let those through and there's other ways to to do that the point is to try to be deliberate in the way you organize your material and get it into its final form this is not going to be a talk about that so I'm not going to go into mod depth just have a plan even if it doesn't survive contact with the Enemy what I do want to talk more about is rehearsing your material do try to make time for at least a few full run-throughs of your talk even if it's a long talk make sure you have at least one time you go into amp um that that can be really important but most of your rehearsal and practice beforehand should be not the full run through but actually around specific parts so the main thing here is to really select a few key parts of your material that you really want to make sure you're very clear on this part know what they are up front spend extra time practicing rehearsing those and and these key points are going to come up in a few other times in this material so how do I emphasize that make sure you know what your key points are have three four maybe five of them at most and everything else is just supporting those if you've got too many key points then you don't have any key points so that's the main things you can do in your preparation to make sure that when it comes to actually giving the talk you're going to feel prepared and that's half the battle so that's preparation now let's talk about breathing so you might think if I'm going to talk about breathing I'd put up a picture of some lungs but actually this is the autonomic nervous system and if you've heard anything about the autonomic nervous system you probably know that we tend to break it down into two parts there's actually three but we don't tend to talk about the other one so there's the sympathetic nervous system which is responsible for our fight or flight response we'll talk about that in a moment but I'm sure you're familiar with that and then the parasympics so again the parasympathetic nervous system is more uh to do with what we might call rest and digest or I think it's more useful to think of it as just the like calming down recovery those sorts of things that you can do when you're not in that fight or flight mode the both of these systems are active at all times but they generally are going to be in a sort of a nice balance where neither one is dominant and they just come to play when needed and evolutionarily speaking when you enter a new situation unfamiliar situation that's perceived threats all around that's going to trigger your your fight or flight response to the sympathetic nervous system and in an evolutionary setting that's exactly the right strategy when you're standing in front of a room of people looking at you expecting you to speak to them having that same response is not quite so useful because what's going to happen is when that sympathetic nervous system is triggered your heart rate is going to go up speakers are going to become harder because your esophagus contracts actually makes it harder to speak you'll start sweating and your breathing is going to speed up you're going to be gasping in short short gasps of air none of that is particularly conducive to feeling calm and relaxed in a public speaking setting and this is usually what puts people off having that response and thinking no I can't do public speaking but that's also in the word autonomic nervous system well it means automatic which suggests that this is something that we can't control you know we are at the mercy of our sympathetic nervous system but that's not actually true we can control it we can control it with our with our inner thoughts once we're practiced at it but we can also control it physically through our breathing so Venture that our breathing speeds up when we take short gasps but if we take control of that and we have a long slow controlled breaths that we actually start to take control of our sympathetic nervous system and it deregulates it back down so that the the parasympa nervous system can start to perhaps dominate again so you've probably heard about this breathing pattern that the long slow controlled breaths you you breathe out you hold on the exhale for a few seconds long breath back in hold on the inhale again don't underestimate how powerful this can be this directly controls the autonomic nervous system and gives you back that control that you will feel that you're lacking when you're up there you know in a public speaking situation to make best use of this you're going to need to practice this regularly ideally daily but if you can't do it daily then just at least doing this from time to time gets you into the habits of being able to take this control and then do it just before your talk particularly if you're out there on the stage just about to speak that's the perfect time to take that back that control get control of yourself get control of your breathing and be ready to give you a talk maybe even during your talk you can find Opportunities to do this if you have a pause maybe you're doing a demo or some other time you're not actively speaking took the opportunity to take a long Breath Again get that control back make it a reflex so anytime you feel like you're losing control you now know how to gain that control back there's obviously a lot more that can be said here could a whole hour or more talk on this but I've only got a few minutes I'm going to move on so the next item which is posture it's actually closely related because there's a there's a an evolutionary aspect to this that when we feel vulnerable we tend to sort of close up so our shoulders will roll forward we may tend to lean forward and on all of our body language is all sort of closed off because we're trying to protect ourselves and again that's not very useful when we're trying to be open and engaging with our audience and speaking in a relaxed way so very similar to the to the breathing and again similar to the breathing we can take conscious action in the other direction so if that shoulders are rolling forward well and pull our shoulders back but not to make them tight and tense so we need to get the shoulders relaxed just just pull back and one way can you can do this is um actually if you sort of hold your hands open forwards then naturally the shoulders will go back but still be relaxed and that will actually help you to feel more open more open to the audience more relaxed and more confident in your project confidence as well but there's another part too to posture which can be really important as well and that's the head neck Layman so your head is actually very heavy so it's one of the heaviest parts of the body if you are starting to to roll forward a bit your head's going to come forward and it's going to start it's gonna you're gonna end up with some sort of cycle where you're going more and more forwards and you're going to feel like you're not in control again for the for the head and neck to be aligned the head should be above the shoulders above the hips above the knees and above the feet all those things should be in line and that sounds like a lot to keep in mind but fortunately our bodies actually work such that all of it happens automatically if we just do one thing and that's just to allow our head to to float forwards and up which sounds silly but try it and you'll find that everything else if you can relax your shoulders as well just sort of naturally falls into line and you instantly feel more confident more open and More in control and that's the sexual part of What's called the Alexander technique which has been known for over 100 years now is a really powerful technique for all sorts of performers singers and actors and anyone that has a has to have a stage presence but they'll study the Alexander technique and there's a lot more to it there's another Rabbit Hole you can go down if you'd like but just remember that your head flow float forwards and up and that's really going to help you to open up and also give that opportunity to do that breathing as well so that's posture I need to move on with uh contact with the audience so that's their next point now most of this section is going to be about in person speaking for online speaking like I'm doing now I found one of the best tips to to get a connection with your audience is to have some way that they can interact with you so whether it's through some sort of a chat system a q a polls anything like that now we're not doing it here because this is technically a lightning talk but normally I would have something early on do it as early as possible where you're going to give me some sort of feedback something to let me know that you're actually out there and you're listening because when you're speaking into the void like I'm doing right now it could be really hard to uh while you're thinking about giving your talk also you're also thinking it's actually anybody listening is there anybody out there is this working as soon as you get that first bit of feedback it's not just that you know that people are there but you feel it as well and that helps you to relax so best of one tip I'll give for online speaking but for in person speaking when you're faced with a Sea of Faces maybe it's a small group it can look like a Sea of Faces especially if you're you're new to public speaking don't think of the audience as a big faceless mob instead think of them as a collection of individuals and look at them as individuals look around the room at individual faces and as you're speaking actually direct your sentences a sentence or two at a time to just one person at a time try to go around the whole room and you will find that there are people with different levels of Engagement especially if it's in a larger room there's always going to be somebody who looks a bit zoned out people on their phones or their laptops but they may all have good reasons for doing so don't assume that you're just being boring just ignore those people find the friendly faces there's always going to be someone that's smiling nodding along just actively engaged there's going to be a few of those find those people and concentrate more on those say sentences to those but do look all around the room especially a larger room it can be very tempting to just to focus on a corner of the room and to exclude the rest but you're not going to feel connected with the audience unless you're speaking to the whole room and doing so is also going to make you feel more in control as well so look around the room find the friendly places talk to those individuals and don't think of them as a a mass of a mob that's out to get you so that's connecting with the audience one more section to get through I think we're already over time so let's see how how far we can go before he ends pulls me off the free PS I think this is um perhaps say the biggest uh practical point for actually performing The Talk itself so if you've heard of the three piece before you'll know they are pitch power and pace and in particular being able to vary these things so some of us are naturally expressive speakers but even if we are when we get up on stage that might change because it's a different environment again it's a different skill set and it's something that we need to consciously uh learn about and practice and get get your own feedback but you can do it you can improve and you can Master this skill public speaking if you consider the free piece so stage actors know that um speaking is a performance and if you've ever seen a stage actor you know that they actually exaggerate things like pitch power and Pace because if they don't then it just doesn't come across in a public speaking setting the one way that you can tune into this is to record yourself and for a lot of people particularly those new to public speaking that's the last thing they want to do I hear people all the time say I never listen to recordings myself I hate it but the thing is if you record yourself and then think oh what did I do wrong and then try it again record yourself again keep iterating until you do actually start to see some improvement that feeling well never completely goes away I'll be honest but it does get a lot easier and and you will find that you can tolerate listening to yourself and you'll always learn something there's always something you can improve on and it's better for you to catch that yourself and any treat on it so let's have a look at the three piece start with pitch I tried to be fairly brief on these but I've actually got a lot of points so the pitch especially varying this may seem the most unnatural if you are new to to public speaking um again recording yourself is one of the best ways to both capture what you're currently doing and see how you can improve on it but varying this a lot can seem very unnatural to us especially to begin with so concentrate on using it for a particular meaning for example a using higher pitches to convey excitement or if you want to get more serious then you can take a lower tone the important thing is to keep it varied obviously don't we don't want to be monotonous and just speaking on the same tone but we also don't want to repeat the same pattern over and over again which we can often fall into if we're not paying particular attention to this so variety is the key here and practice is what will let us be able to do that so power this one is a little bit different we might have to be a little bit more careful about this by default we want to aim for mostly a consistent level of sort of volume and power to our voice because that's going to be comfortable to our listeners so it's usually going to be a little bit above our everyday speaking level I like to think of my you know public speaking voice as being different to my everyday voice it's a little bit above but not too much that it's going to be uncomfortable and we need to allow some Headroom so that where I need to be we can add a bit of extra pump punched for emphasis now a bit of Headroom for that quieter levels though they're a bit rarer but you can use them if you want to add a bit of mystery in you know maybe you want to share a secret with your audience be careful you want to make sure they can hear you but again having a range of power built into your your material can make it more interesting and it can make you feel more in control so lastly let's look at PACE now one of the things I struggle with the most always guilty of undoing it right now speaking too fast and there could be many reasons for this in my case it's often because I've just got too much material to go through and so I'll naturally speak fast and the worst part is what I don't have too much material and I've deliberately um made less material so I don't have to speak so fast I forget and I fall back on the habit and I speak too fast anyway just finish early so I'm still working on that um you may also be speaking too fast if you're feeling a bit nervous there could be other reasons as well again it's something to be conscious of trying to take back that control but again varying the pace can be really important so if there's something you want to emphasize you can really slow down for that emphasis and if you have been speaking at a faster Pace slowing down draws attention to what you're saying and again not only does your audience pick up on that but you personally start to feel yeah I'm in control of this situation and I'm deliberately slowing down here and if you just got some filling material that's just bridging from one section to another it's okay to to speed through that a bit faster because if somebody doesn't quite follow you that's okay and that can also then give that contrast for when you do need to slow down but perhaps the most important part of varying your pace is the pause the pause can add real dramatic effect it can really emphasize a point you want to drill home but can also give you a chance to think about what you want to say next or make it seem like you know you're really sort of drawing attention to this particular phrase so I'm going to emphasize the word pause again as well it's also a time that you can take that breath that you needed you can re-center yourself remind yourself of all those other things that you know perhaps but it's easy to forget them in the moment take the opportunity of a pause to breathe look at your posture think about the free piece and so on look around the room but also for the audience if you're hurtling along at a fast pace the audience is not going to be able to absorb anything everything you say they need those pauses to absorb and reflect on your material and to know which points they need to pay particular attention to so don't skip the pauses they're actually easy to do and one of the most effective tools you have varying your pace making your speaking more interesting and adding that dramatic effect so that's the three please don't forget the free piece pitch power and pace and varying them and also good preparation paying attention to your breathing your posture and maintaining contact with the audience if you keep these things in mind you should become a pro speaker in no time at all thank you very much thank you fellow that was awesome um there's one important thing for pauses which sneakers should do It's very effective and it's also very good for you as a speaker you should drink yes always like a glass of water next to you on stage for that purpose that you drink because you will spend so much water without ever ever noticing it but this is like like you know when you take a break um that's a good opportunity also like like having title slides is really great like chapters and then every chapter has a title and you take a break you take a drink the audience is getting ready thinking about that what I could examples anyways that was a really nice talk and I'm looking forward to the panel
