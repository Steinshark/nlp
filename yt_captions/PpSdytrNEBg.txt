in a previous video we looked at how Europe first fell behind in semiconductor manufacturing as well as how Japan successfully caught up to the Leading Edge passing Europe along the way the attends talk about Japanese semiconductor ascendancy during the 1970s and 80s open European policy Maker's eyes to just how behind they were in semiconductor production in 1980 European producers had just 13 market share of world semiconductor sales from 1981 to 1985 that percentage edged towards 10 percent in 1985 Europe's biggest semiconductor producer was Phillips ranking 10th in the top 10 leading manufacturers two-thirds of their production came from their American subsidiary signetix European companies were largely dependent on Imports in 1985 58.7 percent of total European semiconductor consumption was imported none of Europe's top four semiconductor manufacturing countries were self-sufficient I can go on but you get the point these statistics were concerning in response the European Community tried a series of pan-european policies throughout the 1980s to revive their semiconductor manufacturing industry in this follow-up to my European semiconductor video I want to take a closer look at the European community's attempts to win back the semiconductor industry during a very important time its last real chance to do so for the next three decades but first let me talk about the Asian Armory patreon Early Access members get to see new videos and selective references for those videos before the release of the public it helps support the videos and I appreciate every pledge thanks and on with the show before we begin we should consider why European governments wanted domestic semiconductor production in the first place semiconductors are critical components in all it products semiconductor advances have helped enable whole new Industries to emerge such as consumer electronics personal computers gaming and AI they also enable some of Europe's most important industries including cars planes and Industrial Electronics advancements in these fields often begin with advancements in their microelectronic components one of the biggest reasons why Europe first took up the issue of prioritizing semiconductor production in the 1970s was the belief that their it makers were falling behind in the world markets because they lacked direct access to world-class chips the most important such Market was the next generation of computer systems in the late 1970s everyone was talking about the potential that very large-scale integration systems or vlsi had on the economy these new class of incredibly powerful computers and many other such Advanced devices can only exist because of the increasing improvements of advanced semiconductor products to take a modern example can a country produce the next groundbreaking chat gpt-like innovation without access to the most advanced Nvidia gpus probably not furthermore continued European dependence on Foreign imports was not only strategically threatening it reduced Europe's control over the future technology roadmap but it also threatened The industry's Prestige the semiconductor industry in Europe faced several challenges firstly Europe's lead markets are missing several big drivers semiconductors are components that go into bigger systems and so they are heavily shaped by market demand there are only so many big demand markets out there the big ones back in the 1970s and 80s were computers telecommunications industrial government and Military Europe never managed to develop many of these big demand markets their automobile industrial markets are great but their computer companies lost to IBM their military markets are nowhere as big as Americas and their telecommunications is highly fragmented as a result the composition of Europe's semiconductor industry reflects that lag Japan and America had strong share in integrated circuits Leading Edge chips essential for vlsi production Europe's production on the other hand was in discrete or analog chips more mature stuff from the end of World War II to about the 1970s European countries tried creating national champions across a variety of fields the policy logic differed per the industry but in the case of computers and semiconductors European policy makers believed that their native players needed more scale to be competitive with the Americans governments nurture these National Champion companies with preferential procurement policies by public agencies and r d subsidies unfortunately as it turns out many of these national champions were uncompetitive outside of their home market and core competencies policymakers underestimated how just hard it was to make these arranged marriages work out don't believe me just look into history and try to see how many Big M A deals end up working out most of these flashy deals end up destroying rather than creating value for their stakeholders why should we expect a government arranged deal to work any better furthermore these natural Champions found themselves subject to their government backers this means direct interference in order to preserve certain political goals one notable example is the British government's insistence that British technology stay in British hands and finally the national champions too often ended up falling victim to their darker Natures splitting the market between one another that is what happened in France two Tech Giants Company general D electricity or cge and Thompson arranged their own Yalta agreement in 1969 and agreed not to compete with one another in certain areas that is not ideal most of the most prominent national champions in European semiconductors were sjs and Italy Thompson and France and inmos in the United Kingdom SGS and Thompson merged in 1987 to create SGS Thompson the combined company also later acquired in Moss today SGS Thompson is known as St microelectronics and they're actually doing quite well today in 2022 they generated 16 billion dollars in revenue and turn a four billion dollar profit their core markets are an automotive and microcontrollers regardless St microelectronics mild success is no indication that the national champion policy Works tsmc made more revenue and profit in its fourth quarter 2022 than St microelectronics made in the entirety of 2022. after the widely acknowledged failure of the national champion policy the European Community tried a new Direction this change was driven by Belgian atien David Young the newly appointed European commissioner for the internal Market in 1983 the EC launched the European strategic program for research and development in information technology or Esprit projects the logic behind this policy was that Europe remains quite strong in academic research capability however their industry has a harder time bringing that research into the market they need to do more of it too European r d lagged that of Japan and America two percent of their GDP as opposed to their three percent furthermore companies competed with one another causing wasteful and duplicative efforts in 1979 1980 devignon got together the leaders of Europe's 12 biggest I.T and electronics companies they briefly discussed the idea of creating a European Airbus for semiconductors but instead settled on the idea of a pan-european research collaboration esprits sought to transfer Advanced Technologies to European companies and get them to better cooperate with one another the ultimate goal being to achieve semiconductor parity with the United States and Japan in 10 years expert funded projects from all types of businesses and universities regarding Advanced Technologies manufacturing tools and international standards mostly but not always related to microelectronics to avoid running a foul of trade competition laws no near Commercial products were funded the EC policymakers at the time saw Esprit as one of the two elements to a larger policy the second being the creation of a single Market a unified European market that would improve their company's competitiveness did Esprit work in some ways yes there were some encouraging results European companies improved their technological competencies working more closely with one another rather than a foreign partner Esprit also spawned innovation in areas like millimeter wave communication systems material Technologies and fiber optics this success inspired other programs specifically for telecommunications and biotechnology unfortunately the research Technologies were often too far up the development chain to make any real impact on the market and while subsequent rounds of esper tried to address this few Technologies eventually came to Market furthermore while a significant number of projects went to small and medium-sized businesses the majority went to the Big 12 firms who met with davignal you can see the potential issues associated with that and then we have the Eureka initiative first proposed by France's president midorand in 1985. this was largely a response to America's Strategic Defense Initiative which was an ambitious plan to shoot down ballistic missiles people in Europe doubted the initiative's ability to actually do what it said it would they were probably right however they did recognize that it can fund a lot of commercial technology widening the European technology Gap and encouraging brain drain to the United States so midorand proposed Eureka with the goal of creating a technological Europe unlike the expert projects Eureka projects focused on products that were closer to commercialization but soon after the idea came up policymakers spent the next year wrangling over the project details the project also expanded to include a variety of governments outside of the EU including those in Central and Eastern Europe many people criticize Esprit for being a public largesse spending program that it spread public resources too thinly across too many Technologies and hooked private companies on government subsidies I don't think Eureka did anything to dissuade that criticism by 1997 there were nearly 1 200 ongoing or finished Eureka projects at a total value of 16.7 billion Euro a significant portion of that was tied to the Joint European sub-micron silicon initiative or Jesse a failed initiative to create Leading Edge dram chips I also mentioned Jesse in my previous video on European semis remove Jesse from the picture and what you find are a bunch of small underfunded projects where accountability and transparency are somewhat difficult to find countries with large domestic markets like France had long reserved part of that market for their national champions but smaller countries like the Scandinavian and Benin Luxe countries do not have that luxury the European Community sought to spread those protections across the entirety of the area Francis Thompson argued for higher tariffs on foreign Electronics Imports to protect the domestic consumer electronics companies who consume their microelectronics products the EC complied in 1986 they raised tariffs on video recorders or VCRs to stem a surge of Japanese Imports though they also lured tariffs and clock radios and calculators as a concession to Japan they also lowered the tariffs on finished imported semiconductors from 17 to 14 percent but this mattered little because EC tariffs on Finnish Wafers not yet cut into chips were nine percent throughout the Whole Decade encouraging foreign manufacturers to just import Finnish Wafers and do the packaging onshore then in 1987 the EC brought its own anti-dumping case against the Japanese dram industry an agreement was eventually negotiated in 1989 to create a price floor but Europe's computer makers the dram consumers were strongly opposed to the deal they wanted the lowest price for this critical component this led to further wrangling until 1990 when the Japanese finally agreed to self-implement price limits however by then the Japanese semiconductor declined was already well on its way and the Koreans were starting their climb towards the memory Summit so despite all of these policies Europe's share of the global semiconductor Market refused to budge and in fact deteriorated throughout the 1980s by decades and in 1991 European producers market share had fallen to about 10 percent and it has remained 10 in the three decades since though I suspect it is today far lower this decline was for several reasons over 80 percent of European semiconductor production came from West Germany France Italy and the United Kingdom but over the decade those countries national champions experienced big changes West Germany had once been Europe's semiconductor leader but their production began declining in the second half of the 1980s thanks to the worsening competitiveness of their National Champion Siemens meanwhile Europe's one globally competitive electronics company Phillips ran headlong into a financial and managerial crisis this eventually brought down one of the world's Electronics pioneers if you want to learn more about that I recommend Tech altar's recent video on the topic elsewhere in Europe foreign takeovers of struggling national champions like that of ICL by Fujitsu made it ever harder for policy makers to enact policy they wanted to limit EC support only to European companies but without new entrants such things were becoming increasingly rare perhaps it was for the best though many of these old electronics Giants had long lost their Edge the 1984 Mega project in which Siemens and Phillips came together to produce a Leading Edge dram made that painfully clear the 1980s turned out to be a critical time period in semiconductor history it was the last open window for the Europeans to gain and build ground the first big event of the decade was the fall of the Japanese semiconductor industry the reasons for which are long and multifaceted and I won't get into them here second was the rise of both the Taiwanese and South Korean semiconductor Giants Samsung began taking share from the Japanese in 1986 and tsmc was founded in 1987. third the 1980s saw a Titanic technological shift in semiconductor manufacturing equipment Intel failed to master the latest lithography machines steppers and stagnated from 1979 to 1985. yet in the end despite billions of Euros spent in a plethora of research done European semiconductor manufacturers failed to take advantage Samsung cornered the memory Market Intel cleanup with the PC CPU and tsmc shut the door on the rest of the industry with their independent Foundry business model your soul Shining Light the lithography machine maker asml sells all of its production to Asia and the United States in the 1960s European industrial planners thought why America succeeded was because their companies like IBM were so big so they sought to make their own national champions as big as IBM via merger this turned out to be wrong the reason the American tech industry succeeds so well and is capable of so much dynamism is how it allows small companies to grow big policy makers in the 1980s knew this yet their new policies still could not break themselves from the big companies their continued attachment to those big companies failed them as those companies slowly turned to dust alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the Channel Sign up for the newsletter and I'll see you guys next time
