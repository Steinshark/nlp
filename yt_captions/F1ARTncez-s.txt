it's been a long time coming I'm a little bit late to this one but welcome to the complete battery comparison between the e samsung galaxy s 20 ultra the iPhone 11 pro max samsung galaxy note M plus of all we made 30 Pro and Google pixel for Excel and these smartphone names are getting way too long I've calibrated all the phones in terms of settings screen brightness and speaker volume which is set to 50% so time to unplug and to kick things off tik-tok I gotta say it's not an app that I use but a lot of people do so as we're trying to simulate a normal usage case it makes sense to have it here now if we start with the battery specifications things look great for Samsung this new ultra smart phone packs a five thousand milliamp hour cell we're talking top five percent of smart phones in terms of capacity and that makes the three phones in the middle look pretty small and the pixel for excel on the end look tiny as soon as we introduce the display specs though you can see why this is gonna be a really interesting comparison while the ultra does have the biggest battery it's also got the largest display at six point nine inches and the highest refresh rate at 120 Hertz so if you didn't know that means that the screen on that phone refresh is a hundred and twenty times per second which compares to sixty the kind of going standard for the three phones in the middle and then the pixel four on the end that she has a ninety Hertz panel and speaking of the pixel four on paper things don't look too great for that phone the smallest battery tick a high screen refresh rate also tick and on top of that it ships with the highest default screen resolution which is yet another drain on the battery and with the pixel 4 XL unlike a lot of Android phones you can't actually turn that resolution down even if you wanted to I say that but if you take a look at the battery percentages of each phone as of right now there's some interesting stuff going on the pixel 4 XL is actually not at all in last place it's the galaxy s 20 ultra that is which might be a little surprising but this could change over the course of the test the other interesting thing going on here is if you take a look at the iPhone 11 pro max that is still on 99% and to be honest I don't buy it I don't think it's at all possible that the s20 ultra here has lost 13 percent a battery in the time that the iPhone has lost one or two as of now what I would guess is that Apple is probably programmed the battery indicator to not fall as quickly towards the start just so that it doesn't alarm people the second they pull their cable out but of course this won't affect the end result of this test because when the battery's dead it's dead also last time I mentioned this site promise there is a giveaway running for a Galaxy S 20 ultra so all the rules for that are in the description no if you take a look at the bottom row of specifications under each phone you can see the chipset each one is powered by as well as the amount of RAM and there's quite a disparity I don't actually remember the last time I did a battery comparison like this where all five phones are powered by different chipset but that's what we got going on right now and it gives you an idea of just how many different factors there are when it comes to influencing battery life of course battery capacity is one of them but it's display it's chipset it's RAM it's software and I mentioned the software in particular because people underestimate software and how much of a role it has on battery life see Samsung software has been okay it's definitely improved a little bit over time but it's nowhere near as aggressive when it comes to battery management as Apple's iOS or while ways Mui what I mean by that is historically while way software has been quite quick to shut down applications you're done with and perhaps snooze background processes so this kind of stuff can lead to longer battery life whereas Samsung software has traditionally tried to keep everything open anyways not sure if you've been keeping track of the applications I've been running on all the phones but now we're on the camera so we're on photo now we're going to video and recording 4k video continuously on all of them this is one of the most demanding things you can do on a phone it generates a lot of heat and put strain on the memory because you've got to save big files quickly and the chipset it's not a surprise then that the numbers in terms of those battery percentages have been flying off although you might be starting to notice a bit of a trend you've got two phones at the top the iPhone 11 pro Max and the huawei mate 30 pro in kind of like a middle band there's the Galaxy Note Templar and then right at the back you've got the s20 ultra with the pixel for excel although Samsung has now overtaken the Google which is the result that I was expecting once like work you might have noticed if you're credibly observant is that the Galaxy Note m+ has bars of signal in its status bar now it doesn't actually have a SIM card in none of these phones do I've been quite careful to make sure the settings are as similar as they can be but Samsung's software just sometimes shows it it's a weird glitch although now I think about it you could be in quite the surprise in a time of emergency if you've also somehow all been paying attention to the clock on the far right you might have notice we've passed the four hour mark that's actually quite impressive considering even the pixel for excel in last place is still on 40% I always say on these tests if a phone can last five continuous hours that's good battery life that's the kind of battery life that can generally get you through a day easily if it can last six continuous hours that's really good 7 super impressive and anything above that what we can get to it if we get to it I should also address you might have already noticed that the Galaxy S 20 ultra I'm using is powered by the Exynos chip that's the one we get here in the UK but if you're in the u.s. you'll have a qualcomm powered variant which will perform slightly differently on battery tests but I don't imagine it would be a day and night difference after all the software store the same the battery capacity still the same and you still have that incredibly draining display on this phone between the iPhone and the Huawei this is neck-and-neck this is incredibly close which is the exact same thing I noticed last time I compared those two phones where it literally came down to the last few minutes that we saw a winner and it's becoming quite clear in this test that those two phones are in a league of their own but to be fair the galaxy s 20 I'm sure if you turned it down to a more normal screen refresh rate 60 Hertz like those two phones it might even be class-leading but on balance I think the question more people want answers to is if I use this phone on 120 Hertz will I still have good battery life you've got to remember that these 120 Hertz panels they're one of the biggest selling points of these Galaxy has 20 phones so if you're going to buy those phones and not use that high refresh rate you're missing out a bit on what you're paying for but to come back to that question do you still get good battery life on 120 Hertz the answer has become a very resounding yes taking a look at the clock on the right-hand side well well past the six-hour mark and the pixel is actually just died right now which actually supports a lot of the articles I've seen recently that pixel battery life has improved over the lifetime of the phone see when the pixel four launched those phones were slated for their battery life like it was not pretty but right now having just performed over six hours twenty that's incredibly solid that is comfortable to the point where I'd be happy recommending the pixel for excel as a reliable battery phone and the ultra is called airdate to this three phones remaining it's pretty clear which one's going first but after that it's still fairly close between the iPhone in the hallway although in that time always gained about a five percent lead no last time I compare these two phones they were basically tied in the end the iPhone kind of edged it out by a few minutes but it was close enough that it's perfectly possible that trend could be reversed because we're running completely different applications this time round and you've got to remember since launch both friends have had a whole multitude of updates and that can also improve battery life anyway you've probably had enough of staring at slabs of glass and battery indicators so what were the results well in fifth place pixel for excel with six hours and 26 minutes I've said this before I'll say this again I'm impressed fourth was the s20 ultra and on one hand yes it's fourth place but on the other hand as a time itself is fantastic especially considering that this is with a 120 Hertz mode on following this the galaxy note temp Loess with its psychedelic rear finish seven hours and twenty eight on a similar tear to the s20 ultra but remember with a 60 Hertz display and now in second place the iPhone 11 pro max leagues ahead eight hours and 28 minutes this is pretty much one of the best battery lives you can get on a smart phone and it's got fantastic standby life too and that leaves Huawei with 8 hours and 46 minutes as the king of this battery comparison between this and the iPhone they'll trade blows so which one wins will depend slightly on how you use your phone but both are absolutely phenomenal and as a final take away you can be rest assured that the s20 ultras battery life is really good too and it could well be right at the top if you use 60 Hertz but having said my his era and this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in [Music]
