[Music] hey what's up guys mkbhd here and uh it's 2019 and obviously everything leaks so of course it's never too early for a little bit of pixel hype and boy is today a good day for some of that so if you've been following pixel 3 for the past couple months you know comparing it to other phones we've been asking google for so long now to step up their hardware game to match their incredible software that's always been like a slightly weaker point with the pixels and it looks like they've finally done it for 2019. so this is your exclusive first look at the google pixel 4 for 2019. there it is that's the phone okay so there's a lot to take in here of course things like why does it look so different why does it have that wedge looking thing why does it look like it's in a case but luckily not only do i have this leak but i also have a bunch of information i have some sources some exclusives so i can explain it all so my sources are close to the situation but they wish to remain anonymous but i trust them with my life there a hundred percent on this kind of stuff uh and they have the answers first of all these leaked images come as a picture of the phone with a clear case on it so that's why it might look kind of weird with that sort of an outline but that's what's happening you can clearly see the outline of a clear case around the pixel 4. and they're really going bezel-less like the rest of the competition the chin is of course tiny the side bezel's minimal and there's a fingerprint reader now underneath the display glass on the front and as you can see the screen goes right all the way up to the top and then there's a motorized selfie camera shelf that looks like a shark fin and as a matter of fact that is the device's internal code name so it's pretty common before a phone comes out for it to have an internal name that everyone the employees refer to it as an internal code name and google's for the past couple years with pixels and nexus devices have notoriously been fish related so the nexus 7 tablet before it came out was internally referred to as grouper and then the nexus 10 the bigger tablet before that came out that was called manta like a manta ray the nexus 4 was called mako as in mako shark nexus 5 was hammerhead and then nexus 6 was infamously uh shamu so the whale and then the first pixel was called sailfish so google is clearly sticking to those roots with pixel 4 internal code name shark fin because of the shark fin selfie camera obviously it also looks like google's doing a dual camera on the back which is nice i'm thinking that's an ultra wide camera because you can't really fake ultrawide with software like google's done a whole bunch of great stuff with one camera in the past but you can't do ultra wide if you don't have an ultrawide lens so a second camera super ultra wide lens that's great and then my source says it should have the latest specs snapdragon 855 eight gigs of ram great and then the power button and volume rocker are in the same traditional place the squeeze functionality is also still intact so why was google able to suddenly step up their hardware game so fast for this pixel 4. and why does this remind me of that leak i just saw last week of that oppo reno phone well my source says google recently completed a silent acquisition of the mobile hardware team at oppo this is totally exclusive never before seen information so that's why the pixel 4 looks exactly like that oppo reno leak that we saw last week and i actually believe this is an intentional leak take another closer look at this apple image [Music] so at first it looks like a random collection of colorful artsy images nothing to see here but why else would they have a magnifying glass and a microscope clearly they want us to look closer here so if you look even closer so there's a whale over there and that's an obvious hint at the sea life in all their previous code names and there's a camera over there all the way over to the side that's clearly a signal at how proud google is of their cameras and it's a dslr with a wide-angle lens on it meaning it'll have the ultra wide camera as that second lens confirmed and then what is this like around the plane it's like some sort of plant like a like a beanstalk like jack in the beanstalk okay okay so that's how okay that's how you tell us we're getting a pixel 4 with a jack a headphone jack well played google well played and then there's some sort of monkey or lemur which i wasn't sure what species it was supposed to be until i saw the elephant which is clearly an african elephant which if it wasn't obvious by the globe hanging down that shows africa i mean come on guys so of course i looked up species of lemurs that are native to africa turns out this one most closely resembles a red-tailed sport of lemur native to madagascar fun fact and red tailed clearly means that they want the letter under the tail to be red so we can turn that e red and then above the letter n is clearly a magnifying glass on the color yellow so they want the letter under that magnifying glass to be yellow duh so you turn that yellow which gives you the four colors of the letters now blue red yellow blue are you getting it it reminds you of anything blue red yellow blue okay so last bit i think they just threw this in for fun for the people who didn't get all that uh they just called it the oppo reno pretty obvious reno backwards is owner as in owner as in first project under a new owner google so easy so clearly this is the pixel 4 confirmed in every which way but that's not all we've also been waiting for well over a year for an additional device and we're finally getting it there is also a pixel 4 ultra so this is a clip of the pixel 4 ultra launching alongside this phone courtesy of our guy dave 2d [Music] it's just beautiful it's so beautiful so yeah clearly leaks are getting pretty serious in the tech world and you got to look you got to look a little deeper than just the surface level when you see a leak this is how you get to the next level i even tossed it in an ocr program and i saw those characters in between oppo and reno and of course we know oppo is or was a chinese company so i translated the ocr image into characters in english and i got uh april fool nice so this is your annual reminder uh not to take any announcements or any new products too seriously for the next 24 hours but i hope you enjoyed this one anyway um but what isn't a joke is the new drop in the mkbhd merch store including this and a bunch of all favorites are coming back including this new thing uh a matte black microfiber i was kind of getting tired of those like thin ones they just kind of toss in everything the microfibers you see everywhere so this is a high quality one you can actually use on everything laptop phone tablet just want to kill them all thanks bixby so i'll link to everything below also shout out to dave2d for helping out with this video and his glorious beautiful pixel 3 or pixel 4 mock-up appreciate that dave anyway until the next one happy april fool's day thanks for watching catch you guys next one peace
