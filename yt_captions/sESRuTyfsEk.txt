- We will be spending 24 hours in this insane asylum.
- Yay. - But we're gonna do it a
little different this time. There are two teams. Team red. Team black. Whichever team survives the
longest in this insane asylum, which by the way, they
can't use their arms. They're all wrapped up. Whichever team survives
the longest gets 10 grand. Last thing we are doing different
is there to be no deals. If you even mention a deal, you lose. The other team gets to
10 grand. Video over. All right. You guys ready? - Yeah.
- Yeah. - All right. See you guys in three days. - Ah. Ah. Tea bagged. - The call duty classic. - All right. How long do you think
you're gonna last, Ethan? - Ah. What is time? 24 hours. Easy. - Okay. Chris, how long do you
think you're gonna last? - Banana sundae. - We'll just leave Chandler alone. How about you? How long do
you think you're gonna last? - I'm gonna just beat Chris and Ethan and I just have to keep Chandler in here so then we're gonna win. - Oh yeah. You have Chandler on your team. Chandler's 0 for 5 in challenges. - I mean he's bound to win
sooner or later, right? That's my theory. - Insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again and
expecting a different outcome. - Oh, yeah. - What are you doing? - Huh? - Ethan will last the longest.
There's no doubt in my mind. However, getting Chris out
is the key to us winning. - There's a key to the door? - Yes. And his name's Chris. - Seriously, guys. We'll see you in about an hour.
We'll do our first checkup. If you have anything to say, say it to the camera right there, or say it to the security camera. To be honest, they're
gonna be in there for like, two to three days. So we're just gonna leave
them be for now and, you know, like ten hours in
we'll start messing with them. - Security? Hello? Security. - Literally, it's been like ten minutes and he's already going crazy. Security? - Shh. It's only been ten minutes. - Help me. I need. Actually, I don't need anything. Hi. How ya doin'?
- You looking thick. Chandler's lookin' thick, Chris. Boy, he's thick, boy. He's a thick boy. Hey. Hey, look. My tongue is in the outside world. Ah. Ah. Ah. Y'all got any beans? Y'all got any baked beans? Do. Do. Do. Do. Do. Do.
Do. Do. Do. Do. Do. Do. Oh, my gosh. - Hello? Hello? I'm about to fall.
Please go back down. Go back down! - We're literally ten minutes in and we're already going insane. - I'm gonna go in there, lay on the floor and just do snow angels and not say a single thing
and see how they react. - The door. Ah. The door. - Get back. Get back. - Hey. Hey, get him. Perfect way to block
him. Against the wall. What you gonna do now, boy? - I was gonna walk in
here and do a snow angel, but then in got harassed. Let me outta here. - You can't get outta here. - Yeah. - Go ahead. Open the door. He's fine. I swear. I'll never tell. - Open the door. He's ready to go. - Don't let him out, Garrett. - All right. Check the cameras. - Am I good? - You are not good. - I'm not good? - You're not good. It is not clear. - I need you guys on
that wall so I can leave. Garrett, open the door. - You're good. Ah. - Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.
Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine. - We need a medic. - I'm having a medical emergency. - We know you do. That's
why you're in there. - Please. Please. Please.
Please. Please. Please. Please. Ple- Ah! - Airplane.
- Airplane. - Ah! - Oh, my god. Ahhh! - We need a medic! - Ahhh!
- Medic! - Medic!
- Medic! - I feel like my skull
broke my entire fall. - Going back in. Wish me luck. Just gonna sit on my phone in the corner. - Door!
- Door! - I came here to play on my phone. - According to all laws of known aviation, - Ow! - The flood. ♪ Ah. A muffin pan. Muffin time. ♪ ♪ Who wants a muffin? ♪ ♪ Just another muffin man. ♪ ♪ Please. It's muffin time. ♪ - Ha-ha. You're losers. Ha! Losers. - I'm gonna turn the
megaphone on siren mode and throw it in there, 'cause they have no way of turning it off. - Ah. They turned it off. Hey! You weren't supposed
to be able to turn it off. - You suck. Ahhh! Jimmy is not as smart as us! - I'm gonna go retrieve the megaphone. I'm bringing a weapon with me. An umbrella. Stay back. I came here for the
megaphone and nothing else. Get away. Give it to me. Get back. Get. Hey. Get back. Get back. Hey. Hey. You guys have been bad
boys. We'll be back. Cameraman, let's go. I got your six. Stay back. - All right. I'm about
to turn off the lights and then make the hue lights flicker. - Uh-oh. Um. - You got it, Garrett. Don't worry. You can figure out how
to turn the lights red any second now. Garrett, you're doing great. - This time we're gonna put
a piece of duct tape over it so they can't turn it off. We're gonna train them to act right. - Oh. - How'd they get past the duct tape? They don't have arms. All right. We're coming
back bigger and stronger next time, then. - I doubt it! - Mark my words. - Get him. Get him. - No. No. No. No. No. Get away from me. - Not again. I'm sorry. - Get him. Get him. Get him. - Ah! - I broke it, though. - Bad boy.
- Bad boy. - I'm smarter than you. - No one checked on him. Is he still alive? - He's good, bro. - Hey. Just checking. Making sure you're still alive. - Step out. - Oh! Yes! - He has a weapon!
- A weapon! - All right. You guys are the worst guards ever. - Ah! Wrong arm. Ha-ha-ha! - Ah! No! - For what, then? - Should I scream? - Yes. - Ahhh! - You folks just blow in from stupid town? - I haven't mentioned this yet, but they get a bathroom break. It's time for their first one. All right. Who wants to go first? - Don't look at me. - Oh, what are they doing? - Watching Chandler while he pee's. - Dude, I don't even
know if I can like, pee. - Chandler, you clearly
didn't have to pee. - Dude, I'm about to.
Can you just shut up? - Can you adjust? - No, I can't. - You good? - All right. - So I just had them go
and buy some Twizzlers to feed them as a nutritious little snack. So I'm just gonna go and like, sneak it through the little hole. - Hey. What are you doing? - Nothing. - Does anybody hear a noise? It sounds like somebody,
like, walking on snow? - Outside help. - Me and Chris are gonna
share the licorice. - Mm. - God. That's. ♪ I don't know what I've been told ♪ ♪ I don't know what I've been told ♪ ♪ This old team ain't got no soul ♪ ♪ This old team ain't got no soul ♪ ♪ Chandler looks like he's mad ♪ ♪ Chandler looks like he is mad ♪ ♪ Sound off ♪ ♪ One, two ♪ ♪ Sound off ♪ ♪ Three, four ♪ - Hey! Hey! - It's time for us to feed
them their first ration. This and three crackers. Who's getting fed first? - I'll go. - So you get peanut
butter and three crackers. - Domino's. - I don't like peanut butter. I'm good. - All right. Then, we'll skip Ethan. You want food? - He's eating this cracker. He's after my- - I'm hungry! - Don't steal Chandler's crackers. - Chandler doesn't have his 'cause he always gets really hissy. I wanna see this. Hold on. - Can you just put mine on the floor? Give it that good zuck. Give it the zuck. - Doesn't it taste good? - It's got peanut butter in it. - It tastes good. - I got oatmeal stuck in my straw. - I am not helping you
guys to your drinks. - Ah. That was amazing. - Whoo. Ah. Whoo. - Yo, there's a fight. There's a fight! - Oh, god! - Oh! - All right. No more ball. - All right. Let's go check on them. How are you? - No one takes me serious. - I wonder why? - I have to poop.
- Okay. - Take me now.
- What? - I have to go poop. I'm serious. - Okay.
- Can I go poop? - Okay. Noted. How are you, Chris? - I'm doing good. - We're not gonna lose, Chandler. - Yeah, we are.
- No, we're not. - Yes, we are. - You, man. With the motivation. Motivation. - Well, all right. Guys, let's have a dance party
and then Chandler can poop. All right. It's time for a dance party. Guys, he's dancing. All right. Who's next? You guys rate who danced
better in the comment section. Chandler's second. - Hit the beat. - Yeah, let's get that right. - I don't know what to do. - Oh, this is good. This is good. Ethan said you will buy me a drink. And you will buy me the who the ho. Oh! Jiggle with it. Jiggle with it. Jiggle with it. Oh, that's like, ballet right there. - Oh, my god! - First of all, how do I
follow up with that? Like. I'm out. - Someone get their grandpa. All right. Black team won. - Yeah, boy! Whoo! - So, some of you guys
have to use the bathroom and I can potentially let
you guys use the bathroom outside of here. Let's be real. Then then
challenge would go on forever. I'm gonna let you guys vote. If we do let you guys use
the bathroom out there we're going to have to make
your guys' live in here like a living nightmare or this thing is gonna go on forever. Stand on the right if you wanna be able
to go outside and poop. Stand on the left if you wanna have to
stay in here and poop. - I poop a lot. - We're not gonna be able to let you sleep and we're gonna have to
constantly be harassing you if we let you guys out to poop. All right. Are you sure? All right. So you're okay with us being mean? 'Cause we're gonna have to be mean so this doesn't go on forever. We will let them go outside to poop. And because of that, we
gotta make this a lot harder on you guys. So you might get egged
and watered and stuff. So we were letting Chandler poop and um. - I tore my labrum and my shoulder, like, popped outta socket. And it really hurts. - Ooh! - It's loose. - We have a medical injury. Everyone. How do we deal with a medical injury? All right. So, Chandler's out. So, Chandler, you go get
your shoulder taken care of. It sucks, but nothing we can do about it. But the $10,000 prize is still here. Whoever steps out next
doesn't get anything and the other two get 5 grand each. Whoever steps out, Zoro steps
out, you two get 5 grand. Ethan steps out, you two get 5 grand. It's still 5 grand each. Just one of you leaves,
the other two get it. - No deals, no nothing? - No deals. Nope. Yeah. - It's still-
- Yeah. No deals.
- Making sure that's- - Since Chandler got hurt, next person to leave gets nothing and the other two still get 5 grand. We're gonna have to mix it up a little bit because of the medical emergency. All right, guys. - All right. Bet. - So, Chris, now that Chandler's gone and it's every man for
himself, how do you feel? - It doesn't matter how
long it's gonna take we're still gonna win. Or, I guess, not we anymore. But I'm still gonna win. Kind of sucks that Chandler went out 'cause as bad as it sounds,
it would've been nice to go on home, maybe tonight or tomorrow. Even his shoulder can't win challenges. - What do you think now
that Chandler's gone? - I think doesn't matter.
'Cause I'm still gonna win. And, yeah. That's, yeah. - Again, no deals at all. How do you feel about Chandler
and his medical emergency? - I'm a little upset about it. You know, it's one v one v one. - Why are you upset? You
have a better chance- - Yeah. I know, right? Your odds just went up a lot.
You no longer have Chandler. - I wanted to be the reason
that Chandler finally won one. - Now we're gonna feed them. Hello? Brought you a little bit of food. They look dead. Okay. You can eat your food later. They don't look good. - I want food. - I need y'all awake if
we're giving you food. - Chris, wake your up. - Here's your ration.
Figure out how to eat it. Here's your ration.
Figure out how to eat it. - Thank you. - Here's your ration.
Figure out how to eat it. - Okay. - Mm. That's good. - Hey, Taylor. Taylor. I'm going home. My ears. My ears hurt really bad. A lot of you might know. 'Cause my ears, the doctors
have said they're pretty sure I've blown either one
or both of my eardrums. And because my eardrums are
full of pus and stuff like that and I have an infection. So at night time they get really
bad. They hurt really bad. They make me seasick.
All kinds of weird stuff. These are the winners. All right. Adios. - Oh, boy, guys. Chris wasn't looking good. Even though it was for medical
reasons, like Chandler, Chris did technically step out. So, I mean, I guess how
do you feel that you won? I don't know, it just kinda. It sucks 'cause Chandler had to leave 'cause of his popped out shoulder and Chris had to leave
'cause of his ear infection so it's just like. You guys won. You each get 5 grand. I feel bad because Chris
and Chandler both lost due to medical things, but like. He might've just, game ended. - Does that mean I get his money? - Yeah. If he's not alive. Sure. Okay. Yeah, they're pretty tired. I didn't think Chris' ear
infection was that bad. And I had no idea about
Chandler's shoulder. Don't hold that against them. Don't make fun of Chandler. Don't make fun of Chris. It's not their fault. Yeah, you guys each get 5 grand. - Let us out, please.
