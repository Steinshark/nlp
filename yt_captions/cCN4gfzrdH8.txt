hate is a really difficult we mustn't hate people but if I was to hate sadik Khan and what he stands for is something so close to what that feeling must [Music] be hello everybody I have the privilege of speaking today with actor Lawrence Fox we start by talking about his recent legal trouble in the UK Lawrence was arrested recently uh because of his stated support for the activists in the UK who are interfering with the imposition of the closed circuit television cameras designed to monitor everyone's movement under the purported guise of anti-pollution and saving the planet um there's a lot of CCTV cameras in England monitoring people to a much greater degree than I think is justifiable in a free society and Lawrence took a stance against that and has paid a legal price for doing so he's also suffered uh substantial disruption of of his acting career as a consequence of his political stance which has been pillared by people on the left as fascist as anything that's liberal or even moderately let's see moderately conservative or even liberal tends to be these days and so we talk about while we talk about his legal trouble we talk about his ability to act out dark characters and what that means psychologically and practically talk about the relationship between freedom of speech and the propagation of Truth through through psyche and Society um pointing in no small part to the fact that there's a real valuable Freedom that comes along with just saying what you think you know carefully and and clearly the cost of that especially in ideologically addled times can be the savaging of reputation and the price you might pay in terms of career development but the advantage is the freedom of conscience and and the ability to live in truth that comes along with actually saying what you believe to be true so we're going to wander through all that territory welcome aboard so Lawrence I thought we'd start um right at the heart of the matter or one of the many black hearts of the matter you might say I've been following your recent persecution I would say by the legal establishment in the UK I've I came across this what was happening to you of course because of Twitter primarily I've been following you for a long time on Twitter and I've also been watching with mounting apprehension the operation of the progressives in London it looks to me like sadik Khan and his London Administration are at the Forefront of the C40 uh Consortium implementation of the C 40 Consortium plans and I've reviewed them they've put them out in Stark black and white and they include propositions like the elimination of 95% of all forms of private transportation over the next 10 years something like that so there won't be any cars which is why we're all being enjoined let's say to buy the electric cars for which we have an insufficient supply of electricity let's say that we're going to be required to buy something like three articles of clothing a year year to have one short hul flight per person every 3 years which of course would devastate the entire tourism industry that basically keeps much of Europe afloat uh to stop eating meat etc etc and one of the steps in that direction seems to be the establishment of these ultra low emission zones which are there as far as I'm concerned not in the least to help the godamn planet but to stop people from what would you say to stop to discourage people in the patterns of consumption that the progressives regard as Planet demolishing and now I know there's been a big protest emerge in London in particular with regards to the cameras that the power mongering globalist utopians have decided to employ every which way to keep an eye on every bloody thing that everyone does and that these Blade Runner types so-called Blade Runner types have been demolishing these cameras and you have tweeted out your support for that and I've retweeted that and indicated my support as well in a relatively tongue and Chic manner but still directly you got arrested I went to the UK a month ago they left me alone which you know I suppose doesn't surprise me in some ways but also indicates the arbitrary what would you call the arbitrary enforcement of these absolutely Preposterous laws so do you want to fill people in to the degree that you can given your bail conditions about exactly what's been going on with you and what your view of this is sure um so these uh I'm not allowed to say the word um that you just said but I can say that Blade Runner is my favorite film um but I'm not allowed to say the plural of that word and I'm not allowed to say the name of these devices that are used to um to surveil londoners you can you can admit to the existence of the plural I I presume I I I can admit the existence of the plural but who knows the door's not too far away they might be barging at any time um this is a scheme uh dreamed up as you said by um the progressive Planet haters who want to drag us all back into the Stone Age and and the thing that bothered me most about it um and probably one of the only reasons I got involved in politics in the first place was because it was a scheme designed to damage the poorest in society the most so I don't know if you have this expression in Canada but we the expression in London is the white van man he's the guy that gets out in his white van every day and he drives into London he does whatever he does Plumbing electrician anything like that he is driving a diesel van and sadik Khan and his gang of globalist um scumbags have decided that any diesel vehicle made after 2015 or 2016 I can't remember the exact year is now liable for a1250 day sech charge now and this is in direct um conflict with the fact that if you buy an electric vehicle with your corporation tax in the United Kingdom as a well-off person you can claim back 100% of the cost of that uh electric vehicle again in the first year of your tax uh of your tax year so essentially what he's doing is he's he's he's deliberately making the poorest people poorer and those with the least voice quietest and I took great exception to this no no one voted for this there's actually he suppressed his own report saying that this would have a negligible effect on um the the pollution in London and he had that report suppressed so to me it was criminal uh behavior and its extortion and it's it's all the things that you associate with with criminals as far as I'm concerned so I supported in the spirit of you know American westerns the idea of people taking their Town back and for doing so for tweeting my support of it uh relentlessly and then for saying that I'd like to join them because um well I can't I also can't admit whether I know them or not but um sadik sent six of his finest coppers to come and arrest me uh two and a half months ago and what the thing that was so profoundly moving about that experience was on the car Journey on the way back with the six coppers there was a report of a suicide and a stabbing and both of the times the officers in the car said we're busy dealing with other matters so I just you know London has been completely hijacked by this um this mankind hating regressive niist so let me I'm going to play devil's advocate here a fair bit um these are questions I torture myself with so I'm going to make a case for sad K's Khan's uh his actions so the first case would be well London is overcrowded and there is expense associated with the the uh traffic congestion right the time that people spend because traffic is congested and you could imagine a scheme whereby there was a fee implemented to dissuade unnecessary now this is where it gets tricky because who decides what's unnecessary but to dis to dissuade let's say delayable Transportation into London right because it would keep the roads in principle it might keep the Lord L roads more free and that would actually if people could move around more quickly there would be some economic advantage to that so what do you think do you think there's any that any credit whatsoever should be given to an argument like that I mean so because K could say well we're just we're just trying to control traffic and it is too congested now I know he's made these cases that you know London air is still polluted and I find that pretty appalling because if you look at the historical record of particulates and and dangerous gases in London air the Improvement in air quality o especially over the last what five decades has been absolutely precipitous and it's it's actually a miracle of modern technology that London air is as clean as it is and you can say that for most cities even places like la which like London were famous for their pollution so that just strikes me as Preposterous but can you see any justification whatsoever for attempting to implement control over congestion in London well we we already previously had control over congestion in London which was called the congestion charge which everybody has to pay anyway if you drive a vehicle in or out of London orbe it not an electric vehicle so and you're right to say that pollution is come down drastically in London all meter readings uh pollution meter reading particulate meetings carbon readings are very very either low or moderate in London so there's no justification to add this extra tax other than to fill up his emptying coffers now there is a there's a broader argument to be had about how much we want the planet to be a cleaner and better place I think you'd you'd find it hard pushed to find someone who go no I just want the planet to be much more dirty but we've seen we've seen with um also sorry just to interrupt about the congestion thing the um 50% of London social housing is occupied by illegal immigrants so there is a or or immigrants seeking asy Asylum so we we London is already bursting to overflowing so these these traffic calming measures if they calmed traffic great but they don't calm traffic it's an ideological mission to because he cannot force you out of your car because there would be uproar what he's going to do is he's going to tax you out of your car so because people will not listen to this idea that they want to be free to drive to the beach you know England is small you can get to the beach in 45 minutes from London if you want to he wants you out of your car and into these electric cars which in their own way are digital prisons on their own because if you speak to a if if you speak to a ECT El car owner you know some of the Uber drivers or or some of the other cab companies in London they say that they cannot the minute they get out of London their battery is gone so they are they're hemmed in by this digital prison of their own car whereas you know you can buy a Tesla and go quite a long way but you buy a sort of mid-market here and you're not going anywhere so uh you know I I I fully support uh selik Khan um trying to clean up London but I wish he would do it with evidence instead of made up figes he's making up these figures of 4,000 people are going to die from asthma and it's just a lie and I I I struggle with people that lie openly so he lies about he he's just been uh reported the other day for knife crime he said knife crime is down and my tenure it's not it's up 40% but he feels that he can tell London that knife crime is not a problem and it's like it really is and in the same way pollution is the same issue London is a much cleaner and more wonderful city than there ever was yeah well I I I grew when I grew up cars were still synonymous with freedom and I think in North America especially where I grew up I because I grew up in this little town way the hell out on the edge of the Prairie the biggest the nearest real city was 4 400 miles away and so I lived in my damn car from the time I was really 16 onward especially in my late teens and early 20s I mean car was synonymous with freedom and you know I've thought for a long time that one of the most effective acts of subversion the free West ever managed in relationship to the communist countries was to invent the automobile because the automobile is the is really the material embod embodiment of the ethos of individual Freedom you can jump in your car nobody knows where the hell you are they can't keep track of you although that's starting to change and you can go wherever you want without asking that's a big deal and then when I so when I started to see you know hypothetical utopians go after automobiles I thought man if you hate cars I'm probably your enemy cars and comedians right if you if you hate cars and you don't like comedians there's something seriously wrong with you and this I started to see the war on cars in Toronto about 15 years ago like it just got more and more more difficult to travel by car more bloody bike Lanes which is insane in a city like Toronto where it's frigid bloody cold for 6 months a year you know the only people who bike from November to March are diluted 24 year-old men who think they're saving the planet with their godamn bicycles and the notion that you know that's going to be a reasonable mode of transportation for like a 70-year-old woman with her groceries is just utterly prepost it just got more and more difficult and I used to annoy my family looking around saying you know I think there's a war on cars going on here I can't figure it out and you know it wasn't until recent years that I came across the bloody C40 documents which read like the worst right-wing conspiracists nightmare like you can't even believe that it's true um what in the world what what in the world do you think is going on at a deeper level here and like because obviously you're deeply enough concerned about this to have put your well you put your whole career on the line which is something else that I want to talk about but okay so you you went out and you you evinced explicit support for the actions of people who were taking down the the um ultra low emission Zone cameras and that got you arrested and so what are you charged with exactly and why did you feel that this was a issue that was of sufficient import to put you to put you and your family at real economic and legal risk so um yeah to answer your first question I am they're considering to charge me for conspiracy to commit criminal damage and um support of criminal damage of some kind um I think in the process becomes the punishment thing we'll we we'll see where they end up I I think this scant evidence for that the reason why I did it is the reason why I do everything which is progresses hate mankind they hate hate mankind with a with a visceral hatred and and I don't and therefore I feel that it's important to stand up and say you know you you expressed it very well when you were talking about the car it's like I want to be able to take my kids and my dogs to the river and I want to throw a ball for my dog in the river and while my kids to jump in the river and I want risk and danger and I want all of these things to happen in our lives and I don't want my life to be like a battery hen in a house asking permission for people uh uh to to to do something which is my god-given right to do and um it's it's the selik Khan I mean hate is really I've been really struggling with this as a as a concept hate is a really difficult we mustn't hate people but if I was to hate sad Khan and what he stands for is something so close to what that feeling must be he's just it's just Dreadful to try and control and and out of your own weakness and nihilism and hatred of life and meaning hatred of it all to to go my the only way I can get any meaning out of my life is to control yours and I just go well I will put every tool down in that war and I will fight you face to face over that let me play Devil's Advocate on that front too because the see I've been struck in recent years by the fact that you know the the progressives had two broad domains of of metaphysical concern one was allying themselves with the hypothetically oppressed including the economically oppressed and the other was saving the planet and so I was very curious about what would happen when those two concerns went head to head right and so what I I've seen happen clearly is that the progressive types despite the fact that the grounding of their progressivism is essentially in principle the support of the oppressed and the poor is that they will sacrifice the poor to the to the hypothetical concerns of the planet happily and in a heartbeat because every time I've seen the greens for example make a move on the energy front this is particularly evident in Germany and in the UK where Energy prices just keep skyrocketing out of control and the sources of of Power are more and more unreliable and more more dependent on dictatorial sources for that that if it comes to screwing the poor with higher energy costs which is about the most effective way you can screw them and foregoing saving the planet momentarily they'll they'll screw over the poor in a deadly fashion in no time flat and it really is deadly you know beor lomberg has shown statistics for example that show that these measures that purport to reduce energy consumption by decreasing thermostat maximum which is law for example you have to do that at the bloody European Commission in Brussels by the way you know that even a Three Degree decrease in thermostat setting in the winter will cause several hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths of elderly people because they're so susceptible to temperature fluctuation right because and so but the progressives are going to say to you something like well look Lawrence you might want to have your fun in games right now and take your flights and have all your clothes and all your privilege and and your so-called Freedom which is actually just a marker of your willingness and ability to exploit other people but I'm much more concerned with the situation 50 years down the road and you trumpet your um what would you say your concern for the poor and oppressed at the moment but I'm trying to Stave off you know Global disaster and if we have to break a few eggs to make that omelet it's well worth the sacrifice and so that's the that's the perennial argument right is that the future well-being of the hypo so because the argument you see is well when when the tidal waves of climate change come visiting it'll be the particularly the poor who suffer most intensely and so we have to make sacrifices now we have to make sacrifices now to forall that what do you I mean you can understand that that's a in principle a credible argument if you buy the climate change narrative what do you think of that argument how have you dealt with it personally well I would say that um the reason why they don't why the climate argument and the socioeconomic argument climate one was because socioeconomically we're very fluid capitalism with all its weaknesses is quite a fluid system my brother-in-law went from a a council house in ipswitch to being a really really wealthy film director so you know it this this stuff happens in Britain and it happens all across the West so they they they sort of left that alone and then in response to the second question I would say um give me a single climate prediction that these people have ever come out with which wasn't debunked within five years and and again I don't I every we've got to assume the good faith in people and we want a good we want a healthy planet we want a cleaner future for our children we already have one and it would seem to me that the best way of making the world a cleaner place is to make people richer you know because I I've sat I've sat on boats in the South China Sea driving between islands and watched people finish their poyene things that you used to get in McDonald's in the 80s and just throw them overboard and that's how they dealt with it and I think it was because they were too busy doing something else but if these people were wealthier that a they'd be you know you've you've spoken about this before using better fuel and B you know wealth is the is the greatest thing you can give someone to give them an opportunity to be responsible for the planet that they're going to pass on to their children using the internet without expressvpn is like having a first aid kit but not keeping it stocked up most of the time you'll probably be fine but what if you suddenly get into a horrible accident and there's nothing in your first aid kit every time you connect to an unencrypted Network in cafes hotels or airports any hacker on the same

concerned with the poor and the planet rather than merely hating the military industrial capitalist complex and Humanity in general you would take a stark look at the facts you would understand that transitioning our economies from wood and dung through coal fossil fuel to nuclear is an appropriate transition and one that's time tested it would lift the bottom billion or two billion people out of the object poverty that they still dwell in and it would simultaneously be of benefit to the planet and you'd also I think Ally that with a view that we should pull out all the stops on the nuclear front because nuclear energy is unbelievably dense we're much better at producing the reactors if we could get rid of the red tape than we were 50 years ago and so the other thing that makes me so skeptical of the we love the poor and the planet utopian narrative is that the greens almost inevitably object to nuclear energy and that's just a bloody Miracle isn't it because if it's carbon that's is the catastrophe and that catastrophe is so impending that it justifies the suspension of everyone's civil rights and the imposition of a lower standard of living on on the poor which is going to knock a lot of them into abject poverty then how how the hell can you not make a case for nuclear like if it's an emergency even if nuclear is a risk and I don't really think it is at least compared to other risks then obviously in an environment where all measures whatsoever are Justified an emergency transition to nuclear rather than to unreliable unreliable so-called Renewables which aren't renewable at all that would be in the cards and so you know the fact that that isn't happening it's one of those places where you see the internal contradictions of the ideology make itself manifest it's like well you know I work for the UN years ago on the first really sustainable development document and I'm morally pulled as a consequence of that I would say in my defense that the document the UN would have produced had the team I was involved with it wasn't my team it was Jim Balley's team he used to run Rim if we hadn't Rewritten that document it would be a hell of a lot more socialist and Humanity hating than it ended up being so I don't know if you serve a lesser evil if you serve to transform an evil into a lesser evil does that mean that what you did was good you know you could argue about that but but what I really came to understand when I worked on that panel was that all the evidence suggested exactly what you said was which is that if you got people above about $5,000 a year in average GDP they immediately started to take a long-term view of the environment and so it seems like the fastest way to a green planet is through wealth but we have this anti-human narrative that's been thrust upon us as an alternative which is that well really the carrying capacity of the planet is only about 500 million people and those people would have to live at a pre-industrial you know standard of living I don't know if they're supposed to all be bloody hippies out on some you know Island Utopia farming their goddamn goats and their chickens you know which is a dreadful way to live and I've watched hippies try to do that with you know catastrophic consequences because hand to mouth is no damn fun and it also begs the question what are you going to do with the extra seven and a half billion people and that's where I see like the real danger of this sort of utopian scheme I can't understand how you can make the claim that the planet has too many people on it without simultaneously selling your soul to Satan you know and I I mean that you know I mean that almost literally it's like that's such that's such an awful claim there's too many people okay buddy which people exactly I call I call it um German beach towel syndrome so when you're in a hotel and you check into the hotel and you're trying to go down to the pool and someone has woken up usually a German in England we mock the Germans for doing this and they've taken all the they've taken all of the beach chairs and it's like we need them for us and then they don't even turn up during the day I think it's an uninterrupted view between your paradise and the Sea and any plebs any people who get in the way of your uninterrupted view which you deserve because you think correctly you see that there's a problem and you're willing to do something about it is is seen in some way as as Noble and in my view it's that that that is anti-human and also I I grew up in a Christian family I've been imbued with a lot of things from from Christianity which I just can't get out of my head and one of them is that we're all made equal in the eyes of God therefore therefore I I I feel that that's a really good place to start any conversation so it helps with any conversations to do with poverty with race with any other issue to go look we're equal but we have different opportunities and this idea that you know the the the Hypocrites who fly their Jets around the world telling us that we mustn't eat meat anymore or sadik Khan who gets a his 300,000 armor plated Range Rover to drive him three miles to walk his dog with his wife with his security detail but we can't get in a car and take our kids to the beach and have a fire and cook some sausages is you have to pick side at that point you just have to go I've picked my side yeah well you pick a side one way or another man and everybody's going to find that out in the next 5 to 10 years okay so let me push you on something else too um so when I was retweeting your tweets supporting the um or indicating admiration let's say for the actions of people who were cutting down the the Spy C cameras so I was shocked when I went to London 15 years ago about how many of those bloody CTV cameras there were everywhere and I thought this is not good because the UK is the home of democratic Freedom fundamentally as far as I'm concerned like it's the epicenter and the fact that you guys put those bloody cameras everywhere it's just you know it's just AB in the name of safety safety except except that you're being watched by like authoritarian cameras all the time which doesn't strike me as safe and then that's just multiply multiplied you know in China now there's 700 million cameras they just watch everyone all the time they do gate recognition so even if your face is covered they can recognize you're tracked 100% of the time and that's certainly a potential future that we could have that those that idea was extended too into this uh insistence that your car is so dangerous that we have to track you wherever you go in case you're like outputting some iota of carbon or particulate so but there's a contradiction here if you're conservative in your or even libertarian conservative particularly in your political inclinations it's like I do have some unease in expressing my support for direct civil unrest right I mean cutting down cameras is not nothing it's it's it is technically a criminal act how do you re reconcile the fact that you're calling for that you're supporting the the actions that vigilante types are taking to push back against KH with the conservative insistence that by and large it's a citizen's responsibility to uphold the law like how do you draw the line there well I think I apply sort of a very simple rule rule which is the rule of fly tipping which is you're not allowed to fly tip if you go and offload a a van full of waste and you know washing machines and Frid freezers on the side of the motorway you're prosecuted for it that's what you do so no one voted so we have these low traffic neighborhoods as well where they stick a big plant pot in the middle of the road and you can't drive through people can't get into hospitals people can't do anything so I see this as digital fly tipping it wasn't there yesterday the world was the same world it is there today the world is now a less free world and no one has benefited as a result of it so I see it less as looking at the law I I see it as removing unwanted digital waste from your community and we're always encouraged to you know look out for each other and protect your neighbor and all of this sort of stuff so I see it as that and I think a large proportion of londoners also do see it as that as we see with the um I mean I can't encourage their work any anymore because my free speech has been controlled by the Metropolitan Police but you know I see it as a civic duty when uh moral wrong is committed it it is your civic duty to do anything and everything in your power to do it to undo it okay okay so so let's imagine for a moment that I'm one of these just stop oil characters and I believe that the planet is in existential trouble because of climate change that's going to run away and because of that I also take to myself the right to break laws to IM impede traffic flow to glue myself to a spectacular painting I mean how do you how do you I wouldn't say convince yourself you you see what I mean is that yeah there's this danger in people taking matters into their own hands right it it's the danger of social unrest versus the danger of of hyper obedience right and but the just stop oil protester types the people who are going too far on the globalist utopian side seem to be using similar communitarian arguments now you know I don't I think that the fact that the just stop oil protesters interfere with traffic flow is inexcusable fundamentally and I don't buy their argument but it's complicated for me to think through precisely I mean you have to go all the way down to First principles to some degree you know mentioned in in your previous remarks your proposition that you know each person is made in the image of God and that's that's getting pretty close down to First principles I mean I don't know while you sorry I'm I'm wandering around in this question but you get the point is that what is being done by the people who are cutting down the cameras is analogous with a different set of metaphysical propositions to what is being done by the just stop oil protesters and so it isn't exactly obvious to me how to draw the proper moral distinction well I I think it it is possible to draw a moral distinction over stopping traffic flow because um obstructing the King's Highway has been a illegal since forever so stopping people going to and from work and preventing ambulances getting to and from hospital that that is clearly an egregiously wrong thing to do um taking an angle oh can I see this taking an angle grinder to a um to a lamp post that was not previously there I I I see what you're saying which is like at what point does a c citizenry take the law into their own hands I it's really difficult it is really difficult I would for example I think the more the justop oil people throw orange paint on masterpieces the better because we the more people will just go yuck and they don't have any public support for doing so and I think that the public support the overwhelming public support for what even we've had Ian Duncan Smith who's a former leader of the conservative party has expressed his if not support but his understanding as to why these uh people are are doing what they're doing okay so so one of the things you're referring to is the fact that it that that's an argument that's essentially grounded in a appreciation of the sovereignty of the people is that if you you know I think I read at one point this might be wrong but it's a good illust the principle I I think it was the Netherlands that had a custom or legislation that if 75% of Netherland citizens citizens broke a given law you had to get rid of the law right so there is there's got to be some idea that the law although it has to shape people and and inhibit them to some degree it should sit on a basis of mutual consent and that brings us to another issue too I've been thinking this through especially with regard to what happened during the covid lockdown you know and if there's an emergency you can understand that you can understand the argument that some civil liberties might have to be lifted to deal with the emergency you can understand that argument in principle but my sense is that if someone is calling for an emergency claiming an emergency and simultaneously pointing to the fact that civil liberties are to be suspended in Consequence the first conclusion you should draw from that is that they're probably wolves in sheep's clothing they're probably tyrants and that the argument is actually the reverse they want to impose control and so they're generating an emergency and we should demand what do they say radical claims require um overwhelming evidence it's something like that and so our general sense as citizens should be if you're bloody the emergency if you're calling for an emergency that grants you additional power you would have to prove every which way that you're not just a tyrant who's lying that should be the default thumb you know the rule of thumb and so the same thing seems to me to apply with these with these cctvs and and this widespread surveillance it's like you claim to be acting as a consequence of being motivated by by the highest possible virtue you know if it's not God it's your version of compassion which is the modern God but the fact that you're acre all the power as a consequence seems like a coincidence a little bit too um that's cutting a bit too close to the Bone to ignore and this seems to be happening y i i i i think that F first and foremost there's got to be a free speech element to this so you you you've got to be able to criticize something be it lockdowns be it um Sadi Khan's ridiculous climate scam schemes or anything so we we have to put free speech of the Primacy of the center of of any single argument the second thing that one's got to look at is if we are banned from discussing an issue at all it needs discussing so for example the so-called climate emergency if we're told there is a climate emergency it's not up for discussion there is a uh a deadly virus it's not for discussion this is the only treatment if you're banned from doing that you need to talk about it and the third thing is if you're trying to make the world a better place and a cleaner and happier and more uh you know fuele efficient place and you want to build 15 minutes cities where I can walk to my barber I can walk to my Supermarket then build me the infrastructure before you build me the controlling mechanisms to with which you're going to shut down my life yeah well that's a really that's a really good point you know like when this 15-minute City thing came up you know it was so interesting to watch it morph because I looked at the plans of the new urban planners let's say 15 years ago and in North America in particular our cities are blighted by the spread of these mcmansion suburbs or even just middle class suburbs that really have no community center right there's no shopping malls there's no bars there's no churches there's no downtown there's just an endless sprawl of identical house and there's something Soul deadening about them they're not constructed in a manner that makes for human flourishing because there's no social element to the community they're just boxes with individuals in them right and inside the box there are other boxes where everyone's with their camera or with their phone in their own atomized environment and so when the new urbanists started to talk about you know building localized centers where things were within walkable disc distance and there were and there were the sorts of things that you might want to walk to like a community center and a church and a pub and a theater I thought well that makes perfect sense you shouldn't have to hop in your car every time you want to you know grab a loaf of bread but then it was so interesting to watch that the seed of a good idea be immediately what would you say uh gripped on to by The moralizing utopist Who immediately conjured up way to make the 15minute cities into something like digital prisons I it was quite a miracle to watch that transformation occur and and and you you pointed to something of cardinal importance it's like look and I think this is where the free marketers have it over the centralizes as well it's like if you want to build people a 15minute city that's unbelievably inviting so that people flock there and voluntarily leave their automobiles at home because they can walk wherever they want and that's easier then have add her and if you make a fortune doing it you know two thumbs up for you but if you start with the force and the compulsion and the deprivation of civil liberties we should suspect immediately that you're not just going to start there that's going to be the whole bloody thing and that whatever you're offering is just well it's just it's a false reward for accepting these these these this imposition of force same thing and so maybe this is a good rule of thumb for people to abide by which is that we're trying to do this with this Arc Enterprise that that just had its conference in London the alliance for responsible citizenship we have a rule of thumb all policy based on force is at least suboptimal if not outright wrong if I can't do something in a manner that invites you voluntarily then I'm wrong I want to tell you a little story about that you tell me what you think about this we were talking about about the Christianity of your youth I just did a seminar on Exodus with a group of Scholars and we released that on the daily wire platform and on YouTube and that was quite successful there's a real cool part of that story so it has to do with Moses so Moses is the archetypal figure who fights tyranny and redeems the slave and so you could imagine that in so far as you're a fully functioning social being who's moral that's what you do you oppose tyranny and you you grant responsibility and dignity and direction to the slaves okay so that's what Moses does and he does this for like four decades right 40 years in the desert he puts his life on the line he sacrifices his whole life to this Enterprise standing up against the Pharaoh which was a deadly thing to do and then leading his people through their confusion in the desert so they drop their tyranny and then they're confused for 40 years now just as he reached is the promised land and so the archetypal structure here is everybody's journeying to the place they want to go to right and no matter what you're doing you're always trying to Journey to the place you want to go to that's the promised land so Moses has done this assiduously for four decades now he's right on the threshold of the promised land and the Israelites are all bitching and whining and squawking away because they're out of water again and so Moses goes to God and he says well you know we need some water and God says well you're going to find some rocks and he tells them where and he says go speak to the rocks and they'll issue forth water and Moses goes but instead of speaking to the Rocks he hits them with his staff and his staff is a symbol of authority and tradition right so he strikes The Rock and then he strikes it again and the water does come forth from the rock but God tells him that because he used Force instead of words that he will die before he enters the Promised Land it's such a striking yeah right it's such a striking story because you have this person who's as close to a savior as anyone in the Old Testament right I mean Moses he's I think he's the central figure of the Old Testament you know you could argue about that but he's certainly a central figure and so he does things about as well as you could hope anyone could do and yet the punishment for him for using Force even in that relatively trivial manner is that he can't he can't make the Utopia make itself manifest right that's how dangerous force is and so maybe we could use as a rule of thumb the idea that anybody who's trying to push you to do anything if they're actually trying to push you they're not to be trusted if they can't formulate their Doctrine as an invitation a voluntary invitation at minimum they're incompetent and probably they're Psychopathic and tyrannical yeah I mean I mean I think you touch on possibly the most important question of this fluctuating time that we live in which is what comes next does do the do the so-called or the self-appointed right thinking men bash their staves on the head of the radical woke ideologues the racists the people who wish should tear this Society apart do we bash our staff and say no or do we have faith in God to ask and I think look I I I I'm I'm in no way a theologian and I'm in no way someone who is able to speak on uh on biblical matters in any way at all but I think there's something in that story which is which is fascinating because I have a very very strong desire and I know it's a personal and and a human and a fallible desire to to go you know what these people need counseling we need to councel these people they they they have bought Terror and horror on they I mean they've destroyed a large part of my life but you know they gave me a new one so that was okay but they they bring misery everywhere and you think you know what do what does one do back and I suppose uh you know the closest I can come to it now is if God is saying you just offer the word and the water will come then then maybe it is literally that simple it is we encourage Comics we encourage those people to speak and not compel we encourage people to be courageous in their words not in their not not in their desire to play the same game as the as those that they don't agree with play and I struggle with this all the time because I get more and more and more and more frustrated because you know we have this same thing with sik Khan he has a block vote we have obviously we have you know the US and in the UK have the same problem with uh unfettered and uncontrolled immigration which only affects the poorest people in society including immigrants and you just think this has got to stop we have to compel you to do this but actually I think there is something wonderful in the human in the mystery of the human which is that you know speak gently and carry a big stick I mean something better about that well one of the things I've really noticed on social media and I think this is most Stark on Twitter so since I made a comment that was somewhat impulsive on Twitter about the Israel Hamas conflict I've restructured the way I'm interacting on Twitter and so instead of redistributing anti-woke material you know which has that forceful kind of forceful element to it right we need to put a stop to this and like like I've had so I've been persecuted by my college of psychologists in Ontario and it's it's very annoying and I have a temper and I'm not that afraid to use it and I've had some pretty bloody brutal fantasies about just exactly what I'd like to do to the office of the College of psychologists you know and there's a part of me that not only thinks that's Justified and necessary but would also kind of Glory in it you know but one of the things I've noticed Lawrence is that and this is especially true on Twitter is that we've turned my Twitter feed into something that's basically putting out positive messages that are pulled from my writings right they're invit you could think about them as Invitational messages and I've also seen this on YouTube you know when when I do a more political interview that's oriented more towards fighting back against the utopian radicals the Twitter comment or the the comment feed gets pretty vitriolic and quite polarized and often quite unpleasant whereas if the message is Invitational you know laying out an alternative Vision that's positive and talking to someone about how that might come about which is what we did at the AR conference then all of a sudden the comment sections are extremely positive and I would also say that those messages especially now attract more attention than the more political messages and so you know so maybe it is that it's incumbent and this seems to be Associated you tell me what you think about this it seems to be associated with the doctrines of you know turn the other cheek and resist not evil you know and and part of the reason I really wanted to talk to you today is because both of us have paid a rather complex personal price for taking the stand that we've taken now it's certainly not been for me it's certainly not been something that was without its opportunities quite the contrary you know in some ways it's the best thing that ever happened to me although some of it was pretty rough you know I lost my research career I lost my University career and my clinical practice had to shut down I mean I I spent decades investing into those Enterprises and I was good at them and I enjoyed them and so sacrificing them was not nothing even though the consequences of that have been remarkable but I am trying to work through the notion that maybe all of us all that those of us who are opposing the centralizing power mad woke Humanity hating woke mob should be doing is putting forth an alternative Vision that's Invitational you know now that that gets us back to the initial question which is well does that mean that it's reasonable to tweet out support for people who are you know practically opposing the proliferation of CCTV cameras you know that's a place where the rubber hits the road and I'm still conflicted about that because I hate those godamn cameras I think they're unbelievably dangerous and I feel that you're morally obligated to dispense with them that's what you do in the celebration of Freedom all arguments about security last thing we need is a Security State there's no security in a Security State you give up all Security in a Security State and I don't know how to reconcile that necessity for active opposition to the more blatant forms of tyrannical surveillance with the notion that an Invitational Vision that abjures use of force is clearly both more attractive and perhaps more practically what would you say and perhaps more practical so w so what do you think of that you're a temperamental guy so you know you've got an inclination to to to have the scrap I think there's a humor to it um and I think the thing about the uh guys that I'm not allowed to say the name of is that there is a humor to it that there there's something about it which is we know we're never going to beat the big system but we're not going to go down without a fight and no one is getting harmed in the process so so this isn't like a like the the equivalent of of taking a man who suddenly wants to put on a wig and putting him in a woman's prison this is removing something that they don't want and no one got hurt doing it other than the you know taxpayer essentially or the or the mayor in his silly scheme so I think if you apply a level of of humor Humanity to it then I think it has some value but I do agree with you look we we're going to as we enter this this most difficult phase of the conflict if that's if I'm talking about it correctly we are there all of the weapons that we have that we have tried to defend ourselves with are going to be used as cudgels to destroy us with certainly over stuff like free free speech why shouldn't I sing um from The River To The Sea why shouldn't I call you know you saw the debacle in um the Senate hearing where they were saying well maybe it maybe it maybe it's calling it they're going to and they and her first thing in her apology note was to say well I was just upholding the First Amendment the right to free speech oh yeah oh man that yeah right at Harvard oh yes that was ranked 248th out of 248 universities for free speech that was just beyond absolutely bloody Beyond Comprehension standing for free speech how do we how do we as human beings who I think one of the differentiating factors between us is that I do not hate woke people and I said this at the beginning it's really hard not to hate sadique Khan because he's he's a really horrible guy but I don't hate him I hate what he does I hate what he does but I don't hate him so I think the one of the things that is is the differentiating factor is and that's not to put yourself in a morally Superior position but is to turn around and say I I don't hate you as a person I just hate what you're doing it is it reasonable to say that you that it's okay to hate what though what people in that situation are possessed by you know yeah I think so because well that that that seems to me to be the right level of analysis is that you can see it's sort of like the idea of a of a principality you know I can see these systems of ideas that are at War right there are systems of ideas at War and the system of idea ideas that's on the woke side is the metam Marxism of the postmodernists right everything's a victim victimizer narrative it's a it's an all devouring ideology that grants moral propriety to its upholders it's an unbelievably dangerous Enterprise but it is impersonal in some ways in that if you have a hundred radicals they all have the same idea and so it's not them it's the and you know and that means that the proper level for the battle is philosophical or theological or spiritual or ideational or psychological rather than than physical maybe it's only when you lose the battle that you have to re you have to resort to physical means you you also talked about the utility of humor but I had I ju Just quickly let me just L something in there I've been in court the last 10 days over a Lial trial and I watched everybody who was against me who tried to destroy my life that's what they' done and I and I thought I'd really like to go up for a beer with you guys because aside from this one little kind of crazy woke thing where you're completely right about everything and I'm a you're a total moral supremacist and I'm wrong and I need to educate myself aside from that one pervasive and albeit dead character flaw I'd really like to go out for a beer with you and I have a strong feeling that none of them would like to go out for a beer with me know I think I think that's a really good observation you know because when I was surrounded by screeching Harpy students and often female and then their idiot male enablers who were generally Psychopaths what I kept remembering was well you know you're 19 if I was at a dinner party at your parents house I would probably think that you are a pretty decent young person with some crazy ideas rather than that you're just an absolute bloody Serpentine mess of crazy ideas with a tiny bit of good person associated it's not like that at all and I I've thought about this too sort of technically speaking you know is that Jean P the developmental psychologist he noted that get a bunch of kids together and they could play a game coherently according to a coherent set of rules but if they were young enough if you separated them and asked them what the rules were you got wildly disperate accounts so together they could play the game because each of them had fragmentary knowledge of the game but as a unit all the knowledge was there it's sort of like a group of a hundred University protesters is that because there's a hundred of them the whole bloody pathological principality is there but in each person they're like 10% possessed right and so maybe what you do when you don't hate the person is that you have the possibility of separating the wheat from the chaff what you would hope for for your wouldbe ideological enemy is that free expression of idea in genuine dialogue would free them from the grip of their possession and then you'd have another useful person around which seems to be a lot better than well the potentially negative consequences of of full-on combat you know you mentioned I had a journalist friend of mine say something similar to to me this week by the way he said very wise man with much experience he said he believes that we're entering the most difficult phase of this conflict and you alluded to something similar why why why why did that idea make itself present to you and and why do you regard that as an accurate summation of what's happening I think it's difficult as an actor you're um you're trained a tiny part of your brain is trained it's such a small part of your brain it's to be present and to Remember at the same time so it's it's it's a tiny part of your brain in conflict and that creates a sense of I can see something's happening and actually it it came to me by realizing sitting in court when you put this ideology to reason to cold scrutiny to um proper and rigorous inquiry it has nowhere to go it has nowhere to run it it it can't survive a conversation none of it can survive a conversation and you notice that as you know these little Sparks that appear in society like anti-Semitism and um PE people feeling that they can identify totally as their own little crowd group in Britain you think that people are beginning to run out of patience and they're just signs and I think Peter B oan put it really really well he said this is coming to an end and everyone is going to say that they they they never played part and I have I I suppose in sort of round in rather stupid way I'm trying to say it I can tell it's coming to an end I can just see it coming to an end and and I know it's coming to an end because it doesn't make any sense and nature of B is a vacuum and we've had a vacuum now for a very very long time once your business gets to a certain size cracks start

player in this Arc Enterprise he's a very wise person and with Michael melis they're quite different people because Paso is a icon Carver and a and a deep Christian trained as well in the postmodern ethos so he understands both sides of the argument and Michael malis is kind of a Libertarian um um Anarchist but both of them have the they're both of them believe that we're not going to get through this bout of ideological conflict without some really serious trouble and my sense is more agnostic I believe that the future isn't Written in Blood and that if we conducted ourselves wisely we we could have a virtual apocalypse let's say instead of the real thing that we could work this out in the realm of ideas we could tilt ourselves back on the upward path without the kind of Mayhem that was that sometimes accompanies a transformation of Ideology Now there's some precedent for this obviously when the Soviet Union collapsed that was much less bloody than we had any right to to Hope or expect so by then I you know I'm really torn about this because I look at the universities and I think oh my God you guys are so far gone that nothing but your total collapse is going to bring about a transformation and when I start thinking that that's a rather pessimistic view something like what happened in Washington happens and you get the president of MIT in Harvard and you pay all three woefully underqualified for the job come out and say in Unison something so utterly blood curdling and Preposterous that it's surreal you think well it's a long ways yet to the bottom and so you think you you think it's going to come you think you you intimated that you believe that this is going to come to an end do you do you I just can't I don't have any vision of how things are going to lay themselves out over the next few years I can't predict it and so but you you said you have a sense I can see look I put up five YouTube videos last year that were all critical of the climate narrative and basically nothing happened to me as a consequence YouTube put up a few warnings you know that like they always do about how climate change is this ultimate catastrophe but they left them alone and almost all the comments were positive and certainly the climate catastrophe narrative has taken a vicious hit in the last year and people are pretty tired of the trans stupidity so but but then you see the depth of corruption in places like the universities and you think oh my God you know how much trouble is they going to have to be before sanity does does prevail I suppose what gives you a a sense that things are going to change I was quite affected by something that you said quite early on and weirdly um my dad who broke the car like he he slammed the brakes on in the car when I was about 8 years old and he went postmodernism is evil and I was like didn't understand but I could just remember it and he was obviously listening to the BBC or something and you said this thing quite early on and he was a dad actually introduced all of us to you to to varying degrees of love let's put it that way and um and um one of the things that I thought was this idea that you raised which was when this thing is overthrown what comes a sort of hitlerian figure comes doesn't he out of the viar which is you know Victor Davis hunson talks about how we're in this sort of leisured affluent viar period and and from that comes a hitlerian figure and one of the greatest things I think about Britain and um John Anderson said this to me as well when he when he spoke he said when things get really really bad people are going to look at Britain they're going to look to Britain and they're going to look at your legal system and we're going to look at the way that you've been going around you know you've reformed you've unreformed you've you you've reversed revolutions you've done all this stuff and I think that there is within the English patience the the fundamental English patience there's a real stoic solidness to it and I think that that's what will ultimately end this period that we cannot have um people are now openly laughing at the way universities is are talked about in UK okay anyone who is vaguely awake is turning around and saying you know don't send your kids to universities um I'm we do what we do VI the bad law project to to challenge the government over certainly stuff that they're teaching in schools and I think I think a sort of bloodless coup is possible but but part of me is like is this is going to end violently but it might end violently it might end violently in a sort of in a good way for one to a better word which is that they go they get so upset and so angry and so annoyed that no one is listening to them and that British people still want to protect their culture and not have it diluted and stuff like that that there's a big Riot we've already seen what's going on in London over the last three weeks and Britain just galvanizes itself we're very tough like that and and and that gives me some hope admittedly it's fleeting often but it does give me some it gives me hope that it can be how quick was McCarthyism um they just said go didn't they it was just like goodbye out you know and I think that that something similar might happen well it might it might depend you know it might depend on how effectively it will depend I think on how effectively people conduct themselves and you know I think that for for people like you and I whatever we can do to strive to keep enmity out of our hearts is going to all be to the good you know like I am very unimpressed with the leader of Canada I would have a very difficult sh time shaking his hand I really detest him and you know possibly the right attitude would be to wish the better part of him well and to hope that he could escape from his narcissistic entrapment you know but that's prob well you know stranger things have happened it is possible for people to undergo quite dramatic transformations of character I mean that happens to Paul to Saul on the way to Damascus right I mean you could have a you can have a transformative moment and I suppose if you had any sense that's what you'd wish for for everyone that they could see the light properly um I think that if people on the alternative Vision side while we we're seeing this with Ark you know like that we put a bunch of videos up on YouTube that came from the ark conference and the more political they are the less popular they are the more Visionary the more metaphysical and the more humorous they are the better they're performing right and then the comments are also extremely positive on the apolitical Visionary talks and very negative on the political talks and so I think that is a reflection too of the fact that you know if we're going to those of us who are interested in standing against the use of arbitrary Force should be very careful about not even secretly being pleased when unnecessary force is used well again and that's another thing that makes the the camera issue so bloody complicated I mean I I still think your arguments about opposing their distribution is I think your arguments are correct and I think that that form of civil disobedience is not only appropriate but morally called for you also mentioned you know that one of your Hallmarks for distinguishing between useful and and dangerous civil disobedience is the humor that goes along with it and I you know that I think that's a really good marker too the best the most popular speech that that emerged out of the art conference was Constantine Ken's speech you know and Constantine is damn good at interleaving the serious with the light-hearted and self-deprecating and absurd so there is something about that allowance for the Absurd that does seem to be a touchstone for honest communication you see that too you know so many of the Great YouTubers are comedians or EXC comedians right and I that's not fluke they're they're good at listening to the audience and they don't take themselves too seriously you know and and those are profound markers of the sort of character that you might be able to trust let me ask youor oh go ahead go ahead I was just saying perhaps we're witnessing um one of the other things that we're witnessing which is either new or not new my knowledge of history is not obviously the greatest is this idea of the political influencer via social media the the the absence of a political leader you know we've got the the labor party and the conservative party in the UK the conservative party took in 30 million in donations in the last quarter of 2022 or whenever it was Labor took in 3 million the Insurgent party reform which is currently polling they say at 10% took in £20,000 so it seems to me that there is zero appetite for a change politically but there is a huge appetite for a change culturally or or or or a realignment culturally so that people people always say to me you know you you you get it times a million but when I'm stopped on the street people say to me thank you for trying to protect our culture thank you and that comes from weird not weirdly just normally but it's overwhelmingly people who are new arrivals to this country who came to this country to succeed who want to play on a fair playing field they don't want they they wanted to leave the oppressions and the oppression hierarchies of the places that they lived in before behind and they wanted to fight on a play fa uh Fair playing field and so I wonder whether we we're also going to see the rise in the political influencer you know the rock might run for or taka Carlson might become you know Trump's VP doubtable as it is but whether the entire social media landscape and all of and all of the New Media has you know you you've got with the daily wire you know if Ben Shapiro decided to run for office who knows what would happen it's it's a sort of strange development anyway that was my sort of a side to your point let me ask you something more personal here for a bit um I I what what exactly is happening with you as a consequence of the legal entanglements that have enveloped you like what are you in danger of I mean I know the process is the punishment and everyone the the police who came to round you up um are part and parcel of that what what were the police like what are the police like like the thing that's so striking to me about the police in the UK and and in North America is that it isn't obvious to me that their natural allies are the you know woke utopians and so how did the police who came tell us the story about the police coming to your house how did they treat you and what what what's your family what are you and your family going through at the moment okay so the so the the police I have to confess to being a pathetic actor and actors always want to please Their audience so when the police turned up I tried to make friends with them and I C I could make friends with everyone except for one for the arresting officer who'd got his big day and that was hard uh but even by the end of the day I think I'd won him around and look I took I said to them can I take a book with me because I'm going to be in the cells and they were nice enough to let me take a book so I finished off the gulag archipelago was quite a useful time in the sales and you're thinking well I don't know that bad um in terms of in terms of the police I think they you know I think that I again I want to apply this uh and I must apply this because otherwise I would go insane that what people are doing is not necessarily who they are so I think that you know there was a sort of they were quite charged when they came in and they really wanted to get involved but by the end of the day I think I won them over and they were actually sympathetic even though they did nothing about it when I said please can I have my children's phones and iPads back because what have they got to do with this and there was a really touchy moment and it was was horrible actually because I'm stood in a police uh station next to a kid 19-year-old kid or younger with like forensic sleeves on his arms so those white forensic stev he's covered in blood this kid and I'm stood next to him and he's obviously just killed somebody and I'm and I'm thinking wow we we are the we're being treated with the same level of seriousness by the law so that gave me pause for Thought uh in terms of my family I have a my uh my dad is as I think I've sort of alluded to in this conversation with you he he was on this stuff in the like 1985 I think I was on that car Journey when he was going so he's sympathetic he doesn't necessarily approve of my tactics um my one brother up is a is a beautiful and wonderful Stern brother but he's really there for you when you when you need him but he again it's like not necessarily approving of my tactics my sister and I uh we disagree about everything our politics are completely different and we get on like a house on fire so it's like how do you know about these things and then the people that I really feel sorry for are my children because um you know a really well-known actor went up to my son at school cuz my little son goes to this the I mean the most Dreadful school that Britain has to offer by miles it's just Dreadful full of celebrity Rich celebrities very woke celebrities they teach it's all transgenderism the whole thing is transgenderism and this actor took it upon himself to go up to my son and tell him that his dad was a fascist and that's oh yeah that's that's that's that's Pleasant how old is your son he was 11 at that oh yeah lovely lovely yeah yeah that's great well I guess that guy picked on someone his own size yeah so I so that is difficult but my kids you know the the whole point of doing anything you ever do is for you and for your kids you know and you and you know part of the I think part of the process of meaning full stop is to remedy some of the things that you know it's to try and refine the the mechanism of the family and all those sorts of things as you learn from your father and your mother the mistakes they made and you go well I'll try not to make that mistake so your your life is constantly driven by meaning you're always trying to find meaning in it so therefore with W with my kids they understand me and they get me and they and they know who I am and I and I'm flattered and honored to be their parents and that's that that's how it is I mean is it is it difficult yes it's difficult but is it difficult to be sat in a situation in life where you had no choice no say and your life was ended like that so I I you can't I like these old truisms these I I like these old the the these things that someone's got it worse than you I like those things I like sticks and stones may break my bones I like that I like all of these things because it reminds you that you are you are entrenched in a reality of your own making which isn't as bad as it could be so be tough and be strong and and love your and love as much you can and and how about your wife how how has she managed to managed with all the disruptions in your career and and you putting yourself and and your family well in one way on the line I mean It's Tricky right because you're always putting your family on the line in one way or another like there's no escape from that in life you know and so really what you do is you decide how you're going to lay things on the line but often what people will do is take it illusory short-term Security in preference to actually addressing the issue at hand and I mean you've you've suffered a a dreadful amount of disruption especially on the career front as a consequence of your political stances and how what's that done to your marriage well my marriage ended in 2016 and she is a very interesting character who is using the um we really need to have a look at the family courts in the UK we're still arguing in Family Court weirdly whichever political case I have seems to work its way into a family court case at the at the same time which is different but my partner what my partner is is uh is still water you know she just what when I um when I go I C this is mad it's too much she just goes it's okay it's okay you'll be all right do you want to talk about it and it we she she's still water and I'm fire and that works for me oh yeah uh because I as you said you know you've got a temper I've got a real temper like yesterday when I was with my kids and I was saying we got to go and see Grand and everyone and they're like the car's going to come in 4 minutes and they're like I'm ready and it's like then the car arrives and no one's ready and you're just like kids come on go so um my partner is she's the she's the ice and the cooling to to the fire that I can be sometimes right well that's that's that's handy that's handy to have someone who can let you take a sober second thought yeah so what are your plans what are your plans what are you doing now and what are your plans for the future so how are you keeping Body and Soul together even well it's really annoying I had a neck operation so I I used to keep my body and soul together by exercising but I had a neck operation and that's stopped me from being able to exercise so I need to work out a system of doing that what I'm doing is I'm taking the government to court for uh non- contct child abuse of children in school via their um transgender policies in the UK schooling in schools because it's disgusting what they're teaching our children and we've got a we've put together a big case and we're going to take the Department of Education to court I'm fighting the um who's we who's we that so I started I started not once I realize that politics is fine but it's not what people care about people are going to vote red they're going to vote blue they're going to vote red they're going to vote blue they're going to swap one time or another I we thought okay what are the other things that we can do to change stuff so we started up something called the bad law project which is my team which is a small team it's about six eight people and I have um two I have a barrister and a sister within that team and we are going to take the dep Department of Education to court to stop them teaching our kids this stuff because once we stop them teaching the kids this stuff then what comes out of university is not going to be such a problem um we're fighting our we have an MP in Andrew bridin uh in Northwest esia who was kicked out of the conservative party uh for criticizing the covid vaccine roll out and saying that it did cause some problems and then we do bits of Media stuff as well you know just just to sort of you know offer up some thoughts about life so we try and look at it as a stool whereby we have legal political and um media and I'll do that until I can't take it anymore but at the moment I'm sat totally desperate because I've walked out of my Lial case two weeks ago and I'll get a judgment before Christmas and it and it will be very very important judgment for the UK because the judge is being asked to define the meaning of the word racist which is what I always wanted I wanted someone to define this word as certainly in law because we got two versions of it even in the in the UK law we have the equal treatment bench book which defines the racist as pretty much everybody who has a bad thought about anybody it's it's a it's and this is judges guidance and then you've got the Oxford English Dictionary before it's turned into the maram Webster dictionary which says racism is prejudice against someone based on the color of their skin or their ethnicity so I really want to work out I I've been called the racist so I took someone to court they took me to court I took them to court I'm waiting to hear on a judgment on that and I think that would that that will be very I think that will really matter to to the people of Britain can can you provide some more details about the nature of the case and what it is that you're hoping to accomplish and what you have at stake yeah so um in 2020 uh the big supermarket in the UK called sabes tweeted um that that they were going to provide in the light of George Floyd's death they were going to provide safe spaces for their black employees in their supermarket to which I responded that's protos segregationism are they not safe are they not safe in your Supermarket uh so then I was branded a racist by uh three people one of them was uh was in Show Business was you know one of my colleagues in Show Business and she said anyone who hires Lawrence Fox does so in the knowledge he's unequivocally unapologetically and publicly racist so I mean that was that was a that was a pretty that was a death nail to my acting career so I just swapped the word I SW I swapped the Tweet round and I said anyone who hires Nicola Thorp which is her name does so in the knowledge she's unequivocally unapologetically and publicly a pedophile and she then tweeted she she then sued me for defamation and I countersuit her for racism which is what I wanted to do so we just finished the court case in the last we finished it a week ago on last Thursday and we're expecting a judgment in the next short period And it and it's it's going to be interesting because it'll mean for for the person that like you say they always come for the the smaller person they don't come for the guy with a big profile he's not going to arrest you at he throw for criticizing his climate scan cameras is he he's going to arrest somebody else who's done it so that I'm trying to fight for the fact that you're not going to lose your job for criticizing diversity equity and inclusion and you're not going to criticize you're not you're not going to lose your job for for criticizing so-called anti-racism and you're not going to lose your lose your job for complaining about the dilution of your culture none of which is racist it's just like a family it's protecting your your thing so we'll see I think it'll be quite quite a quite a and is it done is it is it done except for the Jud how how do you how do you feel about how do you feel about your case are you optimistic pessimistic can you say I I I all I can say is that I it's very very hard to lie in court and and when I I didn't have to lie when I was in court I didn't have to tell a single lie but some of the examples were of the advantages of telling the truth is that when push comes to shove it makes your life a hell of a lot simpler well you're right but you know your it's your it's your Mantra which is a really good um it's a really good you know I say it to my kids I think people do and I think you you've offered this to people which is like you know honesty is the honesty is the best policy it's another one of these truisms that that people just forgot and replaced with no Martin Luther King is so yesterday it's like no no these things really matter to people so um I I sat and had my character dismantled by a an activist Barrister and I gave as good as I got you're feeling I didn't lie so you're feeling morally confident in your in your stance and and when when do you find out well I think the Judgment may come down this Friday and if it comes down this Friday then it's good news for for for British people who you know don't want to be called racist just because they disagree with somebody about any issue at all now you can be called a racist for disagreeing about climate change but you know we the other thing about England and we were talking about it earlier is this sort of stoic sense of patience that the Brits have in the UK if you call someone a racist that's your job finished forever that's it it's gone it means so much and yet to the people that throw the allegation around it means nothing so you know we have a problem there and I my emnity was I when I said that I would like to go for a beer with uh those guys one of the people I didn't want to go for a beer with because they were so possessed with why are you asking me questions you're a white supremacist it's like hang on a minute a middle class woman in a dock is accusing a middleclass man of being a racist there's no black people or brown people anywhere near this court case it's just white people walking around calling each other racist so I my job my goal uh if it's will is to preserve the one thing that a man owns and and my father taught me and my children will Le from me which is you have your good name and that's it that's it you got nothing else yeah well a huge a huge part of this culture war is the battle between true and false writes to a good name you know an immense part of what's driving the allyship on the part of the radicals is the desire to enhance their reputation without having to do any of the productive work necessary to have a reputation and to substitute any and all other qualifications for genuine qualification the president of Harvard has 11 Publications to her name okay so she was a tenur professor in the Ivy Leagues first at Stanford if I remember correctly then a Dean at Harvard and then the president of Harvard she isn't qualified enough to get a junior position at a midlevel State University in Canada or the US right so in order for her to justify even the fact of her academic existence she has to invent an entire entirely different structure of value to position herself as a contender for for the occupations that were granted to her it's an absolute bloody travesty but so how do we put up with that so when yours this I have a huge issue with this as well because the man who taught me English so my first interaction with the English language was from a man called Jeremy lemon and he took uh he taught my father English he was that old he had been teaching at school that and he taught me how to understand the English language and he taught it to me at a time when I was able to receive it 13 really like able to and it it gave me millions of pounds for my career I it earned me Millions because I understood the language and how it works and and and what it was and now I look at these I look at some of the stuff my kids come home with and I look at some of the stuff and I just go you're not learning anything like you're not learning anything you're being told a lot of stuff but you're not learning anything yeah well you know our while my plan for that is my daughter and I are launching a new University Enterprise probably in February we've got excellent professors delivering what I think will be the best quality lectures available both technically and and conceptually I think you know this is this is an optimistic way of looking at it you know as the utopian globalist types the idealogues abandon everything of value beauty truth justice genuine marit it they leave it all on the table and what that should mean is that other people can just come along and scoop it up and make use of it and I mean again that seems to be a more appropriate response than railing Against The Establishment it's like well if they're doing such a bad job maybe we can do a better job and invite people along we had a really quite a spectacular success with this Ark conference I here's something cool so we released the videos from the art conference and within 3 weeks we had four times as many views of our material as the wef had of what they released on YouTube over the last year good so I think that you know and this this speaks back to the conversation partial conversation we had earlier about whether or not we could risk being optimistic is that as those who oppose our culture abandon what's useful about it that does free up the opportunity for other people to make use of it and maybe there's infinite opportunity there I mean certainly that's look at what's happened on on the social media side I mean as the Legacy corporate media Enterprises have become almost universally corrupt there's been a massive opportunity for people like Joe Rogan who really do nothing but sit down and have an honest conversation and so you know that's a pretty good deal so all right well look I want to wish you good luck in your lawsuits and your your Pursuits especially against the the people in the education departments I mean I I can't see any Enterprise in the west that's become more corrupt than the education Enterprise per se right K through 12 University the whole bloody thing looks like it's done as far as I can tell and maybe something spectacularly better will emerge as an alternative it it certainly could be the case be very I'll be watching the progress of your court cases with real interest and um maybe I don't know exactly know when this will release it'll probably be after your uh the results of your liel case are are made public and so we'll update everybody on that um thank you very much for agreeing to talk to me today I'm just going to let everybody know too I'm going to spend an extra half an hour as I always do talking to Lawrence on the dw+ platform after this um and I'm going to walk walked through the details of his life which we didn't get to on this side of the conversation so if all of you who are watching and listening want to join us over there you're more than welcome to and uh other than that is there anything else you'd like to bring to the attention of people who are watching and listening before we close off this segment um just to just to speak if you don't speak no one's going to hear you just speak yeah if you have something to say and it's it it's grinding away at you probably time to say it even if you don't do it perfectly right right yeah all right Mr Fox pleasure talking to you and getting to know you a little bit
