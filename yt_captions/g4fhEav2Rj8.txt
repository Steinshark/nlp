welcome to yet another awfully lits youtuber unboxing in a hotel room this time of the 1 plus 60 McLaren Edition and massive thanks to ashram c4 e-tec who kind of made this entire video possible so as you can probably tell this is a massive departure from previous one Plus boxes how the window is the white and red theme they've had for years now and in is black and orange which is as striking as it is unusual one of the first things you'll see is the device itself and I've got to say there's a fair bit to take in here so we're gonna come straight back to this but first of all let's see what else is in the box there's a focus on carbon fiber with this device so you get a carbon fiber style case still plastic but nonetheless pretty well built then we've got the charger and this is something pretty special a first for oneplus and speaking of firsts this is probably the first orange - charge cable you've seen and I gotta say it looks pretty great although that could just be me dying for some variety of course we also have the headphone jack adapter because the headphone jack is no more on the 60 and this weird little trophy which is made of some sort of acrylic and contains the actual carbon fiber and McLaren use in their cars I'm always going on about how I feel oneplus should change up their packaging a bit and this phone feels like the answer to that there is orange everywhere the theme is very consistent throughout this experience okay considering this is just a relabeled 60 just a limited edition version of the standard phone there is more new here than I expected even the lockscreen has been built from scratch and in fact when you start the phone up for the first time it invites you to go through an augmented reality experience you flick through the pages of the book that came in the box and view it on the smartphone itself and it brings them to life it's really random but at the same time endearing touch also as this is a limited edition phone we can expect limited edition wallpapers and there are a whole bunch of them pre-installed on the device and I can't quite see the link to McLaren but at the same time they look good and they're also power saving on this AMOLED display so I'm not complaining and they fit quite nicely with the new theme on the device this black and orange that we've seen consistently throughout the packaging has carried forward through the software which i think is quite impressive the settings menu flicking to the left hand side screen even pulling down at your notification bar you see the same theme what really impressed me though is how this consistency is carried forward into the external aspects of the phone - this is still the oneplus 60 from the outside it's still got that glass back it still doesn't have wireless charging but it definitely looks better it's kind of like a mirror black finish with a really subtle carbon fiber layer underneath and as you follow the phone down it leads into an orange highlight at the bottom it doesn't scream for attention but at the same time I quite appreciate that I think it looks really good I would have quite liked to see a bit of a gradient finish going on but at the same time it is something different so credit for that right so I mentioned this phone comes with a special kind of charger they call this warped charge and for the first time ever on a one plus phone this offers 30 watt charging this is quite a big deal this turns those claims of a days power in half an hour - more like a days power in just over 20 minutes it's well above the industry average but at the same time if you are coming from a phone like the mate 20 Pro you would be a little disappointed because that phone has 40 watts so the camera and just generally most other aspects of a phone and the software haven't really changed from the 60 but there is one more quite significant hardware change which I think will get a lot of people excited the McLaren edition of the 60 comes at 10 gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes of storage as standard so when you combine that with the snapdragon 845 this is kind of finishing 2018 with a bit of a bang it's not a next-generation device like a lot of people were hoping for and so if you're on anything like the 1 + 6 you do not need to think about upgrading to this but at the same time if you're someone who would be introduced to oneplus with this phone it's pretty good place to start alright guys thank you so much for watching I pulled yet another all-nighter to get this video out on time and massive thanks to ash from C for e tech god leave his channel in the description below my name is Erin this is mr he's the boss and I'll catch you in the next [Music]
