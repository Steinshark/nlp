ladies and gentlemen welcome back to how to win a chess this is a series where I take on my subscribers in 10-minute rapid games I go up the rating ladder walking you through every single phase of the game I try to mirror the level of my opponent to potentially set them up for good moves uh but I do ultimately try to win every single game in an instructive manner uh this is one of my more laid-back series and this is episode 27 in this episode we're going to be playing Five subscribers starting at the 900 uh rapid ELO uh and going up to 2,000 uh and as always this series is sponsored uh by nobody uh but the namesake of how to win a chess is actually my book so if you uh are a beginner uh you know anything below the level of 1,200 Rapid or you have a relative or a friend you'd like to uh get the book that's uh that's the name of the series it's on the book uh and if I play any of my openings then uh I will shout out one of my courses and they are available on Chesley which is my uh my chess educational platform so I am the sponsor of my own content if you would like to take your chess learning to the next level other than that we uh in the words of Ernie Johnson on TNT inside the NBA unsullied by sponsorships since 1989 I think that's what they say anyway this is game number one uh I'm playing perco uh you know we we're we're starting out early uh and I and I feel like to you know we'll we'll ease into it I'll play D4 for my first White game like to mix it up so sometimes I play three games with black two games with white uh today I'm going to be playing three games with white and uh I I would I mean I really want to play a London but I feel like I will be London myself but uh the Queen's Gambit is always is is always a fun one as well let's just begin with the London let's let's show let's show how to play this opening at the 900 1,000 level level it's a very common opening nobody has an antidote to it uh you could play a little bit more aggressive and tricky London with night C3 Knight B5 but uh I'm just going to play a normal London um you know and and and night out to F3 versus not night out to F3 is kind of a very small detail that's not that important this is already a slight misstep my opponent really should be dealing with the London by playing D and C pawns out together uh there's not this isn't a horrendous move but it blocks the C pawn and from C6 the Knight actually doesn't really put a substantial amount of pressure on the center what I like to do when my opponents do this is I actually like to turn the game back into a Queen's Gambit so we play to London but seeing as though this is how our opponent reacts it's like any it's like tennis or or boxing like if you see your opponent reacts to something that you're doing you can then proceed to uh to um to to play in a slightly different way and and and go about things in a slightly different way now a lot of people here would react to this pin they this is you know generally a decent move if you are pinned just sort of ask the question sometimes taking is actually bad for us but I would refrain giving up a bishop this easily uh for for not a particularly strong reason uh and so now my opponent did the right thing I mean they got out their light sored Bishop they put a bunch of Pawns light squares we have the option to continue to try to play like a Queen's Gambit uh we can get our Bishop out and we can castle since this was sort of what I'm what I was going for originally uh I'm going to do it anyway it's not the best move and it's not the best move because actually we we do have a little bit of open air here now that we brought our Queen over there okay my opponent plays Bishop you know there instead of Knight here a lot of questions to ask yourself here right the opponent plays Bishop D6 like do we take G generally no that's just sort of something you learn as you get better at chess generally no you you really don't want to take that Bishop it only helps black develop you really shouldn't make trades that only help your opponent develop like how our opponent took us uh you know you you want to be careful and make sure you're well protected here I think we are uh and uh we could take there's nothing you know wrong with taking the pawn to reopen the bishop but just good rule of thumb like if you don't have to take and you don't see an immediate reason why you should you don't you don't have to like you could just make an improving move and I mean this is generally going to be an improving move uh if black captures we will take with the bishop which helps us get out I've already talked about this a lot you you kind of want to avoid taking an opponent's piece if a new piece will emerge in its place and you don't have one right like again like I I I don't really want to allow the queen out unless I have a followup and I don't I just cuz I can attack the queen doesn't mean that's going to be a a good decision for me so uh I have Bishop D3 I have a handful of options here uh and uh Bishop D3 actually does run into this move Knight to B4 which is annoying uh and uh I kind of want to play it just to be instructive and and and and see if my opponent finds it I also don't really want to handicap myself because this is not a good move because of this incoming Knight to B4 uh some of you may be wondering why won't we take this Pawn after Pawn takes Pawn takes that's fine but if we take with the Knight and then they take with the Knight and then we take and stop there we lose the game because we have to think and it's a common tactic chess is all about pattern recognition there's going to be a queen on that square there's going to be a queen on that square and our opponent can just play Bishop to B4 check and win our Queen and that's hard to see if you're s sitting at home going what are you talking about yeah that's tough uh Pawn takes Pawn takes our Knight goes there so this diagonal actually opens we're a lot better off actually just developing a piece let's say to E2 and then castling like getting the king to safety here will actually serve us uh a great a great deal another useful move is actually Pawn to A3 which generally the these kind of A3 H3 moves are sort of useless in this case it was useful it wasn't necessary I probably should have just developed a piece as we are sort of realizing now I'm a little bit behind in development this is actually a decent move because this is annoying not that but this oh my goodness I am I I can I draw that Arrow okay this is insane can I draw that Arrow there we go see Knight to B4 exactly my opponent does this that's not a good move though it would have been better if my Bishop was on that square this is a very easy move to Perry number one I can just move my Rook number two I can just Castle both are probably fine uh castling allows the Knight to come here but it's not particularly dangerous but this would have been a lot more powerful what if my Bishop was on that square because it would have threatened my Bishop my pawn and still continue to threaten that fork if my Bishop moved that was a bit Advanced uh and I think an average 900 in this position if I in this position if I gave them this position might play Bishop here or might blunder and and ultimately you know get hit with that tactic um I'm not going to lose a queen to these you know to to to to these subscribers no no uh no way uh C6 is solid uh and and now now we can ask the question to this Knight I'm still not taking the bishop we're doing something here called keeping the tension I do have to speed up though like if this was a real game I'm doing a very poor job managing my time being down 2 minutes is not good uh and and I can teach you a little bit about speeding up uh in general the best way to speed up is to play uncomplicated moves that just improve something a lot of people speed up by just capture capture capture and that's not that that sort of breaks the principle of of everything that we've discussed already a basic improving move might be to move the pawn two squares to gain more space or to bring a rook biggest question in chess is where do you put the Rooks you put the Rooks where you anticipate the position opening without blocking in the other Rook so if I anticipate the position opening on the C file I would put a rook on that square but I wouldn't put that Rook on that square because that would Block in The Rook right so I would probably put my Rooks on D1 and and C1 like that uh or you know maybe E1 maybe maybe but now I don't know what my opponent is thinking about they have to go here this is a very poor investment of time for black uh this is absolutely just there is that's a one move calculation you just yeah and so now again if I want to play a move quickly here I might just take some space I don't know know if it's the best move but I'm taking a little bit of queenside space every time we advance a pawn we got to think about what got weaker this stuff got weaker my knight is now not protected is that a big deal we'll find out the other question is where's my Pawn going am I trying to play C5 and B5 am I just trying to play B5 and one go the truth is at 900 it might be tough to discern all those differences but as long as you're not making a blunder the longer you don't make a blunder as a 940 the higher your winning probability so to be honest at 940 both of those moves are good but at a certain point you got to play where you're a little stronger right now black is not a little stronger anywhere uh black center is sort of like equal Equity but black can't really do a lot of advancing and in general in chess if you can't really make forward moves it's a bad sign I can make a lot of forward moves I I can move my my my my Bishop uh I can go here here I can take I can probably push my Pawn I can play Bishop D3 three I have a lot of forward moves so again I can take the bishop but let's just let's just Advance this Pawn finally big question of whether black will take or not yeah and and black is you know in this level where you you do sort of want to take I think sort of want to take meaning that's just what 900s do it's not necessarily good or bad it's just life um I took what the queen just not to break my structure but Pawn takes is totally fine it weakens this a lot but it complet locks down E5 whereas Queen TS doesn't really lock down E5 that move unfortunately is a big blunder and like I said at the 900 level if you Outlast your opponent in blundering uh you will win and um it was very important for my opponent to snipe my Bishop so anytime there's a bishop on the other side look at where it is looking and uh when I played C5 this opened up and I might have even taken the Knight to damage the structure but I'm definitely going to be taking taking the night when it's a free night and uh this is you know that's a big deal a free night you know and this is life this is life at 900 I mean my opponent played very very well I sort of kept the tension the right way just applied a little bit of pressure and again again the caveat throughout this series is like people are playing me they know it's going to be a video like people are a little bit more nervous a little bit more elevated heart rate um when a bishop Ventures out like this you do have to be a little bit careful of the bishop not getting tra uh right now I feel like a lot of people might you know might might start marching forward you know you know what's you know for me I I might just go back like if it doesn't blunder anything just get out just so just just get out you know you could it's not the best move but like let's just get out of there and what we're going to do now is we're going to try to we're going to try to methodically chip away with pawns we can trade the Queens as well but then our Pawn goes in to die so there's not a benefit to rushing into trading the Queens but like I said the side with uh the side without forward Mobility is is is likely going to be in bad shape so I see this right away I'm just thinking let me just trade that pawn right if Pawn takes the Rook opens up but I'm going to take with the Rook I'm not going to take with the Knight and you know I could I play E4 get these pieces off the board probably but again I'm thinking if if this comes here the queen opens up so I'm always looking looking at how do my decisions impact the other side as well chess is a constant game of drawing arrows for my opponent's pieces so much of it is drawing arrows for what my opponent sees I see my pieces I know they want to go here they want to give a mate like what does my opponent want and how do I make sure they get nothing and right now Black's getting nothing they're down a bishop and they they don't have a lot to show for it and that's that's the most important part here so that's kind of how it goes um so yeah yep that's sort of Life take a pause there take a my coffee right we're going to take down that opens up our Rook uh black really I mean a lot of the position is difficult here but black does have to be a little careful not to allow me to have a pass Pawn if black plays Rook C8 which is a very natural move I might need to kind of show the two techniques uh for winning a chess game there's two techniques one is to go to an endgame right try to trade Queens try to trade pieces uh the other is to go for mate and as you get better you're going to get to a stage where you you mentally you're like if I got a few moves in a row how would I conduct an attack from the from the position that I have so I'm thinking here I'm thinking get my queen over not there get my queen over here G4 G5 and maybe E4 a little bit later probably the best move was to double my Rooks my Rook doesn't really have a place anywhere else so doubling would have been smart if the question is where are you going after you double I don't have an answer uh in reality a move like E4 probably opening up the position dealing with the consequences of that Queen would be the best I wouldn't even be shocked if trading the Queens was was was all that bad uh but uh okay that move does stop what I want but now now now I'll go back to this plan we we can't forget this this was another idea like let's let's try to open the position a little bit let's try to hop in there with our KN also we are up a lot on time now again there's the caveat of you're playing me you might be a bit more nervous blah blah blah but uh yeah this is this is the way we would we would convert this you know what let's trade let's go back to the other game plan let's trade another secret to winning a game like this you probably can sack a piece for a couple pawns but you need to make sure you have enough pawns that uh that you're going to guaranteed win the game for now I see an open file so I'm just going to improve my Rook right now the Knight can take a step back to then take a couple steps forward but what I would avoid doing is putting the knight in front of the Rook because then you can get pinned like Rook E8 here is an auto and then I'll show you how to get out of that but you know I can't move my knight forward I can if I sack my Bishop okay be careful don't lose the Rook I'll put the Rook all the way on the back rank because again I'd like to trade pieces so the less pieces my opponent has the easier my life will be uh and then you just have to win the end game this is not exactly you see you see I'm I'm I'm under some pressure uh I'm going to now show you the technique to get out of this which is King F1 but now if my opponent doubles again I'm I I could get a little bit stuck which is why you want to avoid doing stuff like this yeah there you go uh so now since the bishop is defending the Knight I can move the Rook but that's lucky because that's not always the case so I'm going to go here and offer a rook trade and uh that that's kind of an example of why you got to be careful tying your pieces together so even in a totally winning position the game is not over uh and I you know I I appreciate my opponent uh playing those moves and if I didn't have a bishop I would be in a lot of trouble now of course I'm going to trade that was uh that that was that was always you know that was never in doubt and and now I'm going to Target the pawn it's better to Target the pawn because it can't move and now we're back here and this this is bad this is bad news uh this means that we will likely you know we're likely going to accomplish something pretty soon um my night is still a little bit stuck I mean I'm going to play this move just sort of out of inertia but I actually can't get in like the best move is unquestionably sacrificing a bishop to try to you know get a get a a pawn back and get in but I'm 900 I mean right if I'm playing like a 900 I'm going to try to use my pawns I'm going to try to use but we got to find a way to zigzag in with our Knight and right now we don't have a way right we just don't have a way so a lot of 900s here would get desperate they start pushing their pawns they that's what they would try to do um and okay that makes my life a lot easier right so if if if you're just going to leave me in an end game of Bishop Knight versus knight I'm going to win right so here we can snap take and the way you win this end game is you have to get your king involved you got to make sure the Knight doesn't get in and eat the pawns so that unfortunately is a blunder and once my knight is going to get in it's also going to be able to reroute and then I will be totally winning 94 is a clever idea uh to disconnect so even even if I blunder my knight my opponent resigns but I was going to say if if if something like Knight E4 was played I I can just take you know black is going to get this but you can play King E5 King D6 but even if you have an imbalance of two pawns versus one you can just offer a pawn trade and yeah Black's just not in the square and even if black is in the Square you can walk your king and even if you don't do that like you play C7 you're still winning because you have so many pawns so you can play King C5 or uh so yeah I mean in this game we we had a very solid opening it was very equal but this idea night B4 was slightly incorrect I mean the computer says it's fine but the computer also says you want to go back so like after this white got a bit of an advantage and I kind of took some space but after C5 and and all of this B6 of course being a big mistake black is just worse here black is a little bit passive and I would recommend to avoid things like this in the future for uh for my opponent to play a move like C5 just a little bit faster it's it's it's just a little bit better to play C5 instead of putting a KN on C6 but overall I mean again if you want an opening to attack the London uh you you you have to learn something you have to learn something on YouTube or something in a course that actually attacks the London and puts it under Fire um you want to avoid things like Knight B4 you probably want to focus more on E5 so you can try to play like you know for a quick E5 push like this if you're gonna play Knight C6 focus on E5 that's what I would say for my opponent and okay obviously the blunder is the blunder that's uh that's life and that's sort of how it goes sometimes um second game I'm playing a subscriber from turkey or I don't know maybe just the person that has a Turkish flag this person is rated 1209 so we're moving up about 300 points uh this person plays D4 I wonder if I'm going to get London uh let's let's test out a Dutch defense uh I really do like m a a Dutch we'll see if my opponent is a Queen's Gambit okay they are a Queen's Gambit player they'll play Knight F6 most common line here is is for white to put two knights out into the center which plays directly into the Dutch hands I have an opening uh course called the Gotham Dutch and the free sample chapter is this so you don't have to actually pay for the course you can just go and get this whole sample chapter for free I love this this in my opinion is one of the most fun dutches to play this is one of the lines uh what I like to do here again I just like to ask this question if they go here they lose the bishop so yes many people take technically technically the best move is to take the Knight because it's check and you damage the pawns but you'll probably you know you'll do that on the next move um but some people here will play like Queen B3 and there's a very funny line here where you can trap a queen um and uh that's not it that's if they play Queen B3 again technically best line is to capture right now uh but what I like to do is I like to wait I like to wait for my opponents to waste time cuz I was going to take anyway so I'd rather make progress until one of my opponents plays a move like A3 technically white can play Rook C1 and now they would not be damaging their structure so you're it's a you know you're kind of playing a little game with your opponent since you have these this is why you watch the series now we take cuz we were going to do that anyway so now white lost a little bit of time and since you have all these light squared pawns you're going to put the bishop on this diagonal and to me this opening is one of the easiest openings to play by far for black because white gets this cluster and this cluster is very solid but it is so hard to understand how to move it white struggles to move the E Pawn the D Pawn weakens this C5 just looks insane because you damage your structure A4 we just play A5 that plan is sort of gone all right so yeah um yeah that's um this is sort of how it goes now okay White's going to Castle and now now's the big moment uh in the Gotham Dutch we sort of get our structure um it's usually D6 Knight D7 that's sort of how I like to finish my development I find I find that I don't like to put the Knight on C6 to block my Bishop another way to play this is to play uh Bishop A6 to Target that pawn and play Knight C6 Knight A5 but to do that to put the Knight and Bishop like that you need to have a Pawn on C5 first queen D3 is an interesting move but um I don't get it actually because you can't play E4 and also I can put the bishop on e4 now and sort of push you out so I am curious what the idea was behind this move but sadly I cannot talk to the subscribers like I said Gotham Dutch you get 12 moves easily on the board and then you kind of have to understand the plans of your opening after just like in the London and in any any opening right 92 very sophisticated wow this is uh that's very sophisticated so my opponent wants to trade with me I think but they don't want to damage their structure now what's in or or they don't want to block their Queen what's interesting is that they actually blundered a pawn they actually blundered a pawn uh the drawback is that I would open up the G file to my king but this is an destructive moment in chess in chess you have to evaluate positions with specific moves or ideas what I mean by that is you cannot just go rather let me let me take a step back you cannot evaluate a chest position by words you cannot say Bishop takes Rook here that's scary scary is not an evaluation it's a human emotion that's why computers are better than humans they don't experience emotions you have to evaluate Things based on concrete ideas after Bishop takes Rook G1 Bishop back what is White's concrete idea in that position and if you don't see one you should play the move now as you get better in chess you're going to get to a point where you calculate everything correctly like this idea or you're going to miss something right like as you're growing up in in in chess you're going to miss things or you're going to see things Bishop F3 okay fine I mean we can trade we can block our you know but I I I I don't see anything wrong with this and now we're just up a pawn we're up a pawn but we do have the responsibility of not getting checkmated right we're going to finish up our development now we're going to sort of say all right white I mean you sack the pawn and you do have an attack on our King now prove it the best thing for white to do here is probably to Castle and double up the Rooks or play King E2 and double up the Rooks and then we got to fight back and probably the best way to fight back is in the center so the best you know way for us to complicate things in this position will be attack the center of the board anytime you're being attacked in chess you want to strike back in the center but it's a balancing act it's a it's a mix of striking back in the center and respecting our opponent's threats even if our opponent takes here with a doubled drook we're gonna give up our Queen but get two Rooks back okay King King E2 is this is edgy stuff I mean I'm I'm telling you this is this is really impressive the best move here unquestionably is to strike back in the center we can play Rook F7 we can wait but we got to go here because now we're actually we're calling the shots we have a threat and white has to play our game now if they take we can't take with the pawn because we lose our Queen we lose our Knight take take you lose this something more difficult to see take night takes they have a check right so when this opens you got to make sure that check is not fatal I saw that if you don't see that that's how you lose games I also saw the fact that when this opens up our Knight is hanging but if we take with the Knight with the Knight we're threatening a trade we are threatening a trade the less pieces our opponent has the less chance they have of successfully attacking our King and we're up a PA so we're going to be better in every end game now if the opponent gets the Knight out of the center I'm going to shove the queen back so B so fast because I know that those are the pieces that want to come attack me and then I'm going to keep attacking right I'm going to right so now Knight takes E5 now I'm expecting this check just like the last game it's an option of keep pieces on the board or go for an end game try to trade some pieces to be honest with you we can check after the the game what's better I think I just want to trade the pieces we are now threatening a queen trade and a knight trade white can go for both or one white can't go for zero if white moves the queen somewhere we take the Knight actually it's even worse than that we probably take this Pawn uh so if white trades the Queens we can take with the King Rook or we can get the Knight out of the center and say I don't want to night trade anymore probably the safest move is to take with a rook but actually King takes is totally fine uh it gets out of the way there's no check that matters we would just take back and look what we have left white with which is exactly why the Gotham Dutch is so powerful because it leaves white with very difficult uh Pawn structure in the future so again I'm going to just ah it's really tough for me to play Rook takes because I know it's not the best move um but I'm going to show you why it's not the best move it's not the best move because it disconnects the Rooks on the back Rank and after white trades Knights white gets the open file so let's see if my opponent capitalizes you see normally I would play that's not the best move because I can also trade Rooks but even you know more important than trading the Rooks is um probably taking the open file a lot of people would play Rook F6 here and uh lose a lot of their advantage the rook's not scary I mean The Rook you know is trying to go there and be annoying in the end game the most important thing is unquestionably the open file like life will become so much simpler now I think white wants to go here attacking the pawn from behind it's a good move it's a good decision uh I'm going to push the pawn because I have no other move uh and then we're going to try to double up but the reason taking back with the Rook was bad and the King was better or even the night is precisely because if I kept my Rook on the back rank I would have been able to fight for the open file because my Rooks would have defended each other it's very sophisticated stuff also if my king took the queen uh The Rook wouldn't have been able to make it down here now the easiest way to untangle in this position would be to trade the Rooks take the open file and bring the king trade the Rooks if you want to win a rook end game you should trade one pair of Rooks and now we go here and now life is good probably white will play Rook C6 and we we have to win this end game it's definitely not over um the way we win this is we uh we we walk the king over and we try to trade The Rook I don't actually see another way I mean we could play Rook e s and try to zigzag the king that way uh but uh I I mean I don't see anything else so let's play yeah I mean let's play King E7 we want to play Rook here right but we can't because they would take our Pawn trading the Rooks wins because we're up a in the end game let's not forget that simplification we have more pawns we have seven pawns white has six so Rook trade just wins mathematically C5 instructive I would not take I would not take because I don't want to split my pawns up so you're learning a lot I would not take cuz I don't want to split my pawns is it still probably winning yeah but it's not Checkers is it still winning probably you know what I'll probably even play it just to sh cuz I feel like a lot of 1200s would just take right they would say ah it's fair trade but I wouldn't do this but what this enables is my king like my king can walk forward now which it couldn't do uh White's going to go here of course and I'm going to defend this Pawn by moving my C Pawn up one square which I think is instructive but I'm making life a little bit more difficult for myself and what generally happens in these Rook end games is they're draws they are drawn because they're very tough they're very annoying uh and the only way for me to win any of my opponent's pawns okay that's an interesting move the only way for me to win any of my opponent's pawns by infiltrating with my Rook would be to probably lose one of my own pawns back here now I think a lot of people here would play moves like G5 just sort of go it's not a bad move uh but we have to protect our weaknesses in the end game we got to be very careful and the best move for white is to try to hunt down my weaknesses my Rook is very passive uh but when I go C6 Rook B7 my Rook will very quickly become active on the open file white should try to bother me aha now we have a moment we can take take or ignore we can also take ignore take ignore you want to create a pass pawn and in an ideal situation you create a pass Pawn on the outskirts of the board so to me here my gut tells me to take and push you can also just push right away it's very difficult to decide which one is better all right take and push or just push let's go for take and push can you take twice probably also this move doesn't right I mean just be careful but it's probably fine I want to keep pawns together I'm tired of splitting up my Pawn so I'm going to go here I just got to protect these pawns just got to protect those pawns right so now I have I'm getting those pawns right and those pawns are going to be annoying for white to deal with white is going to have to defend against my advancement on that side of the board you see how like in chess we're like we're winning but we're not going to trade all the pawns simplifying is good we want to trade when we're up but simplifying too quickly might make us might throw us into a drawn end game it it's it's a balancing act it's hard to perfect sometimes multiple things are good sometimes they're not all good all right can I win the endgame if I take and play King E5 probably probably but I'm going for this because chess is about decision-making I want to get my Rook on the second rank to win that pawn and then I want to push my pawns right so I'm going to go King E6 you no no no no no no no this is insane this is this is crazy um I'm going to take and I guess my opponent wants to run the king over here but but this but this this is this is nuts you you can't do this I mean you you cannot trade Rooks in a five on four end game it's it's it's crazy to play like this um King F2 I I probably can even just run forward yeah but but no but this is but this is nuts this is nuts because I just play H5 and as long as the king doesn't walk in and eat everybody you can't no no this is a big decision big big big mistake big decision I'm just going to you know now I have a constant threat of promotion I might even just be winning right I might just go G3 and yeah you can't do that and that's instructive I mean it's instructive you you you cannot simplify in into a Lo into a pawn end game unless you are 100% certain it's correct but especially if you're down pawns I mean it's it's losing probably 95 out of 100 times so yeah now I'm threatening not to take back by the way yeah so what my opponent missed is that uh my my threat was not to go here my threat is to go G3 take H3 and uh that was the threat and now you have to be in the box and you are not in the square of the box and now I just win so that was instructive I mean that could have went on a lot longer this would have went on a lot longer I think also again there's a little bit of like I'm playing Levy I'm going to lose anyway whatever but uh to improve at 1200 this like that that end game was very important because at 1200 games will go long and my opponent resigns but games will go long and you know this is a losing end game with best play um probably but it's hold for white like it's it's definitely holdable uh I would not rush to trade this many pawns and you know the computer says takes takes G4 is good it likes G4 it does like this idea um if I had just gone G4 right away it likes it a little bit less it's probably still a good idea but and you'll notice it didn't like creating a pass Pawn in the center because it's too close to everything so the evaluation here is minus 6 but the evaluation here is double double if triple almost Right double about so it's like that a lot more it's very instructive right and I mean that type of stuff like take once and push take once and push in the end game that comes with time right that comes with experience uh and uh one more important lesson in this game the Gotham Dutch by the way great opening highly recommended check it out in my in my courses list on Chesley but also just check out the free sample maybe I'll put a link in the description to um to that if you you'd like uh I'm telling you like this course is great I love this course and uh even the free first chapter is is awesome um I thought white played pretty well but instructive moment here don't be afraid of things if there's no concrete followup there was no concrete followup it was just the file is open and that's scary but trading the bishop was not the right way to go you just lost the pawn right and now definitely the best move is to Castle and then you know E5 and we would have had a game I mean my opponent would have gone here I probably would have played King H7 Queen F7 here actually doesn't work because Knight takes but that's you know a slightly that's a calculation type of thing uh but I thought this was you know correct and E5 is the top computer move striking back in the center in the anticipation of the attack so lot of instructive stuff I would rewatch the commentary over uh I I think I'm very detailed in my thought process and all the important moments and I try to summarize them at the end of the game um but uh yeah here the best move is Knight takes F7 actually relieving this knight from its Duty uh this is okay and this is definitely the best move but black is still fine but I would I I would say uh for this level I would say King takes is the best move because you get a rook to d8 and that's the most important thing like to me this is by far the easiest end game to win once you can connect your Rooks okay two games down let's play the third one um I'm now going to play Dark Knight 1600 last time I played D4 last time uh in episode 26 I played an English I have white again so maybe I'll play an English in that game this time I'll play E4 okay Carl Khan so I I've played fantasy before I've played a lot of different stuff um against the caroan I'll play D4 I'll play the advance advance is the most popular yeah okay my opponent is playing the Gotham caroon against me the best line here you have to know this if you're going to play the advance against this you have to know captures at least Knight C6 now Knight C6 and E6 are the two most common moves um E6 is slightly better Knight C6 is fine uh the best line against Knight C6 is in my E4 course which is the move Pawn to F4 and if a person doesn't know what they're doing here they could get themselves in a ton of trouble a ton most people here play Bishop F4 or Knight F3 which gives black a comfortable game at top level Knight C6 is almost completely gone because white can just hang on to this pawn and then hang on to the rest of the pawns as well a lot of people go here you play here now a lot of people here play D4 which is a very natural move it's probably the best move if they don't play D4 you play C3 and Black's in serious trouble like right now I can play Knight F3 or C3 I don't think there's a huge difference um but the best line is like some crazy G5 stuff so if my opponent knows that then you know good for them um I'm trying to think C3 or or Knight F3 is there a huge difference let's develop our Knight I mean we might as well wherever the Knight moves we will slide the bishop out of the way it will continue to defend our pawn and our idea here is very simple we want to play C3 we want to get the Knight off the board and we just want to maintain our extra Pawn so this is the problem if you don't know this this variation at this level 1, 1600 17 18 2300 whatever you're going to be down a pawn you're going to have less space within 15 moves you will be completely lost cuz it's chess like it's very hard to play Black be down a pawn and be down space okay so I'm going to play Bishop F2 I believe an idea like G5 here is the best move maybe not exactly in this position but that's sort of the concept uh although here I yeah Queen A5 but see now this doesn't work because I can trade Queens very quickly and um and get a very comfortable game but yeah this is definitely still the right idea and uh actually you know now that I'm looking at it Bishop here yeah my opponent will be taking on F2 okay so actually they they I think they got themselves out of trouble yeah now they can play Bishop C5 it's a very nice idea by my opponent actually very nice idea now this is the best move because there's an in between move let me explain myself in this position if my opponent had played Queen A5 check and I played Queen D2 and they took I would have taken the queen and I would have removed the defender of the bishop however in this position if they take and I remove the defender of the bishop they can take with check the difference is that Knight F5 forced my Bishop to a square which they missed Oh I thought that was their whole point oh now black is completely lost oh no oh no that was so clever Oh I thought my opponent I gave him so much credit now they're just completely lost now they are fulfilling the destiny they are down upon oh no oh no no no no no no no oh man yeah that's tough yeah now now I'm completely winning now I'm going to push the Knight out of the center restrict it and now black is fulfilling the destiny of down upon down space Oh that was so clever by my opponent because they could take and sneak in a check and then and then white is a little bit better but not upon and uh that's that that's kind of the way I I like to play this Advanced carocon I like to take I like to do this if you're sitting at home by the way wondering I can't believe chess is all memorization you need a little bit of knowledge pregame to play chess like in any sport I mean you need to know how to serve you need to know how to do certain things certain technical things to get an advantage over an opponent like if you're showing up and you don't know how to do anything why compete right that's sort of the point so now I'm going to play C3 and I'm going to show you this kind of rock solid formation with B4 and a lot of things are good here I can probably already kick the Knight out of the center but this Knight is not intimidating right A5 is a very common move to stop B4 makes a lot of sense now I will I will play this G4 move just to kind of show you like the ultimate position um probably not the most accurate by the way G4 but just a very nice move to play uh Knight E7 Knight G6 is possible yeah good move move good move um kind of want to take as much space as possible kind of want to play Bishop D3 like I have a lot of options here just don't want to fall asleep at the wheel don't want to give my opponent more than is necessary let's just yeah let's develop a piece this is a good idea I have to defend my Pawn with Bishop here got to got to be careful like I can't I can't just lose this Pawn so now i' I'd really like to play h for H5 push the Knight back H5 is an interesting move by my opponent try to get the rook in the game another interesting idea is Rook C8 to try to go after my Pawn I'm still up the pawn you know uh I really want to go here I really want to play this move but this move will be a lot stronger if black cannot play H5 it's actually kind of sneaky so maybe for now I will just take some space to try to play B4 and Knight B3 in the future and on castling I will play H4 H5 now black can play F6 also I should Castle probably but if I Castle I can't play H4 so it's like it's all Balancing Act I'd love to play F5 but that weakens my pawn and I don't really want to take the Knight I mean that would be a little bit sad I kind of kind of don't want to play this move uh um yeah I'd love to play H4 H5 like I'm waiting for my opponent to Castle maybe they'll play Rook C8 in a position like this a lot of it is also thinking of what's your worst piece I think it's this naturally Knight B3 comes to mind and then Knight D4 but if I play Knight D4 I'm blocking this so I have to do it all correctly in a right order I want to go here to make sure everything's guarded but then I hang my pawn my castle I can't play H4 you know information overload all right so indeed now I'm thinking of H4 there it is let's justify our plan was the plan all along we waited now H5 I just take there's no Rook I'm always looking at a strike back like I'm always looking at black playing F6 but H5 looks really really nasty to deal with I mean the Knight is going to get shoved all the way back there and there's still a point to be made like F6 could be a perfectly reasonable and not just reasonable it could be the only move to not get completely steamrolled that's probably not the move uh I get what black is trying to do but unfortunately I think white has a very strong position now um maybe it might be time to Castle I can play King E2 or Castle I actually don't know what the best move is what can black do can black play B5 I have on bant let's let's castle Yeah and um I said in the very beginning there's that move it's a little late but that is that is definitely still the best move although I don't have to take um I sort of said in the very beginning like this is what could happen this is a a kind of a worst nightmare in these carons now if take I'm going to take back so what do I want next I want to make a plan maybe I want to play Knight here tough to say do I want to what do I want to do maybe I want the bishop on that square okay if you can't decide and everything's sort of spinning make an improving move doesn't weaken anything okay don't burn all your clock time we spent 50 seconds on that move now we know that trading is good if you're up is it good there very tough to say the side with more space generally wants to avoid trades the side with less space which is black wants to trade because that will open up lines but we're up so we want to trade because we're up right you see how like chess is very annoyingly confusing now I mooved The Rook here kind of as an improving move but now that I see that the file is going to be blocked maybe I want to do something else I want to move my bishop and I can't so long as my knight is not protecting this Pawn so I think it's finally time to make that move all right black might come in this way and the question is do I yeah do I get rid of the Knight I mean you know maybe black is also trying to play Rook f8 that could be a thing um and now now put the Rook back on F1 to try to trade anticipating the opening of the position maybe but if I move my KN my Pawn's not defended but my Bishop can move right very man very tough to say we have to maintain our one minute time Advantage as well very important so one thing we could do here to kind of make it difficult for black to move is we can play like Bishop B5 just get in pressure disallow some of these pieces to move that's always going to be a nice square with good pressure on this as well and if the game rotates this way we rotate as well just make sure everything is protected black is going to be the one that's going to try to trade because black is down we could guard with the king or The Rook me personally I like Rook a little bit more all right now there's tactics stuff is hanging right like Rook here yeah Black's trying to double very ve very logical decision okay you know maybe we protect with the King we're going to do that we got to you know we game is speeding up now if this Rook moves so important so important if that Rook moves that Pawn's no longer protected if you don't spot that you won't punish black for their decision- making I think they spotted it as well now it's going to be a matter of do you still go for it or do you realize it's bad and it's too dangerous chess is hard it's a hard game Knight E5 is not possible a lot of these pieces are struggling to move I anticipate like a Night Hop just to make something happen we're going to trade that off we're going to trade The Rook off get a lot of pieces off the board I just said the side that likes to trade pieces that has less space is happier but the side that is okay but what about takes and takes can't we do that aren't we just picking up a pawn there I think my opponent was worried about this but that looks pretty damn good to me we're going to take and take and now we are up two pawns and we're threatening to trade a bishop and now that we're up two pawns we're going to start yeah we're going to start going for it I think my opponent wanted to play D4 opening up this but they forgot that our Knight could actually take the bishop and that's a that's a big mistake that's a big mistake that was made under time pressure and unfortunately now we will win a whole lot more than a couple pawns but that was an instructive game that was an instructive game and if you're going to play that Caro Khan you have to be really really I'm just trading see now my opponent has less space but at this point I hope you can understand we are totally in the clear to trade right we are converting Etc um if you're going to play that line of the Carlon you got to make sure you are very very sharp and quick at getting your Pawn back or else within 10 or 15 moves things could get very very very bad okay we won um this was exactly how this opening kind of goes um Knight F3 Bishop F2 and now this move and everything was good here so the instructive moment was that if my opponent had tried to play Queen A5 I would have went C3 or queen D2 and the point is that now I have this kind of fork or again I have this kind of concept of taking the queen and the Knight takes but the queen stops guarding the bishop the way my opponent played this which was very clever I have to say was to put my Bishop back on F2 there's an argument to be made Bishop G1 is even better but now my opponent could have just and should have just taken this because after it takes Bishop F2 is check that is the major tactical difference right after King takes Knight takes now we would have had to play this game and I would have had to show you how to play and uh my opponent almost did it perfectly but if you're not extremely accurate in this opening you will run into this position and now you will just be brutally shoved backwards and uh yeah this is this is a worst nightmare and I kind of said that I said that in the in the beginning of the game and the best move for black here would have been to play F6 it was always to try to fight back with the F Pawn that was the only method you had to play F6 a little bit faster to give me something to think about once you allowed me to get all the maximum of my position and the extra Pawn black still did a very nice job fighting back and maybe here the best move practically would have been to sacrifice and just try to open up but once you played it too slowly it sort of all fell apart and it went from plus. 6 to plus two to plus 9 and that's life unfortunately um I've got two more opponents uh and the next one is rated 1,800 and has a profile photo of a frog so we will uh we will okay C4 is the move I like a lot of things here one of my favorite courses that I've ever made is a modern so the modern goes Bishop G7 and then the way I like to play the modern in particular against this again chess is all about reacting to our opponent's openings is I like to play Bishop D7 Queen C8 and bring the bishop down there for a trade I can't do that right now because my opponent would take this Pawn so I just like to develop my knight to C6 first this is just how I like to do this bishop here Queen C8 yeah and now you could do this in a handful of ways some people here don't rush this castling at the 1800 level they still still might and basically the plan is like I want to trade your Bishop because this is your very powerful English bishop and also your king is there so if I trade that Bishop I will be able to attack your king a bit better using my H Pawn with my Rook because I haven't castled now this is not easily preventable so my opponent is trying to you know immediately instigate some counterplay over here perfectly reasonable by the way uh I don't have to play A5 I just kind of like to go ahead with my plan I mean I I I want to make an English player uncomfortable is B5 a concern not really cuz I can move my knight now I don't take because my opponent would go up with the king I play H5 now the easiest way to deal with this if you're playing with white is to trade kick out the queen and shove the pawn back to H4 but that's not everybody's cup of tea That's not everybody's cup of tea not a lot of people like to Castle in an English and then play H4 and it's not always the end of the attack either but this is a very nice way to deal with English players uh because it makes them really really really uncomfortable uh and that's what chess is all about like in the last opening I was trying to make my opponent uncomfortable chess is about making your opponents uncomfortable Bishop B2 all right but now I can still play H4 and once this move happens some people lose in 10 moves uh some people just completely Panic here now it's too late to kick me out uh because my Pawn has reached H4 Knight takes H4 loses the game to Rook takes H4 now my opponent also was openly admitting before this game they were very nervous and that's completely understandable and uh I get very nervous too so you know it's it's part of Chess uh and sadly that's just sort of the reality but uh a lot of people here already Panic like a lot of people here with white already think oh my god I've messed up not quite but we definitely do have a more pleasant game than they do if B5 I'll even move my knight to the middle remove another defender of the white king and once I get rid of these two I'm getting in there so I already am looking at taking taking and playing the queen to H3 um but I don't have to all right I don't have to I I can maybe try to find a little bit more precise way uh but it's definitely an idea I'm I'm also looking at just trading off the Knight first I don't know what the most accurate move here is um another way is to bring the queen put the queen on the H file first let me think some of you may be wondering why I'm not playing takes and H3 uh my H file stays closed that way and I don't really get the attack that I that I necessarily desire it it doesn't become as powerful as I would like to me uh a very natural move here might might just be take first and see what happens but I I'm not a fan of opening up my opponent's Rooks it's a very tough very tough decision actually very tough decision what to play here and again I want to give my opponent the respect they deserve so I don't really want to bull rush in and kind of go crazy but you know what sometimes I think you have to keep it simple let's take they have to take with the F Pawn which is UNC unconventional normally you want to take toward the center but that move loses in two moves to Bishop takes uh in this case they have to take away from the center and I think I'm just going to play it as simple as possible I am going to take put my queen there and Target the Knight and just attack I am not going to over complicate things because if you over complicate things you can get yourself in trouble this is not a moment you need to think okay takes and now another question is where's my opponent going to move the king my opponent's just very nervous they are very nervous I mean you give me all of this you're going to get nervous now do I play Knight F6 Knight G4 or do I play Knight E5 removing the defender of the king I I mean it's really tough not to play Knight E5 to try to just bring that Knight and now h two can be taken with a check which is very very scary I am also threatening Knight D3 I'm also threatening Knight C4 and I'm probably just in a vague Universe threatening Knight G4 just as sort of a backup I would imagine the best move here for white is something like D4 basically saying I'll give you this and you can take but my opponent didn't do that now Knight D3 is possible I mean it's a free it's a free Bishop right like I I should go for it I'm worried about my knight getting trapped but I it's a free Bishop I mean it's really hard to and some of you may be wondering about this check I probably would have blocked with the pawn but believe it or not sometimes just sliding the king out of the way and hiding on f8 is perfectly safe for this opening which is kind of fascinating but this just shows you how this modern attack versus the English is so annoying and English players want to Cal game where they impose their will and we're not giving them that and we're giving them a a a migraine now we're going to win the bishop and then we're going to try to get in against the king as well so um my opponent did admit they were nervous you know and I uh and I and I played a very mean line and definitely if you're nervous you're not going to play your best and I just realize like there's actually no way to trap my knight because I'm still coming in here yeah so look I just said the easiest way to to to finish off a game of chess right trade and what I would do here I would just snap this Knight off the board just snap it off like it's not necessary at all take it get out with your knight and now we are up four points of material we did our damage now we win of course I mean theoretically you could resign like at at any point like especially at 1800 people already think that they're so strong there's no point playing on I would I would kind of understand but uh I'll offer a night trade I don't think my opponent should accept it obviously but we'll just do it uh double pawns don't really matter being up at night is in an end game is far more important you could resign but I I I really wouldn't I mean I I would play on a little bit and and you never know when an opponent just kind of like gets lazy and starts making mistakes and we could still Castle our King just be a little careful with this Knight some Pawn advancements are possible uh I would Castle or just kind of hide my king in the center of the board I'm going to double up on the H file is there a threat no let's play King D7 double up on the H file put some pressure over here and just kind of crash in it's really tough I mean it's it's I can even play Rook H3 I can play as far as I want to put some pressure it's just a tough position there's no counter playay here for white there's no imbalance there's no which is why I was sort of saying like if you know if you resign here as like 1,800 I'll forgive it if you're 1,200 here you never there's no point in resigning 1200s bring short circuit at any point that's not an insult it's just life like they they they could do something ridiculous at any moment in the game all right we're going to double up I guess Knight F1 is the idea which is unfortunate that you sort of have to play so passively but I'm just I'm I'm still going to kind of go for it and I will get the pawn a sneaky Threat by the way here is not just on the the pawn but also on that pawn so this is a very normal tactic you threaten two pawns if the Rook at the end is pinned and not protected sufficiently just interesting sort of something but Knight F1 guards both by the way Knight F1 protects against both of those things right here Rook G3 right I could play Knight G4 this is a hidden backup idea just a useful little tactical trick for you to know remove this just a useful tactical trick Knight F1 okay my Rook is hanging uh I guess I will just go right back to to you know to the right just hammering away now I'm also because the G Pawn's gone I have eyes on that it's a tough position I mean there's no way around it and sometimes that's how it goes but from a game like this what my opponent should do is now learn an antidote against that or hope they don't see it again which is actually relatively reasonable strategy because I sometimes play things that aren't that popular they don't always happen in games um I just realized that this move guarantees me nothing because the Rook will just go to G2 which is annoying I would like to this is kind of Chess thinking right here I want to Target this Pawn by going here but my knight guards my knight right now so let me go here first right this is like this is the way chess brain works I want to go here Target this spawn I can't because my knight is protected so I got to guard my knight first it's tough it's tough for wait to make a move and uh credit to my opponent by the way for playing on not just kind of resigning out of frustration and it could be very frustrating I mean if you if you start a game and you know you're already nervous and you're kind of in your own head and then you it goes exactly in the worst way that you envisioned you're going to be really harsh on yourself uh and I'm preaching to the choir because I'm exactly like that I mean I am very much it's a good move by the way I can't take I'm very much a negative person like I I guess I will take this Pawn BR Rook C2 I frequently speak it into existence and then I'm like shocked it happened and it's kind of like well you spoke it into existence let me give this check the King has to guard The Rook by going here I'll play Knight E5 oh that's silly I forgot about King G3 I mean there's probably better ways to do this than I am doing it currently that was kind of silly um although I might have a mate I might have a Checkmate I might actually be able to change my plan here I do I have Rook C3 Rook F3 Rook F5 King G3 Rook C3 King F King F4 Rook F3 Rook F5 like I said always two options trade everything or or go for checkmate this is a very nasty move and Rook F5 is mate so is Rook H5 by the way that is kind of mean the poor King got swarmed oh there's King E4 whoops uh I'm kind of lucky I didn't like lose the whole game there but it's still mate actually yeah unfortunately the position is so strong for black it's still a Checkmate so Pawn takes Pawn is a good it's a good spot King D5 Rook D3 King D4 Rook D3 that was uh yeah I didn't even see King E4 was legal I was sitting there going wait a minute and now Rook D3 that was tough I feel for my opponent that was um I am curious if I made all the right decisions in that game um but uh yeah I mean it looks like I did it looks like okay Bishop D7 was an inaccuracy according to the computer but yeah H5 H4 and look at the advantage already that's crazy move nine black is better and after E3 this whole clarification was correct and yeah Knight yeah and I mean black is already winning it just shows you how ridiculously powerful this concept is and even 1800 like not fully aware not fully prepared like that could be very very brutal so um I'm going to say good game to my opponent um say don't be harsh on yourself being nervous before the game can always affect game play anyway that's life I know how it feels uh and in this series we are wholesome we are only wholesome okay last game against Jacob Jacob is uh from Poland I guess I don't actually I mean it could the flag could be anything uh I've played everything you know what we could do is we could play B3 I uh very rarely play like these kind of goofy Sidelines but I will play A nimol Larson and I will just show you how to throw a very strong opponent off their game you know 90% of opening study is all this stuff so my opponent has already committed upon there uh which means okay so they play D5 C5 E3 is normal and in general white has multiple approaches here one of the white approaches is actually playing F4 so securing control over the center with with the F Pawn and then putting the Knight behind it uh another approach is just to play Knight F3 like just play Knight F3 and play for a more Central based approach but via this move order I I really like F4 I mean I I I I love this line line so I'm going to play it uh the critical response for black is always a central Strike Back in the center of the board I got to raise my level 2100 rapid is very very good knight C6 is very principled I can already trade off this Knight to relieve some of that pressure or I can play Knight F3 if I play Knight F3 I have to think about the fact that what if my opponent plays A6 then I have to wonder like is that a concern I think I will go Bishop B5 I'm going to play Bishop B5 to to get rid of the piece here there's actually another funny way that the queen could get trapped this structure existed in the Dutch game funny this overlaps by the way the way that I'm playing this overlaps my game uh this one this was a mirror image I guess I shouldn't be analyzing really uh this was a mirror image position look it's mere image it's with black but uh if we go back to this game um it's a mirror image kind of so my opponent attacks my queen normal stuff uh I guess I can can I take on C6 now same kind of concept like in that Dutch game by the way sort of funny let's play Knight F3 I mean if my opponent plays Rook C8 they play Rook C8 but I'll play Knight F3 and I'm going to Castle I'm going to play H3 so it's like that Dutch game but with the colors reversed now 2100 is very very good I got to really manage the clock here I can't just be down four minutes and be like I'm going to win anyway 2100 is no joke uh assuming it's legit 2100 cuz like the truth my opponent is you know 100% legit I'm just saying the pool on chess.com in Rapid is completely unpredictable it's kind of a shame actually but um it's yeah it's life so if you if you really like the Dutch like if you're 2,000 in the rapid pool on chest.com or frankly anywhere on the internet like you'll get probably one in 12 cheaters probably like 5% 5 to 8% one and 12 is what 8 and a half uh and we have uh we we have kind of the conclusion of our opening I think I'll still maybe play for H3 another idea here is Queen E1 with the intention of putting the Knight on E5 and putting the queen over here let's play Maybe Queen E1 this queen E1 idea it's kind of interesting also just D3 is normal playing in the style that we did uh in the Dutch game d39 2 Knight C3 is also not completely stupid we play D3 D4 E4 just like in the Dutch game color revers this is a bit weak Queen B6 A4 is very good if A6 A5 is very tricky Queen B5 Knight C3 Queen B4 Rook A4 wins the queen Rook A4 I've had that in some games here A4 A6 A5 he can't take with the Knight because of the pin they take the bishop Knight C3 Queen has to come forward Rook A4 is a queen tra happened to me before it's quite funny but most people just play A6 or Rook C8 a lot of people play Rook C8 because they think I want to not damage oh my goodness can that actually I don't think it's G to happen I don't think at this level it's possible for that to happen but stranger things have happened I play A4 should I go for it just cheesy oh it's so cheesy I feel so silly I mean the best move is probably to take the I'm going to go A4 they could play C4 trying to get this it's not it's not bad I mean it's an idea I probably have to play like Bishop D4 or something or queen E2 just to protect this Pawn like this is okay well now A5 doesn't work because Knight takes so they didn't fall for the Trap uh so now if they play A6 I would just take probably would have been smarter to capture a little bit sooner uh if I'm being honest I probably should not have waited such a long time H I just decided to be a little bit silly let's take now if they take with the queen maybe I go for the sneaky Knight E5 and we uh we play a position with a relatively symmetrical structure if they take with the pawn I'm not really sure why they move their Queen there because I will just push the queen back like damaging your pawns voluntarily is odd Queen C6 makes far more sense considering that's kind of what you signed up for okay let's finish developing Knight E5 was a clever trick but then they take my queen I take their Queen they take and then I take and okay it's we have a big trade I mean I might have some microscopic Advantage there but I do want to show how to justify this very powerful Bishop I do kind of want to show maybe how quickly everything can fall apart in Black's position in Black's position we are we are constantly monitoring these advancements it's difficult for black to make any other forward progress B5 is silly there's no point having the queen on that square that's also a weird move because you can't play C4 so I don't quite get it okay H3 is let's play Queen E1 again we're going here and now let's see how Jacob reacts to the threat of the incoming attack cuz like the last game knowing you're about to be swarmed is very unsettling and uh not to mention the fact that now that I'm unpinned Knight E5 is very potent it's a very different story when my knight gets there uh and it's not a tradeit of Queens this is scary stuff and Jacob's going to think now for a bit he's probably going to take my knight I think this is generally a good starting point just kind of like or back the bishop up to G6 and try to make sure it sort of blocks but that's always going to be a Target I mean I'm I'm going to throw everything forward what I love in my position in this kind of nimol Larson reverse Dutch is everything is well protected like the position works very very well together I'm stopping a lot of advancements I literally just said that move was going to happen do I move my Rook I can also get my Rook into the game oh this is very tough I don't know is there any difference if I take with the n technically I'm allowing C4 but then I'll put my knight on E5 technically I'm not allowing C4 let's take with the Knight put the Knight on E5 tough to say G takes is probably stupid taking with the pawn there C4 I go here very quickly I fork I can take the pawn and then I'm not attacking but I'm up a pawn which looks pretty convincing wow am I missing something now the only question is do I take uh do I take in Fork I want to keep my Center together so I'm thinking take take Knight E5 am I missing anything Queen B6 maybe I'm missing queen B6 but if I play Knight E5 first queen B6 A5 Queen B5 okay Knight E5 Queen B6 Bishop D4 Bishop C5 I can trade and just win the pawn and pretty sure that just wins a pawn take take Knight E5 Queen B6 Bishop D4 Bishop C5 I even have Rook B1 if I want it and then I'm just up a pawn the alternative is Skip all of this and just try to attack but uh I didn't see a difference so I'm going to go here first because it maintains a little bit more tension yeah there's no difference I mean I just can't take now because they would take my Bishop but Queen B6 Bishop D4 Bishop C5 I can trade and I can take the pawn on C4 I mean I'm pretty I'm pretty certain it's just good for me I don't see why it wouldn't be I have other ideas I mean I can play Queen here with some attack and play like Knight D7 but that looks a bit too much a little bit too much but uh this was missed I think I mean that's why my opponent's thinking a lot okay Queen C7 they didn't play Queen B6 I spent see this is chess you spend all this time calculating your opponent doesn't do what you thought they were going to do but now I'm just going to win a pawn right like now I'm up a pawn I have to be careful I have to make sure I don't damage something here probably will have to defend my pawns against the queen and the Rook it's not like black has what they call compensation but this bishop is way too powerful and if black ever tries to start fighting back I'm just going to threaten mate I'm gonna be like who are you threatening so here this shows you the power of the Nim Sol Larson let's pre moove Knight takes probably right if or whatever we can just sit and relax for a second hope this was an instructive episode I think I played a lot of different interesting openings I I probably can take with the pawn as well but there's absolutely no reason to damage these pawns now I'm a pawn up now we have to delicately slowly improve our position stop counterplay against this I'm thinking just just just oh my good that looks so good this looks so hard to deal with now now that dark square is completely logged down uh I I really want to deal with this diagonal by tucking my king to H1 where I think my king is going to be very happy my knight on C4 is Immortal I don't know how my knight is going to get dealt with and then I'm just going to advance I mean I'm just going to March forward and um while threatening mate maybe on both diagonals if I'm feeling frisky I I just thought about this move I just I just said so what about E4 here Knight takes I guess right they take then do do I have a fork there's a check that's why I need my king on H1 black wants Bishop F6 I can play Bishop B5 first by the way yeah what if I start with this move Maybe not maybe that wasn't smart maybe they're just going to go Queen C5 to put some pressure that might have been a bit silly but I could always go back and as as a bonus I can always attack this Pawn cuz like that's going to be a weakness too we can't forget about that I'm getting a lot of tunnel vision here but I don't I don't have to mate I just have to not lose my Pawn somehow SO trading Knights and Bishops here trading Bishop for Knight would be perfect CU my knight is going to be a beast it's going to live there it can't be touched by any of Black's pieces um and I definitely like the two minutes up I mean two minutes up in with four verse two is fatal um I think my next move is King H1 I think I've sort of decided that there is no need to do all of this stuff over here okay is Knight B4 a problem maybe like a tiny bit I mean it's not like the biggest problem but it's annoying which is enough of a problem let's just let's let's let's show what I mean by getting our King out of here F6 would be a mistake probably because yeah Bishop F6 makes more sense um F6 would have been a mistake because it would have just weakened more stuff I I I I following this me you know mentality of like we don't have to take take us we're putting stuff on light squares because we don't have a lot on the light squares uh I I mean hey I like where my knight is I don't care about double pawns because I'm opening my Rook I'm taking squares away from black and my night guards my Pawn so now we can either keep attacking or we can start hammering the queen side and I I think it's about that time I mean I think it's about that time we switch the plan and we just say hey you know we our position is so good we could March straight down on the queen side as well but we could continue to threaten the king too so we could play Queen G3 I I just want to play like a balanced approach right right cuz I know the Black Knight is probably going there black is going to try to fight back okay that also makes sense um this attacks a rook The Rook will go to B8 and maybe I bring some pawns but then Knight C6 all right then Knight C6 that's not it's not that easy these 2100s don't go down maybe we go for a queen trade maybe we play Queen here Queen here maybe that's how we try to prove an advantage cuz Knight is coming maybe that's it I've decided I'm gonna go trade the queen or I'm gonna just put the queen active in that territory without trading but I think a queen trade would help in the end game I think the queen for black creates a lot of counterplay and I don't like that so I think I'm going for a queen trade maintaining that two-minute time Advantage keep in mind what I've been saying throughout this video you got to apply practical clock pressure too especially in any game you play 90 minute 40 minute you know 10 minute 1 minute 30 second 8 day chess I don't know how you can apply pressure in a eight day chess game but that's my plan I'd like to trade Black's queen and I want to keep applying pressure there it is now my gut says take with the Rook but taking with the Knight is also uh with the pawn is also very appealing because it gets closer to promotion but I mean I think take with the Rook right we just had a very similar thing in the previous game uh that looks like a guaranteed Queen trade and this one I absolutely will take with the pawn because I will get a passer this Pawn will now evolve although Knight takes is extremely goodlooking as well but I think this is just very tough to deal with I mean it's going to be a protected pass Pawn ooh that's uh that's like one of those come and take me moments um I can take and put a knight on D6 but at all times this guy is coming here so maybe what we do is we double up on the B file instead we want to be taken so what if I do remember how in the previous game I move my Rook all the way down look at that why don't I just do the same thing all the way down and here I kind of anticipate this okay that's uh that's a move is are they trying to mate me is that that what's happening maybe I trade the queens now now you can't mate me there you go uh and now I'm playing here by the way it's going to be the same tactic it's going to be the same exact tactic as the previous game pattern recognition chess is a game of pattern recognition look at that it's the exact same tactic and that is why you've got to be sharp with your tactics now we go we just start hammering at this pawn and this was a this was a contained game this was a nice game from start to finish uh now we will sacrifice h no sacrifice trade okay that's uh yeah that won't do it and let's just make sure we never get back rank checkmated just even at this level you never know that's a force Rook trade that's hanging that was a nice game I thought that was a very clean game and um I think today I I I was pretty sharp I think I was instructive I think I was pretty sharp and okay the player is 2100 and you know I played 94% so I think I did a a pretty nice job it says I I had a Miss I don't know what the Miss was better way to connect okay my Miss was you know already when the advantage was quite quite strong um but but yeah this moment right here was was a critical one and and black blundered I mean black played um C4 but I got to tell you it's very tough to find a move here for black very tough very tough like black can play A6 I'll play A5 or I'll play Queen G3 Knight E5 I'll start creating an attack the computer thinks it's equal but to me position is much easier to play for white uh that was instructive I think I think there was a ton to learn in this episode I mean like easily over 10 things uh how to Outlast at the lower elos like 900 and a th000 how to outlast opponents and and how to make slightly better opening decisions um how to not evaluate things in words but rather in in concrete EV you know Solutions uh how to make sure that in the opening you're you're avoiding the worst nightmare like the worst case scenario and also just being sharper a little bit in the tactics cuz if you float out in the first 10 15 moves in a dangerous opening already you'll just get a losing position but also in that third carocon game preventing counterplay in the fourth game we attacked an English and in this game we played a Nimo Larson it was actually a reverse Dutch which was very instructive uh and we followed the game plan I think to a t opponent blundered and we capitalized and Consolidated so that's how to win a chess uh if you want to get into a future episode like I said it's generally uh it's generally twitch subscribers but it's people in the the Discord and um I don't stream a whole lot nowadays but when I do people some still are still subbed and um if you like my content and you're below 1200 I would say check out my book if you'd like or any of my courses they all have free samples and I played a bunch of these openings in today's video I always do uh and that's all see you in the next episode get out of here
