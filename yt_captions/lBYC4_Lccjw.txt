- This is a deserted island
with zero inhabitants, and we're gonna spend
24 hours straight here. (Chandler laughing)
- I'm gonna go swim. - Yo, this looks like a Dorito. - Speaking of Doritos,
we brought supplies. - First is Mountain Dew. - Barbie Easy-Bake oven. - This is for my poop. - We brought Fortnite Monopoly, 'cause deserted islands are pretty lonely. - [Tareq] What did you bring, Chandler? - A heavy object. (chill music) - And everything else here is just tents, chairs, and boring things. - You ever go to the
grocery sto' with yo' mama and then gotta take all the bags at once? (Chandler grunting) - Alright boys, the boats are gone, they're not coming back until tomorrow. We have no cell service.
We're on a deserted island. Please, do not let anyone die. I gotta go pee over there, you
guys keep setting' up camp. - [Chris] I'm gonna build
the best tent you ever seen. - Good. Chandler, can you build mine? - Nope.
- They're over there. Like I said earlier,
treasure chest full of money. We're gonna find a spot
to bury all this money, but I don't know where. 'Cause I don't want 'em to see me. They're right over there. What if we told them we were
playin' hide and seek and then, but instead I bury the treasure. Alright my fellow islanders, I wanna play hide and seek real quick. I need you guys to all line up over here. Okay, drop what you're doing. Go all the way to the
water and look that way. If you're caught cheating, you're never allowed to
compete in a challenge ever until the day you die. - [Chandler] But I'm immortal. - They would never expect it to be in the middle of the camp. I'm gonna dig a decoy hole. (sand crunching) We're really close to camp, which is why I don't
think they'll check here. They're gonna think it's further out. Alright guys, I lied about hide and seek, you can turn around. - You were trying to bury
yourself and you couldn't. - Nah, I buried treasure. There's $10,000 buried somewhere. - [Chandler] No it's not. - Just kidding. So I lied, there's not $10,000. There's 3000. Go. (intense music)
$3,000 in $1 bills. - If I touched it first, I get it. - The more they look, the
more footprints they make and the harder it'll be to find. I see you, Chandler. If I know Jimmy, very lazy.
Doesn't like to go far. Which is why he went far. I'm going to Europe. - I strat is to follow Chris and then push him when he finds it. Bring it back faster. (intense music continues) - I'm gonna set my tent
up, have a nice meal, and tonight I'm gonna go rabid. - Now let's set camp. - [Tareq] Wow, you
already built your tent. - That took a very long time. - [Chris] Tear it down,
'cause it wasn't on camera. - No. - Dude, we're keepin' big
tent industry in business. We just keep on buyin' so many tents. - [Tareq] First step of
building a tent is to complain. - Ah, I'm so angry. That you exist! - [Tareq] Oh yeah. - You know where the treasure is, right? Can do a little splitsee ditsee. - [Tareq] 'Cause I don't
settle for 50 50, Chris. - I'll take 200 bucks.
I just wanna find it. - [Tareq] You just wanna find it? - Yeah. I offered him 2,800 bucks. See if you can beat that, nerds. - [Chandler] Oh yeah?
I've already found it. - [Tareq] You're building this
tent. You're working hard. - I went through all my ranks. Cub scouts before boy scout
and then I became a boy scout. They're gonna ask me to help 'em later, and I'm gonna say "Get
the seagull to help you." (cheerful upbeat music) - [Jimmy] So, we're kinda
hungry if you don't mind. - Well I'm dealing with a problem. Alright, it's goin' behind
Vikin's tent to block the wind. - [Tareq] That is actually kinda smart. (upbeat music) - Children, gather around
for your 'nother clue of your treasure. It's on this side of the island. - I found it. - [Tareq] Dustin found
the buried treasure. - You know, Dustin, it's a
shame we're on a deserted island and no one will know what
happens until nine o' clock. - I think Dustin found it,
so he should give it to me. - I'm 'bout to try to get
Josh to build my tent for me. I'll give you like 20 bucks. - Whoa, How much you win? - He won $3,000. - You won $3,000, you gimme 20 bucks? Wow. - Alright, so who payin' me for this bed? - How 'bout I give y'all each $1,000. - Well when you put it like
that it sounds pretty good. - Sounds amazing.
- Nice. (upbeat techy music) - [Tareq] You got it. - Getting so frustrated, dude. Oh my. (Chandler grunting) - [Tareq] There you go. (Chandler yelling) Stop hurting me! - This was a terrible idea.
- Once you get this set up, let's all go scuba diving together. (upbeat techy music continues) - Imma go for swim now. - [Tareq] Go for a swim. Enjoy it. (Dustin screaming) (water splashing) Hey Jimmy, I'm gonna throw you this GoPro. - [Chris] That's terrible. Oh my God that was awful. - Alright, me and Chandler
are about to go scuba diving. We'll let you know if we find anything. - Hi sisters. (upbeat techy music) - There is another island over there and we're gonna go swim to
it because we need content. - [Tareq] Oh look, we
have a shark in the water. - Alright guys, we have a
long treacherous journey, let's keep goin'. - I'm a shark. (chill music) - [Jimmy] Boys, the island's
all the way over there, keep goin'. - Come on.
- Everyone ride Jake. (Chris yelling) - [Chandler] Jimmy,
you're not catching up. (Chris and Jake yelling) - [Jake] No, Chris! - I gotta keep goin'. I gotta keep goin'. - Just splashed a drop in
my eye and I almost died. - You know the oceans on
the other side, right? - Of this?
- Mhm. - [Jimmy] We could swim to Europe. - [Chris] Naruto run
through the water. So fast. - [Jake] You're like a
motorboat. Keep goin'. - Chandler, where ya goin'?
- The island's this way. (Chandler laughing evilly) - [Jake] Oh, okay. Can we bring a tent over here? - [Jimmy] We're gonna need to head back. - [Jake] You mean you
wanna head over there? (upbeat chill music) - [Tareq] Hey Jake, give us slow motion- - I need the goggles! Tareq, what'd you want? You were like, I want a slow mo of what? (upbeat islandy music) - Woo. - Chris, we need you to get out the water and make a fire so we can eat hot dogs. - I don't wanna. - Junior. (Chris yelling) Good boy. - [Tareq] He's rollin' around
in the water right now. - Don't drop me on my. (Chris yelling) You did one thing asked. - We're sending the drone up so you can see how small our island is. - [Tareq] Island's gettin' small. - What?
- The island's gettin' small. - Who said that? - Mother nature.
- What the heck, mom? - [Tareq] Guys, we gotta migrate that way. - No. We build a moat. - We're not migrating anywhere. - [Tareq] I don't know
if this moats gonna work. Hey, let's see it, let's
see it, let's see it. Oh.
- It works. - [Tareq] It works. - We need more moats. - Yay, pool! (water splashing)
(Tareq laughing) - Guys, get to digging.
Protect the village. Ope, another one. - [Tareq] Oh, here he goes. - [Chandler] Holy cannoli. - Think you just saved your tents. Chandler, drain it to the ocean. (sand scratching) - Boy, that'll burn
your thighs right there. (chill music) - [Chris] It's working. - It is. - [Chris] That's a big one. - [Jimmy] We survived. - [Jake] It's protected! - We're doing good, boys. Keep digging. (upbeat music) Alright, the wall is secure on this side, let's go on the east. This area right here has got
about five feet, we're good. Our next point is right here. Here comes a big one! - Oh geez.
- Oh, that's a really big one. Oh my gosh. - We live to fight another day! - Who woulda thought
there's water on an island? It's called an iland not an iwater. - I was just thinkin',
we should make some food. - Chandler, do you see what
is happening right now? - Yes, we did a great job and I think we deserve a meal. - We can't make a fire if the village is underwater, Chandler - [Tareq] Think, Chandler. Please help. - Alright. Hold this. - Okay.
- Don't lose it. - Okay. - What is that?
- Heart attack. - [Tareq] You build
this moat, we get food. - Food?
- Yes. - Food. (upbeat rock music) - [Jimmy] Keep the island from sinking and we will give you all
the hot dogs you want. All of the hot dogs in the world. The waves don't want you to have hot dogs. - I'm gettin' tired. - [Tareq] You want some food? - Put the lighter in here.
- Food. - [Tareq] Some watah? What about food? Okay. Well, what if we drink watah first? And then we eat food. - [Chris] Dustin, can you
stand on the other side of that wall? - Okay. - The moat worked, this was
the best idea we've ever had. It actually withstood high tide. Now we're gonna eat some
food, heat up some hot dogs, it should be fun. - You know, it's pretty sandy. And also, there's a lotta water and birds are just poopin' everywhere. - [Tareq] I heard you
look like these birds. - Huh? From who? - Look at me build a fire.
- Who said that? - [Jake] 'Cause I was in
the boy scouts, look at me. I'm Chris. - So you say I look like birds now? - Like a majestic bird. - Okay. - Okay?
- Okay. - Do the neck. Do the neck! - [Tareq] What kinda bird is that? (Josh cawing) - Okay.
- No one's focusing on my fire! - [Tareq] What do we need to start a fire? - You just want me to say
the thing again, don't you? - Roast it all then.
- Sure do. - Fuel.
- Uh huh. - Flame.
- Uh huh. - And oxygen. And everybody said, no, you
breathe out carbon dioxide. But it's not, you're blowing and it makes the oxygen go to the fire. So you're wrong, comment
section, you dinguses. I'm sunburnt. - I know.
- I forgot sunscreen. I know, and I'm a boy scout. Cub scout. That's the first rule of
boy scout. Cub Scouts. - [Tareq] Sunscreen? - No, be prepared. We're roarin' now, boys. Get your weenies ready.
And also your hot dogs. Jimmy. Appreciate me. I made you fire. - I don't care. - I wanna feel appreciated. - You sound like Maddy. I need a takeaway. Come over here. Maddy, come on. It was an easy joke. It's not true. 100% not true. It's just, I was with the boys and the opportunity presented
itself for a funny joke and I took it. So it's okay, right? Right? - Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Love you, Maddy. (Chris yelling) - I got a knife.
- Oh god. Why is he running with a knife? - [Jimmy] Someone take
that knife from him! The only way to stop a crazy
was with another crazy. Chandler, attack. Boys. Think of your friendship. - Touch fire. - No. Your flame is not worthy. (waves crashing)
(birds cawing) - [Tareq] Chandler,
what did you say to him? - That's how you get rid of him. (upbeat music) - Hey Chandler.
- Yo. Give me that. Give me this. Gimme this. - [Tareq] Oh God. - If I don't get food
in the next 30 minutes, I'm walkin' around naked. And you know what? Also,
I'm gonna tear up the camp. That's what Imma do. I'm puttin' out the fire, I'm
gettin' naked in 30 minutes if I don't get food. - I haven't washed my hands, but- - [Jimmy] Cook our wieners. - [Chris] There we go. - [Tareq] Wait, you
haven't washed your hands? - [Jake] Were you diggin' in your crack? - Yes, I was. We're not dealing with optimal conditions for wiener cookin'. Alright, let's go ahead
and get the buns ready, and the ketchup, and the mustard. - [Jimmy] They ready yet? - No. Hey, get outta
here, this is my wiener. These are my wieners! - [Jake] I'll sacrifice myself and make sure they're not poisonous. - Everyone gets two wieners. That's your rations for the night. Wiener me up, daddy. - [Tareq] Chris, thank you.
I'll be the first to say. - You're welcome.
- The hot dog- - I don't get much of those. It's gonna fall. Close your bun! - Let go. (birds cawing) - [Chris] Go away, these are our wieners. - What'd you do with the
ketchup and mustard, Tareq? - [Tareq] I don't know. - How many times? How many
times have we forgot it? Once? That's one too many.
- Alright. - One too many. - Every time we go on a trip, we always forget to bring
ketchup and mustard. Which is no big deal,
it's just condiments. - On the mountain, it was water. I can deal without water.
You can live without water. - We're gonna die of dehydration - But a hot dog without
ketchup and mustard? You might as well just put me in a coffin. (upbeat music) - Guys, the drone shot's not good enough. You can barely see us. - Not see us? More fire! - Oh.
(men yelling) (soft serene music) - I'm so tired. I'm so tired from swimming
and all this stuff that I just don't feel like moving. I'm just gonna sleep here. Goodnight. Goin' to bed hungry 'cause
I dropped my hot dog. - I'm gonna go to bed. I'm tired after being
on an island all day. I don't know if I'm gonna wanna leave in the morning, though. Hey, can you cut my light off? The dark one spawns tonight. - Okay.
- Ope, now I just look like a dork. (soft serene music continues) - Good morning, guys. I ended up in a tent. I don't know how. I slept terribly. Sand is not comfortable. - I'm tired and I wanna
go back to bed. Please. - Alright. Good morning,
I slept in this chair. I think we're just gonna get outta here, it's almost been 24 hours. Hopefully this boat'll come soon. - That's probably the worst
night sleep I've ever gotten. Everything hurts, I'm covered in sand. I just wanna shower.
Can I have a shower now? - So guys, I just thought of something. What if the boats don't come this morning? - Why would you say that? - Do we have a flare gun? - I doubt it.
- No. - Frick. Okay, well we better
hope the boats come back. - An island sucks. - I agree. Don't spend 24 hours on a deserted island. It's miserable. - Boat doesn't come
soon I'm gonna go crazy. - We're currently packing up and hoping the boat guys didn't forget us. We're making sure we pick up everything we brought to the island, 'cause obviously you
don't wanna leave a mess, that's horrible for the environment. (water splashing) Our boats are here! - [Tareq] Hey guys, good
news. The boats are here. - Yay.
- No they're not, they're all the way over there. - [Tareq] I mean, yeah,
the boats are there. - I'm dying. - I'm gonna need you to carry me. - [Tareq] How much do you weigh? - About 168. - Tareq only carries 169ers. - [Tareq] That's true. - Hi.
- Hello. - [Chris] Thank God. - Come on, guys. We did it.
- I have sunburn. Don't touch me, I have sunburn. - I'm so sweaty.
- Come on. Bring it in. - Ow. Ow.
- We did it. We did it. The boat is here. - [Chris] Am I able to be dropped off? - It's a boat. (explosion booming)
