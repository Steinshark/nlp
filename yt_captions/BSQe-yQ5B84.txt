[Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and welcome to what's on my phone 2019. see i've done this sort of thing roughly once a year and it always tends to be kind of the same as the last year but this year i'm going to put a little bit more of the other devices that i use so it's more of a look at the ecosystem of things that i use somewhat daily right now and this is right at that like perfect time of the year where we're in the lull after the holiday season where i can sort of settle into one device for more than a month at a time we're about to start to get new phones again but for the moment this is what i've chosen uh to settle into so you probably notice i have two phones in front of me i'm going to go through them both i'm going to start with my android phone but i do carry an android phone of choice and an iphone of choice as you know those phones are pixel 3xl and iphone 10s max black space gray all right so this is my probably pretty familiar looking uh pixel setup at this point like i've said not a ton changing but i'll go through uh the the icons on widgets anyway i'll leave the wallpaper link below of course but uh tick tick that's my to-do list app i don't think i'd be nearly as productive without actually writing things down as when i actually write them down like if you ask me to do something and i don't write it down and i tell you i'm going to do it i'm not going to do it i actually have to write it down but then i have google keep which i see they've called keep notes now but it's just to keep lists of things and to remember what's upcoming then there's instagram i think we all know instagram is and then there's google photos over here which is the stock photos app for the pixel then pocket casts and this is something i've gotten more into lately but i've started listening to more podcasts from various creators there's podcast networks there's news sites and all sorts of people do podcasts now nba players even so i use the pocketcast app to sort through those download them listen to them on flights and car rides and things like that i use relay pro still for reddit uh i use a different reddit app on the iphone but i'll get into that later relay pro is great that's the tesla app i haven't had my car for at this point almost three months and there's an update on that coming very soon but i still have the tesla app lonely hasn't been opened in a while on my phone then there's spotify um that's just all the music i listen to a lot of music still in the car or whether i'm working out or whatever i'm doing and i have actually added an mkbhd videos playlist and i'll i've started linking that below as well so the video intro music you hear in a lot of videos you can find it on spotify and so i've started adding them to this playlist so shout out to spotify so the last two on this row youtube studio app pretty uh pretty standard stuff i think you've all seen that before and google maps i'd be lost without it but i use waze which is on my next page at the bottom i always have my text app and the dialer i have my camera always over there and part of the reason i've been using the pixel for for all this time especially over my second favorite phone right now in the android world which is the oneplus 6t is the camera the oneplus is a better performer it is significantly faster smoother doesn't hiccup nearly as much has way more ram it's just more pleasurable to use but the camera's not as good and every time i come back and take photos on this pixel's camera it reminds me why i really liked it in the first place so that's going to be something really difficult for other phones to top in the future but pixel's camera is what's keeping me here then i have the play store and i also have my twitter app of choice on android it's called flamingo it's no longer available for additional users in the play store so it's kind of a useless shout out but it's one of my favorite twitter apps of all time but i don't get notifications through it i use the the official twitter app for notifications so that's my sort of weird twitter situation and i'll scroll over uh there's my calendar app i forgot the name of it but it's really good so i'll link it below and it just lets you click on the calendar from up top and then there's waze this is what i use for navigation so it'll tell you if there's potholes on the road ahead or if there's anything like closed roads or construction traffic is really really good with waze so i recommend waze then there's yahoo fantasy i recently dethroned the best team in our league but i'm only 11 and 5 in the 16 weeks of the nba season so i'm not not on top yet shout out to jesse and i think that's uh that's mike so good job campy then i have my fitness pal which is an app basically used to track macros and fitness and calories and things like that then soundcloud my second favorite music app uh stuff that's not on spotify which is very little i can listen to on soundcloud and then group me for all the group chat action but of course like any other android phone there are plenty of apps that are not on my home screen that are still on my phone accuweather is just a great weather app i think most people know what that does aftership is pretty good for just letting you know what happened with your packages whether they've arrived yet you can see the titanium red hydrogens that i ordered are on the way so android auto audible audible's good for audiobooks i've read at least three books in the last year so that's pretty good breather i haven't used that in a while but i've talked about it before lets you rent space in your area if you live in a city where there's a lot of breathers in calculator calendar camera chrome clock coin base remember bitcoin good times dark sky dark sky is a really good hyper local weather app so it's sort of crowdsourced and wow that's a lot of rain or something coming awesome but it's a hyper local weather app and it can give you notifications about if it's going to rain in the next couple of minutes it'll say hey it's going to start drizzling in 17 minutes and raining hard and 24. i know exactly how long you have to get out of wherever you're at so i like dark sky google fitness i don't use as much you may notice i wear an apple watch and i've developed this obsession with closing my rings it's what a lot of people with apple watches end up doing it's telling me to breathe right now uh headphones this is the sony headphones app so you guys saw that i reviewed the sony wh-1000xm3s pretty recently that was with minimal experience with the app and there's a couple cool features in the app where you can customize what it does but that's the app on my phone now then there's a healthmate app which is connected to a digital scale that i have literally tells me mostly just how much i weigh but you guys didn't know how much i weighed so there's your uh your insight into that hashtag gains phillips hue there's a couple philips hue lights in here including that one behind my desk that's been there for years now gotta love philips hue stuff uh i also have the lifx app because i've been experiment experimenting with those they talk to google home as well and that i don't have to go through all these uh ld is called lens distortions so you can open up a photo in the lens distortions app and then there's a whole bunch of different effects built in that you can play with to adjust how the photo looks adds essentially overlays that you can adjust opacity intensity of and filters it's pretty cool i don't use it that much but it is useful at what it does and i also have lightroom mobile that i use even less often than the actual built-in photo editor in google photos but it is good for certain things as well then there's the me ross app that's an app that i got specifically for a smart plug that needed to use that app to talk to it but then it could turn on and off a holiday tree for the past year so it worked there's nest there's pandora i only have two different wallpaper apps that i use regularly one of them is papers and it's very similar to the other one i use which is called wally down here at the bottom w-a-l-l-i i'm also gonna try to link as many of these apps as possible down below so the description is gonna be really long but ideally you can find everything there then we're getting down to the end i have a photo blend app i have pocket casts i have the regular reddit app that's good for notifications i have slack i have resplash what is resplash oh it's more it's more wallpapers i forgot i had a third one i don't use this one as much i have the stockx app this one uh can be a bit of a problem because if you're into shoes or street wear but for me mostly just shoes then you can just kind of endlessly graze through here and find things that you want uh highly recommended and then you get to the bottom and there's youtube youtube tv youtube music youtube studio and zillow for just perusing real estate and that's basically it so that's that's the apps that are on my android phone again i don't use all these apps all the time the ones that are mainly on my home screen are the ones that i most often use like with most people but i also have an iphone and that's where i'll i'll do a lot of stuff that's just works better on the iphone so i'll link again this wallpaper for my iphone below but again just a bunch of apps that are good on the iphone that aren't necessarily as good on android so things like snapchat uh instagram for instagram stories and then there's a bunch of duplicates just because sometimes i find myself using the iphone a little more so the camera there's google photos at the top for backing up your photos there is the actual photos app and then there's the calendar which is good for just telling me the date i don't actually use the calendar app on the iphone it's completely blank but the icon shows the date and that's why i keep it there there's the wallet uh the wallet apps on android are all really finicky and a little i would say untrustworthy fun fact if you go to an apple event they will actually put a pass in your wallet app that they will scan and let you in with so they just kind of expect you to use their products so i have the wallet app then spotify and soundcloud right next to each other the app store settings youtube youtube studio pocket casts a lot of duplicates as you can see a lot of competitors next to each other as well and then i have instagram and my tic tic app which does sync with the tick tick app on my ipad and my android phone and everything else i love multi-platform sync and then in my dock people thought i was trolling when i put these here but i have the the dialer i have the messages app safari and the google app and this is going to give me the same google cards that are on my android phone uh a little bit slower not as real time but i can still trigger google assistant from here i can still open google lens and identify things from the camera uh it still does all that same stuff then of course on the second page any iphone user knows you just have folders of junk that you don't open that much and since you can't move them or hide them anywhere to a drawer my folders are junk are the apple folder the utilities folder i have three games because i don't really game that much on my phones but i have osmos asphalt 9 and color road and i have a google app which has some google apps in it or google folder so that's my my junk folders at the top pocket dropbox dark sky again venmo again sky guide in my opinion sky guide is the best ar app period and i'm just gonna toss that out there if you open sky guide daytime or night and point it at the sky it will show you in real time where constellations are where celestial objects are where the sun the moon the planets and everything is and it overlays it with your actual environment the trees the buildings the skyline it's really cool highly recommended then the activity app which again if you're ever concerned about closing rings there's your history of rings being closed or sometimes not closed but don't pay too much attention to that and then on the last page i actually use these more than the middle page so the series shortcuts app the snapseed app for photo editing uber swing you as a golf app so for those of you who play golf there's a bunch of apps that do this but literally it connects to gps and as you walk around the golf course it'll tell you exactly how far you are from the whole from whatever hazards you're near things like that it's pretty smart then there's igtv yeah i remember that then there's the hasselblad focus app in theory it would be the perfect way to transfer photos from the hasselblad x1d that i use to my iphone and then edit them on the iphone unfortunately it's very very picky and usually when i want to use it it's a crowded wi-fi network and it's it's hard to switch it over so it could be a lot better i don't use it much but i want to use it more the metric time app for that clock i reviewed a long time ago then there is the zedge app which is the one wallpaper app that i use on the iphone so my ipad uh my beloved ipad pro i've found every excuse to use this over a macbook pro for example for the past couple weeks like i've said in these videos i kind of gave it a rave review here's what's on my ipad pro so a lot of the same stuff that's been on my iphone is duplicated so i'm not going to say that stuff again aside from the fact that yes i have the calendar up there just because it shows the date but really i just have three pages of apps i don't even have that many trash folders on here because i use a lot of the stuff on the ipad first couple rows uh i have that apple folder just to have a bunch of junk in it um spotify and soundcloud next to each other lightroom tick tick but some of the first true ipad apps that i have uh are games golf battle which is it's so stupid it's literally just a just a putt-putt game it's mini mini golf but like with your hand it's one of those super simple addicting games and then earn to die which is a game i've played on android but it's sort of like a uh horizontal scroller similar to mario but you're driving a cart with weapons on it and zombies are sort of attacking you that that type of thing and then osmos hd this is another one of those games that just looks amazing on a tablet and even if it's not the most action-packed thing the concept of it i'll leave like i said links to these below but you play through it and it's beautiful there's a great soundtrack you got headphones on you can get really immersed in this game so i'll recommend osmos hd and then just a bunch of apps that i use to to get work done on the ipad google keep google drive google docs um not even that crazy professional app so i'm not doing any video editing on here but i do have live lightroom cc on here because i can do photo editing and then i scroll over and there's some realtor apps so houzz for interior design realtor.com i also have zillow on here i have a weather app i found this app called medley that kind of lets you attempt to make music i'm not very good at it so i don't claim to be an expert at that at all but it's super fun um netflix i haven't really used netflix very much over the years i made an account a long time ago never really used it but as i've been going on a lot of flights lately i've found i've wanted to watch stuff podcasts don't really last six whole hours usually so there's some good stuff that i've downloaded netflix has been a good source for that i usually try to use my ipad for as much mobile work as possible i still hate typing on the ipad here's the thing about the ipad this is the keyboard and you can't really quite unless you have huge hands reach the middle of the ipad pro keyboard especially if it's landscape but the ipad pro is the only ipad where you can't split the keyboard so i guess on the smaller ipads you can do this little gesture and then it splits to the sides and you can type like this but on an ipad pro it won't do that so you end up being this hunt peck type type of person i i don't know why so i do most things like email or things that require a lot of typing to reply out to stuff or writing out like video ideas i do that on my laptop because i have a real keyboard i can actually type but i will not be mad if i find myself stuck with just an ipad pro and i just have to type like weirdly with my thumbs in that annoying way i'll get it done anyway that's my ipad all right last but not least uh the desktop imac pro 2019 fully maxed out this is where the the editing and and the production and the magic happens i guess you could say um but it's also my daily machine so i'll go through the apps and things on this so usually it's either in the launch pad all the stuff in here or the dock a lot of people used to do what's on my dock videos that was good times there used to be a lot of a lot of people doing what's on my dock videos so here's what's in my dock finder tick tick my to-do list app that's how i lift then there's final cut pro the editing suite of choice uh safari which is now my default web browser i do also have chrome but i do use safari for the most part on the mac spotify for the desktop tweetbot for all that twitter goodness uh the app store of course system preferences and the control panel for the apollo twin uh that i currently use for my audio setup and i keep my desktop pretty clean there's usually not a whole lot of spare extra icons going on i usually usually have just the web browser and twitter up i really really miss the dual screen setup of the past back in those days in 2013 and 20 2012 i guess those are the days when i most often used a dual screen setup and i'm really excited for the the modular mac this year so i can use whatever monitor i want and i can go back to having two but for now for the most part it's the imac so it's just one monitor you can see the 80 terabyte rate of attached storage up here that's the promise pegasus over here that shows up because it's a mounted hard drive and that's where i have a whole bunch of footage from previous videos and from current projects but also down here you can see the jellyfish as well doesn't show up as a mounted drive but over there back behind me that's a 120 terabytes of hard drives and that's the current server that's our network attack store network network attached storage are they weird if it was attack storage but it's attached storage but anyway that shows up as an additional location it's called jellyfish there's all the same mkbhd stuff and we have current video projects and i won't click in there because there's some top secret stuff but you'll see that very soon but that's what we use to have multiple people working on the same final cut pro project at the same time really impressive stuff it's called the lumaforge jellyfish at least that's what the hardware is called and i've loved that so far for like the past couple weeks but yeah this is this is the hub this is obviously where everything has to render this is where things get uploaded and published um and it's been a workhorse so far you can go back and watch the imac pro review if you have any other questions about that but that's basically it honestly yes just uh just a lot of what you've seen before in a bunch of other various places but all in one video if you have any other questions i'll hang out in the comments section below and talk through whether it's workflow questions or app questions or if i forgot a wallpaper or some link you need me to drop below i'll keep doing that but that's basically it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
