know you're dying to know we have no idea what we don't know it's obviously a big number but we don't know the answer we're going to play a game the Hydra game based on Hercules Greek mythology the second labor of the 12 that Hercules had to complete to kill the lenan Hydra it had nine heads and every time Hercules chopped off aead two grew back and that's why this was deemed sufficiently challenging for Hercules and he kind of cheated because he like got fire and burnt the wound so that the heads couldn't grow back but there's a mathematical way to solve this and figure out how many heads would Hercules actually have to chop off for this to end and that is the hydrogen surely will never end you have to define the rules in the Hydra game the rules are potentially a little bit different to how The Legend of Hercules is told but we can figure out how many heads Hercules chopped up if the linean Hydra followed the mathematical rules of the Hydra let's hear the let's hear it let's hear it I'm ready all right so the rules are you have a root so this is R this is the start of your tree and it's what we call a rooted graph so that means there are some points coming out of your root and then they have some points so rooted graph just means that every point every node has a single parent that it's come from that's as simple as you might expect there's no like ins and outs flowing it's just just single parent tracing all the way back to an actual route at the bottom and the way you play the game is you pick what we call a leaf so sort of stage one is pick a leaf X so a leaf means the furthest point along sort of you think of it as an actual tree so this would be an X that we could pick and then you also pick an integer n so a whole number n and then you remove X and then step four is you add n new branches to who X's grandparent so we've picked X let's say n is two in the example of Hercules chop one off two grow back remove X so then this is X this is the parent so this one is the grandparent and of course this will vary depending on the X you picked but I now need to add two new ones here so I've chopped off my one head of my Hydra two new ones grow but they grow in a different position so that's like how it differs slightly to the Hercules Legend but this is the these are the rules of the Hydra game and then you go back and you pick a new leafx you pick a new integer n doesn't have to be the same and you repeat so the question we're interested in is how many steps until the game ends so let's take the Hercules example so the Hydra for Hercules nine heads and we're going to make it nice and symmetric so CU I think it would be so it's going to have three sort of main stems and then each of those has three heads so it's it's been depicted in many ways throughout history but this is this is definitely a way I have seen it depicted there's like a central body which splits into three and then each of those three bits has three heads on it so n is two and N is fixed so every time we chop off ah head to grow back from the grandparent from the grandparent yes exactly that's you've already caught and on that that's really key in how this is going to work so let's again it's completely symmetric so is there a particular head you want to chop off let's pretend your Hercules start at the left left or right so we going to CH that one off so we've picked our Leaf our integer n is fixed it's always two for Hercules we've removed X now we go back to the grandparent we add two left to right carry on left to right let's keep going so chop this one off again two more grow chop this one off two more grow so we're getting quite a lot of heads and there's going to be another one where this Leaf node used to be and again we're going to chop off another six [Music] each time we do it we get another two so we're going to get another plus 12 here aren't we so what we're left with is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 n plus another 12 we've added from those last ones so we actually have 21 branches coming out of R where R is this big roote at the bottom so we end up with 21 at the end how many have we chopped off so far we chopped off nine so we' we've taken nine steps so far there are 21 left but every time we chop off one of these there isn't a grandparent we go back to the parent there isn't a grandparent so that's kind of like an implicit rule in how the game works we can't go back any further so no new heads grow when we chop off these ones we're pruning back to the exactly so 21 plus the original nine that we did so the total for Hercules is going to be 30 heads Hercules actually has to chop off he can just Lop off those last 21 without without any growth exactly and if we started here and then decided to chop off one of these bottom ones we would chop it off nothing would grow but you've still got another eight remaining like two levels deep so I think the answer would be 30 for this example regardless of the order in which you chop them off for this particular example in other examples it's going to change but here it's 30 okay so we now know how many heads Hercules has to chop off it's 30 if the real Lon the real the mythical and Hydra follows the rules of the Hydra gate but a more general question that we could ask is not necessarily how many steps until the game ends will the game ever end given a specific Hydra in front of you a specific graph do we even know the game will ever end could there be an infinite number of steps because it kind of feels like if you're chopping off one thing but you're adding on more than one thing do we know that we'll always get back to the route and they'll be nothing left so that's the question as a mathematician you're often first interested in is will it even end before you would ask how many steps so let's investigate will this game ever end I feel like they always will end okay that's a good intuition because the answer is yes it will always end and the way we're going to do it actually is approve by induction you show some of the early steps work and you show that you can always continue to either increase or decrease from those early steps and you're like oh so I just repeat this forever and I'm good kind of how it works um so we consider what we call the maximum distance between a leaf and a root so the root is fixed it's the bottom of the tree and the maximum distance in the Hercules example is going to be one two so we actually had nine points that were a distance two but for Hercules D the maximum distance was two the other thing we observed in the Hercules example was once we were at a distance one that was all that was remaining we could just chop those off and nothing new would grow so once we get D equals 1 we're done that's a kill shot that's the kill shot right there could be four billion heads at that point but we don't really care cuz no new ones come you care if you're Hercules you don't want to chop up 4 billion heads but that's what you got to do that's what you got to do so that's like once we get to D equals 1 we're good so the induction is going to be can we can come up with a way or argue why we can keep reducing d if we just keep reducing it one by one no matter what it starts at we've got to hit one eventually and We Know It Ends once we get to one so if D equals 1 were done if D is greater than or equal to two we're a distance of two away there is some number of heads at that distance so again for Hercules it was nine but any graph where the furthest point away in my original starting one again D was two but we only had two heads at that distance there is a number of heads at that distance let's call it w subscript D so w is the number of heads and we're going to subscript it D meaning that's the number of heads that start a distance D away so we just do WD steps so for Hercules we did nine steps this one up here we do two steps we just remove all the heads at that level we don't care about this being necessarily the shortest or best way to solve it we just want to know there is a way to solve this like that it will end we can guarantee it will end so just do that many steps and having done WD steps the new heads grow from the grandparent so every time you remove distance D you get some amount because every step technically you pick a new integer it's not always the same one which complicates things but it doesn't matter you add some amount at distance D minus one and that's the key you can never add anything to distance D you can never add anything to the level you're at you only add to the one below cuz you draw the line from two below but it ends up being a distance one from where you were so after WD steps whatever number that is we now only have heads at D minus one remain could be lots of them right this could be a really big number and every time we do this we could be adding 4,000 heads every single time or even billions of heads every time so it could be an incredibly big number but we only add heads at the level below so now go back up to here and repeat exactly what we just did at D minus one we remove the small in some fixed finite number of steps only adding things at level D minus 2 so now we're on D minus 2 again and every time we do this there's going to be even more like their numbers are going to grow but they can't go to Infinity they can be big but they can't actually fully run away to Infinity So eventually might take forever and we'll see some examples of that shortly but you're going to get down to D equals 1 and as you said it's your kill shot the hydra's dead this feels like you've done a quite a sort of a formal not I know you haven't formalized it but you've done quite an elaborate proof for something that just seems kind of obvious like I'm glad you think it sounds obvious because um often things that feel obvious are the hardest to prove because you're starting from a point of this is obviously true like you said yourself yes it will end I think it will end so it's very helpful to have that intuition and that kind of obvious aspect to you as the mathematician but then formally writing down those steps just that's where you need training and practice as a mathematician so I agree with you it it's probably Overkill but as a mathematician roughly I feel happy enough with this sketch of an induction it could be a big number but we can end the game so we know it always ends so now let's think about can we get a grasp on how big these numbers could be now we'll just fix n so it's some number like in the Hercules example let's just you know if it helps think of it as two but it could be any number rather than there being a potentially new number that grows let's just fix it and see what happens there first step in the induction was remove all the heads at level WD so that's going to be WD steps right so again in Hercules example WD was n that was the furthest distance away there were nine now how many have we added so at the level below every time we did this we added n so the level below started with WD minus one meaning the number at distance D minus one but we've now added and lots of the steps we've already completed next one remove all of those it started at WD minus 2 that's what it means the number at level D minus 2 at the beginning but now we've added n lots of the ones that we've just done because every time we remove one at this level it adds one to the level before it and this pattern's going to continue so what this one actually if you simp simplify it a little bit CU you get this n * that one and then you get n^ 2 * the one two levels up so you can kind of continue with the pattern and eventually you'll get all the way down to uh W it would be D minus D minus1 would be W1 and then you've got n from the level before but the level before is going to be n lots of uh w d minus D minus 2 um and then you're going to get n 2 of the one before it which is I'll just write as W3 because that's going to be W1 W2 W3 and this goes all the way up to it's n to the D minus1 WD this would Now take us down to W1 and we know we can finish from this point Kill Shot turret that is killsh shot territory there's there's a lot of heads at this level that we have to now remove all of these heads but we can finish in that number of steps so the total number of steps is the sum of all of these total number of slashes of the sword yes the number of heads that have been loed off you want a visualization this one W1 only appears once so it's W1 and then you have this is W2 * n and here would be a W2 so you get a 1 + n * W2 and then the pattern continues a 1+ n + n 2 W3 plus dot dot dot plus 1 + n plus all the way up to n the^ of D minus 1 * WD because again WD is in all of these As you move your way up so that's what it represents so this is a big number now we can actually get an even nicer formula for this so we can't tell you what the W's are that's just the number of heads at the beginning but n is fixed so given how many you're adding grow back each time you lck one off two for Hercules um because these things and this is a very nice application of a geometric Series so geometric series is where to go from one term to the next you multiply by the same thing so here you're just multiplying by n to get the next term there's a formula for that okay so if you have 1 + n + n^ 2 plus dot dot dot up to n the K one geometric series is 1 - n k over 1 - n geometric series sum up to K terms where this is the first term second so plugging this in here what you see is the total number of steps for this simplified case is W1 plus now here we only have two terms so this is 1 minus uh n^ 2 over 1 - n * W2 and then we get 1 - n Cub 1 - n * W 3 and then we carry on this last one is 1 - n the D over 1 - n w d this is the total and the key thing here is you've got these powers of n increasing so if n is like four and you've got like 12 layers this is 4 to the^ 12 that's a very big number it's exponential growth again but like exponential growth almost like on steroids it's like super super growth really and this was for the simple case of n being fixed so in the Hercules example just to fully see how this works D was two we said n was fixed at two W2 is nine nine at distance two and just three at distance one so the total W1 which is three plus we're only going to stop here for Hercules 1 - n^ 2 so that's 1 - 4 / 1 - n - 2 so it's Aus one on the bottom minus 3 so that gives you a three multip by 9 so it's 3 + three lots of 9 which is 3 + 27 which is 30 thankfully my formula is correct so this doesn't prove the formula but we've derived it using geometric series and again that's for the simple case when n is fixed and we can already begin to see how this is going to grow rapidly when n is potentially quite a big number so we know this is growing quickly but I cannot stress how quickly and the best way to see that is with what we call a rapid growth example we're actually going to specify the rules here we have to pick a leaf so we're going to say pick the rightmost leaf so it doesn't have to be the furthest away so in our proof and what we were just talking about we were always looking furthest away and working our way back doesn't work here it just says pick the furthest one to the right just make it simple so it's like an algorithm to follow and the way that your n is going to work the number that grow back so so n is equal to the step you're at at step one one grows at step two the second head I'm chopping off two grow back if it's the third head I'm chopping off from when I started three grow back so the longer I let this run the worse it is for me as Hercules so there's like a you want to finish this as quickly as possible so this is just a way of like building in this kind of concept that n can vary as well so we just looked at M being fixed and you can get a bit of an understanding there but of course n isn't fixed so this is one way of allowing n to change and actually making it increase all the time so this is where the growth's really going to explode yeah however we know it ends because we had to proof it will end but how quickly does it end well we're going to look at the simplest possible graphs we're going to look at straight connectors of length y so if Y is one you have your root and you have a single that's it length one nothing else so this one's easy you come in chop your head off nothing can grow back it's dead so that takes a total number of let's call it s steps is warm now if I have a two straight length again that's it so again we're taking the simplest possible trees toop of the rightmost head this was step one so one new one grows from the grandparent I chop off the rightmost head that's step two but nothing can grow cuz it's at the bottom step three we've lost that so for this one three steps so far so good not growing too quickly y equals three one two three rightmost head you're going to have to help me keep track of the steps in this one so that's step one so I go back to my grandparent and one grows step two chop off the rightmost head to grow because it was step two chop off the rightmost head none of them grow so I've done three steps so far step four rightmost head nothing grows step five is now up here I now need five down uh so that was step five now however there are six left at the bottom and and when I chop off them nothing new will grow thankfully so I think s is going to be 11 so we can see it's not blowing up yet but you can see where this is going so y equals 4 next right and this is the last one I'm going to draw um and I'm actually not going to do the steps of this one because you know how many steps there are 98338 who so I don't want to do that feel free anyone watching this is very welcome to follow these rules on a simple full length chain 98338 steps gosh to end the hydro game but again it ends we know it must end but it seems like relatively simple set of rules the easiest possible graph we could have and yet nearly a million steps and then y equals 5 know you're dying to know yeah we have no idea what we don't know no one's been able to actually compute it we again we know it ends we have a proof that it must end but we do not know how many steps it takes I can't believe no one's done that like it seems like something someone will have done with a super computer just for the sake we don't know don't know the answer the Y equals 5 so challenge to the viewer exercise for the viewer a I want to know I want that number yeah so it's that jump right it's that jump from 11 to 983 th000 is just crazy this wouldn't be hard to compute though would it like just you just need a comp powerful computer like it's obviously simple it feels like it should be simple but as someone who I don't work in computational complexity which is very much the field you're getting into so I I don't I'm imagining the fact that it hasn't been done suggests it's not as straightforward as we originally think and I think this was the big clue that jump is just there's something else there that's it's sort of something else is happening that makes this really tricky but yeah no we we don't know the answer for y equal 5 it's obviously a big number but we don't know
