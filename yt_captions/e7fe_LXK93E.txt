I wouldn't describe myself as a conspiracy theorist but when almost three quarters of people report difficulty understanding dialogue in their favorite TV shows and movies and the entertainment industry's response is basically watch it in the theater or get your own theater red flag I think you've lost touch everyone uses subtitles now old man no I reject that that it's the mixers who are wrong and I've got the solution while sound bars may have a reputation for being either outlandishly expensive or Garbage or often some combination of the two a Goldilocks zone does appear to exist where you can get better dialogue quality and a wider Sound Stage without breaking the bank and surprisingly the most popular one on Amazon at the time of writing is from bows bows and affordable aren't words I would normally put together so then why are you all buying this sound bar ah the better to hear this segue to our sponsor dearie the ridge the ridge wallets are high quality compact

spending a thousand dollars on a TV would have some kind of budget set aside for an audio system but speaking from experience it's quite the opposite they're expecting that for that kind of money the built-in speakers should be decent already unfortunately the industry Trend towards thinner and thinner displays means they're simply not anywhere to put speakers like where would these speakers go in this TV now at the very high end there are Creative Solutions to this that involve vibrating the entire surface of the display and whatnot but most people aren't buying those kinds of solutions and the ones that are really especially ought to be using external speakers and soapbox so let's focus on the mainstream then we're going to be pairing our top selling sound bar the Bose TV speaker with another best seller that we're going to get to in another video this this 43 inch Amazon Fire TV if I didn't know how good this movie is supposed to sound it's fine I could barely hear his dad there isn't even any background music right now I can barely make anything out the sound quality is not great but that's okay we can fix that surprisingly the box for the Bose TV speaker contains only an optical cable to connect to your TV so we saw some complaints from people who were upset that they couldn't use e-arc without a trip to the local Walmart fortunately for us we have some HDMI cables lying around and we would definitely recommend going this route since e-arc should allow us to use our TV remote for Soundbar volume control and allow our devices to automatically power up and power down together as for the rest of the i o we've got auxiliary in a service port a base Port we'll talk more about this later and power now this unit doesn't have Wi-Fi meaning that you can't connect to the Bose app but it does have Bluetooth if you want to use it with a mobile device like your phone it's Bluetooth 4.2 though which means limited range compared to more modern implementations I'm pretty sure they're supposed to be base here no but like they're supposed to be like sub Bass and then now here there's supposed to be bass Bose yes bass no oh and that is not the mark of a good speaker when the bass finally manages to hit the rest of the sound ducks or it kind of sounds like it's being suppressed we also found that there was a lot of compression at high volume on bass heavy songs pretty good for music at low or medium volumes bad at high volumes it's kind of like a giant Bluetooth speaker it really struggles with the rumble of the train it's way better on the built-in speaker on this TV I couldn't tell she spoke a different language there it's just all unintelligible to me and I get it if you're looking to understand dialogue better I could see people bringing this thing home and compared to their onboard thinking man this is what I've been missing out on this thing's flipping amazing and if you're still having trouble hearing the dialogue enhancer definitely works doing even more to well enhanced dialogue but it does cost you in other areas particularly the little bit of bass that there already was gets suppressed even further it's not a home theater in a box but absolutely good enough for someone who just wants to hear what people are freaking saying the solution to most of my problems seems to be a Bose bass module base module you made a subwoofer ah no remember that base Port we saw before well as it turns out Bose locks down their sound bars to prevent you from using a third-party powered sub I mean I'm sure they have some kind of brand BS ensuring a consistent experience justification for this but we need only look as far as the price of Bose's proprietary base modules to find out that this just comes down to milking you for more money once you're locked into their ecosystem so you can eat it bows at least it's stylish though like the all-new LTT tracksuit from ltdstore.com it's poly cotton Blended God it looks good Bose has a pretty established look at this point black mesh with the Bose logo on top if you've seen one you've kind of seen most of them the finish on the plastic feels nice though the whole device is small and sleek and it just over over 2.2 by 4 by 23.4 inches and 4.3 pounds while mounting it should be a breeze though I suspect most people are just going to set it down on their console like we did especially since the paid mounting service costs almost as much as the sound bar itself I'm not gonna lie this is about the least impressed that I have ever been by a why are you all buying this thing product we're going to talk about some better options in a bit here but first let's take a break from what I think and talk about why you guys keep buying these with over 7 500 ratings on Amazon this sound bar averages 4.5 stars with a whopping 74 percent of you giving it a full five stars in spite of my complaints y'all are pretty happy with it let's start with the Positive then our five-star crowd loves how easy it is to set up how well the dialogue enhancer Works especially for seniors or those who are hard of hearing and they love how much of an upgrade it is over their TV speakers moving on to the four star gang they mostly agreed actually saying that it bumps up the perceived volume that having both Arc and Optical connections is nice and that the sound quality is good however even in the four star crowd almost every review comes with a caveat of some sort there's an included optical cable but not HDMI it's easy to set up but the sound is mediocre it's an improvement over my last sound bar or my TV but it's not as good as I was expecting considering that it's nearly three hundred dollars and it comes from Bose a well-known company and as we keep moving down we find some pretty reasonable complaints from in my humble opinion the people who probably know home audio a little bit better than the wow it's better than nothing five stars crowd for example we saw criticisms about the lack of EQ settings other than dialogue criticisms about the poor performance at high volumes and the lack of bass we saw critiques of the lackluster remote that is all stuff that we experienced and I think people were pretty fair about it but we didn't experience audience though was overheating whatever our experience with our unit though it's frankly alarming when this many reviews mention it being too hot to touch smelling like burnt plastic and leaving marks on things some units even broke seemingly prematurely with the customers suspecting heat to be the culprit but then even if that wasn't a problem should you buy this thing well if Bose was doing more than just making dialogue more intelligible I'd have no problem with it I'd in fact love to see a version of this product that works with third-party accessories or that can be expanded in the future using it as a center channel in a surround config or something like that but as it is it's a dead end entry-level solution at a price that just doesn't make any sense I'm not even trying to be one of those home theater setups or better than a sound bar at any price Bros but for 280 dollars come on you could pick up almost literally anything and get equally simple setup and dialogue enhancement I mean Amazon this Vizio 2.0 is a better basic option and it costs only 69 dollars nice not that I would necessarily even recommend the cheapest solution a good sound bar is still going to sound better than whatever your next TV and your one after that is going to be and costs only a little bit more the LG s40q for example or the Polk Cigna S2 are only about 130 and 160 dollars respectively and both of them come with a base module in the Box for that price so a subwoofer exactly and if you were going to drink the Bose Kool-Aid anyway you could spend the same amount and get something much better and get something much better I mean we haven't gotten a chance to try all these yet stay tuned because the labs home theater testing room is going to be coming online later this year but on paper the Sony HTS 400 Samsung hwb550 and Vizio V series are all name brand products that are on sale right now and match or beat our Bose sound bar while also including a base module subwoofer right cubose the reality is then if you buy the Bose TV speaker there's a good chance that 74 or whatever it works out too that you are going to be happy with it but our job isn't to tell you what might make you happy it's to help you spend your money wisely and I just don't think the Bose TV speaker holds up especially if you spent more than Fire TV money on your display we tried it for example on an s95b and while the dialogue enhancer did improve over the stock speakers it was not a massive Improvement and it came at the cost of everything but the dialogue unusual conclusion today but do yourself a favor and don't follow the crowd when it comes to sound bars make sure to get something with a sub if
