it is uh in fact there's a bit of yellow Cable in the shot what's that all about no should we leave it there then let's just leave it as a bit of a tease okay what we're looking at then today Steve uh well the Clue's over there um but no I think as we're recording this it's a few days after the 50th anniversary of ethernet um ethernet well it's become the network to rule them all even though it's not a ring Network or anything that was created at Xerox Park like lots of things by uh Bob Metcalfe and others back in 1973 at that time there were lots of different Network Technologies being developed we've talked in another video about Aloha which was the wireless network being created in Hawaii to connect their computers up to Terminals and other machines dotted around the islands but at Park they were interested in creating a local area network a network for connecting computers within a single area perhaps within I think the paper suggests around a kilometer would be the maximum length and when you actually think about that in terms of distance you think well the kilometers quite a a big distance so for our American friends that's just over half a mile right it's five eighths of a mile but actually when you think about how computers get connected up you can very quickly get even within a single room 40 or 50 meters of cable in this room we've got about 40 computers uh dotted around the places our cyber security lab a cyber physical lab as well um but we can use it as a proxy to think about how much cable we'd actually need let's take these two computers here we'll use the monitors as a proxy rather than actually trying to find the actual devices underneath the desks because they're very small these days they're about a meter apart from Center to Center that's roughly a meter three feet for you people who deal with weird injures and feet so we need a meter cable to connect these to it roughly over here another meter that's two meters to connect three four meters uh no three meters four meters five meters to get here it will take six seven eight nine we need nine meters just to connect the 10 machines on this desk and we're going to continue the cable because they're trying to do it with a single cable and we'll see why in a second so we need to continue it here there's probably another three or four meters 13 meters and then 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22. so we need 22 meters to connect the computers over on this side of the room there's the same over in that side of the room so that's another 22 meters of cable that's 44 meters and then what let's say that's five meters so we need about 50 meters of cable I mean that's assuming we can put them a meter apart when you're dealing with some of the original ethernets there was rules that say you actually have to have them two meters two and a half meters apart so actually when you're thinking about the cable snaking around the whole room or a whole building a kilometer isn't actually that long if we go to a diagram what do you think about how we can connect computers up if we've got two computers then connecting it up is quite straightforward we can put a cable between the two this machine let's call this a can talk to machine B let's add a third machine machine to see getting imaginative see for computer well let's say we want to connect C up to the other two machines as well now we could add another cable let's connect C to B now B can talk to A and B can talk to C but I can't talk to see directly it could send a message to B and B could then pass it on but it can't talk directly if you wanted to talk directly then we'd have to add another cable in so we now need three cables three machines let's add in a fourth machine and I'm sure you can guess what this one's going to be yep that's right it is d I should have gone for E just to sort of number four yeah number four just to really trigger some people we can do the same thing again we connect this up now it can talk to machine a but it can't talk to any others directly we can connect it up to machine C and then connect up to machine B and we now need one two three four five six cables to connect four machines and as you add more machines if you want everything to be able to talk to everything else directly then the number of cables goes up um if you had another one you would need another three Cat four cables adding so you've got ten for five machines if you want another one you've got 15 for six machines and so on you get an explosion of cables which would also come with an explosion of sockets on the back of the machine and by the end of it your machine will be huge because you've just got sockets on it to connect every other machine and then let's see able to actually plug another machine in you've got to add another socket for some applications having a mesh like that fully connected mesh like that is really useful so what most networks do is rather than directly connect everything they share a medium they share some access media that they can then speak over and so the idea in Ethernet uh was that rather than having each machine directly connected to each other as so what they would do is they have a single cable and you need to terminate it at each end and then you would connect each machine to that cable so we had machine a and that's connected to the cable machine B and then we have machine C and machine D and we can connect that to the cable as well we now have every machine connected to every other machine and machine a you can send a message over that cable to machine C no problem machine so you can send a message over it to machine B Machine B you can send one to machine a or to machine D the problem now is how do we make sure that two machines aren't transmitting at the same time how do we make sure that where machine I use transmission the machine being machine C don't try and transmit at the same time because if they do it'd be like two people speaking at the same time you'd end up with a confusing yeah because I'm talking at the same time and no one can hear what's actually being said so we have to do what's called media Access Control how do we make sure that a can transmit and then it can be received by everyone the advantage of this is that if you wanted to add another machine onto the network let's add machine e over here then it's dead easy we can just so take the cable to that machine ADD it in and it can talk to everything over the same shared medium the beauty of what came in the original ethernet specification that was proposed in 1973 and the uh Xerox memo that's um wonderfully zero sensitive I think this was released at ethernet at 30 at least that's what it says on the back of the PDF that we've got here so this memory describes how they were thinking about how they would solve the media Access Control problem how do you make sure that only one machine is transmitting at the same time I made a joke at the beginning about this bit not being a ring Network ethernet as it's laid out here is a bus Network we have one long piece of wire which is commonly referred to as a bus in computer science uh Hardware terms and everything is connected to that interestingly there's a wonderful bit in the memo about why it's called ether and not cable net or I'm using the the alto Aloha Network because they did borrow quite a few ideas from Aloha which had come out a couple of years earlier Bob had the foresight to say that while we may end up using coaxial cable to carry our broadcast Transmissions it seems wise to talk of an ether going back to the idea of The Ether which electromagnetic signals traveled through back in the sort of late 19th yeah late 19th century ideas about how things worked of course now we know it doesn't quite work along those ideas but the name stuck it seems wise to talk in terms of an ether rather than the cable for as long as possible this will keep things General and who knows what other media will prove better than cable for a broadcast network maybe radio or telephone circuits radio wireless wi-fi modern Wi-Fi is based in part on ethernet power wiring we have power based ethernet things frequency Multiplex cable TV cable modems for transmitting things microwaves or any combination of that it really is quite insightful about whether 50 years of networking is going to go there's a wonderful diagram of what if I predict in the 1970s but of course you already had Aloha running over in Hawaii so perhaps it isn't that surprising so their idea would be that you'd create your network with a single piece of cable um this isn't the sort of Xerox Park ethernet that we've got here this is the sort of what came a bit later on after it had been standardized and sort of adopted by everyone in the early 80s this is what's called 10 base five and so you'd have a huge cable and the idea would be that you would have this running around the building running in the ceiling uh and the specification I think meant that you would maybe hook computers every two and a half meters apart from it so you'd have that and then you'd have devices like this which would physically puncture the cable and if I just take it to bits we can sort of see what's going on um so we've got a circuit board here this is the transceiver that actually talks to it and it connects to the computer there we'll come to that in a second but if we lift that off for now we can see that there are three spikes and they're quite sharp sitting um there and these go through and on the other side they puncture the actual cable two of them are going into the screening on the character cable and then one goes all the way through to the actual signal wire in the middle and so that enables it to make a connection without having to break the cable which gives you good signal Integrity um and just makes things I want so easier to do because putting these things on was probably a nightmare but compared to having to sort of splice the cable put connectors on it was relatively straightforward of course later you had 10 base 2 which did do that use T pieces and connect things together so you'd have your connection to the ethernet to the cable there and then you'd have your transceiver sitting on top of it which of course is now connected through to that table by the connections here interestingly this designs is a digital one you can put the circuit board on either way depending on whether you want the cable to come out the left or the right at this part of the circuit will take the data from the computer and modulate it into the format that was transmitted over the actual cable and it also did a few other things as we'll come to and look at in a second so this is the actual bit that would then sit on top of it I like that and then you would have a cable so this would be in your ceiling void or under the floor perhaps you wouldn't have this sort of running behind the computer I mean these are actually referred to colloquially as vampire chats because obviously you've got sort of pins piercing into the ethernet cable to suck the data out a bit like Dracula piercing your neck to suck the blood out I guess is the sort of idea behind that what you then have is a drop cable like so which would connect onto there so this is a 15 Pin cable and it's got locking connectors on it so once you've connected it you can't get it off and that's got the transmit and receive from the data that's on here back over a couple of Twisted Pairs and it's got Collision detection we'll come to that in a second and Power for this device these were designed so that if the power went off they would just not be there effectively electrically equivalent and then you would connect this back to the back of your computer and you'd have your network card and then you would plug that in like so and so your computer was then on the network even when I first started being around the university in the mid 90s um there were still drop cables coming out the ceilings in places and it being used to connect things the other thing you needed to make sure is if a signal is traveling down the cable and it comes to an abrupt end you'd get a reflection back along the same cable which of course would interfere with the data it's not attached to anything if it's not attached to anything so if you just said it like that you'd get a reflection back because the signals come to an end and it just sort of reflects back so that would sort of absorb the energy and terminate the connection standard coax cable rj8 was a specification for 10 base 5 I'm not sure what they're using Xerox but similar sort of stuff no doubt let's have a look at how they actually solve this problem as soon as you've got some sort of shared medium that machines are communicating over you need some sort of algorithm for one of a better word to decide who can speak when um if you've got a sort of centralized Network which is another way you can build it sort of star network is referred to where everything's connected back to a central point that can arbitrate and only transmit data or receive data from one or send a signal down it's your turn to send anything you could do things like that if you've got a ring Network and you can pass things around as it goes from one machine to another a token that goes around a bit like you do on an old single track Railway to only allow one engine train to be on that bit of the line at time you have a token that is collected by the train as it goes past and then deposited at the other end to make sure there's only one thing at a time with ethernet with the approach we've taken there they had a distributed algorithm so there's no Central Point except the cable they've got a distributed algorithm that the machines use based on some principles that are neatly outlined in Bob's memo to decide whether a machine can transmit and these are sort of based on what was done at Aloha because that had been put the size it was shown to be working but they modified it because they were based on a cable the way Aloha worked if you go back to the video is that it transmitted and received on different radio frequencies so machine couldn't receive Transmissions from other machines because they're on a completely different frequency from what it was receiving up so if it transmitted at the same time as another machine was transmitting it had no idea about it one of the advantages of everything being on the same cable you can see if something else is being transmitted which we'll come to so let's bring up the paper or the memo again and we get a couple of bits down the whole section on how does the stations transmitter acquire the use of the IFA for a particular transmission but they base it around four or five axioms four or five ideas that they're going to use to make this work the first one is The Ether Axiom as he calls it and that is that The Ether the cable carries Transmissions To All stations so if a machine sends a packet of data it will be received by all stations it's not being sent specifically to see if a transmits something it's sent to everything and then there's address Fields within that which says which machine it's for and they're transmitted first because that way all the other machines can ignore it if they're not interested in it second one the proximity Axiom is the the propagation times basically how far apart the machines are is relatively small so if a is sending something to D it's not going to take too long for it to get there and by not too long millions billionths of a second we're talking about it's all relative when you get down to these things a long time isn't there's a thousands of a second which to a human is quite a short time but it's all relative the next Axiom is a detection Axiom and that states that stations can detect that's the machines on the network at all times Transmissions of other stations so it's not just that they receive it but they can detect whether something else is transmitted as they pass in about one bit's time so as soon as one bit of data from another machine has been transmitted all the other machines on the network should know that that data is being transmitted uh and that something is transmitting on the network so the fourth Axiom is referred to as the deference Axiom and this is where we get to the core of how the algorithm works and we can start to see what's going on so it says while detecting a passing transmission so it's tied into the detection Axiom no worth of station will begin or continue its own transmission and this is really the core the heart of how the system works it later became known as carrier sense multiple access with Collision detection so let's have a think about how it works so the basic property is that any machine can send any message and it's received by all the machines and there's address fields in there that are used to specify who it's going to and it's down to those machines to say oh this is not for me I'll ignore it of course you can put it into what's known as promiscuous mode and see all the traffic that's traveling past on a network like this um so we can get data from any machine to any other but the problem we've got if there's more than one machine wanting to transmit how do we decide who transmits if there's only one machine wanted to transmit then it's fine it just transmits its data it gets sent out over The Ether and it's received by all the machines including hopefully the one that wants to receive it but if there's two machines wanting to transmit then we need some way of arbitrating which one gets access so the first thing is the carrier sense the deference Axiom and it basically says if something else is transmitting don't start transmitting or don't continue your own transmission so basically we're saying if you see something else is speaking on the network if you see someone else who's transmitting don't start transmitting and that will remove a whole load of what we call collisions where two things are trying to talk at the same time um it's a bit like having a conversation you wait until the other person is finished speaking and then say something exactly yeah because that way it doesn't overlap everyone can hear what's saying so we can get rid of a whole other problems there that but he doesn't get rid of all of them let's say we've got machine a transmitting something and machine B and C both want to transmit a packet Okay so we've got machine a transmitting A's transmitting so these defer to it and don't send anything a then stops transmitting machines B and C then say okay the Network's clear I'm going to transmit boom two machines start transmitting at the same time to get a collision so how do we get around that well the key as we said is that these machines can detect if there is a transmission error if there is a collision as we call it and the way that they can do that is that they know what they're sending but because they're also receiving on the stuff from the same network they can compare what they're sending with what's being received and if they're the same everything's fine if they're not the same then there is a problem so what do you do if you take there's been a collision and actually you can know based on the size of the network and the conditions that are there you can measure that you can know that within a certain amount of time but you've acquired the network and the data should barring accidents get transmitted without any problem because once you've sent enough data that the amount of time it will take to propagate around the whole network and then come back to you as past you know that you've got the bus Acquired and you can send everything because all the machines if they follow the algorithm correctly will have detected that you're transmitting and not send anything you can get a situation where if you start sending and machine D is several hundred meters away that by the time you it's it starts transmitting when it's clear you've already started transmitting um and if that happens right at the end of that time period it takes to get there it will take the same time to get back and so it can be potentially twice the distance to propagate the full length of the network so we can get collisions we can detect them so we can then stop transmitting and stop the Collision the next thing that comes up is well how do we then send the data um and the way that they do this is they actually use what's called exponential back off has been termed that afterwards and basically these two machines B and C were trying to transmit and they've detected that a collision has happened how do you decide next well they can't they're not talking to each other because the network is the conversation is the communication media so presumably they've got to kind of pick a random amount of time or something like this right exactly exactly right so what they you do is you say Okay machine's B and C they want to transmit they've detected a collision they say right I've got the dice or something yeah they're basically they'll pick a random number and they will wait that long in seconds but they are they're clever they know what they think actually it's going to be twice the length of Network in Time Danny I'll pick a number between that distance random so I pick a random number and there's various ways you can do that and I will wait that long and then try transmitting again if something else starts transmitting before then well I defer and the whole thing starts again because someone's got in performing um otherwise I will pick a number and wait that time and hopefully and hopefully if they pick random numbers they'll be different so one of them will start transmitting and the data will get through and then the other one will say oh something has to use on the network you can get to the point though where if the network gets busy then you've got lots of machines on it and they're all trying to transmit that your probability of a collision happening even though you've had a collision and they're picking random times become so high the more machines on the network that are trying to transmit the chances that they'll pick the same duration or very similar durations is becomes more likely than not well then what do you do well you get another Collision what those machines then do is they do the same thing again oh we had another Collision just after having a collision we'll pick a random number but this time they double the maximum wait time so if they waited for it to go twice around the network before they'll now wait for it to go four times around the network and if it still collides or you double it again and you go on and until eventually the data gets through and so by using all those different aspects they can get it to the point where without any of the machines and being able to talk need to talk to each other directly they can acquire access to the ether to send the data when they need to now that doesn't guarantee the data is going to be received correctly I mean the machine needs to be switched on um there might still be noise someone might switch a vacuum cleaner on right next to the cable which we can introduce some temporary noise on the system or something that might be a dodgy cable um a connection somewhere which would then corrupt the packet and so you still have to have error checking there and if the machine's Switched Off you're not going to know it hasn't been received unless something extends thing back but it's it can do its best effort it's just what's referred to as the best effort Network at getting the data transmitted and that was how the original ethernet worked I mean originally it ran at three megabits it was designed to connect the Xerox Alto workstations PDP 11s PDP others Novas for together at Xerox Arc but it became incredibly popular it sort of escaped other companies started implementing it and it's quickly certainly by through the 80s and the 90s I mean it wasn't the only networking standards there were others about token ring econet uh what else we had Arc net we were around but it was very much ethernet that won out um probably because it was it wasn't the cheaper option but it just became the standard that people use and the others sort of fell by the wayside and probably because it was easiest to implement or something I don't know why it became popular but it did and these days pretty much all networking connections that we use are based in some form of the original ethernet now that these days they don't use a shared medium there's not masses of ethernet cable running around this building with all the machines attached onto it um one of the big problems with the shared medium Network right Wi-Fi is the more machines you have on there the less bandwidth there is around we talked about this in another video and there's less bandwidth there is around for each machine to communicate um so particularly on wired networks you'll get them to be switch based now but actually all that does is say well okay we have a central point and between the machine and the switch we'll run ethernet but there's only one machine on there so there's not going to be any collisions but we'll send the data in the same way or with the same packet format and different modulations so the speeds increase from three megabits to 10 megabits or 100 megabit to gigabit to 10 gigabit then down to 2.5 and 5 gigabit 25 gigabit 40 gigabit 100 gigabit 400 gigabit whatever we've got to in terms of networking the speeds change the mediums change from rj8 uh 10 base 2 to UTP at CAT5 Cat6 cat7 fiber optics whatever using it and with the switch what happens is you send the packet to the switch and the switch will look at it and say oh this is for this machine and I know that this machine is on this network here on this port here so I'll cue it to go out there at that point and you can get full duplex communication but this is where it began 50 years ago at the time of recording designed around this and yeah it's quite a Nifty algorithm to solve those problems it's not the only one um there's other approaches that people have used we talked about Wi-Fi in another video and that use carrier sense and multiple access but with collision avoidance because as we talked about the hidden node problem you can't always when you're on a radio based Network detect because something might be out of range of where you are but the other approaches that you can use to sort of share access to this shared medium if you're wondering why we've got red and blue ends of the room um well this is because we use this for cyber security amongst other things when we're teaching and so we can do red team blue team the actual rights uh for another purpose which is probably a video on its own they react to the state of the room and I shall leave it at that
