first up is the a donut photo grip which is actually a little more than it looks on first glance the premise is that it'll turn your smartphone camera experience into a professional camera experience so to do that it gives you a pretty meaty grip to hold on to as well as a dedicated shutter button this thing lets you mount your phone onto a tripod or twitch it comes bundled with and what I think is even cooler is that once you've done that even to slide this shutter button out and use it to take photos remotely it also has the bizarre inclusion of a precision stylus within the handle which in theory should help you edit photos easier it is a little bit better than using a finger I honestly just love it when stuff fits together when different parts of a product complement each other and that is exactly what you get here with the my port it's effectively a phone stand but whilst you're hands on it it uses fast 10 watt wireless charging to keep your battery topped up but here's the kicker it's actually not just a stand and a wireless charger the back component can act as its own independent 10,000 milliamp hour power bank and as far as power banks go it's expensive but I like how neatly it ties together it'll charge itself whenever you're using it as a stand and even when you're on the go with it you'll still benefit from the same wireless charging you had when it was docked next up is the Marshall Stockwell - a multi-directional powerhouse of a speaker with a few cool tricks on top of that so there are four things that I think are important here number one this is actually the most portable in their entire lineup designed to be thrown in a bag and not worried about it's made of tough stuff and is built with ipx4 water resistance number two is that it's got bluetooth 5 capability which means massive range but also that you can have multiple hosts so two users let's say you and a friend you could both connect at the same time and let's say take turns playing music 3 has the fact that the battery can give you over 20 hours of play time and the charging speed fast enough that you're actually getting six of those hours in 20 minutes plus it can use that to reverse charge your phone and finally when it comes to audio you've got one large subwoofer on the front and then both front and rear-facing tweeters which high frequencies is a side-by-side versus a smaller speaker [Applause] [Music] it turns out the headphone jack is for more than just headphones as this gadget right here tries to prove all you do with it is if you found yourself in a time of emergency you can pick it up you can put it into the 3.5 ml jack on your smart phone and use it to break glass and of course I had to test it myself first and safe to say it does do the job now you've probably seen a lot of smartphone gimble's but also probably not a lot that of this portable this is the vlog pocket and they weren't kidding it is literally small enough to fit into most jean or jacket pockets i've tried up there with the smallest stabilizers i've ever seen it's also better than i thought it was going to be the application connected instantly and you don't even need to use it you'll get the full stabilization benefits just using your normal camera app but I'd recommend it when using it you can tap a face and your camera will start tracking it you can go for an automatic 360-degree panorama but what I thought was even cooler is that if you tap this ultra wide mode then even if your camera doesn't have an ultra wide lens this thing automatically takes nine different shots and stitches them together to make what can actually look even better at this price with these kinds of dimensions it is really tough to fault on the subject of tools for creators there's this tiny thing here this is the smart mic plus and it allows you to transmit real-time audio into your smartphone using Bluetooth so without any cables you clip this to your clothing and just start recording using their application and your audio will go from sounding something like this to sounding something like this alright so right now I'm testing the audio from the smart mic plus something about 10 meters from the phone right now there's quite a bit of noise coming from over there I see a light up in here it also just before the next product if you do enjoy straight-to-the-point tech content like this a sub would be amazing we're trying to hit three million by the end of 2019 now I'm not sure if the name of use chicken inspires confidence when it comes to you charges but all my doubts were cast aside when I opened this thing aesthetically it's shaped a lot like a macbook charger but whilst it doesn't charge with as much power as that because it doesn't need to it actually feels nicer and comes with a whole lot more features at its core you're looking at a plug they can charge your iPhone or Android device with up to 18 watt it comes with a whole load of worldwide adapters so it can work almost anywhere it's got both a USB a and a USB C port plus a little display to show you what the battery level is because yes this is also a power bank that you can use to you charge your phone on the go with wired and wireless Li next up we've got something that doesn't need much of an explanation it's a fan with six sticky pads and so whilst it can be used on a lot of different surfaces one of the most interesting applications is literally grabbing it and sticking it to the back of your phone there are two power settings and on the top one it really does pack a punch I was tempted to make a really bad pun about it blowing me away but I'll resist it's also got a built-in multicolored LED not really sure why to be honest if you're the kind of person who finds themselves using older wired tech even though every company is pushing for Wireless this thing might make a lot of sense it's a bluetooth receiver with a headphone jack or in other words it can convert your wired audio gear like earphones and speakers into Wireless in terms of the product itself it's just a remote but it's well designed it's made so that your fingers even if this thing was in your pocket can easily feel for where each button is when you hear the word printer you'll probably reminded of one of those products that takes up half your desk and practically eats through your ink this is a little different the e-bot print pen is a portable printer which comes with a whole lot of perks but also two primary compromises you use the app to select what you want to print it could be stickers text or even full-blown photos you've just taken and then with one tap it sends that signal to the pen which you then just press against a surface and you're done what's impressive is that the surface itself is rarely a limitation you can print on paper yes but also wood textiles items of clothing anything that can hold ink and it really comes into its own when you're trying to make personalized gifts but the two things to bear in mind are that you can only have a print in one color at a time and that the entire way this works it strongly favors horizontal content welcome to a clever little holder by company Divi and we're not going to spend too long on this but essentially it clips into anything that this will fit around it uses a pretty elaborate mechanism to make that fit secure and also has a rotating ball to allow for a good amount of movement say hello to energy quite possibly world's most advanced umbrella created to actually make use of all the empty space on traditional umbrellas so there is a battery inside of here I believe it's in a handle and you also get a USB port that comes from the bottom which again lets you use this to charge your phone but trust me when I say this it gets wackier inside the box are solar panels which clipped the top to keep it constantly powered up and get this the umbrella has a physical fan inside presumably to keep you cool during a hot day now although one of the most surprisingly versatile smartphone gadgets the best way I could describe it is the Swiss Army knife of holders you're getting what is effectively a rail which you can use to attach over the entire height of pretty much any modern smartphone and then like something out of a Transformers movie you attach these different parts in a frankly incredible amount of ways it doesn't necessarily look particularly secure but most do it would need quite a pull to tear it apart the Sun disc I expand is a clean-looking wireless charger but with one significant perk this is a product for people who don't really want to rely on online backups what it does is every time you place your smartphone onto it it's not charging with 10 watts of power but at the same time at backing the contents of your phone up to be stored locally on it also thanks to sun disk for sending this one out now as a bit of a bonus we've got this tiny camera it's built primarily for security and monitoring and it can record video in 1080p the idea being that it'll send alerts to your smartphone as soon as it detects any motion but the whole reason for this crazy design is that what you're actually seeing here are ten separate infrared lights which means it cannot just work during the day but also at night - if you enjoyed this video then I've got a massive and growing playlist of smartphone gadgets content so I'll link that and everywhere I can from here my name is Erin and this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
