Amazon is absolutely littered with products with unreadable unrecognizable brand names UI osmuff wheel Lux and kirksen believe it or not it wasn't always like this but where did they all come from are these names simply from some foreign language that doesn't translate well to English the answer to the second question is actually no although many of these off-the-wall Brands you see are from China these brand names are just as fanciful and meaningless there as they are in the English-speaking world but before we get into why that is let's take a step back and explain where these Brands even come from although China is the largest country in the world by population only a few very large companies dominate the online shopping landscape there we're talking companies such as taobao and tmall and if you're a Chinese seller it can be hard to sell on these platforms because there are already so many other folks trying to sell the same product you have so it's unsurprising that Chinese sellers are looking to the American Market instead Amazon gave up on trying to operate a retail website in China as there was just too much competition but Amazon does actively recruit Chinese sellers to Pedal their Wares on the Us website the company even holds huge conferences for folks in China interested in making money on Amazon a practice that began Circa 2015 not only is it a big opportunity for the sellers but it also gives Amazon another source of cheap Goods they can use to undercut competitors like Walmart in the U.S but why does that mean these brands have to use such nonsensical names we'll tell you the reason right after we thank secret lab for sponsoring this video secret lab chairs are engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play their Titan Evo 2022 chair has four-way lumbar support Ultra comfy lines of different seat materials and more all chairs come with up to a five-year extended warranty and a 49-day return policy so head to the link in the description and check out secret lab today the reason these names are so Random is that it makes it much easier for these Brands to obtain a trademark which is extremely important for selling on Amazon you see Amazon has a program called the brand registry which provides sellers with important benefits such as reduced fees cash back a campaign asking customers to leave trusted reviews and notably help with marketing and advertising on the site but to participate in the brand registry a seller has to have a registered trademark as one of Amazon's goals in having a brand registry is to cut down on counterfeit goods and it's usually very easy to get a trademark approved that's a nonsense word or just a string of random letters as it's unlikely that some other company is already using that trademark this way they can avoid the arduous process of getting a trademark approved that's too similar to a different company's existing brand based on a word that makes sense in fact the US patent and trademark office has complained of being flooded with more of these trademark applications than they can actually handle and even though one of the main reasons companies typically register a trademark is so that they can build a strong identifiable brand that one can pronounce that isn't really necessary for many product categories on Amazon sure if you're looking for a stand mixer you might think KitchenAid or you might trust Yeti if you're looking for an insulated bottle but if you just need a pair of scissors a garden hose or a bowl for your dog these aren't items where a dominant brand has mine share with the public instead good reviews will get the product pushed to the top of the Amazon results which is what will drive sales far more than memorable branding but even though buying from one of these Brands might seem like a good idea to save money please make sure you check to see that there are reviews that sound like they're from real people Amazon hasn't had a very good track record of cracking down on fake reviews or ensuring that these products are properly labeled and meet U.S safety standard though Amazon claims that this is something they continue to work on so try not to get sucked in just by a cool design and a good price although I will say the Allure of this lumilu unicorn fanny pack it's hard to resist hey thanks for watching that whole video guys like it if you liked it dislike it if you disliked it check out our other videos comment below with video suggestions and don't forget to subscribe and follow especially if you've got a wacky name that's hard to pronounce I want to see I want to see those
