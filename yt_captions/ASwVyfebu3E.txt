[Music] the mic oh right underneath the camera i haven't done one of these in a minute oh wow matching wallpapers oh what if i can that's awesome hey what's up guys i'm kbhd here you guys just heard that intro music shout out to tony syl he is doing 36 new songs or sharing 36 new songs in 36 days that was one of them they've all been pretty sick they're on his youtube channel so i'll link it below check him out one of the most underrated nicest guys in music good stuff so here we are i'm taking a page out of peter mckinnon's playbook which was just his tweet last night that you can do a q a while still practicing social distancing so that's what i'm going to do the studio is empty here i'll take a video here we see an empty mkbhd studio in 8k on the galaxy s20 ultra that's what you guys look like look at that focus so i've made the choice that at least for the foreseeable future we'll stay on the safe side and make sure no one has to travel to get to the studio so i'm here solo but i asked on twitter what you guys wanted to know and uh it's time for q a also i'm just realizing that tagging him in my tweet my q a tweet means all of your thousands of questions that are responses to it also got sent to him sorry about that peter uh maybe he'll use some of your questions for his video who knows anyway i just want to say i know i haven't spoken up a lot about the virus and all the turmoil that has surrounded it in the world mainly because i'm not an expert i'm not a healthcare professional or a doctor so i'm getting all my information from others as you should be you shouldn't get information from me so i'm in the us i'm listening to the cdc i'm listening to trusted experts but if i could echo their best advice wash your hands sanitize them stay socially distanced that's the smart thing to do to try to flatten the curve and prevent the spread of the virus i think i'll leave any links in the description that may be helpful to those of you who are just wondering about it but generally be responsible take care of yourself to take care of others so that being said let's see if you guys have any good questions on twitter oh yeah okay right off the bat did you get any threats from escobar inc uh no i haven't gotten any communication from them at all which is probably the story with a lot of people now there was a quick update uh briefly their website was down and a lot of people were sending it to me the night after i made my video screenshots of it i tried going to their website it was also down uh but then like a half a day later it came back and it looks like they're still taking orders so if you were considering ordering one don't obviously oh okay interesting what are your total watch hours from your viewers i think i can just look that up actually so the number is 7.4 billion billion 7.4 billion minutes in the last 12 years of videos hey google what's 7.4 billion minutes in hours 7 400 million minutes is equal to 1.233 times 10 to the eight hours uh hey google what's seven point four billion minutes in days seven billion four hundred million minutes is equal to five point one three nine times ten to the six days hey google what's 7.4 billion minutes in years here's a summary from the website researchmaniacs.com let's start with how you would write 7.4 billion with numbers only one 7 400 million and this is how you would write 7.4 billion with letters only two hey siri what's 7.4 billion in years 14 069.8 years nice okay what do you most want from the new iphones this year for me it's night mode it is a super cool feature to have on your phone cool uh yeah i think there's just a couple of main things i want out of iphone 12 for 2020. number one it's got to be higher fresh rate display i'm hoping for 120 hertz this is something that you know this is going to be an expensive phone when it comes out and if you spend this much money on your phone having high refresh rates seems like mandatory so 120 hertz screen then two i would love to have usb type c while i know it's not the most likely thing to happen i would really love to get rid of some of my last non-usb type-c chargers and maybe come with a fast charger in the box and then three just an overall generally updated design get rid of this huge notch about the front while i know it's housing a bunch of the face id sensors actually that ties into the other thing i would change which is adding touch id back i think apple tends to be that company that waits to do something correctly instead of being first on the bandwagon we've got a bunch of underglass fingerprint sensors now so i would love to see them do just a giant bottom third of the screen huge thumb press and that just reads your fingerprint touch ideas back on these phones and you can get rid of the huge notch so new design touch id under the glass usb type-c and uh just a generally much better screen okay so which selfie camera do you think in a smartphone is most practical they have a oneplus 7 pro with the pop-up camera and they want to know my stance on cutouts notches and pop-up cameras so i would almost make that like a tier list so you got you have a through f or whatever and f is like not having one but d tier for me honestly is like if you have a thick bezel which in 2020 is not a good look or if you just have like a giant notch and no real reason for a giant notch and c tier would be like a reasonable notch or you know the teardrop notches that that could be in c tier then b tier is your hole punch cutouts so the small ones you know what you got on like galaxy s20 uh whether it's in the corner or the center not a huge deal for me i think i like it more in the center but generally they take up the least amount of space and they don't interrupt the content as much so i'll say a tier is the hole punch cut out but my other hot take that i shared on twitter before was i really like pop-up cameras as an a tier selfie camera the main biggest possible downside for it would be it's a moving part but we haven't really seen anyone reach that moving part limit yet which is great and then possibly less waterproofing but even some of the phones with pop-up cameras have a little seal around the bottom that dramatically improves water resistance so it's not the end of the world for water and dust if you have a pop-up camera and then there's all the benefits you get a full screen display you don't have a selfie camera when you don't need it it pops up fast enough to do face unlock if you want to do that but you probably don't have to and best of all when it's retracted inside your device it's being blocked so you can't have someone hack into and using your front-facing camera when you don't need them using it so a little security advantage too so a tier for me is the pop-up cameras and the punch outs and if we had like a future possible s tier that would of course be getting the selfie camera behind the glass invisible so it's always available but never interrupting the content but we don't really have those yet maybe that's something we could see in the next iphone if the tech is ready but that's the question is would they be would they be first to some tech like that probably not we'll probably see it on the way to the next next iphone all right this guy just tweeted brownlee just check out this just check this out and it's uh the tcl rollable phone concept okay so i've had my eye on this and i've thought about it a lot since we first saw it for those who don't know tcl in new york city not too long ago i wish i got to be there but they showed a bunch of concept foldable smartphone modular designs just because they can't so while there were a lot of working phones technically there as far as i know none of these were actually slated to come out as real phones but there was everything from this this triple folding display that makes like a w shape and you can fold it up like a xylophone and it's got three panes when it's open just wild stuff like that uh tcl figured they'd just make a bunch of them and be first to it and if they get good response maybe they'll make them later but the one that really caught my eye and we talked about this on the waveform podcast was this rollable like scroll like display so and this one wasn't even a real this working screen it was just paper like a fake screen on top but the id was still there that you could have a regular size smartphone with a full size display looking totally normal that you use on a regular basis and when you want to expand it to a bigger screen you just pull it out and from behind this extra screen appears and now you have this larger display that you just peeled out like a scroll actually now that i think about it it was really difficult to explain on the podcast but seeing it and seeing some demos of it uh really got the gears turning like maybe foldable isn't the only way to use these flexible displays to put a bigger screen in a smaller form factor this whole rolling thing i don't know if it's not possible yet with a screen on it or if it would just damage the screen too much but i don't know i would like to see an actual working device do that so this really got the gears turning because of course for me the whole point of having these big flexible screens is hey big screen small pocket fold it up it fits that's that's the general point so the triple screen one doesn't really make as much sense to me just because that's still gonna be a huge thick boy phone when you try to fold it and put it in your pocket it looks cool but it's also not super useful that's form over function but this rollable screen one looked interesting and i'll pass that actually to you guys in the comments section would you rather have a rollable display or a foldable display just on what you've seen on that foldable display concept all right someone asked how's the new studio coming along also advice for an upcoming tech youtuber cheers uh yeah the studio is coming along great i posted a couple updates on twitter and instagram so far if you want to check those out i i would go shoot down there now if i wasn't trying specifically to be social distancing responsibly we're going to have some blackout shades in there and a lot of blinds we're going to have some new light switches we're gonna have fiber internet in there gigabit internet that's pretty sick and that just acoustic treatment is the number one thing for us to worry about for the entire space so slowly but surely all right here's a here's a potential sad one or great one opinions on the upcoming canon eos r5 and would you purchase it i want to just say yes so a lot of us camera nerds have been following this but if you haven't there are rumors and partially confirmed rumors now that canon is working on a new eos r called the r5 it's going to be a pro level camera it's going to have 8k video with advanced autofocus and it's going to have all these pro features and be an amazing video camera and that's about all they told us is that that's what they're working on matter of fact peter mckinnon has probably seen more of this than anyone he's held one uh and talked to canon about it but generally i want to be excited about it but i also know canon and if you've followed canon stuff you know there's always a catch there's always a great camera all the great specs but this horrible thing like i have a canon eos r love that camera for a lot of stuff great video quality but huge crop and this has happened with other cameras the 1dx mark iii is awesome but proprietary memory cards this happens a lot i'm nervous about what that hitch is going to be for the eos r5 is it going to be 20 000 or is it going to be record limit at 8k or overheating problems or crop or autofocus what is what is it going to be so i'm hesitant to get excited about it but kind of like the red comodo we don't really know that much about it so i'll keep my fingers crossed all right i'm going to end it with actually i had some questions for you guys that i pulled you on on twitter two things one was just straight up how many of you guys have a case on your phone you might have seen this in one of the last videos and if i was guessing i would have said something maybe a little over 50 50. i know cases are popular but surely not everyone has a case right but just of this audience 80 of you have a case on your phone which means in the rest of the world i'm sure it's even higher so that was pretty interesting and then the other question i asked you guys was what is your phone volume set to is it volume on silent or vibrate and i literally never have my volume on as far as my ringtone i don't even know what my ringtone sounds like most of the time and so far the poll is running right now on twitter but so far vibrate is winning but uh that could change as the rest of the votes fill in but i just i don't know i like learning about these behaviors that i sort of take for granted and then actually ask you guys about and figure out the answer is totally wild like why did 25 of you have your volume on all the time why i don't get it what why is it always on so anyway that's been it thank you for the q a hopefully you guys are staying safe out there and by out there i mean in there because you're staying home and yeah i guess let's just let's just let these internet videos be our little safe haven for entertainment while we're you know self-quarantining basically and keeping the world safe thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace
