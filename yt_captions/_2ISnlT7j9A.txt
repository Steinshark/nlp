let me ask a silly question but we'll say it with a straight face impossible so let me mention Elon Musk what are your thoughts about he's more you're more on the physics theory side of things he's more in the physics engineering side of things and in terms of SpaceX efforts what do you think of his efforts to uh get off this planet well I think he's the other guy who's sent me serious about getting off this planet I think they're two of us were semi-serious about getting off the planet what do you think about his methodology and yours when you look at them don't and I don't be against you because like I was so excited that like your top video is reycarts file and then I did your podcast and we had some chemistry so it's oom DUP yeah and I thought okay I'm gonna betray her sauce so just as I'm coming up on Ray Kurzweil you're like and now Alex Friedman special Elon Musk and he blew me out of the water so I don't want to be petty about I want to say that I don't could I am yeah okay okay the funny part he's not taking enough risk like he's trying to get us to Mars imagine that he got us to Mars the moon and we'll throw in Titan and know we're good enough the diversification level is too low now there's a compatibility first of all I don't think he Lana's serious is about Mars I think Elon is using Mars as a narrative as a stories and or make them to make the moon jealous it makes them I think he's using it as a story to organize us to reacquaint ourselves with our need for space our need to get off this planet it's a concrete thing he's shown that many people think that he's shown that he's the most brilliant and capable person on the planet I don't think that's what he showed I think he showed that the rest of us have forgotten our capabilities so he's like the only guy who has still kept the faith and is like what's wrong with you people so you think the lesson we should draw from Elon Musk is there's a is a capable person within within a lot of us you own make sense to me in what way he's doing what any sensible person should do he's trying incredible things and he's partially succeeding partially failing to try to solve the obvious problems before uh yeah you know but he comes up with things like you know I got it we'll come up with a battery company but batteries aren't sexy so well we'll make a car around it like great you know or any one of a number of things Elon is behaving like a same person and I view everyone else's insane and my feeling is is that we really have to get off this planet we have to get out of this we have to get out of the neighborhood don't linger on a little bit do you think that's a physics problem or an engineering problem he's a cowardice problem I think that we're afraid that we had four hundred hitters of the mind like Einstein and Dirac and that that era is done and now we're just sort of copy editors so it's some of it money like if we become brave enough yeah go outside the solar system can we afford to financially well I think that's not really the issue the issue is look what Elon did well he amassed a lot of money and then he you know he plowed it back in and he spun it spun the wheel and he made more money and now he's got a few money now the problem is is that a lot of the people who have a few money are not people whose middle finger you ever want to see I want to see II Long's middle finger I want to see what I mean by that or like when you say it I'm gonna do the biggest close do whatever the you want Yeah right you anything that gets in his way that he can afford to push out of his way and you're saying he's not actually even doing that enough no I mean he's not going please I'm gonna go Elon is doing fine with his money I just want him to enjoy himself have the most you know Diane Issa you know but you're saying Mars is playing it he doesn't know how to do anything else he knows rockets yeah and he might know some physics at a fundamental level yeah I guess okay just let me just like go right back to it how much physics do you really how much brilliant breakthrough ideas on the physics side do you need to get off this planet I don't know and I don't know whether like in my most optimistic dream I don't know whether my stuff gets us off the planet but it's hope it's hope that there's a more fundamental theory that we can access that we don't need you know whose elegance and beauty will suggest that this is probably the way the universe goes like you have to say this weird thing which is this I believe and this I believe is a very dangerous statement but this I believe I believe that my theory points the way now Elon might or might not be able to access my theory I don't know I don't know what he knows but keep in mind why are we all so focused on you on it's really weird it's kind of creepy to what he's just a person who's just asking the the obvious questions and doing whatever he can but he makes sense to me you sent craig venter makes sense to me Jim Watson makes sense to me but we're focusing on Elon because he somehow is rare well that's the weird thing like we've come up with a system that eliminates all Elon from our pipeline and Elon somehow snuck through when they were quality adjusting everything you know you
