the three weeks when it is really soon that's actually a question I wanted to ask you um can you tell us a bit about your plans for the Keynote of course it has a little bit to do with the book I don't just want to show random content from the book I actually wanted to make this a little keynote to talk okay so uh my personal opinion is that indeed in the zip Community we are way too much leaning on features and language details I would love that we talk more about soft design and I hope I make a very strong point for that um convince people that have to design is actually the thing that you should think about first before we then talk about the implementation details so structure and softly design for me are actually the basis for a successful project so this is what the keynote will be about
