ladies and gentlemen I have an incredible piece of content for you today you see chess AI has been better than human beings for over 25 years since the Year 1997 when deep blue defeated Gary kosparov who was the best player in the world at the time and widely regarded by many as the goat since then the Gap has only gotten bigger AI embarrasses human beings in chess every day but we humans persevere and also humans are perverted we are demented we are deviant so we have now created chess artificial intelligence Bots that play the worst move mathematically possible on the chessboard at any given moment a couple of months ago I made a video called the worst chess game mathematically possible where we pair two of these AIS against each other but in today's video we have a human being taking on the worst fish bot which was a human invention and uh this is going to really blow your mind let's jump into the game so I was scrolling on Reddit one morning like we always do when we lay in bed and I saw this game by a person named cautious seat who is getting an honorary Grandmaster title and he's playing against worse fish who does doesn't really have an ELO all worst fish does is play the worst move at the board at any given on the board at any given moment so that first move is G4 the grob is actually the worst move according to stockfish according to any top engine that you could possibly play the good news is cautious seat who is a 2 000 rated player responds in turn with the move G5 this is called the double grub it's a not a very original name and now white has many moves but the worst move by far is Knight to H3 what's interesting is that the move F4 which loses a pawn in front of the king is actually not according to stockfish it's even worse so worst fish maybe isn't as good I mean I don't know because Knight to H3 seems like a very bad move but F4 is considered a bad move as well and here black plays H5 so already very weird stuff now how do you actually defeat the worst AI right I mean that's that should be easy defeat the worst AI you play the best move it plays the worst moves yeah but anybody can do that even the local chimpanzee at a zoo can do that so Knight to F4 that is definitely the worst move in the position because it loses a knight right there is no other way for white to lose any material here other than playing the move Knight to F4 and cautious seat plays Pawn takes F4 okay Pawn takes F4 because you want to be up a little bit of material and now white plays F3 and the point of F3 is that black should now proceed to take or to play in the center with the move E5 and at this point worst fish would just get mated right it would just allow a Checkmate it would go here and allow Queen takes H4 uh Queen H4 mate uh but our protagonist cautious seat is a very intelligent individual and plays H4 do you know why they did that so that the computer could not blunder Checkmate that was very brilliant actually because worst fish is programmed to self-destruct so by preventing it from self-destructing it now has to play chess against you right and the worst move in the position here for white one of many is just to Simply develop it doesn't change anything and it allows H3 which would force the bishop back and after E5 white would be in Dire Straits and that's exactly what he what what cautious he does he plays E5 but G5 now another very bad move giving up upon giving up an attack on the bishop at which point again Black's attack would be simply too much but we are trying to beat the worst AI in the world we are not trying to bully the worst AI in the world it's a conundrum how do you defeat something that is trying to lose fascinating stuff F5 now the computer plays King F2 because it's not supposed to develop any pieces it's just supposed to make the worst move possible but what it was not prepared for was cautious C doing the exact same thing King to F7 also developing its king to G1 making the evaluation even worse King to G7 and at this point worst fish says take my Pawn you idiot please and actually taking the Pawn's not even the best move the best move is H3 obviously and queen G5 because in chess you are supposed to win but how are you really supposed to win if one side is trying to lose are you actually a winner if you help the other person get their desired result you see normally what you don't understand my friends is you are playing a chess game against the person that wants to win and by winning against somebody that wants to win you take away their desired result but what if you play somebody that wants to lose then is beating them the right result or is losing to them the right result it's a fascinating conundrum D6 the computer goes back with the King because it's not supposed to develop any pieces and now it moves its Queen one square taking away its own King's oxygen and basically saying please capture my king Knight to H5 cautious seat is not to be denied develops the bishop undevelops the bishop back to the home Square now by playing like this B4 at some point caution at some point the computer is going to get a little bit frustrated and it's not going to continue repeating moves back and forth so it just plays Pawn to B4 once again H3 and queen H4 is simply winning for black but Bishop to E6 is played now the computer undevelops the bishop to H1 and white just proceeds with the move B5 Rook to E8 centralizing The Rook in the center of the board not doing anything in particular undevelops the bishop undevelops the king you will also notice that worse fist just played Pawn to C3 and in this position gives its Queen up for absolutely free like this and after King to h8 not only does it give its you would think giving up the queen for the bishop would be enough it gives away the queen completely Queen to E6 and this move is the worst move on the board because it helps black develop Queen to E6 is literally it's worse than Queen D5 apparently because after Bishop takes D5 the position is minus 10 11 and and apparently here it it's it's it's minus nearly 12. apparently the bishop serves better here than here I I I don't I don't get it I don't know anyway Queen E6 played Bishop E6 and now we just go back to G8 Knight G7 and worst fish gives up yet another piece Pawn takes C5 now this might not be interesting to you but it should be it should be interesting to you because like I said this entire game is a puzzle all chess is is a puzzle it's a bunch of problem solving it's a bunch of critical thinking how do you beat somebody that wants to lose well C4 Queen takes D2 this is the way you start but guess what worst fish is not going to take your queen because it's not programmed to take your queen white plays King Rook F1 it's now officially the first M on the board M7 which is probably a type of BMW now we play Pawn to H3 of course white should fight for their life but instead they play Rook to G1 and now it is M2 Bishop to H4 King F1 and any of these moves E4 however now is there a faster way to blunder a Checkmate here Bishop F1 and now it's E3 mate Pawn to E3 what a move Bishop F1 Rook G1 the configuration the square is taken away from the King Pawn takes F3 now the computer blunders Checkmate in one again Queen takes E2 or does it blunder it's not blundering of course it's not blundering because it's literally programmed to self-destruct Queen all the way back to d8 it still finds a way to get checkmated in two moves if the queen comes back and then takes the pawn to F2 remember what we are trying to do is we are trying to get worse fish to play our game we are trying to program something that is always going to play the least intuitive and the stupidest move on the board to play our game E4 on possum is possible it takes now the best move in this position is King takes G1 because after King takes G1 it's Checkmate in three F's or queen D4 Bishop takes and a back rank checkmate but the worst move on the board is not to take the Queen the worst move on the board is to play King to E2 now it's made here it's made here it's made here not in one and two and one and whatever but now Queen C8 the computer plays King to F3 we take another one of its Pawns what is black doing what does cautious seat doing in this position the king moves again excuse me the Knight moves again and now Queen takes G2 and Bishop to G5 is a Checkmate Bishop to G5 is Checkmate it won't move after that D7 just waiting Bishop F1 now Knight E5 is made Queen takes Knight is made in a couple of moves but now we play Pawn takes E4 giving white a couple of options so King takes E4 is made in three Knight takes E4 is made in one and King to G4 is main one so obviously the computer is going to play one of one of those moves because they're both tied it goes here why does it go there because better to not take anything it's better not take anything but it goes here now Bishop D6 if you hear any noise by the way my downstairs neighbors are on their second month of construction in their apartment it doesn't it doesn't even sound like they're renovating anything it just sounds like people come there and they just turn onto Jackhammer and then they leave so if you hear that if you don't hear anything that's okay maybe I just need professional help Rook to E1 now Queen the G3 mate on the board my friends here we go if you haven't clicked off the video yet you better not because how are we going to defeat worst fish how are we going to give it the undesirable result that it wants King to G5 once again black plays Pawn to F3 now white has many many moves many moves but most of them lead to some sort of Checkmate in one king to H6 voluntarily walking into a Checkmate like this Bishop to G3 missing it by a square Pawn to B6 it's trying to give away all of its pieces and it's trying to Checkmate itself Rook to E5 now it's over Bishop F4 Queen D2 Rook H5 a million different checkmates but this is actually brilliant Rook to E5 is the most brilliant move that cautious seat could have played allow me to explain the point is that now white is stalemated white has no way of running around anything else all white is going to do is Chuck all of its pieces and that my friends that is exactly what cautious seed is going to utilize Pawn to A3 multiple moves are made in one but that's not the goal Rook C1 now we take the pawn on B6 that pawn has been captured white plays A4 because the objective is to just get checkmated or stalemated if you run out of moves but a stalemate is not the desirable not a desirable result for black pawn to H2 Rook to D1 we make another queen black now has a 41 Point material advantage three extra Queens multiple extra Knights multiple extra Bishops and Rooks and pawns Rook to A1 Bonzer B5 remember it's not going to take the pawn because that's one of the best moves Rook to D1 we've removed yet another Pawn from worst fish on the board and now we go B5 why are we going B5 because now our pawns can March together because we know it's not going to capture any of our pieces and we also know this has no legal moves this is no legal moves this is no legal moves so it's just about these three pieces but we also know that worst fish is not going to take anything A3 A5 A2 B3 B2 and now just a big moment here A4 do you know why because we don't want to force it to take we do I don't think you understand how absolutely brilliant this is black is doing this in a way that white has squares to move to that don't have anything to capture you see if you Corner your opponent and now they start sacrificing you don't get the maximum type of victory in the game A4 A3 you know it's not going to take any of your pieces B1 Queen you know it's not going to take any of your pieces Knight B1 Knight B1 right it just needs empty space now you take why do you take because you know it's not going to take any of your pieces have you lost the objective of the game are you wondering why we haven't delivered a mate in one that's not the point those of you watching this who are smart understand the point Rook F1 win the B7 Queen to A8 Pawn to A2 my friends we now remove the last Pawn on the board that had a legal move potentially in the future the pawn on G6 is not going anywhere A1 Queen black is now up 70 points of material black has six extra Queens black has two extra Knights one extra Bishop two extra pawns multiple multiple other pieces E3 the pawns are going C4 those of you who are Keen we you understand the objective Rook A1 can be captured by no less than three queens potentially Queen C7 the bishop is not going to take the queen it's not going to take the queen it keeps moving around Rook to D3 Queen to H3 Rook to D6 now it becomes a queen Dance all right becomes a queen dance you're looking for the right move you notice that that worse fish is trying to lose its Rook it's trying to lose its Rook like five different ways but it's not allowed to take anything because taking something would be a better move than not taking something which would therefore lose the piece E2 this is incredible stuff this is other worldly stuff Rook to D5 we Shuffle we Shuffle we try to find an opportunity we try to find a breakthrough Queen to D1 F2 F1 Queen there it is we now have a 94 Point material advantage black has a monstrous wall of Queens this is absolutely insane stuff black has promoted every possible Pawn one two three four five six seven eight nine they have nine Queens there's a queen to start with every single Pawn has promoted to a queen Rook A3 windy but now my friends how does black win we've made it this far but how does black win the game where's the checkmate do you understand where we're going with this Queen A6 it should be seven we take the Rook we now have a 99 Point material advantage but how are we gonna win this game Bishop here win A5 what's the plan well I think what we have to realize is the second that we allow one of these two pieces to move they will once you move the Knight this is going to go here you better not stalemate white you better not take the final piece so in this position black finds an opportunity to maneuver their pieces in such a way around the board Bishop to E6 Queen A7 Bishop F5 this is it in this position black defeats worst fish not Queen F5 which would be a stalemate not Rook F5 which would be stalemate not Rook H4 which would be a Checkmate no in this position black plays Knight takes F5 check the King goes back and now in this position with a check made in one Checkmate in one a check made in one a check made in one a check made in one and many many other checkmates black plays Knight D6 check removing the knight from the defense of the square the king walks up and in this position cautious C with a 102 Point material advantage the highest possible material advantage because cautious seat kept the Queen the Rooks the Bishops the two knights this is the and promoted eight Queens this is the highest possible material advantage that you can have in a game and loose if White had a knight instead of a pawn the material advantage would be two points less cautious seat found a way to beat the worst chess AI on the planet by getting a maximum Point disparity of a cent starting setup followed by the promotion of eight pawns into Queens and still losing the game to upon in a king this is an accomplishment this right here should be celebrated I got nothing else get out of here
