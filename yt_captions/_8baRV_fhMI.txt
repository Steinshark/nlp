hello everyone and welcome if you were to ask me to choose between front wheel drive and rear-wheel drive I'm going to pick rear wheel drive basically every single time but this car right here the Acura Integra Type S is one of few cars that shatters that mentality now I realize this makes no sense but I want to compare it briefly to the BMW M2 which yes is a completely different type of car with completely different performance Targets in a completely different price bracket the reason that I bring up the M2 is simply because it was the last press car I drove before the Integra but the first time I floored it in this type S in second gear I thought wait a minute this thing feels quicker now that didn't match what I thought I knew about the M2 after all the M2 has a much better power to weight ratio so sure enough I looked up the 0 to 60 time for the type S and then looked up the 0-60 for the manual M2 and as you'd expect the M2 is significantly quick quicker in fact it's over a full second quicker to 60 miles per hour so was my initial impression all in my head or was there any Merit to this well it turns out a little bit of both but there's more Merit than an initial glance would suggest so under the hood of this type S is a 2.0 liter inline four-cylinder engine turbocharged making 320 horsepower and 310 pound-feet of torque the M2 is making 453 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque way way more now what is this torque that presses you against the seat this is what you're feeling so since this only has 76 percent of the BMW's torque well that feeling should be less right well it's not that simple there are two things we need to think about first that torque travels from your engine through the transmission through a final drive ratio eventually makes it to your wheels and then passes to the ground with your tires so what gear you're in those gear ratios as well as the radius of your tire influences what that force is applied to the ground so if you put the Integra Type S in second gear at Peak torque and the BMW M2 manual in second gear at Peak torque the force at the ground the Integra applies is actually 82 percent of the BMWs despite only having 76 percent of the engine torque that's because this car has a slightly shorter second gear as well as a slightly smaller Tire radius okay so remember that 82 percent number as it's important when we're talking about acceleration of course Force equals mass times acceleration so the second thing we need to discuss is mass and the type S weighs nearly 600 pounds less than the manual M2 this car with me sitting inside weighs 85 percent as much as a BMW M2 with me sitting inside so although we only have a 82 percent of the force pushing us forward we also only have 85 percent of the mass to accelerate so in reality if we're in second gear in both cars the actual acceleration is nearly identical how cool is that it perfectly illustrates the power of gearing as well as the benefit of weight reduction now rightfully you're thinking wait wait wait how could both cars possibly have the same acceleration if the BMW has a much quicker 0 to 60 time well allow me to answer that question first without any words you know what we're going to watch a clip as you saw in first gear the Integra simply cannot put down all of the power as you accelerate in a front-wheel drive car you of course have that load transfer to the back meaning you're taking weight off of the front wheels and thus reducing your ability to accelerate this means front-wheel drive cars will never be the best cars for launching and they're 0 to 60 times will show this the rear-wheel drive BMW on the other hand as you start to accelerate you're transferring that load to those driven wheels so now you have more weight on the driven axle and thus you have more potential to accelerate so it's actually really good for launching hence the M2 has a better 0 to 60. but does this really matter I mean arguably it doesn't yes the BMW will have the better launch and yes it will be faster around a track and yes it's going to have a higher top speed after all it has 453 horsepower not 320. but if you're doing a simple pull on a an on-ramp in second gear the acceleration you experience will be nearly the same and really the Joy from accelerating comes from the pressure pushing you back into your seat it doesn't come from some theoretical 0-60 time what you feel is what you should care about and clutch dumping in first gear to launch should be a rare occasion if you have any mechanical sympathy for your car so somehow despite being way down on power this offers nearly an identical acceleration experience in real-world driving as an M2 that is very cool because again these cars shouldn't be compared and yet the type S can hang to me this is the more fun car and I never ever ever thought I would have felt that way prior to having driven both put me on a Mountain Road and ask me which one I want prior to driving either I'd have picked the BMW 100 out of 100 times now that I've driven this my answer has changed and that's just genuinely impressive so what makes it so great well there's a few key points first the engine is excellent is there turbo lag yes but the mid-range of this engine is super meaty so there's always plenty of torque available if you're willing to wait for it second by modern standards it doesn't weigh all that much it's just 31 pounds heavier than the Civic Type R but with a healthy boost of Creature Comforts third the manual transmission is Sublime I set it driving the type R and it remains true for the type S this is simply one of the best gear linkages in any manual transmission period more on that later fourth the suspension tuning is great this is not a beat you up stiff suspension it's very compliant Fifth and finally it's a very precise and connected Driving Experience wide fat sticky tires are super responsive the steering weight remains heavy even on dead center and despite having boatloads of torque sent to just the front axle torque steer is rarely detectable the thing just drives great but I think more so than just listing logical explanations and features for why it's fun to drive is that the experience itself is just very involved on the spectrum of underwhelming to overwhelming it leans towards overwhelming but in the right way there's a lot to think about the gears are fairly short so you're always Switching gears which is Fun the front end can't handle all the torque you're throwing at it so the tires chirp and you have to make steering Corrections it's a little bit of a battle to drive aggressively at low speeds but again in a way that makes you feel like you're involved not overwhelmed okay so now let's make some vehicle comparisons that actually make some sense so first the type S versus the a spec which we have here and later versus the Honda Civic Type R now the first car I ever owned was an Integra us so I was quite excited when I learned that the Integra was coming back only for this to be revealed and admittedly I was a bit disappointed there's no two-door variant and it uses Honda's 1.5 liter engine which is fine but I'm not much of a fan of it props though because it still is a hatchback and they still do offer a manual transmission and the type S solves the engine problem so this car is in a really interesting position it's a premium five door with a manual transmission there aren't really any direct competitors which offer a manual transmission so Props to Acura but admittedly it's in a bit of a weird spot about thirty eight thousand dollars you get a car that's undeniably practical and has a manual transmission gets good fuel economy decently fun to drive but nowhere near the experience of the type S though it does cost about fourteen thousand dollars less to me it makes a lot of sense and it's an awesome alternative versus the Sea of crossovers out there driven by people like me still the engine leaves a bit to be desired 1.5 liter 200 horsepower 192 pound-feet of torque it's not slow it's just not really quick either that said there is a lot of Turbo lag and the worst part is the Rev hang shifting gears you have to wait a long time before letting out the clutch because the revs take their sweet time falling down this leads to rough ships though the type S has way less rev hang now both of these cars have rev matching so an interesting solution exists to the Rev hang problem generally speaking rev matching is for downshifts you shift to a lower gear and an automated throttle blip perfectly raises the engine speed for a smooth shift okay but on an up shift if you push in the clutch then shift to the next gear as long as you hold that clutch in your revs are going to start to drop and then eventually that rev matching system is going to hold them at the right RPM for brief moment so then you let the clutch out and at that moment you have a very smooth shift so you can wait and let this rev matching system hold it there yes the shift is going to take a long time but it will be smooth and alternatively yeah you could just wait until it falls to the right moment and just let the clutch out don't get me wrong it is problematic I'm just saying you can live with it for non-spirited driving and if you really want spirited driving the type S is the way to go and revhang is much less of an issue still there but not nearly as bad undeniably part of why the a-spec is still fun is because this shifter is basically perfect there is absolutely no movement in the shifter even under hard driving now yes it's a cable shifter it's not directly linked to a transmission below but Honda has nailed the linkage here there is no play there's a healthy resistance to any movement and a nice waiting all-around it is abundantly obvious so when you've selected any position whether that's a gear or neutral you may still jiggle out of habit but you will know for sure whenever you're in any given position this all results in a shifting experience that you just want to repeat again and again clutch control is easy on both the a spec and the type S both offer rev matching which can also be disabled some manuals feel sloppy some manuals feel clunky this one just feels precise I have a hard time describing the shifter as anything other than Flawless as far as differentiation in the shifting experience of the aspec versus the type S this has slightly shorter gearing and you have a slightly lower Red Line both of these mean you'll be shifting more often in the a-spec which is fun unfortunately with significantly more rev hanging the a-spec the shifting experience is definitely better in the type S and finally the a-spec has engine start stop which thankfully the type S does not but actually it turned out to be way less annoying than I thought and it's because it has a manual transmission so there's a certain number of conditions that have to be met for the engine to shut off the shifter needs to be in neutral the clutch pedal needs to be released and the car needs to be completely stopped all right so let's say you're in an automatic transmission vehicle and you're coming up to a stop sign so you reach the stop sign you come to a complete stop obviously and then immediately you start going again so once you hit that complete stop the engine shuts off but then you start going right after that so the engine kicks right back on and it pointlessly shuts off so unless you turn start stop off this common scenario is unavoidable now it's different in a manual in a good way so let's say you're coming up to a stop sign so you've got your foot on the clutch you've got it in first gear you come up to that stop sign you come to a stop and then you accelerate away from it because you left it in first gear and you kept your foot on the clutch as you came to that stop the engine will never shut off okay well now let's say you're coming up to a stop light and you're actually going to sit and wait for a little while so you get to the stop light you push in the clutch you put it in neutral and then you release the clutch so now you're just sitting there neutral and your foot's on the brake well in that scenario it shuts off the engine while you wait now in automatics it's annoying to wait for the engine to restart even if it's quick because you start moving usually as soon as you lift off the brake and now you have to wait for that engine to kick on now with a manual that's not the case the second you press in that clutch pedal the engine fires up before you've even put it into gear so you're not held up in any way with a manual which is actually really cool now again you can turn it off and the type S gets rid of it altogether some other differences the a-spec has five seats to the type s's four that's weird to me but it's the same story with the Civic hatch and the Civic Type R so that carries over to the integras this this has narrower tires 235s but honestly that's not that narrow for the vehicle's weight in fact the type S just has very beefy tires at 265 millimeters surprisingly even though the type S has larger wider Wheels they actually weigh less than the smaller a-spec Wheels overall the a-spec is about 150 pounds lighter than the type S coming in under 3 100 pounds aside from the Rev hang the driving experience in the a-spec is actually really good and it's really practical overall this is a super solid daily finally the natural comparison for this car is the Civic Type R which it's based on the Integra costs about seven thousand dollars more which might make the decision easy for you but honestly this to me is the better car for multiple reasons first off is the styling my quick summary would be the Civic Type R has a boring exterior but with a wing the Integra Type S has an exciting exterior but with no Wing though there is an optional carbon fiber spoiler which looks great overall I think the Integra looks much nicer second the Integra has five more horsepower that means it has five more horsepower than the Civic Type R now was repeating that it has five more horsepower as pointless as five more horsepower you yes third the Acura has significantly more Creature Comforts heated seats optional heated steering wheel heads up display a revised interior with better sound deadening though admittedly it's not exactly a quiet interior and it's all paired with a much nicer sound system with more speakers and all of this with only a 31 pound weight penalty fourth and finally the difference I find the most worthy of upgrading to the Integra is the suspension tuning it's softer and much more compliant than the type R both vehicles have adaptive damping but with very different tuning Acura tells me that sport mode in the Integra is like Comfort mode in the type R be honest with yourself if you're really only planning on driving on roads the Acura has the better ride if you really do want to tackle some track time the Honda suspension will reward you on perfect tarmac so if you were to ask me when I was 20 and still driving my Integra which one would I prefer I'd have told you the Civic Type R for sure but now that I'm older no more mature but with more gray hair it's the Integra for me and simply because of the improved ride quality despite what many enthusiasts choose to believe comfortable suspensions can pair very well with sporty cars what's left to say this car is awesome looks good feels good drives good Good's good if you have any
