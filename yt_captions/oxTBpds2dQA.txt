we wouldn't be arguing about whether there were women and men if things didn't need to be retooled from the very bottom that's my sense of the situation now that is a critical conversation whether the god-shaped hole gets filled by God exactly is something maybe for us to discuss on the shows you're going to be joining me for the next nine evenings on my we who wrestle with God Tour and I would like you to come armed with your sharpest sword and hold nothing back you've asked me to do something generally speaking I'm pretty good at which is to be disagreeable and tried to find holes and things I'm going to be coming at it from a kind of first principles uneducated but I hope sufficiently intelligent perspective and I think you could offer to the audience a really critical response that's thoughtful so that I can see if there's still holes in what I've laid out because I can't find any that's what we're going to explore I can't wait the difference between the temperature 200 years ago and the temperature now and you're going to this 1.5 degrees and the Earth is going to burn up or whatever that's less than between breakfast and lunch it it is so stupidly ridiculous to say that a 1.5 degree celsius increase in global atmospheric temperature is going to be a disaster as a matter of fact it will open up vast areas of Farmland that were too cold before [Music] hello everyone I have the opportunity today to talk to Dr Patrick Moore I've been following Dr Moore for quite a long time and I had the privilege of hearing him live in uh in a little meeting in on Vancouver Island here recently and we decided to do a podcast together Dr Moore is in the interesting position of being skeptical to say the least and unconvinced of the doomsaying prognostications of the climate apocalypse mongers but also have been been active in the environmentalist movement for 50 years he was one of the founding members of Green Piece back when they were working primarily on anti-nuclear campaigns and on campaigns to protect the remaining whales in the tragedy of the commons oceans against over fishing Dr Moore became convinced that the environmentalist organizations as such have been were in the process of being taken over by um actors whose primary interest was not the green movement in the environmental sense or the peace that Green Peace once stood for but more the promotion of a kind of radical self-interest combined with a hysterical with the hysterical Doom mongering that's now typical of the Apocalypse promoters and so so we go through the evidence of climate change and environmental composition over about a 500 million year period concentrating particularly on the last 2 million years and present the hypothetically appropriate conclusions in that climate denialism Festival so join us well hello Dr Moore thank you very much for agreeing to talk to me and to everybody else on this platform today uh we met recently in Vancouver Island it was the first time I'd heard you speak publicly and I was very interested in the story you walked through and so I thought today we could start with your adventures your Early Adventures with green peace and what you were hoping for from that environmentalist organization and move from that to your divergences with their current worldview let's say and and and the reason that that Divergence was necessary and and and and right so let's start with green piece let's let's begin with that well Jordan I was doing my PhD in ecology at the University of British Columbia I had excelled in the Life Sciences all through high school and in my undergraduate years mainly interested in evolutionary biology photo photosynthesis uh ecology in general and uh I was radicalized by this by the Vietnam War the threat of allout nuclear war and the uh concern for the environment which was a new thing uh the word ecology had not yet been used in the PO popular press it was an obscure scientific term uh and I think I was the first PhD colist to graduate in in Canada as far I know of any others and uh so I I learned through a little piece in the newspaper that a a small group of people were beginning to meet in the basement of the unarian church which is a church that accepts all uh religions and uh not not that I'm particularly religious but I agree with that sort of thing of of peace and and uh and an end to Waring and all that sort of thing I'm a pacifist I guess you could say but I'm also uh fantastically interested in nature uh and and the evolution of life from no life to life I I think there's two things that we can probably be sure we will never know the answer to uh one of them is how did Life Begin and the other one is there anyone else in this universe besides us uh it hasn't become apparent to date and we've got all kinds of listening devices and and and and we're a young star the sun is a young star so many of the stars that would have planets around them that are billions of years older than our star you'd think if life was going to happen on them it might have done so by now so those are those are kind of my basic uh philosophies where I I I think there are things that we can never know uh many of them probably maybe some that we don't even know how to uh to speak about but uh ecology the science of how all living things are interrelated not only with other living things but also with the planet as a whole and even the solar system because Saturn has an effect on tides and it has an effect on these cycles of glaciation and interglacial periods that have been going on for 2.6 million years during the plac ofine Ice Age so that's how I see the the the world as everything being interconnected Ed uh and and that brings me to well what is really the fundamental meaning of science uh and scientific discovery science is about Discovery primarily and I I have three steps that describe the scientific method the first one being observation and if you can't observe something either with your own senses or with the machines we've made like x-ray machines and and and uh all the other things we have that we can see inside people uh we can have R you know radiation detectors and all that sort of thing so they're part of our ability to observe the what's going on in nature or in the world and in the outer world so that that's what's needed is first observation and and then second comes verification where you you observed something and then you see if it repeats itself over and over again by very carefully trying to prevent outside forces from interfering with the the two things you're looking at where you think there might be a cause and an effect relationship uh and that's mostly what science is about is discovering cause effect and so you do that yourself to make sure that when you tell other people what you think You' found you you'll be on Solid Ground and then then there is replication where other people see if they can do what you did and if they can uh especially if it's 100% kind of thing then you have a theory a scientific theory and the reason that most of the scare stories today are about things that are either invisible like CO2 radiation and the bad thing that's supposed to be in GMOs which doesn't have a name everything has a name so if it doesn't have a name it doesn't exist and that's my opinion of on the subject is there's nothing in GMOs that is harmful other otherwise it would probably harm people and many people are eating them by the millions so that's just a total hoax as much as the climate emergency or climate crisis as they like to call it is a total hoax because people cannot see what carbon dioxide is doing they cannot do the first thing in science which is observation and therefore for some reason the sort of mass hysteria effect uh takes place around many subjects and so it's not just things that are invisible though it's also things that are so remote that no one hardly can go and look at it for themselves and I use the two examples of polar bears and coral reefs very opposite one's in the hottest Tropics the other's in the coldest Arctic but and and hardly anybody gets to see them I mean I've been lucky I'm I'm a I'm a diver and a snorkler and I've been to Indonesia on three two-e trips to all the coral reefs there which is the richest in the world happens to be in also the warmest ocean in the world and uh yet people can't see for themselves when they heard in early 2016 that 93% of the Great Barrier Reef was dying or terminal or in its final terminal stage as if there were other terminal stages before the final one and you notice they never said dead they said dying terminal or you know oh also uh bleached they love to use that word whereas bleached isn't like bleach that you make clothes white with bleach means they've ejected their phytoplankton and their symbiotic relationship between a poop which is an animal related to jellyfish which is in the little holes in the coral the tin trillions of them in a very small area and then the phytoplankton are taken in by the pops and put under their skin which is translucent and so they can still photosynthesize in there and give some of their sugar to the pop and the pop gives them protection from predation so that's it's a perfect example but the point is last year in the middle of the summer it was announced by the whole group of people who are studying the Great Barrier Reef that in the 36 years since they've been doing it uh thoroughly it was the highest Coral cover yet known so weigh those things it's 93% dying oh oh no sorry it's got more cover than it ever has in the last 36 years and that gets in some kind amount of media whereas the other one went worldwide that it was dying and the the thing is is that that the highest biodiversity of all coral reefs is in the warmest ocean in the world which is Indonesia it's protected from the north by Asia and it's protected from the south by Australia to cold water incursions that come into the Great Barrier Reef and many others but it's it's they say if it gets warmer the corals will die no they will spread because we're we're coming out right now of a period when the the at the Earth was so much warmer the eosine thermal maximum was was happened 15 million years after the dinosaur extinction which was almost certainly caused by that asteroid that hit Yucatan and sent Ash into the stratosphere where it blocked the Sun and caused plants to die and mass EX to occur and uh if if if the planet warms from what it is now which is actually one of the coldest periods in the history of the Earth this is the great irony now I'll try and go just quickly into the the the three most important points about climate change one is that this is one of the coldest periods in the history of the earth that's why the ice caps are huge ice caps are covering both the North and South Poles there were forests in the South Pole and there was no ice in the Arctic until about 3 million years ago since 250 million years before that when the kuu ice age which lasted 100 million years uh the same sort of thing we're in now where the poles are all covered in big sheets of ice um since 250 million years ago when it ended the Earth has been warmer than it is now so you're focusing on time frame and this is this is something that's perplexed me continually with regards to the both the climate debate and the carbon dioxide debate because my sense is that you can derive whatever conclusion you want essentially about temperature and about carbon dioxide and about the relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide by merely arbitrarily choosing a particular period of time to study now you what what struck me about the presentation of years that I saw was that you circumvented that to some degree by using extremely long spans of time and so the claim that you just made let me just lay it out again for everyone who's watching and listening is that over the last 250 million years we've rarely been in a period that's as cold as it is now and that for much of that time when there was no shortage what we never have been okay we never have been now there have been periods of time in the Earth's history when the whole earth was an ice ball how how long ago were those periods of time two billion years ago it's theoretical it it isn't proven uh it is possible that there were ice ages that were more extreme than the three that have occurred in the last half billion years the saluan was uh a a shorter Ice Age that occurred when Co two was at 6,000 parts per million you know it's four 400 and some now and they're saying it's going to make the Earth go on fire uh so and then the the kuu was 100 million years long that was during the time when forests evolved uh and it it was very similar in temperature to the one we're in now you see the the international um strateg graphy institution I think that's not quite its name but they stratigraphy is the layers of of the earth that you can read the ages and the fossils and stuff like that they have declared this hene interglacial period as a new epic the pene is an epic and it's lasted for 2.5 million years and there have been at least 40 interglacial periods no different from this one during that time none of them are EP okay that's a span of how long did you say the place toine 2.6 million years is it it's arbitrary but it was going down down down down and they said okay this is where we'll call it the place to scene because it had become so much colder that was than it was 50 million years ago and and it it had gone down quickly and then it leveled off for a while for about another 10 million years and then it crashed down to where we are now with the fact that we are in as cold period as has ever existed in the past 550 million years now as for ice ball Earth i i ice ball Earth is too long ago to have accurate records uh there there's all kinds of I've read I've read a lot about it and there's a lot of speculation involved in it obviously the world didn't freeze over completely or there wouldn't be any life here again I mean life had already occupied all the oceans of the world by that time and and there was no life to speak of on land I'm not sure about bacterial forms I mean that there's so much we don't know the reason I don't go back except to say that photosynthesis and sexual reproduction both evolved during that earlier period going back two three billion years but multicellular life never came into existence until about 560 million years ago before that everything every living thing had been unicellular microscopic and confined to the Sea so that's that to me that's where we start really all right so let's get the big biggest picture here and zoom in a little bit so 4.5 billion years ago about we have the emergence of the earth we have the emergence of Life what three and a half billion years ago and we have unb yeah something like that we have an unbelievably long span of essentially 3 billion years then when life is unicellular 500 million years ago we get the the emergence of multicellular life and that's the time when you start to focus in on the data thinking that at least in part the evidence for anything that happened before that is thin and speculative how good is the evidence of for or our conception of climate and Atmospheric composition from 550 million years ago to now and also from what sources is that evidence derived like how do we know what the temperature was how do we know how much carbon dioxide there was in the atmosphere across that 500 million year period and how much more accurate do our estimates get as the millions of years progress very good question uh yes uh we have a a lot of proxies the the the best evidence started to occur in 1958 in the international geophysical year when ships went out all over the world and drilled deeply into the Marine sediments to look at various proxies oxygen 18 is a really important one it has to do with different rad different Decay rates of different isotopes of various elements uh I'm not an expert on this but I know that's how it's done also the uh foraminifera which are a tiny shelled animal that lives in the sea and and is a huge of huge abundance we know from the shape of their shells how long ago it was along with the uh proxy uh radiation stuff so we can look deep down into these sediments and and see the evolution of life and the first multicellular life was pretty well all just like jellyfish there were no shells yet or bones and the the the the Clam family went off to make a shell as like a KN in armor like a protective plating around its whole body and made it much less suceptible to predation but the bony fish uh decided Ed to have then they started from way way back uh you know that same sort of 500 million year period and the skeleton and the and the central spine became a very uh desirable thing to have uh to hold to hold the fleshy part together and academics could learn from that Patrick I would say the importance of a spine you might say yes important um so but you'll you'll find that everything that has a spine can run pretty fast because we don't have a shell around us whereas the the the the the the the B valves and univ valves and all of the other shell species in the sea in particular there are freshwater clams and muscles which is proof that the oceans won't become so acidic as they like to say less alkaline is what they really mean that it's going to melt all the shells the shelled creatures in the sea that's ocean acidification I have a paper on it uh called uh a a a re basically a relook at this at this idea because it only emerged the whole idea of ocean acidification emerged when the temperature started stopped rising in in the late 90s there was a a flattening out period and everybody's going oh no we have to create a new scare story because this one isn't working as well as it used to and uh and that's the kind of thing that does drives a person nut me like me nuts because they get away with this yeah and so the the shelled creatures though uh can be uh what's the word for stay in one place you know sedentary sedentary sedentary yes and and they can be like oysters and all those shell species but the jellyfish are still around but most of them have ERS so they don't have to be able to run away too fast because the other species know that it's not a very pleasant experience to swallow one and so all the all these different uh strains the the philm of Life many philm have emerged in this 500 milliony year period and the only reason they're still here is because they were successful now people say that when I say well the esine thermal maximum was like way hotter than it is now there was no ice anywhere for 250 million years and life thrived the dinosaurs thrived if it hadn't been for the asteroid they'd still be here but it made room for us mammals to fill the Gap and so they say but no but humans couldn't have lived through that no but their ancestors did if if we wouldn't be here if our ancestors hadn't lived through the hot period And so that that this 500 million years gives you abs absolute proof that the the climate emergency and and this strong relationship between CO2 and temperature they are out of sync through that 500 million year period more than they're in sync and that is not not a cause effect relationship okay so let's review this so so far we've established that we have reasonable records of climate and atmosphere for a 500 million year period let's say we' derived that in part from the study of um radioactive isotopes and partly from the study of the shells of shelled animals that have been around for an extraordinarily long period of time and so we can get a pretty decent picture of both climate and Atmospheric uh composition during that period of time and what we see is that for much of that period of time in fact for all of it in in your estimation um the planet was in fact much warmer than it is now to the point where there was no ice for most of that period of time on either pole yet during that period life flourished abundantly also during that period this 500 million New Year period for almost all of that time there Not only was more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than there is now there was like there was way more five times more 10 times more and the consequence of that was that plants flourished all also the carbon dioxide and the temperature during that period are radically out of sync and not obviously causally related is does that is that a good summary of The 500 milliony Year Evidence so okay well I just say that the The keru Ice Age lasted 100 million years the saluan only lasted for about 10 million years ours is only 2.5 million years and they're declaring it over without any evidence whatsoever that it's anything like over as a matter of fact of the 40 inter glacial periods that have occurred the the most recent ones have shown A continuing decline in the warmth of The warm periods which are the short periods it goes it takes 85,000 years to sink from where we are now back to the next major glaciation see they call it the last ice age the one that occurred ,000 years ago no it was the most recent glacial maximum of which there have been 40 during the place to St Ice Age and the the amazing thing is is that the the cycles that are occurring here are are asynchronous like for the first half one and a half million years it was a 40,000 year cycle in keeping with the shape of the Earth's orbit which is a fected by the mag by Jupiter's gravitational field Jupiter affects both our our our our circle around the it's not a circle it's a oval but it changes shape in tune with Jupiter's gravitational effect as as it goes around the Sun and then the the the tilt of the earth is is affected by Jupiter's gravitational effect and so is the wobble the North Star won't always be the North Star because the Tilt wobbles like this in a 20,000 year cycle right I'm using round numbers it's 21 or something but so this period we've had now for the last 2.5 million years the graph shows very clearly from Ocean sediment analysis that it's still getting colder in the cold periods okay so that's the pl scene that last two and a half million years and that's the time that's been characterized by 40 processions of ice yes the last of which was the last ice age no no the most recent M recent glaciation the ice age is the place to scene oh yes sorry yes yes and but people you got that in your head because they're pouring it into you every day that it was the last ice age when when it is this is the last ice age it's called the place to scene is the most Ice Age but we also have these ma glacial maximums occurring and and and so this is called the place to scene conundrum because no one knows quite exactly how that happened okay so let me rephrase that so two and a half million per year period which in in totality is an ice age that's characterized by the movement and the re the the movement forward and the recession of of the ice masses and the last major movement forward was 20,000 years ago go but we're still in the and and now are we're at the tail end of the recession where are we in that process no we're at the tail end of the interglacial period if it's anything like pretty well all of the previous ones it really only lasts about 10,000 years and the first part of it is warmer than it is see people are not even willing to look at 10,000 years they want to say from 1850 right yes when the industrial era began now it's the industrial area that is causing this slight change in in global temperature when in fact this change started more like in 1600 that was the peak of the little ice age as it was called and it wasn't an Ice Age either it was just a a a cold period during an interglacial period during a warm period so but the little ice age was the coldest it's been since about 10,000 years ago as it was coming up out of the real glacial maximum they can't tell right at the beginning exactly how many there were and and where you really start and all that stuff but it's in the neighborhood of 40 glacial maximums first on 100,000 year Cycles sudden switch to 40,000 year Cycles both of which tie in with the uh Jupiter gravitational Theory um this was discovered in the 1920s uh but they didn't have they didn't have the detail that we have today um the the fact is is what what I call it is the most recent glacial maximum was 20,000 years ago they call it the last because last can also mean final as as well as most recent right so most recent is much more accurate than final I don't know why final would would be used unless they thought it was the last one and and there's absolutely no evidence for that because we've already started about 6,000 years ago going downward slowly till we came to the little ice age and it was only 400 and some years ago that that happened people starved in the Northern parts of Europe because it was too cold to grow food and and it doesn't take that much temperature a couple three degrees Celsius makes the area where you can grow food move quite a bit just like the in the glacial maximums there was a mile of ice over and two miles of ice and three miles of ice and around Churchill like four miles of ice on top of the land and and there was almost nowhere in Canada that wasn't completely glaciated a few places where there's very little precipitation in in the Alaska area Yukon area but basically the whole country was covered in a massive sheet of ice which went way down into the Northern Tier US states New York had a mile of ice on it so and was only 20,000 years ago and that had occurred Time After Time After Time for 2.5 million years and again there is absolutely no indication that the place to scene is anywhere near coming to an end everything points to it getting colder or staying the same maybe the chance of it going back up is 5% if you look at the evidence as it presents itself do you ever read the fine print that appears when you start browsing in incognito mode it says that your activity

enough to frequently have the progression of the glaciers and that's happened and they've receded 40 times now you made illusion to some of the forces that are multiple forces that are causing that you talked about the the um the tilt of the Earth's orbit and the and what would you say the irregularities in that tilt so that's a source of variability you talk if the Earth points more towards the sun then the solar radiation goes further north and further south in in our winter there summer so it it it can that seems to be where it was triggered was was by these the Cycles fit perfectly so you you sort of have to go well that looks like it's a cause effect relationship right and and it's happens so many times and and you said Wobble the Wobble itself is affected by even more distal forces like the the gravitational pole of Jupiter so there's many many forces at play that are determining these large scale cycles of climate over tens of thousands of years tens of thousands of year periods and it you don't believe that there any evidence whatsoever Cycles upon Cycles upon Cycles upon cyes right and you don't believe that carbon dioxide production per se is one of the major okay so so let's D drag into that because or drill into that because I'm going to do everything I can push back against you to to evaluate that argument because we want to give the devil is due so I could say all right so the first thing I might say is well you could be right in that there's been a tremendous amount of Vari across large spans of time but the rate of change at the moment since 1850 is sufficient so that those perturbations will be hard for natural systems to adapt to and they threaten the stability of the cultures that we've generated predicated as they are on a particular uh what would you say manifestation of weather and climate and so the right span of time is a 200-year period and not these tens of thousands of years or millions of years even that you're insisting upon so how would you respond to that objection well John Clouser uh who got the Nobel Prize in physics in 202 or three uh has just joined the CO2 Coalition of which I'm a director founding director and we're a group that only accepts people that we want to come in you can't just pay money and be a member uh we we we know what we're talking about we've got some of the top uh atmospheric scientists and Etc in the world as as as our group and we're also associated with clintel in Europe uh which is a climate International uh Alliance I believe it stands for and we're we're pretty much on the same page because it's the only page that makes any sense uh the the the fact is is and John cler said it this way the difference between the temperature 200 years ago and the temperature now and you're going to this 1.5 degrees and the Earth is going burn up or whatever that's Le that's less than that's less than between breakfast and lunch everywhere in the world 1.5 degrees Celsius it it it is so stupidly ridiculous to say that a 1.5 degre celsus increase in global atmospheric temperature is going to be a disaster as a matter of fact it will open up vast areas of Farmland that were too cold before a lot of this I I live in KOMO uh where I'm just barely halfway to the North Pole and it's too cold for things to grow for large parts of the year and it would be nice if it was warmer and the other thing that not many people know is that when the earth warms uh say back in the day this is many millions of years ago when it was much warmer than it is now uh it it it does so more towards the poles the equator doesn't change it it it's a a a constant that like the poles actually became subtropical uh during some of the interglacial periods before the Ice Age came the ice didn't start building up in Antarctica until about 30 million years ago and the ice didn't start building up in the Arctic until about 5 million years ago the South Pole is always colder than the North Pole the southern hemisphere is colder because it's mostly ocean and it takes a lot more energy to heat up the oceans than it does to heat up the land you're only heating up a little bit like this but the oceans are like the atmosphere are in in cycle they they're in lots of different Cycles exchanges so they're moving heat all over the place whereas the land doesn't move heat it just absorbs it and so the the the the the northern hemisphere has always been colder than the southern well since the land masses were reasonably in the same place they are now over of course over the hundreds of millions of years the tectonic plates have moved around quite a bit and at one time they were all in one continent with all the rest of the world being ocean g gondan land I think that's what that was mhm um and so the the the flows of heat uh but the point is is that in the esine thermal maximum the temperature was at least 5 to 7 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now maybe even more and Tropics it there were 50 million years ago was the peak of the esine thermal maximum as it's called and coming out of the glacial uh coming out of the dinosaur extinction there were 15 million years where it still was going up it had gone it had gone down about halfway to where it is now in the middle of this 250 million year period but it was nowhere near cold enough for any ice to be on the earth and at the same time CO2 was going in the exact opposite direction than the the the whole of the um temperature was and that you can see that in in the graphs that that that there is no clear relationship but the thing about CO2 is actually it is a greenhouse gas but clouds are so much more important you know water is the most interesting one because as a gas not mod I also understand that in the CL the climate models don't have sufficient resolution to appropriately model clouds and so so you talked about 1.5° and that number has always bothered me because um I I understand if I'm correct that that's within the error margin of the estimates of the forcing effect of water vapor I understand that it it's a small enough measurement so that we can't determine um if it can be validly detected in terms of an increase given our inability to model the effects of clouds I understand that we don't have temperature measurements from terrestrial weather stations that are sufficiently reliable over even a period of several hundred years to ensure that our estimates are accurate within a degree and a half I mean I learned this not least by reading Michael kton about or kryon about 20 years ago when he wrote one of the first exposes on the climate scam pointing out that most of our terrestrial weather stations were placed in outside of cities to begin with but that they've been the subject of encroachment by the urban heat Islands since and that in consequence their temperature estimates have to be corrected for that encroachment and there's error in that measurement as well so yes and not only that they're they're playing with the numbers they're making it seem colder before that they're actually Noah the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is actually it's they're lying they're they're they're saying oh there's a good reason to show it was hotter now and colder then and then they change the numbers and they're doing it without telling anybody and then the graphs go out I mean this whole thing is still corrupt and it it's basically the problem is is that politicians who uh work by scaring people uh that if this happens you know you vote for me and I'll make sure this doesn't happen uh but they quietly get their bureaucrats to give billions of money to scientists universities who know that if they don't go along with the story they're going to get fired NE never never mind they actually cannot counter this without being shunned and have youve seen what's happened recently with the big universities and the the the kind of horrible stuff coming out from these people not just on climate but on social issues and War and all that sort of stuff and that's not I don't talk about that too much yeah but I follow it I follow it very closely and the there there there's so so all these scientists publish all these papers with with Doom and Gloom as the main theme you don't see the big corporations doing that sort of stuff they're trying to make things that are useful and now they're being forced into this electric vehicle thing you know that using fossil fuels to make electricity is only 35 to 40% efficient and then you're going to use that use that electricity to run your car and it's only so efficient I mean it's more efficient than burning fossil fuels but you're burning fossil fuels 65% of all the electricity in the United States is still bought by fossil fuels and they're pretending that that doesn't have any CO2 emissions because the cars don't okay so let's let let's turn our attention momentarily to to the CO2 issue so I became aware six or seven years ago of The Greening Global Greening phenomena so now we've been told for 60 years that as the carbon dioxide rates increase and the temperatures inexorably rise that what will inevitably happen is that the semi arid areas will turn arid and the deserts will expand but what's actually happened and the opp in a yeah not just the opposite in a little way the opposite in an absolutely mindblowing and unequivocal way which is what's happened is that because we're actually in a carbon dioxide drought which is also what your data point to we're down to about 430 parts per million and plants start to die at 150 parts per million the plants are literally gasping for metaphorically gasping for breath and so they have their stomata open too wide and that means they lose a lot of water and that means that the semiarid areas in the Earth are wider than they should be larger than they could be could be so now carbon dioxide levels have gone up and not even that much and the consequence of that is that the plants are thriving in comparison and this has happened over only a 20year period and so the the amount of the earth that's greened since the year 2000 is equivalent to the total land area of the United States right it not only that there's been a market Improvement in Crop Production it's like 13 to 15% so not only is the planet not desertify it's doing the opposite and near the deserts right in semi-arid areas Plus instead of that being a threat to food production it's actually enhanced food production worldwide so my sense is that if we weren't ideologically addled and we were looking just at the straight data with the with the eyes of let's say new investigators we'd look at the release of carbon dioxide of the of the plant-based carbon dioxide sequestration from the fossil fuel reservoirs as the return of a necessary nutrient to the atmosphere and we would consider it a net positive and so what do you think about that is that like I just can't any other conclusion when I found out that the the area of green on the planet had expanded that much in 20 years it was well it was I didn't know what to to think of that because not only does it indicate that the desertification by carbon dioxide hypothesis is erroneous it's actually the opposite of that it's literally an anti-truth the notion that carbon dioxide will cause desertification and it seems to me that environmentally oriented people should be thrilled that the planet has become substantially Greener and that agricultural land is more productive because it means we'd have to use less of it so you know I've gone so far as to delude myself into thinking that adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is one of the most effective ways we could possibly distribute fertilizer so given that we need to burn fossil fuels for all sorts of other reasons and so that's so far away from the current narrative that it seems like a delusion so what do you think of that what do you make of that you studied well um yes it that's all of what you said is absolutely true and many of us like you and I know about this and it falls on deaf ears for some reason and and I go back to uh burning witches and throwing virgins into volcanoes um people did these things and the rest of the people accepted it or even supported it and so I I what is it some kind of collective Death Wish because the fact is during the most recent glacial maximum as I like to call it 20,000 years ago CO2 sank to 180 PPM in the atmosphere that's because when the oceans cool they absorb more CO2 and when they warm they outgas CO2 I I use the example of taking a glass of cold water out of the fridge and putting it on your counter in a few minutes bubbles begin to form on the glass inside that's the gas coming out of the water put it back in the fridge they disappear so Henry's law is the is an actual scientific formula that determines the equilibrium between CO2 in the water and in the atmosphere and given that the water is 70% of the land's area this is a fairly major factor in things and so it went down to 180 and as you know at 150 plants die right so it is thought that many of the high elevation plants did die for lack of CO2 because as you go up the air thins out so 150 150 parts per million becomes a lower number as you go up yeah and and so that because there's Ash Ash deposits at those altitudes that seem seem to be like pervasive uh and I think that's a logical conclusion uh I mean in other words it it's not a bad hypothesis uh because it was solo and and and so I say that human emissions of CO2 are a Salvation not not a not a destructive tragedy or emergency or crisis it is actually that we this species has not only figured out how to build airplanes and spaceship and computers but we have also reversed the continuous downward trend for the last 500 million years with a few blips up and down in between but for the last say 150 million years it's been a steady downward line starting with with regards to carbon dioxide percentage from 2500 PPM 150 million years ago to 180 20,000 years ago and when we came out of that most recent glaciation took about 10,000 years to get up to what's called the holine climate Optimum because the first 10 the first 5,000 years of the whole scene were warmer than it is now the Sahara was green CO2 was a little bit higher it went up to about 280 after the after the the 180 the warming of the oceans caused outgassing and made it 280 by the time industry began and then industry has taken it from 280 to 42 five or six or something right now and it just keeps getting greener but but the Sahara's not green yet because it is I've read that it's shrinking on its Southern expanse yes it is but uh the the fact is there are do red dots on maps showing all the villages that were all across the Sahara Desert with goat herders and sheep and stuff like back then for for thousands of years and one of the reasons they say the Egyptian civilization began was they all had to move into the Nile Valley uh because it was the only place where there was enough water to live and the Sahara became a desert 6,000 years ago or 5,000 something like that but anyways that's the time when when everybody had to Mo move and and that created one of the first big Urban centers along with the Middle East

criticism of the current climate apocalypse mongering on a different ground and then let's let's investigate for a a brief period of time why this story might be making itself manifest you already pointed to some degree to the corruption of the scientific Enterprise but but there's that's not the whole story so so um my license in Canada to practice is is being threatened right by my professional board one of the reasons for that by the way is that some complainant some random complainant in the United States who I never had any professional dealings with whatsoever like all the people who complained about me by the way submitted the entire transcript of a Joe Rogan interview that I did on where I discussed climate in some of the same ways that we're discussing it and one of the things I pointed out was that the models that we use are radically dependent on a set of initial presuppositions they're not very accurate in their estimates of such things as terrestrial temperature they don't model water vapor well or clouds and and so they're and they're not data they're models and so they're not reliable and then they are fueled in their development by the people who want the apocalypse mongering to continue so that makes me very skeptical of them but then there's something even worse they use those models to generate 100-year prognostication which is a long way out there and and that means the farther you go out with your models the more the errors multiply but then they stack an economic model on top of that and claim that the consequence of the 1.5 degree elevation in temperature is computable economically one century from now and that the consequences will be devastating well you know I read all of Bjorn lamberg's careful work and Bjorn has accepted the ioc prognostications about temperature increase and he's calculated what that's likely to cost us in relationship to the fact that our economies continue to grow and that people are flourishing and his conclusion is that not only is there no climate apocalypse because that's a complete bloody lie in the way that you just described but there's also no economic uh uh apocalypse even if the climate scientists are right because our proclivity to become more productive will radically overwhelm the slight detrimental effect of any climate transformation and so anyways for stating all that that's part of the reason that my license as a clinical psychologist is being threatened which is you know sort of an indication of the current state of the world and so I don't know if you have anything to say about the economic models or if we should just leave that lie and so so what do you think of that line of reasoning economics is sort of in the middle of real hard science uh and I don't know naturopathy or something um not that not that I don't agree with a lot of naturopathy but it's soft versus hard science type thing and you know it's just so insane that they are doing this because the ipcc itself the inter intergovernmental panel on climate change uh part of the United Nations apparatus it's partly the Meteorological association uh and the Environmental Center in Nairobi and they're very political of course but twice during the publication of their large volume they they they have a a public one for the public but they also have a big volume that they put out every four years and twice they have said to effect it is impossible to determine future climate Trends you see chaos the very definition of chaos is you is that you can't see through it I I I've been a Boer all my life and built a few of them too and uh I love the bow wave uh because at at a certain speed you're you're going slow and it's a beautiful laminer flow around B it's there's no turbulence and then you get going a little faster a little faster it becomes turbulent and frothy it's impossible to predict where each of the atoms are in that chaotic system and that's the same thing as the climate there's no possibility that anybody can predict the future with a computer it's especially well you can predict some things with a computer if you've got a perfectly linear thing that they looking at yeah but you can't predict something as complicated as the global climate another point I'd like to make is that you know people are saying that it's going to get too hot to live on the earth we are a tropical species we're not polar bears that's why we're not covered in massive fur coats because we we evolved at the equator and we we stayed there for a very very long time and couldn't come out of there even my place here in Baja on the of cancer is too cold for people if they don't have shelter and fire so I believe that the control of fire was the beginning of the species called humans and that it went from there to clothing and needles for knitting hides together and then nice houses and with nice fireplaces and lots of wood around and you know one of the reasons the forest fires are so bad in the western us is they don't clean the wood off the ground and they let trees die and just stand there back in the day before there was any fossil fuels every village every tribe every town every city they collected all the dead wood for miles around their Dwelling Places and used it for their firewood in the winter because it was dry already and easy to get because it was already on the ground right and so people don't recognize that and you got to manage a forest properly if you don't want it to turn into a conflagration like they have done in California and many of the other Western States but back to uh clouds Joanie Mitchell I've looked at clouds from both sides now from up and down and still somehow it's clouds Illusions I recall we really don't know clouds at all she said one of the most prophetic scientific things of any modern singer and this is true we cannot predict the clouds and and they have multiple forces they they reflect sunlight off the top they keep the Earth's heat in at the bottom they rain all over the place and make everything wet and then you've got the fact that that H2O name me another compound that has all three states gas liquid and solid the ice has a huge effect too when it comes like it has now so water is really the one that we should be focusing on right right right but I don't think I don't think we would come to the conclusion that we should get rid of the water in the same way they're saying we should get rid of the CO2 these people who are building billion dooll things to to store CO2 yeah I know CO2 cration St they they really they really should be put in Chains and not allowed to do that you know it's so ridic it'd be just as effective to go to door too with a with a pistol take people's money and burn it in the backyard it's it's equally insane okay so so it is about that's a good yeah it's about it's about us insane okay so so let's let's look underneath this and this also will tap into something paradoxical about you I would say so let me lay this out and tell me Tell and then you tell me what you think about it okay so my sense is that the great climate apocalypse narrative emerged essentially out of the concerns of people like the club of Rome and the concerns in the 1960s that the human race was going to that we were basically we could be modeled like mold in a Petri dish and that we would expand our population till we consumed all available resources and perish in a in a cataclysm and that that had to be stopped and that was the sort of um dire situation put forth by the biologist Paul Erick for example who's been beating this drum ever since the mid-60s okay so the club of Rome people got together in the mid 60s and they decid decided that there were way too damn many people on the planet something radical had to be done about that which is a bit of a dangerous presumption in my estimation right and a bit of an anti-human presumption but um in any case the consequence of that was the emergence of the more radical side of the environmentalist movement now I hesitate to say just that and this is where I would really like your input because there are a number of reasons for wise people to be cautious and concerned about the relationship between human beings and the and the broader ecological system so I spent a lot of time analyzing human effects on the so-called environment and I came to the conclusion that we're misdirecting our apocalyptic attention in a variety of pathological matters because for example I think that the fact that we're we've devastated the um Natural Abundance of the coastal Waters and really intensely in the last 100 years is a much more pressing concern than our production of carbon dioxide but it's a concern that it is possible to get people to attend to now it's not the only environmental concern so you could imagine that there are genuine environmental concerns and then there's this anti-human screeching about overpopulation and the combination of those two forces drives the demand for an apocalyptic narrative and then that feeds into the politicians venal wish to be seen as the saviors for a problem whose progress towards solving can't be measured and that also enables them to Proclaim themselves as something like the saviors of the natural world right so so the reason I'm asking you this is because I'm trying to delve into the reasons why they apocalypse narrative surrounding climate got going to begin with now you were there at the onset of the environmental movement say with the with the green peace types and you had your environmental concerns so what was driving your concern at the onset and the concern of your compatriots and why did your paths deviate so we're we're talking you were you were trying to get me started on that at the beginning and we got off on too many other things but yeah I'd like to explain why I joined Green Peace and why I left Green Peace I I think I did say that I was doing a PhD in ecology and that led me into environmental concerns and there was hydrogen bombs being detonated by the United States in the illustion islands and there was still atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons by France and French Polynesia and that was the first Target of green Peace's campaign it it was Green Peace the peace in in in Green Peace is about people it's not about the environment green is about the environment and so we were at the beginning uh we were actually doing humanitarian work rather than an ecological work in some ways I mean we were trying to stop the possibility of an allout nuclear war by waking people up to the arms race and all of that that was going on at the time and that was when 1971 was 1971 was the voyage to to amchitka uh with 12 of us on a small fishing boat 85 foot boat crossed the Pacific Ocean got arrested by the Coast Guard made molter kronites evening news and had tens of thousands of people marching in the streets and so uh there were lots of other people involved but we were the tip of the spear on that because we got up out of and did something and quit our regular lives and went on a three-month uh campaign uh on a on an old fishboat uh and learned a whole lot of stuff and had a great time and uh and and because we we all had a a motto the this the the revolution should be a celebration uh not killing people and stuff and so we did that and then the next year we've had such success we had defeated the world's most powerful organization the US Atomic energy Commission because they stopped their next test that they were going to do Nixon did that and it was very shortly after this the bomb we were going against they did set that one off I guess they couldn't lose that much face but uh they they stopped that program so we said well let's head for Mero atle in French Polynesia and sto the atmospheric tests and it only took two years to do that in a 20 6 foot sailboat going from New Zealand while the rest of us went over to Europe and the first thing we did was we asked for an audience with the Pope which he gave us and mentioned our name during his speech from up on his porch there uh and that was pretty thrilling and and then we went to Paris and occupied Notre Dam Cathedral just a half a dozen of us handing out pamphlets because even lemand at that time was controlled by the state no one in France knew about the atmospheric nule test in French Polynesia it wasn't a subject to be discussed and so we handing out these pamphlets and then we sat in the pews and as it was time for closure The Sur came in and we said we are occupying this church overnight as a de a demonstration and they said excuse me sir but this is not a church it is a national monument and you will come to jail with us if you don't get out of here right now so we're we're actually quite smart about these things we didn't want to to jail and we got out but we made leemon the next morning for the first time there had been a story about the French atmospheric nuclear testing and then we went to Stockholm where the first international meeting on the environment took place uh where where uh they were talking about all kinds of environmental things but they sure weren't going to talk about nuclear that's what the the superpowers as they were called in the nuclear weapon States uh made it very clear that war was not an environmental issue and so therefore atmospheric testing wasn't an environmental issue even though it was sending radiation around the whole southern hemisphere for months of the year and uh but but we didn't go to the alternative conference in all of these conferences there's an alternative hippie conference with colorful flags and dancing girls and all that sort of thing we went to the real conference because six months earlier Jim Bolan and his his wife Marie and I Jim B was one of the the leaders of the early Greenpeace group he's engineer who worked with buck Mr Fuller on the on on the domes up north the D line domes really smart guy and I went I went with him as an ecologist and and his wife and we Lobby every southern hemisphere country especially the ones on the Pacific about the situation and that we were going to send a boat and all that stuff and then we went to the Stockholm conference and convinced the French uh sorry the New Zealand delegation who had been the sort of strongest against this all along and uh the New Zealand delegation put a motion on the floor against uh atmospheric nuclear testing and won by a landslide so it was a great embarrassment uh to them all and the next year they quit they they did do one more one more year yeah they did but then they went underground and now now they're not doing it at all and then they sank our boat in New Zealand with with with L with bombs on the on the hull while people were in it one person died uh that was that was that was the only time uh there was a fatality during a Greenpeace campaign we were very careful at our boat with our boats because boats can kill people pretty quick if the weather gets bad and uh and I've been I've been I grew up on a floating village so there was nothing but boats and uh my dad's logging camp in Winter Harbor on the North tip of Vancouver Island which we still have a family compound there we we're not in the forestry business anymore but we were for about a hundred years and uh so I grew up on a tide flat with a dock and a few houses and uh a couple of rivers and a lot of forest and so I I I was naturally interested in uh in nature uh so I I joined Greenpeace we went on these voyages and as time went on we then uh moved into uh more environmental issues uh such as uh toxic waste pollution uh cleaning up the rivers in Europe North America had already passed passed good clean water and air acts earlier than we were in The Late Late n late 60s but Europe had not and every almost every Big River the elb the Ry the river in London temps uh they were pretty much dead and so we got a smaller boat the river boat we called it about a 50 foot boat and went up these rivers with divers and plugged the pipes of the factories that were putting poison in the rivers underwater where no one could see it going in and so we plugged the pipes and it backed up into the factories and that made the newspapers happy and uh we won and so that that was good and then uh about the early 80s a change occurred where environmental groups were now describing the human species as the enemies of the earth great cancer on the planet yeah amp you know disaster for human for for life and all of that so we kind of the green got dropped sorry the piece got dropped out of the green piece and uh but I it's too much like original sin for me to think that humans are the only evil animal on the planet or evil species on the planet uh I just don't go for that I'm not into that and but the but I stayed for a bit even though they were saying these things and how did that happen What like why do you think that happened what what changed we were infiltrated by the political left yeah so that was aist it was a it was a Marxist incursion yeah yeah that that makes perfect sense yeah cuz that that kind of puts that anti- capitalist spin on it right yeah yeah then what happened Jordan is in an international meeting of which I was one of the directors and we had maybe 50 people around the table by this time from all kinds of countries David mctaggert who was our chairman and and had become so in political ways uh and I negotiated the founding of Green Peace International with him in a conflict over the use of the word Green Piece uh the San Francisco office was trying to take it away from us the founding office and of course the the US has 20 times the fundraising capacity as Canada and so it became a civil war within Greenpeace and and I we got my our lawyer negotiated with me and David the the contract of Greenpeace International which he would become chairman and I would be the representative for Canada and the representative for us and a representative Australia Germany uh Germany Netherlands UK we had nine or 10 countries all with offices by this time and good fundraising going on and uh so David was one of these people who is scared of chemicals right chemophobia it's been described as it's sort of like being scared of the climate uh and he decided with advice from others that Greenpeace should start a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide with capital letters and I'm going you guys salt is sodium chloride it is an essential nutrient it is why Gandy marched to the sea to make salt because the Brits were were taxing the poor people of India for an essential nutrient that they couldn't afford and so come on but not only that adding chlorine to drinking water was the biggest advance in the history of Public Health and to spas and Pools and Hot Tubs Etc and 85% of our Pharmaceuticals are based on chlorine chemistry and 25% of them actually have chlorine in them if you look at your cold medicine you'll see a little CL there on a lot of them and so I said we can't do that you guys we cannot ban chlorine worldwide if you have a particular chlorinated compound that you think should be banned from industry or whatever let me know but I'm gone if you do that and I was gone and it was Peaceable was friendly um but I I I was gone and I went home to my Winter Harbor home and with my brother and brother-in-law we started a salmon farm just when Norway was taking off with that industry and I ran a salmon farm for 10 years and in the end we couldn't grow them for as cheap as they were being sold because the market it's one of those things where the market just flips and suddenly you're in a buyer's market the early days we were in a sellers market and it's a beautiful product and I still eat a lot of salmon in particular the this the steel head that are being grown in freshwater that they've got some way of making rainbow trout get this big uh in freshwater and de Baker Lake is one of the main uh places where they're growing them and so is the Columbia River and it's a fantastic product and your comment about the the sea uh did did did you read the book The Tragedy of the commons by Garrett Hardy yes do you know that one yes yeah it's it it really laid it out very clearly that unless you have and this is why this whole thing about no borders is as completely ridiculous you have to have jurisdictions if you're going to stop over fishing and over whatever right right right uh and and the the international oceans are are are the place where this should be figured out somehow and and actually Canada and the United States and Japan and Russia all have a treaty over crabs and salmon uh that keeps it from being overfished and gives quotas and all that sort of thing so it is being practiced in some places the Atlantic side though there's 25 countries out there and uh and Japan is you know they don't they don't care who says what they they own the sea and and and they're very I mean and then they're on an island and you can sort of I mean it's sort of like England yeah like Great Britain in that way and as you know the French and the English have been fighting over whose fish they are for a long long time and uh the same thing goes on in other parts of the world too and and my my my grandfather was and his three brothers were salmon fishermen out of Winter Harbor and my dad married his daughter and uh logger and a fisherman and that's what we were up there that was about all there was there was no Road there was no road to Winter Harbor when I was a child until I was 16 and uh when the road finally came a 75 mile Gravel Road from Port Hardy across the North End of of Vancouver Island to the most westerly Port Winter Harbor on the island and and and and on the very near the very tip of it we thought wow now this place is going to Boom half the people use the road to get out that's that's human nature for you because they had to stay there all year and many of them never got out at all because they couldn't afford to go to town because getting to town was a two-day trip on a two boats a a taxi and and and a big steamer going to Vancouver the north and south of Vancouver Island weren't joined together by roads until about the 1970s so the North Island was a whole other place cool place to grow up so when you started to separate yourself from Green Peace you said that the two things happened to Green Peace if if I've got it right one was the incursion of the Marxist anti- capitalist types and and the anti-human types as well who were proclaiming that human beings were something approximating a cancer on the face of the planet so it's a real radicalization of the green element then there's the incursion of the marxists and you also said that there was some um what would you say neurotic over concern with chemicals as such right so that's something more like a it's more like a phobia than a than a reasoned position a new paper just came out that said there are more than 9,000 toxic chemicals in plastic and they didn't name one of them but they did find 9,000 of them in there apparently and that's the kind of stuff that's coming out they've been saying that plastic is toxic forever it is the primary product used in healthcare for for blood bags for vinyl tubing you can take vinyl is the most interesting plastic because it and it contains chlorine polyvinyl chloride so it's the the only uh one of these polymers the Plastics that has chlorine in it and because it has that different chemistry it's able to absorb nearly anything you can put uh anti germ chemicals into it and you can use it as flooring and wall covering in hospitals so that the germs can't grow on the floor of the walls and all the Glo gloves and caps and and all kinds of things are made out of plastic in healthcare because it is non-toxic that's the whole point of it did I go into the the the Marine plastic the the Great Pacific Garbage Patch we haven't talked about that have we no no no well so it it it's it's um it's easy for an the environmental movement to be captured in a variety of ways and that's essentially what seemed to happen in the 1980s so what now how exactly did did you separate yourself from the group and when did you start to become aware that the climate issue was a a tempest in a te part let's say or even or even something antithetical to the truth and what has been the consequence for you of that Discovery Well I pretty early on I realized that CO2 was one of the most Essential Elements for life on Earth and all of those things I mean and and between CO2 and water uh there's nothing else that comes close to the importance of those two molecules that nitrogen would be the next thing you would think about and uh n nitrogen is interesting in that life cannot absorb nitrogen directly it has to go through nitrogen fixing bacteria uh to and that and they they they are in Plants mostly in the roots of plants and the nitrogen fixers uh are what makes gives the nitrogen to life we can't we nit nitrogen is a is a really really weird element uh but nitrogen NO2 n nitrogen nitrogen dioxide it would be called uh we can't metabolize it it has to be broken down by microscopic life forms in order for us to to be able to live so I see after learning all these things um it's just so clear to me that we we are not evil uh in in the collective sense uh but at the same time we there is this ma Mass confusion issue where people dress up in weird costumes and glue themselves to roads and throw tomato juice at Mona Lisa and all this ridiculous stuff you know I mean it's absolutely ridiculous but and what they're what they want I'm not quite sure they keep saying they want the climate to get better but it is a fact that we are a tropical species and we would also well the environmentalists also tend to be stridently anti-nuclear which is extremely strange if their primary concern is actually carbon dioxide so you know that's a real that's a real conundrum in my estimation because that seems like an obvious Way Forward if if that's actually your concern I mean you can you can have an intelligent debate about the relative merits of nuclear but if you're convinced that carbon dioxide is going to destroy the planet then nuclear seems a perfectly reasonable alternative but the greens also fulminate actively against nuclear plants and are having them closed down in places like California and and in Germany much to the detriment both of the economy and the environment the Germans turned to burning lignite because they closed their because they closed their nuclear plants which is so they managed to come out of the the green energy movement producing more carbon dioxide more particulate matter less energy less reliable energy they increased their dependence on the fascist regimes that provide fossil fuels like Russia and they Quint toppled the price of energy so that's nobody nobody said logic would Prevail that's for sure because the real the real problem is is in the beginning the the the political side of of the movement Associated nuclear war and nuclear power right right and they should nuclear nuclear energy should be in the same category as nuclear medicine not as nuclear war right nuclear yeah nuclear energy is one of the the most wonderful things and we've had 30 years of stagnation and even reduction there's over still over aund 100 reactors in North America and not one person has died from nuclear plant in North America Three Mile Island didn't kill anybody Fukushima didn't kill anybody it was a comedy of stupid idity that Fukushima thing that first they built four reactors 8 feet above sea level where they knew there had been tsunamis in the past second right that seems like a bad idea yeah the backup generators for if the the uh plant went down which they had to at the earthquake they had to shut all the plants down but they also lost access to the grid the power lines went down so they all they had was their backup diesel generators they started them up everything worked fine for an hour but guess where the diesel generators were in front of the reactors towards the sea on skids they weren't even nailed down they didn't have any houses around them and the gas tanks the diesel tanks were connected by a hose and they were also on their own set of skids and the tsunami came and just took them up in the mountain somewhere and that was the end of that and then one by one they melted down and then even stupider each of those glass Towers those are the westing house style of reactor the G the GE ones are sorry those are the GE reactor no yes that's right the westing house one is the one with the Dome like Three Mile Island uh and all that is is a protection from the weather the reactor is is is down low and and surrounded by a concrete structure so those are just in case there's a leak and they don't want water falling on the reactor or whatever and the but when the melted a core produces hydrogen by the disassociation of water because the the cladding around the fuel is a is is a catalyst for water separation so it makes hydrogen which goes up into those towers and as soon as hydrogen gets to 8% any spark causes a massive explosion and they let that happen three times in a row on three separate days because thee Minister you see in in the United States at least probably Canada too if there's an accident at a nuclear plant the head of the plant phones the prime minister or the president and briefs them on what's Happening and what he is doing about it in Japan you breef them on what's Happening and then ask permission if you can do some things and he said no to the breaching of those Towers because he didn't want those uh the the radiation that was in them to get get out three m Island just if let it get out Three Mile Island would have blown up too if they had not let the hydrogen out and there's so little radiation there's so little radiation it isn't even consequential and this whole fear of radiation is just another fear of an invisible thing that you can't see what it's doing and and and the rules have been made so strict that it's almost doubled the price of building and maintaining nuclear reactors which is absolutely unnecessary whereas with windmills and solar panels they're getting massive subsidies uh and and China's strategy is to build lots of solar panels and windmills for themselves and then export even more than that and Tack another 10% onto them so theirs are pretty well free and that that's what's going on there this whole thing about electric vehicles I mean I thought it was a free country but not when it comes to CO2 so we are allowing carbon dioxide which is actually one of the most important and benign substances in this world absolutely the most essential element for life because we are carbon-based life all life is carbon based and there is absolutely no evidence that it is having any effect whatsoever on the temperature theoretically it might have a little bit but it doesn't show in the record that has any significant there's obviously many other things that are far more important in in in determining the temperature of the earth and one of them is the position of the tectonic plates these cycles that we've seen the ice ages and such that the oceans are ocean currents on top and Diving below at the poles when it reaches four degrees C I mean it's it's all water is also the only liquid that gets lighter as it gets colder that's why it any other liquid that the the the solid would float go to the bottom so if if water acted like any other element any other liquid the The Ice would have built up to within about 15 feet of the surface that's all you'd have and right life may not have evolved in the oceans under those circumstances let's review Patrick because we're going to run out of time and I want to just make sure that we've covered everything and give you a chance to make a few final comments as well so we started out by talking about the fact that we have decent records of both climate and atmosphere over about a half a billion year period and that was about the time when multicellular life evolved and we can detect atmospheric change and temperature looking at uh the remnants of life in the in the sary strata and using um the the activity of activity of elements that decay in a radioactive and predictable Manner and what we see across that large period of time are three things we see a a planet that's often much warmer than it is now up to 7 degrees warmer and that's a planet where life is perhaps even more abundant because of the additional warmth we see an atmosphere that almost across that entire span has far more carbon Dio than it does now and we see very little evidence of a profound relationship between carbon dioxide proportion and temperature and then okay okay so good we've got that we've got that established and now over the last two and a half million years we're in an Ice Age the place to scene and that ice age is characterized by periodic movements forward of the ice and recession and there's been about 40 of them and at the moment we're actually in a a period That's not only cold by immense standards hundreds of millions of years but relatively cold by the Pline standard and also characterized by an almost fatal absence of carbon dioxide that so we're close to the point where plants start to get desperate and we're already at the point where if you give them more carbon dioxide they actually grow a lot better and so what we're actually doing by burning fossil fuels is returning to the atmosph spere the carbon dioxide that was actually sequestered in the remains of plants and giving the plants an opportunity to flourish which is what they're doing in consequence of carbon dioxide production as we know because an area the size of the United States has greened in the last two decades and our crops are actually more abundantly productive than they have been and then we all that all of that is true okay and then we also pointed to the fact that in the 1960s and then again in the 1980s an environmental movement that had its utility because human beings should act as stewards for the planet got demented first by the overpopulation Advocates who were freaking out about like Paul erck about something that just not only was not going to occur but didn't occur which was the widespread famine that was predicted in consequence of the population explosion combined with the incursion of the marxists into the environmental movement and a kind of phobia about industrial activity and nuclear activity that developed in Tandem and so here we are now spending Untold tens of billions of dollars fighting against an invisible enemy that can't be measured properly that is actually more likely to be in the final analysis our Ally there's no doubt whatsoever there's no doubt whatsoever that our emissions of CO2 are the salvation of life on Earth The Next interglacial Period the next glacial maximum which is expected to be about 70,000 years from now it would go below 150 if it had continued on the same path it was on I've got the graph made out very clearly that it would it might take two more inter two more glacial uh maximums for it to get to the earth dying but it would get to the earth dying there was no way that that was going to be stopped after 150 million years of continuous decline I'd like to talk just for a minute about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and and the issue of Pacific of of plastic in the oceans it's nothing but beneficial in the oceans in the same way that Driftwood is is beneficial in the oceans and actually many species of wood have toxic substances in them to prevent them from rotting like like Cedar for example and Redwood they have quite a few toxic substances in them and they won't build playgrounds with them anymore in case the children bite the wood or whatever they're supposed to do um but the fact is there's two reasons why Driftwood is important in the sea first it becomes a habitat or a feeding ground for many many species of marine life but muscle especially uh deep sea uh Barnacles goose neck Barnacles they just grow all over them and then other things eat those and so there's there's nothing wrong with it whatsoever and that of course they say it turns toxic when it goes in the ocean and I go yeah are you kidding we wrap all our food in plastic to keep it from becoming contaminated and then you say when it goes in the ocean it becomes a toxic Hazard like give me a break it doesn't change its chemistry it's one of the most inert things in the world you keep saying it takes 2,000 years to break down and then you say it's all turned to microplastic and it's getting lodged in the livers and kidneys of fish which is another lie because microplastic of course is invisible and no one's ever actually found any but uh but the other wonderful thing is that the Pacific Garbage Patch is a fake doesn't exist go on the internet and look for images of the Pacific Garbage Patch and you will see that they are all photoshopped there's not a single one of them that shows an actual patch of plastic twice the size of Texas which is what they said but nobody can see it so it might as well be invisible just like polar bears and coral reefs it's in that's that's why I titled my book f invisible catastrophes and threats of Doom because all of the all of these socalled catastrophy stories are based on things that are either invisible or are remote I call it the universal theory of scare stories and there's this this fantasy in physics that there will be a universal Theory of Everything someday like time all the different right right right I doubt I doubt that'll happen but I don't think the world is that unified uh to be able to do that but it is true that uh the universal theory of scare stories is a fact that they are do they deal with all of them deal with things that are either invisible or remote or in the case of GMOs non-existent and then the other thing is is that seabirds benefit from plastic immensely all birds have a gizzard and they don't have teeth so they have to swallow things whole some of them have sharp beaks to tear things apart but they still have to take big gulps and if it's something that can't be easily digested in an acid stomach which they also have they have two stomachs one like ours and another one though where they they Shorebirds I mean landbirds and Shorebirds put Pebbles they all their life they swallow Pebbles as the grinding agent in their gizzard and when the chicks are on the nest they have to bring pedals Pebbles to the chicks well Albatross and other seabirds there's no Pebbles out in the ocean there so they use pmus as their favorite thing but it's not available all the time because it comes from under sea volcanoes that aren't erupting all the time but when they find that they make a cach of it and the other thing they use is bits of wood that are of the appropriate size and shape and today bits of plastic of the appropriate size and shapee and there's one picture of a mother albatross giving not feeding that awful man in England who does the BBC scare stories about walruses committing suicide uh because of plastic or something I forget what he said it was it was because of pack of polar bears were going to eat them and they decided they'd rather fall off a cliff than be eaten alive by polar bear uh but uh but all over the world seabirds are using bits of plastic as a substitute for the other rare things that they have to find for their chicks and then what's his name the TV personality on BBC who does the nature bonor yes he's a fake and he he says he he shows a young woman as assistant of his holding up a big clear plastic bag saying this plastic bag was given to the chick and when the chick died we did an autopsy and we found this plastic bag in the chick it's a total lie no mother Albatross or father Albatross would give a plastic bag to its chick what they give is little pieces of uniformly sized Plastics that go into the gizard and and do when they when they give a whole squid to a bird a baby and and themselves The Squid gets ground up and the poop gets pooped out but the beak stays in there as a grinding agent so that's one of the way one of the ways they get a hard object in there and uh it it's fascinating but the Smithsonian goes along with the story that they're feeding plastic to their chicks uh and it and that it's a negative thing it's been studied for 50 years and no one's ever found a negative thing about it it's just a substitute for all the other little hard objects that they've got in their in their region and and and as I say there there's it's rare to find Pebbles on a Windswept Rocky island and that's just the way it is and they should be telling people that it's a great story that that our little bits of plastic are be are useful and there is no Pacific Garbage Patch one only one picture on the internet that I found I've looked all over for the Pacific garbage patch on on the images in the internet and there's one that shows a massive area of debris over the ocean and a diver coming up and underneath it says part of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch I studied that photo for a little while and realized there's mountains in the background right in the background there's no mountains in the middle of Pacific Ocean it's the debris from the tsunami that killed 18,000 people and they're using it to lie about the plastic Garbage Patch because there there was 20 towns swept into the ocean and and 18,000 people killed the the the nuclear plant didn't kill anybody but CNN had a headline in the middle of of that disaster and but it wasn't a disaster from a human life point of view two people did die they were Swept Away by the tsunami but uh on the headline said nuclear crisis deepens as bodies wash ashore that was the headline right right right right right and I I've looked it up and it's gone I guess they decided it wasn't really a very good thing for people to know about because imagine that blaming blaming the the 18,000 bodies on the nuclear disaster so that's the kind of thing we've got going in this world these days and I'm doing everything I can to try to straighten it out and I I think you you saw my presentation I cover a wide number of topics and I do not believe for a minute that these scare stories are true uh like what is it in the GMO that you're that this is a multi-billion dollar anti-gmo campaign where the Europeans are refusing to buy crops from Africa if they adopt the improved product when in fact every single one of us is genetically modified none of us are identical to our parents that's what sexual reproduction is mixes the genes up and all they're doing is very methodically taking a gene that they know exactly what it does in the species they're taking it from and putting it into one that doesn't have it and that's what golden rice is all about I work I I campaigned for five years on Golden rice I came back into into the movement in 2013 and my brother and my wife and I and got a team of people from Germany and India and and and and and and Australia and went to all the Greenpeace office locations and demonstrated in front of them and got to 30 million people by the media but it didn't it just then we couldn't do it because they've they've got control of the environmental apparatus the governments uh in the same way as this whole uh so-called what do they call it I forget the name of of what they what the the movement what's the name of the movement woke that's right the movement I I I probably want to forget the word yeah because it's so stupid but there just they're they're they every anything but woke and and just don't have lost all scientific and and communicative uh faculties uh they they they're insane uh it's some kind of mental disease as for from from my way of thinking and the the climate thing is no different than all of these other social and political things I mean Equity yeah sure that's a good word but they're using it like a sledgehammer and because all people aren't the same and and and and good good for that I we don't want all people to be the same and and to to say that white people are all racist if that isn't racist I don't know what is h how how can anybody think that way well this is the mystery that we're trying to unpack with with podcasts exactly like this yeah yeah well all right sir we should we should stop this um for everybody watching and listening I'm going to continue to talk to Dr Patrick Moore for another half an hour on the daily wire side and I think I'm going to talk to him at least in part about the consequences of putting himself outside the more radical um faction of the environmentalist movement so that should be a fascinating discussion and if you want to join us on the daily wire side and throw some support their way they make these podcasts a consequence of their generosity and uh and have helped me a lot to expand the professionalism of the of the production and to distribute the content to a hypothetically wider audience Dr Moore thank you very much for talking to me today and for walking through all that complex material for shedding a bit more light on the relationship between um the lengthy history of the world the climate variation that's been part and parcel of that since day one the composition of the atmosphere the relationship between the atmosphere and climate and also the pathologies of what would you say the modern politicization of the environment mental movement much appreciated sir and uh for everybody watching and listening thank you for your time and attention the film crew here in Jacksonville Florida because that's where I am today thank you very much for your help Dr Moore we'll take five and then we'll reconvene on The Daily wi side thanks Dr Peterson it's been a [Music] pleasure
