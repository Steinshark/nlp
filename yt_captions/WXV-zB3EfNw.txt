Have you ever gone down to make a comment on a video and thought, oh my God, there's already so many. Who is ever gonna read this? The answer is me. Believe it or not, I spend hours every week reading your comments. Everything from constructive feedback to positive vibes about your new favorite LTT member to yes, even really mean personal attacks. Some of which have gotten pretty creative by the way, which is why it's time for another round of Linus reads mean comments. But it's not all me this year. You name a host, we found a roast and we'll be getting reactions from the others as well. So buckle up and put on your protective eyewear because this is gonna hurt a little, a lot. What won't hurt is telling you about our sponsor, Laifen. Look, none of us actually enjoy going to the dentist. So why don't you keep those visits to the bare minimum by taking care of your teeth with the Laifen Wave. Click the link below or keep watching to learn more. All you got to do is read those.  You make it sound so easy. Delusional Linus thinks killing babies should be a constitutional
right. What a father. The earrings and socks with sandals makes sense now? Wow, you really aren't pulling any punches, hey?  Not this time. Swipe for more. Damn, looking back, Jake has really let himself go. Jesus, I actually lost weight. I've lost 70 pounds in a year. Damn, f*** you Gio, that's wrong. Damn, Dennis' Canadian accent's actually getting really good. Really, what's the Canadian accent? I don't think people will agree with you. Oh yeah, bud, just give her. Can I get my double-double? I don't know why, but I just can't believe anything Plouffe tells me. I think he's testing me, wanting to see if he can make me buy things I regret. I'm not testing you. I just, I don't know. That's a weird one. I
don't even know how to respond to that. I thought these were going to be mean. Who decided to name their girl child Butt? It's my last name. I didn't have a choice. My parents didn't have a
choice. And also, I kind of like my last name, so f*** you. A blonde guy with a ginger beard. That's a bold choice. It's a bolder choice to assume I'm blonde. I've never been blonde.
My hair, not blonde. My hair's not even red. It's, it's like decidedly brown most of the
time. James and Riley. That's not how you spell it. Talking about each
other looks is ironic since they are perfect examples of how the genetic pool in Canada seems
more like a genetic puddle. What does that mean? I mean, Riley and I look very different from
each other, so. I don't know what to say. I think that means there's a lot of genetic diversity here. This is not like it's Iceland where we need an app to know who's related or not. I feel like if you're writing a comment to criticize James and I commenting on each other's looks, you know, that's fair enough. That's not something you should do. And even less so should you comment on the genetic puddle of Canada, which is objectively not shallow, okay? All right, moving on. This comment just says Dennis. Does he think I am Dennis? Is it just 'cause we're both minorities here at LMG? He's like, "Oh, well that must be Dennis." 'Cause we don't look alike at all. He's not even in that video. He is not in that video. It's me unboxing a phone and talking about a Xiaomi phone. Who would say something mean about Dennis, exactly. But I can also understand people who... don't know me and can maybe can find me a little bit different. So this kid was like a make-a-wish hire, right? Yeah, I can't even argue with that one. It's fine Colin, I'll read them for you. It says Linus is Skipper, Jake is Kowalski, Elijah is Private, and
Colin is Rico. The Penguins of Madagascar. It's a movie, okay. What a menace. Is James capable of reading instructions at all? Hey, I remember this one. That was not my fault. Yes, I actually, usually on any kind of build project, I'm the person who wants to read the instructions. But for you people at home, sometimes it's more fun if we don't. Plouffe man, I'm sorry. Just can't stand this guy. That's okay. I'm like a combination of Alex, Riley, and James. Yes, that is a complement with a E and not I. What does that mean? You're just a white dude, like? I'm also just confused about why you're volunteering this information. Hey everybody, I'm like a combination of Alex, Riley, and James. What does that mean? He's like a tall, engineering, funny, good-looking guy. Describing Tynan. Damn. Linus got hot. I love Linus's final form. More Tynan, please. The amount of thirst in some of the comments boggles my mind sometimes. Maybe it's just me? I don't know. Thank you. Wow, okay. This just says car guy, but car is in quotations. What the f*** Angel? Who hurt you? What are you, a Honda guy? Jesus. Hey, hey, hey, shut your mouth. Linus hired Badger from Breaking Bad. I've never seen Breaking Bad. Who's Badger? You're telling me I look like this guy? Who is this? The only clear thing is Alex it's not the most skilled guy. If you're going to try and roast me like that, at least get your f***ing grammar correct. Jake and Riley, team awkward. That I agree with actually. This video, the eBay refurbished one, that is every day with Riley and I just trying to out awkward each other. You betcha. Let's go. Haha. See, I just did it. I'm glad our awkwardness was able to shine through whatever sponsor
talking points that video had was. Your opinions on the buying games and parts or as a whole were
total f***ing dog s***. You're cracked out of your gourd on meth. You should not be that out of touch with the value of $80. Okay, one moment for a second here. We'll slow down Linka. I'm talking about a thing that is already happening. Look at Final
Fantasy 7 remaster. This ain't hypothetical. Jeez. I didn't buy it. I waited. I'm not out of touch with the
value. It's a lot of money. Plouffe just loves anything that is a pointless gimmick, doesn't he?
I kind of do. That's like 100% true. If it's a weird gimmick and makes something unique, I'm all for it. Real fans remember the LTT 8K fireplace video,  where James panics halfway through because a burning log fell on the rug that they borrowed and no
one noticed for like 20 minutes. And that wasn't just a rug, that was a beaver pelt? It was very nice and luxurious that my father-in-law lent me for
the shoot and I was pretty horrified when I took that log off there's just like a perfect charred
rectangle in it like basically ruined it. It combed out a bit but honestly what a, bless him, he
either wasn't that mad or really contained it because I panicked a little more than uh seemed
necessary in the end.  Oh wow all caps. Would you- I think I have to yell it. Would you please stop putting
Riley in every sponsor read! You know he's on the list right? Can't say which one or I'll get my
comment removed! By he who shall not be named. Santa. He's making a list.  Imagine being a ginger and thinking I want more of this just to be extra virgin. You know people pay more for the extra virgin olive oil
right?  You definitely get state aid for hiring mental handicapped. Are you talking about Linus or me? Colin must be either Dutch or Belgian, and if his English isn't as
good he's probably Belgian. F***ing hell, two times ads? Get real you greedy potato! Okay, for one thing we've done two sponsor reads in our videos for nine years. If you are just noticing now, you might be the kind of
person who comments before finishing the video. She laughs a lot, but I get the impression she is an
absolutely formidable human. Is this a compliment? Um, thank you? I've heard laughing
makes you a happier person and makes you live longer, so I'll probably live longer than you. Average Discord mod. I don't, can I know what video this is from? No.  I did, like, I was the admin of our Discord for a very long
time, so I guess? I feel like Tynan had an interesting and unique childhood compared to the rest of us.
You're probably not that wrong, but also a little bit wrong.  Very disappointed. Plouffe should not be reviewing keyboards. Wow, that's actually, okay, that's, that one's kind of rough. You know,
I own a lot of keyboards.  I've built a lot of keyboards. There's not a lot of things that I'm
like, yeah, I know what I'm talking about. Keyboards are kind of one of them, so.  I thought Elijah was some annoying autistic or ADD kid in the last tech upgrade video. I had no idea he worked for LTT.  Yeah, I was just Alex's little buddy or whatever.  I don't know if I can watch Alex destroy perfectly fine hardware anymore. And that one really hurt me too. That was a difficult video. For the
most part, I really like making things that are like, they split janky, and it's kind of a good
idea. And that one after Linus separated the heat pipes by doing what me and Nate said he shouldn't, was just so bad. Oh my God, it was awful. I can't believe it worked at all. Sarah has done hot knives before. You can just tell. Um, no comment. Disliking every video you have Riley in! We all know why, Mr. 500 feet! You're a liar. I, we don't all know why. I wish I did. Okay, this person is definitely, uh. I feel like he f***ing hates Tanner, LMAO. I feel like that a little bit sometimes too, I'm just testing him. Colin is the single person on this channel who has had more character development with each video, all without even saying a word. I feel like James and Tynan either really get along or really don't. We hate each other. We, for the most part, get along pretty well. Cringe hentai lovers creating the titles these days, huh? Yeah. There's a nice one! Nobody more deserving, ElectroBoom has done so
much. Thanks LTT. Not true. I'm just pointing out how out of touch LTT are by giving upgrades
to rich people, or staff, or the host's wife instead of regular poor people. ROG Rig Reboot anyone? Jeez!  I love you guys except Dennis. He's a c***. Why? What did I do to you? Why are you so angry?  Seriously, the only person on this channel who deserves any hate, any at all, is Jake. He can be pretty annoying,
but at least he tries. This is so mean. Like, what did I do to hurt you? There's definitely reasons you could hate me, but I feel like some
of those reasons probably apply to other people, right? Please, for the love of God, get that bomb CX-500 out of that
induction forge. You picked the one PSU that is known to literally explode. On the bright side, if that power supply explodes, that's the least
damaging thing in the induction heater to actually blow up. Oh my God. Jake is like Nolan from Donut Media, dipped in a vat of bleach. Mentally abusive to his wife. What video is this on? We can make jokes. If this was not presented by the unlikable douche, I really could have enjoyed this. Well, I'm just very complimented that you didn't say an unlikable douche, I am the unlikable douche, and I really want that on a shirt now. Nick, please. See, now this comment threw me for a loop because the first part
says, "Who likes Riley?" And then the second part says, "What a dork." So I didn't like how much of a ride that comment was. Putting helmets on people who are not truly handicapped is not
funny. That wasn't the point. We weren't making a handicap joke. It was just, I hit my head. It was protecting me. When did Yvonne get Linus pregnant? What is that from? You're not going to give me any context? I mean, Shizzy Wizzy didn't bother to leave a timestamp. She's fun. I like her. I hope she goes far in life. Are these supposed to be mean comments? I'm confused. This is so sweet. Thank you. Plouffe is like sliced bread. Gets boring and stale. Man, and this is where I'm wearing my nice shirt too, with the pink hat and everything. I'm not boring. Andy, am I boring? Added flavor. Sarah is such a fun host. Dennis, in contrast, is really cringe
most of the time and always looks like he's trying to appear dumb.  Dennis is an amazing human being and this person is just wrong. I'm pretty sure in this video I was pretty useful, I was
building the desk. Everything, I wasn't trying to be anything. I'm just doing my job, trying to
build the desk. Tanner, if you're reading this, I am, you gotta lose that homeless
leprechaun beard. Look, I work at a place where 90% of the people here look so much
like me that we could all be mistaken for one another in a police lineup. How old is she? 10? Most brainless review ever. Giggling,
nonsensical, and, and then that's where the comment is cut off. Yeah, this is my first ShortCircuit ever. I was really nervous. I agree, not a great review, but I think I've improved quite a bit,
so... How much do you receive from, comma, the government to keep Elijah
hired? Is Linus getting payments from the government for me? Lots. I can't trust Plouffe on anything purely based on how he pronounces
"gif". Yeah, you know what? I don't care. I don't care if it's "gif". I
know it's graphical. You know what? The guy who invented it says it's pronounced "jif",
so suck on that. Jake's mouth has eyebrows. Mouth has... Oh, the mustache! Oh, it's because it's a little bit not filled out here. Yeah, okay, f*** you too. Oh, are you? Good. Good for you, you rich f***. I wasn't born into money, you know? I actually still work a nine to five, you know? Sorry, what is even the context here? Oh, is it I'm keeping the world's biggest TV? Probably. Look, did you click the title? Wow, new low for LMG. No helmet for James? Unbelievable. You're right, I should have worn a helmet. There's no excuse to not wear a helmet. I've been in a biking accident and hit a car like a fricking dart. And I was very happy to have a helmet on. I believe in helmets. Everyone should wear a helmet. No need to yell at me Riley, there is actually, you know what you
did. Why was Riley's end segue so loud? Because I need to get your attention. You know what you did too. All of you. I like red shirt guy, he isn't an awkward idiot like Alex. Now at first I thought this was referring to Jake and I took a bit
of offense but then I saw that the red shirt guy is Dan and we all like Dan, fair
enough dude. Unusually wide hips as a man. No wonder people thought you were a
lesbian. That is my physiology, sir. I will not apologize for my body. I show my wife the take makeover with Dennis's neon sign and now
she only refers to him as oh my god It's Live Laugh Liao! Thank you for Grapefruit's Zulu wife. I love you, too. I am surprised Plouffe hasn't sticker bombed his car. Okay, the funny thing is I actually, I love sticker bombing stuff. I hate bumper stickers. I can't stand it. Cars, I like 'em clean. I don't know, it's weird. Alex is too awkward to be in front of camera. I've told you before, listen up idiots. This is from the ASML tour, which I frankly think is a fantastic video. And if you think that it is not a good video, you are an idiot 'cause you did not understand what I was talking about. You shouldn't call your mom a f***ing idiot, even if she is. Okay. What she did was f***ing idiotic. She's not an idiot. If anything, I get any intelligence that I got from her. Why does Tanner look like he's held hostage? Because I am in a constant state of discomfort. I'm uncomfortable right now. Dennis is gonna have a blast once he gets to take this home. Actually, I don't have the space for this massage chair. I have it. And Andy got it from a Christmas prize, from Christmas prize. I live in a small apartment, so I'm okay. Andy can enjoy it. It's pretty comfy. Linus, your daughter seems a lot more sensible than you. Well, she's half Yvonne, so that explains a lot. Tanner looks so scared when you asked him to celebrate better, lol. I'm really not good at faking emotion. I'm barely good at showing
genuine emotion. My god, that cat is an absolute unit. Arlo is the most amazing, magnificent creature in this entire
world, and I'm glad he gets the appreciation that he deserves. You're becoming a spoiled little brat. It says two days ago, so
this must have been a recent video. Like, we're definitely spoiled, that's just kind of the nature of
working for a tech media company. But at the same time, it's not so much spoiled, it's like you just
get desensitized to how insane some of the technology we're using really is. Especially to people that haven't played with some of this stuff,
so, I mean, fair. I don't think I'm a brat, though. I bet Plouffe's keyboard is worth more than his car. They're
actually not too far off. Imagine having Linus as your boss. Unsufferable. The word you're
looking for is insufferable. I would rather go without $5,000 rather than have Linus in my house
all day. Well, that's good, because I don't want to give you $5,000.  Sarah was brought in to ensure that Dennis could complete the video. Um, I kind of don't remember what exactly is going on with this
desk. I remember it was a lot of work, but Sarah did help a lot. Like, 20%. Thanks, Dennis. Oh my gosh, she's here! Oh no! At least Linus hires mentally handicapped people. Very progressive
of Linus. I don't think I could take much more than 20 minutes of this guy.
If you think that, you're probably right. Any Tanner on camera is too much Tanner on camera. You know what? I
completely agree with you, and that's why I am very glad that Full House and ALF are both off
the air. Too many Tanners on screen. It's way too many. He was talking about me, wasn't he? I mean, obviously, it's gonna fall short of the 5,500 pounds of
German engineering I drive today. For the last remaining three people that didn't
think Linus was a douche. Elijah, can you come here for a second? I'm detecting some confirmation bias here. Did you just search for the word douche? I searched keywords and then looked for comments. Yeah, was douche one of them? Douche may have been one of the keywords at some point. Thanks. You're welcome. Talk to you later. Oh, this one's just straight up. Riley is a bad host. Okay. You try. Plouffe's monitors are worth more than his car. This is 100% true. I have the AW3423DW. My name is Plouffe and I have an AW3423DW at home. Dumb YouTuber, stop spreading false lies. Wait, what are you talking about? This was about the potential malware in those cheap Android- That's not a lie. I'm damned if I do, I'm damned if I don't. Okay, you know what?
Fine. Here's a new version of that video. Go buy whatever cheap pirate software Android box you want. There's
no way that it'll be full of any spyware or malware. Enjoy! Every time I hear Riley, my cring-o-meter blows up. Do you need a cring-o-meter? Like you don't, you can't tell if
something's cringe just on your own? Still not convinced after all this time that Tanner isn't Mike
Myers undercover or a pentavarite agent. When I was a teenager, I used to get the comment that I look like
Mike Myers very frequently. So I thought, you know what? I'm gonna grow my hair out. People won't say I look like Mike Myers. Then they continued to do so. So I grew out a grotesque beard. Maybe this will make me not look like Mike Myers. And there is nothing I can do to make myself not look like Mike Myers. Hate Linus's bad boss attitude. We were unboxing a CPU. Is this just 'cause I wouldn't buy two of them for Jake? I'm sorry. This video inspired me to shout "Penis" at Dennis at LTX. It got
his attention. What? Did you do that? I mean, if someone shout "Penis" in public, you probably would look
back. Tynan is the epitome of smart enough to know better, stupid enough
to do it anyway. Yeah, I think I might need to make that my tagline. Why hasn't James being fired yet? Because I can write. Is Elijah single? 'Cause I'd like him as my upgrade. What the f*** does that even mean? I promise you, you don't have to pay me $5,000. I'd do it for a lot cheaper. Linus, I gotta tell you, what are you doing employing that idiot Alex man he brings you down, G. Whenever like Linus or anyone that is hosting a video says things that are smart, it's not just because they are smart, even though Linus is a smart dude, but also because someone has spent weeks preparing the things that he is saying. Holy s*** wow, this is a long one. LTT, please read, "I would fire Jake. Jake is a useless tool. He
takes advantage of Linus's good nature. I don't know if it is scripted like he's supposed to be the village
idiot, and he's just hired to piss off Linus in each take. Either way,
it's annoying, frustrating, and I've worked with people exactly like Jake. They typically
accomplish about 25% of what you ask them. Sorry, Jake." I don't do anything at all during the day. I mostly just watch
memes on my computer. Linus isn't watching this, right? I think Dennis should do keyboard reviews. Plouffe is too much of a
keyboard snob. That's not fair. You know, you can like something that's really
good. Like I can like fine dining. My dad's a chef. I love to eat nice, but I also go to McDonald's sometimes. There's
nothing wrong with that. Lol, a hundred dollars for a screwdriver is worth it? In whose
world? Cost you five to ten dollars to make it and your markup is ridiculous. Okay, first things first, the screwdriver cost way more than five to ten dollars. You know how I know? Go buy one for five to $10. I'll wait. Find one? Does it have a ratchet? Does it have high quality bits? Was it tested by Project Farm and found to be fricking awesome? Yeah, I didn't think so. The f***? Are you Linus and James's son? I kind of see it, but generic white guy with a beardism much? It's good to see that nowadays it seems that so many writers are
actually prepared and seem to have all the stuff together before shooting a
video. But sometimes I do wish Riley would make another PC building vid
with everything going wrong, you know great fun to dot dot dot, read more, the first comment is
Riley is literally their worst host lol. This is just just this is just low effort like get creative, you know  if any employees steals you need to fire them why should
we support a business who lets employees steal? Why support thieves? I agree, this is a totally reasonable sentiment. You shouldn't
steal. I just do it anyways. Shame video preview wasn't just picking a lot of Alex the video was
full of that annoying unfunny tool, space full stop. Such a shame. Space full stop. Riley with his worst jokes is more entertaining,
space full stop. My opinion don't like, I don't care. Not everyone can be pleased with everyone, space full stop. Dude It's a video about a fan that can actually chop your hand off. I greatly enjoyed watching Linus torture SBF's little brother
throughout this episode. This is from that one reddit post where someone said oh my gosh Sam
Bankman Freed works at LTT because I had my afro. I'm not Sam Bankman, okay? He went to jail. I got out. Oh this. This is the best way to get a tax write-off, could turn anything
into a tax write-off, does labs exist solely as a tax write-off? That is not how that
f***ing works! A tax write-off doesn't mean you didn't spend the money!  If I get- Someone give me money. Give me a money. I'm gonna give you guys a little lesson.  This is a crisp fake Benjamin. If I have paid all my other business expenses and I make this money I take it home.  Or well, at least after the Taxman takes his pretty close to 50% cut.  Okay, I made 50 bucks. That's great. Hold on a second. I have a business expense. This time I need to buy a filming slate. I'm gonna spend that money. That $50 is gone, but I've got this slate and I've still got 50
bucks. That's my profit. Oh, wait,  I still pay taxes on the part that was profit The only money that didn't get taxed was the money that I spent on
an asset that the business, a separate legal entity now owns. It's not a way of making more f***ing money!  And now I need another slate! Dang it!  That's okay, I'll just visualize a new one. Virtual slate. Ah,
much better. Now it's time to visualize a segue to our sponsor. Laifen. Oral hygiene is no joke, and Laifen knows this. That's why
they've got the all-new Laifen Wave toothbrush. Their proprietary servo system vibrates the soft tapered bristles
at speeds of up to 66 thousand vibrations per minute which is, a lot of vibrations maybe
even good ones. Its dual action rotation though is the special sauce with its 60
degree oscillation range. That is three times wider than some of their leading competitors.
And what's even better, is that their brush head replacements aren't going to cost you an
arm and a leg or a tooth. The unit itself is designed to have no gaps in its aluminum alloy
handle for residue to build up in and at a height of just around 140 millimeters tall it's
built to be ergonomic, and convenient for travel. And if you're into customizing your
brushing routine their companion app has three settings with 10 different levels of intensity for a
total of a thousand different combinations so you can tailor your experience to your preferences.
So keep your teeth clean by checking out the Laifen Wave at the link down below. Well, the ones for me were brutal, but it was nice to see some
positive comments about the rest of the team. Thanks again, everyone who enjoyed the video. Um, like, leave a
comment. We really do read them. They can be very helpful and inspirational, just like this inspirational video that you guys can go check out. The last time
we did this, four years ago. Really? Time goes by way too fast.
