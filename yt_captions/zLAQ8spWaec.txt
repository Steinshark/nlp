hey go 21 the 1.21 has been released as of today is it really today yeah today's the eighth the go team is thrilled to announce go 1.21 which can uh you can get by visiting the download page go to uh I don't I actually have no idea why I just growled right there uh go 1.21 is Pat I'm just gonna call It Go 21 okay everyone uh we're packed with new features and improvements here are some notable changes all right tool improvements the profile guided optimization feature we announced uh for preview in 1.20 is now generally available I really hope they have Arena allocations come on Arena allocations uh if a file name to default for go is present in the package directory the go command will use it to enable Pogo build see the Pogo uh documentation for more details cool interesting the go tool now supports backers a two to seven percent Improvement in performance that's huge when it comes to like servers if you could a magically get seven percent better things on large in like large companies that's great like language changes new built-in uh functions min max and clear is this due today now that they have generics you can just have generic min max is that what's happening here um min minute Max all right uh the built-in function's been in Max compute the smallest or largest respectively of the value okay of uh value of a fixed number of arguments ordered types okay oh interesting they actually have proper Min and Maxes let's go let's go go I appreciate that I appreciate that finally they're adding some basic functions to the language can't believe it this will make it go honestly a lot better several improvements to type inference for generic functions that's a description of type inference in the spec has been expanded and clarified nice I like to hear that in a future version of go we're planning to address one of the most common gotchas of go programming Loop variable capture 21 comes with a preview of that feature that you can enable in your code okay cool I I don't know that one but we can look at that one later actually let's look at it now what the hell is it what does it do um let's see what is the problem consider a loop like this okay we have an INT that we range over the test cases we run this one right here T parallel uh that must mean run in parallel uh V value does not equal oh is this like the old JavaScript problem too right is that what's happening V is just pegging to the end this aims uh to check that all the tests are uh are even they are not but it passes without uh go experimental Loop the problem is that t dot parallel stops the closure and lets the loop continue yep yeah this is like the cloud this is the Classic this is the classic right this used to get me in JavaScript remember where you'd have a JavaScript and you'd have like something go and then I would be the same for everything and you're like why every time I remember that okay cool all right I like that I like it uh very very cool uh let's see standard Library editions the new log slog package for structured logging beautiful love structure logging new slices packages for common operations on slices of any element type this includes sorting functions that are generally faster and more ergonomic than the sword package all right a new maps package for common operation on maps of any key and element type a new compare package with utilities for comparing ordered values very cool Ghost making a comeback ghost making a comeback okay I like this nice leveraging the generics uh they added yeah this is good copy um this is this gopium look at that Porco okay hey come on everyone knows that go go is going places okay improve performance in addition to the performance improvements when enabling Pogo uh the go compiler itself has been rebuilt with Pago enabled for uh like the compiler needs to be faster as a result go programs build two to four four percent faster that means your program's gonna build instead of 40 milliseconds it's gonna be 39.6 faster like oh cool cool I I noticed that um due to tuning of the garbage collector some applications may see up to a 40 reduction in tail latency oh that's incredible that is incredible because tail because that's really that's where all of your problems are your problem isn't in your median right it's in your it's in your 99 percentile right the 99 percentile is where it's all at right collecting traces with runtime Trace now incurs a substantially smaller CPU cost oh let's go uh Newport to Waze I uh go 21 ads experimental port for webassembly system interface preview one all right let's go with the goose uh to facilitating right uh writing more generalized General webassembly wasm code the compiler also supports a new directive for importing functions from wasm host go wasm import thanks everyone who contributed let's go actually this is really cool there's some really good stuff I I really do feel like go is hitting this really cool curve which it's it's gonna provide everything you want it's gonna have just enough generics it's super constrained in features it's very very simple and I just feel like there's going to be this curve that it's going to become a really amazing language and I think it's it's it's it's very very fast it's extremely it's it's so easy to get it right when writing parallelized code right just going go you know go Funk yourself going and writing these things there's no colored functions it just seems to be pretty good like I really like it there's a lot of really great reasons to like a go and so I'm happy about it um I'm very happy about it is unfathomably based it really is this was I'm ready uh wasm is on the cusp but I'm not sure if it's ready like I don't know I know I made it into I'm a meme I'm a meme boys I'm a meme in fireship's latest video I I that is most excellent um I finally made it I finally made it as a meme um anyways in essence it's grinding towards the 90 right point on the worst is better scale it is I think that it's doing exactly what you want because worse is better is a really good way to gauge making software and I do really think that go is is awesome right I think go is just the right you know it's just the right amount so I love it uh Hey thank you very much for listening this is some prime news we did look at this there's a little bit of news piece the name is the primogen the mimajin the I'm in the latest fireship video widget
