- Whoa, 24 hours in the desert. Let's do it. We are going to spend the
next 24 hours in the desert. - I'm hungry. Make me food. - We gotta build a camp first. - But I'm hungry.
- Okay. - Okay.
- Chris, make him food. - Noted. After I set up my tent.
- Thank you. - So Chris here finished his tent already, while Chandler and Beast are
still having some problems. - Yeah, I mean, this is good. - That's your tent, that's . - That's tough, we're
doing good, right, Chris? - Yeah. I mean. You take this in. And you're gonna put it
in this metal rod, right? See this metal rod? - Doesn't really matter, if you use it. - So Chris here used to be a boy scout. - Yes, sir. - He used to do this all the time. - Chris is the only reason we're gonna survive this challenge - I'm kind of feel like,
I'm part of something. What I'm gonna go do now
is find some dead sticks. Ooh. There's some sticks over there. - Oh, there goes Chris. Oh, bunch of sticks. Getting sticks.
- Aw, they all have thorns on them.
- I got them. - I've got wood. - Hey, hey. Go, Chris. - Oh, my gosh. Put it out. Someone. Help. - Get a water. - Key elements for fire
are flame, fuel and oxygen. - What'd you got there, Chandler? Chandler, show the world what we're gonna put in
our stomachs tonight. - So this is what we're gonna be eating. MREs. This is what the militaries eat. Meals ready... - To eat
- To eat. Sure. - We don't eat it anymore. - Here's your meal for the day. - Thank you
- Jake. Hope that has a lot of protein. - Beef ravioli and meat sauce That's mine. - What's this one. Pork sausage. Jake, you look like a sausage type of guy. What is this? So you literally just pour hot water on it and you're gonna get
Mexican-style chicken stew. - With your "Friends" t-shirt
in the middle of the desert. - Gotta represent. Savages - Comment how you think
Chris feels right now. A bunch of grown men,
depending on him for our lives. - This is the first meal. I've been letting this
water sit here and boil. - It's gonna blow up. - You just stir it around
and then you reseal it. And it cooks itself. Chandler has literally been
begging me the entire time and it's getting on my nerves. So Chandler's the next person. So if you guys are-
- All I have to do to get special priority is be annoying? - Yes.
- Okay. Noted. - Remember, Chandler.
- Yay. - We'll Remember, Chandler we all- - Yay.
- Shut up. We only get one. All right. It's time
for me to eat my meal. Actually, no joke it's really good. Wow. It's like a...
- Cool. We get it. It's good. You wanna flex on us more? - I literally made you food. Go get your own spoon. - That was my spoon. I opened the MRE. - I made the... I put your tent up. Then I made the fire. Then I boiled the water.
Then I made your food. - Oow. - I really feel like
Chandler's not contributing as part of the team. And he's relying on me to do everything. And then when he demands for a spoon after I cooked him his meal,
that ain't right, chief. What have you done for me? This is today. We're surviving. The life that we knew is gone. All right, Jimmy, this meal is for you. - Thank you, Chris.
- You're very welcome. - Next time I do a challenge, I think- I am not making it easier on you. - I wish I had popcorn for this. 'Cause this is entertainment. I know it's hard. There's
no microwave out here. Okay. - Or a McDonald's.
- Or McDonalds - Or cookout? Or literally the Burger King. - Yeah. He only eats like three foods. - Chris is making fun of me, 'cause I can't do anything on my own. Well, you can't. - Shut up. This is my interview. - You're doing okay over there, Chandler? Did you really just fart? - Yeah.
- Why did you fart? - You know, I don't know why everyone's just ganging up on me, man. It's just, I don't know, but I'm... I'm done.
- Hey. - I'm done.
- Hey, that's my phone. Guys, Chandler just took my phone. Chandler just took my phone. - Where's he going?
- I don't know. He just stormed off.
- Why? - Look at him. That's him right here. - Guys, Chandler ran away.
- We're sorry. - I promise not to make
fun of your next fart. - No. - Give me the camera. I'm
gonna go save Chandler. I'm coming to save you. What the was that? Chandler. Come back to the camp. - Are you gonna stop being mean to me? - Hey. It's a two-way street. - Who was I being mean to? - You farted, what do you expect? - Oh my God. - All right. Chandler, you're not allowed to storm off like that. - Well...
- Your dad would kill me. No more making fun of Chandler
for the next 10 minutes. - It's gonna be hard, but I'll try. - This is breakfast hash. So this is the last easy one to make. This is our last easy meal. The other ones are kind of complicated. So this is for the morning. This is mine. - What?
- This is mine. - What?
- This is for the morning. And he whispers, this is mine. - I made all of this. I eat what I want. - So Chris thinks just 'cause
he cooked all of us food. He gets to eat the rest of it. - I'm gonna be honest. Yes. Chris did a lot in setting up, but I really think it's
starting to go to his head. You built the tents. You made the food. You started the fire. You did everything. You don't have to rub it in our face, man. - I'm taking over this
kingdom when he's asleep. Chris dethroned. - Well, I'm about to make another big fire so that way they can sit around it. And I'm not getting cocky. I'm just saying, I like
breakfast. There's only one left. I think I should get it. I did everything. - That's . - What did you do? - I ate your food. - I came. - So, we are building a second fire here. Right here. - Of course, Chris is building it. Mr. Know-it-all. - You want me to not build it? - Oh, someone didn't take
this little packet out either. - Oh, that's not good. - Wait.
- This little guy. - Yeah.
- Oh, shit. - Is it open?
- That's poison. - No, but it says, "Do not eat." - Yeah. As long as it's
not open, you're fine. As long as you can feel
the beat, hand it to me. They're all in there still. - So apparently Chris left
some like poisonous stuff in my food and now he's
telling me to eat it. I think this is his way
of getting rid of me so he can have more food. - Wait, what's all that
in your cup, Tareq? - Is it ash?
- It's Ash. - It's fine. - Nobody else had ash
in their water or food. - Mine had it. - Mine had a bug in it and so did Jake. - Guys, if you don't see
me again, that's why. - We're in the wilderness. We're not at the Hotel
Tiffany's. Get over it, snowflake Snowflake. Audience, you see this? If I get sick, I'm suing Chris. - Okay. Not gonna lie.
I forgot to pack a belt and it was just getting really annoying. So, I'm just gonna walk around
my boxers. I don't even care. - Hey, bud.
- How you doing? - Pretty good. The fire's warm. - Oh, shoot. I can't even see anything. - Ha.
- Oh my God. , dude. Where were you hiding? - You guys couldn't hear me moving? - All right, guys. I'm gonna hit the hay. Hopefully I don't get eaten
by a coyote or I don't know. I'm just in the middle of
a desert. Wish me luck. - All right, guys. I'm gonna yeet myself into bed 'cause I'm so tired right now. So, goodnight. - All right, guys.
We're about 15 hours in. We're a little low on food
'cause Chandler eat most of it. And we're also a little low on water. I don't know. We're gonna
go on some adventures today. Hopefully we don't dehydrate. - I'm drinking all the water and food so they're making me go
out and find some more. - Dude, I think there's
some creatures out here. I just saw some footprints. Look at that.
- That's a dog. - Bro. Dogs are coyotes, dude. Look, and they keep going. They literally walk
right by us last night. Bro, is that your poop? - Yeah. - Maybe that's what scared off the coyote. - You're welcome. - Hello. - Hey, I have the address
of the first person who got the golden ticket.
I'm gonna text it to you. Go buy it off them. I
don't care what it costs. - Roger that. - All right, guys. So we're here at ShopMrBeast. And we're about to deliver
the first golden ticket to the golden ticket winner. All right. They have no idea. - Tanner.
- Oh my gosh. No way. Are you serious? - Yeah, man.
- Oh my gosh. - How you doing?
- I'm good. - Proud to say that you were
the first golden ticket winner. - Oh, my gosh. Dude, are you serious? - Yeah. So go ahead. Rip this thing open. Okay. - Look at this desert right now. We're really in the middle of a desert. - We brought a generator, so we could charge our drone. Chan-Chan, how you doing? I'm cooking alive right now. - Dude, so am I. - Hey, Chris. How you doing? - Ah, it's really, really hot. - Yeah. I know, dude. This is getting unbearable. Holy crap, sun. Go away. How about you share? You
already ate like all the food. - I bought this one. - Is Chandler eating again? - Yes.
- Chandler. - It's getting unbearably hot. I'm trying not to get sun burnt. And also, we're outta food
and we're almost outta water. Chandler's like hoarding
our last bit of food. - So, I wake up this morning
in the desert, right? Chandler's still eating. We're already low on food, but again, he's just sitting there stuffing his face. - Ah, dude. It's too hot. What are we talking about? - I'm hungry. It's hot. I'm dying slowly. - Guys. We have basically ran out of food. - I'm hungry.
- Chandler. - So, the only logical thing we can do is we just split into two
teams and go look for food. We're gonna go on an exploration to those mountains over there and see if we can find some food. Tareq, you hold down the fort.
- Got you. - Let's go boys. Chandler. We're falling behind Chris. - He's our leader. - Dang. Those mountains are huge. - They're too far away. I'm already tired. - Sun's, beaming boys. They're surprisingly not a
lot of dead animals out here. They're just little grassy
plants that can survive. My durag look funny, little like Batman. - What happens when we
walk a few more miles and then we have no idea how to get back? - You just follow your footsteps, man. - Chris.
- Yeah. - Hold up. Chandler's peeing. Hey, Cheetos.
- Wait, what? - We found food.
- It's empty. - It's empty. - What is this? - It's like a to go box or a cooler lid. - It is a cooler - Oh. - Look, we got clickbaited. - Look what we have ahead of us. That's what we have ahead of us. Those are like huge. - How you feeling? - I feel tired and hot, but
gotta get content somehow. What am I supposed to do? Just do a Q&A in my room? - What am I supposed to do,
look at memes on my computer? - Whoa, chill. Dude, this is crazy. Ow. Ow. - There's these sandspurs. - This is no buena. - Ow. Ow. For size comparison, me and Chandler are gonna
walk up to the mountain. - All right. Dude, you
guys look like ants. Compared to that. - Oh my God. Look at the
mountains to the right. You okay, Chandler? - Woo. - So the air's definitely thinner up here. - That or we're just tired. - The destination right there. - Mount Booby.
- Mount Booby. - Dude, you look like an ant now. Oh. We made it. Dude. Nothing around us
but desert, dead trees. - Well, what do we do now? - Enjoy the moment. And then ask that question. - All right. The moment's enjoyed. What do we do now? - I don't know. - Chandler, are you okay? - We came out far away, boys. - Yeah.
- Look where our camp is. - Guys, don't die on me. You see, way out there is where our camp is. - I come up here for a
fun time with the kids. I end up getting sand in my pants. - What are you thinking about Mr.Beast? - How many grains of sand
do you think are out here? And now it's time for an epic drone walk. Let's do this. This is why we made the journey. - Oh my God, Chris. This is steep Chris. - You, okay?
- Yeah. - Chris, where'd we lose Chandler? - Not giving me much, man. $500.
- All right. - $1,000. - Okay.
- What's it gonna take for you to give me that ticket? - I don't know, man. Something
to buy more food than this. - $3,000. - Okay. - All right. That's it. $4,000. $4,000, dude. - All right, man. You can have it. - Hey, did you get the golden ticket back? - Yeah, I did. - Thank you. Perfect. - It was so easy. All we
had to do is spend $4,000. - Oh, that's it? - Yeah.
- Cool. Cool. Thank you, Garrett. Give it to me. When I get back to NC. Chandler, thank God we got
the golden ticket back. There's only like 15 other ones left. It could come in your package. It could, you know, if
you follow me on Instagram I could DM you a picture of it. It could come in your email just interacting with my brand in any way. You could receive a golden ticket. There's about 15 other ones. And remember, if you
