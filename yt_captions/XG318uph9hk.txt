next we have a tick tock here my ship would now be worth one billion dollars no way i just got a message from a couple of mates and they told me that this token called shiba inu its cryptocurrency has gone up 67 million percent since since january last year it's you're proud it's all a fugazi dude it's a fugazi listen this uh modern bull run this modern crypto wave dude it ain't lasting just listen to that number like think about it is there anything that could support this substantiate this think about a normal stock yeah apple it went up 67 million percent in one year yeah really in one year can you believe it the pink sheets 67 million percent no this doesn't make any sense now in january last year i was browsing reddit and i came across a subreddit that recommended buying these meme tokens and one of them was ship shiba inu now at the time i put two thousand dollars into it and i left it for a couple of weeks and i lost 300 pounds uh i sold it at a loss anyway it turns out that would now be worth one billion dollars if i haven't sold it hey look that's your average trader for you right there right you buy high you sell low and you don't wait till the actual high as soon as it dips panic sell every time dude that's the average crypto trader in a net show for you how can you go to work after that you know what i mean like just the fact you lost that much money must just eat away at this man at night honestly the truth is though uh you could have never known which meme coin is gonna pop off that's the problem with them there's millions of them so most people do lose money and so you were probably right to sell it but hey sometimes you should have won the lottery if you just held on to the ticket now up next guys we have a very special contribution to our lesson on how to become rich and this is one of the island boys now as you guys know the pinnacle of talent because i'm an island boy and i've been trying to make oh i'm an island boy now when they went viral when they got millions of hits immediately the world wanted to know what do these guys think about finance because that's what crypto's about guys we've thrown out the uh the the the seasoned investors and we've asked the island boys which way modern man what's the new crypto secret crypto eye i'm just trying to make it i'm a crypto island trying to make it i'm a crypto island go to the top yeah so what they saying crypto you know stop of all the things i've done today i feel worse for watching that no no no no stop the video stop the music we shouldn't be doing this we shouldn't be airing this i'm part of the problem i'm sensationalizing these idiots this is what this is what mass entertainment is nowadays having an existential crisis right now the island boys have given me an existential cri this is a disaster obviously don't invest in crypto island it'd be hilarious actually it just occurred to me it'd be hilarious if somebody invested in two thousand dollars they sold because i said so and then you know a year later it's worth a billion dollars crypto island got up one million percent in the last year would be just my luck listen hey look look this whole bubble can't last forever guys so enjoy the ride while you can okay all this nonsense of oh we went up a million percent in a year and ain't happening for long listen trust me now coming to things that aren't going to change anytime soon no i'm just kidding i think this one's about the gender pay gap sorry sorry i'll prove to you that the gender pay gap does not exist the reason why men make more is because they choose higher paying jobs like lawyer doctrine oh here we go here's the propaganda but women choose lower paying jobs like female lawyer female dog okay sorry you had me you had me in the first half dude oh my gosh that's pretty funny by the way guys i just wanted to say real quick while we're here all credits go to um tick tock investors the twitter account great great account very funny memes go follow him and don't forget to pump zilla of course as well now this honestly makes so much sense of all the data i'd seen i had felt so bad for women for years and then i really i didn't realize they were picking different jobs i'm just kidding of course we respect all women here equal pay for equal work that's what it's all about boys um now our next guy is talking to the men of the room this man is an older brother teaching his uh little brother the lessons of finance that he has learned let's tune in dude come out to texas we're getting rich out here he said i can't i have class i said school the crypto markets [Music] [Laughter] oh dude you know what sucks it's like okay this is like legit funny and then also we're in this weird time where there hasn't been a bear market for like 12 years so you could just have stuck your money sort of anywhere um in this like modern market where everything just goes up up up up up and you're kind of fine i mean assuming you weren't a total idiot or you allocated funds but oh when this market turns i'm not saying i'm going to be happy about it because i'm not i'm not objectively i'm not but it'll be nice it'll be nice to have the markets make sense again guys listen the value investor they have been very sad for a very long time let me tell you that all those guys studying stocks all day to try to figure out which ones are going to pop they're getting outperformed by people like this literally you go to your mba program at harvard and then you're about you're about to finish your four-year degree some guy pulls up in a mclaren goes that says this it's hard not to cry a little inside when you see this stuff oh man it's funny although just showing a price that goes up doesn't mean anything a lot of the people who are talking about crypto now literally have bought here they they tell you they bought down here but actually what they did is they got into uh social media and decrypto at the same time which is right here now guys our next meme here is what not to do when you're dealing with getting rich guys you don't want to do this right you want to rip the crypto markets you don't want to do this this guy says y'all i put my entire net worth into squid gamecoin what do i do and then we see that he made the classic mistake of buying high and selling low guys that's not what you want to do you want to buy low it's very counterintuitive not a lot of economists have figured this out you buy low and you sell high so classic mistake by this guy i hope that he can improve himself and become a better human for society nice try buddy nice try what do we have next here i bet you're asking uh a bunch of guys here standing on the street nay we have the next fortune 500 most powerful people in america [Music] this is why men get paid more already dead wait are they chanting because it's the bored apes is that what this is all about they're just ah just another just another thing it just that has absolutely gone crazy bored apes this month they're all worth it's like a million dollars to get a board ape now maybe 10 million maybe an arm maybe you just sell your whole leg eat a board ape absolutely crazy that these djinns figured it out man hey you got to put your hat off to him what's the stock market what what's the stock market what did you just say what's the stock market what's the stock market i don't know what are you poor [Music] what is it what's the stock market oh my gosh [ __ ] god i just want you to explain the internet about the internet you know about grabs charts what is it what is it don't ask me to explain it to you okay listen if you don't know what it is you're not rich you're not part of that special club dude tabitha do you even day trade no get out of this apartment no really if you're not options trading with 100x leverage i can't even talk to you listen guys this is how you get rich in the 21st century i mean it's jokes it is it is jokes but at the same time because you should absolutely not do this you will fail at the same time there are idiots buying nfts becoming rich there's idiots buying shib and they could have been a billionaire it's absolute nonsense don't ask me to explain it to you in fact i know finance guys who are looking at things going like they're going crazy internally and i feel bad for them because they've spent their whole life studying the market and none of it makes sense right now but does that mean you've thrown since out the window no because the truth is you can't replicate those results because they're one in a million you just hear about them on social media so don't be stupid don't go into this instead practice good financial sense guys that means no meme coins it means invest in what you understand it means be conservative don't invest more than you can afford to lose have a risk tolerance all these things will safeguard you when we inevitably run this economy off the cliff like we seem to be doing so be safe out there and if any of these tips helped you become rich hey go ahead pump the stock guys it's absolutely free i have to tell you guys it's absolutely free because apparently there's some crypto called zillow which i'm absolutely not affiliated with i would never promote i have to tell you guys explicitly only pump the stock by liking subscribing thank you so much for watching as always big investigations coming we'd just like to get some of these more daily videos out to you guys because oh we know you got to consume the content okay so there it is love ya hope you had a good one i'll see you in the next one [Music] but things will be different if i was balling
