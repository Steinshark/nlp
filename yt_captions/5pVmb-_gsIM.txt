it would have been the biggest technology deal in corporate history in 2017 then singaporean semiconductor firm broadcom offered 103 billion dollars to buy san diego-based chip maker qualcomm the takeover became hostile and qualcomm appealed to the government to review the deal in an unusual move the committee on foreign investment in the united states cephas took them up on that offer and then trump blocked the deal on rather unusual national security grounds failed hostile takeover soon faded into the background as the trump administration moved on to other news making things a lot of them like the tick tock fiasco for example but even at the time i thought the whole kerfuffle was super interesting and worth the video so here it is but first i want to talk to you a little bit about the patreon for those who've not signed up to the early access tier i want to call out that there are a few videos queued up and waiting to be released that you can watch right now i'm going to try to keep the number at around 5 but right now it stands at 8. it will help support the channel and help pay for all this coffee i'm spending at cafes when writing the videos so head on over to the patreon page and take a look i deeply appreciate anything you'd be able to sign up for and thanks now on with the show qualcomm is a semiconductor and telecommunications company that develops products for the wireless market founded in 1985 it went public in 1991 on the nasdaq stock exchange the company established itself for its early research into wireless cell phone standards such as cdma standards like cdma are best described as ways to transmit and receive data streams over radio waves after some controversy cdma was brought into the 3g standard 2g 3g 4g 5g and so on these are just general labels for referring to generations of mobile telecommunications technology technologies which are then adopted by various telecoms around the world cdma being accepted as a 3g standard made qualcomm's patents extremely valuable the company has since been involved in the 4g and 5g standards its business model is to spend a whole lot on r d to develop commercial wireless technologies and then license those out to suppliers and operators those license fees are the most profitable bits of the company the company known as broadcom is a weird beast we can trace it back to a singaporean company known as avago technologies avago was spun off from the chip division of agilent technologies which in turn was spun off from hewlett-packard private equity firms kkr and silverlake teamed up with singaporean state investors temesek and gic to found avago technologies they levered up a 1.3 billion dollar investment to pony up the 2.7 billion to purchase the company when the company went public in 2009 the investor group made a handsome sum of money knowing about avago's private equity background helps you better understand their style of business the company is known for its frequent acquisitions and takeovers once they have acquired the company they radically cut expenses including r d and focus on financially maximizing what they call their big franchises they did this for a variety of companies including the 37 billion dollar 2015 acquisition of the venerable broadcom corporation when avago took over broadcom they took the name as well and now they were aiming for qualcomm in november 6 2017 broadcom made a 103 billion dollar offer to buy qualcomm this offer was almost immediately rejected by the qualcomm board as being way too low the takeover attempt soon became hostile and broadcom began to reach out to qualcomm shareholders so that it would be able to switch out the board's members and that was when qualcomm reached out to cephus cephas stands for the committee on foreign investment in the united states it's an interagency committee headed by the secretary of the treasury but also includes the secretary of defense state and more together cephas reviews foreign transactions and investment for whether or not the acquisition can stand to be a potential threat to national security for example if the foreign investment could result in foreign control of a u.s company that makes military hardware broadcom is a singaporean company if you recall its predecessor avago had temesec and gic as substantial foundation investors being in singapore allowed it to better evade certain corporate taxes yes but it also maintains a large workforce error so it's not the same as those cayman island shell companies in china but in november 2nd 2017 four days before the qualcomm offer the company announced that it was redomiciling itself to delaware broadcom ceo huk tan and trump had a big press conference announcing it both parties did the conference ostensibly to promote the president's big tax reform proposal but it also is likely that the relocation had something to do with an acquisition already in progress that of storage networking company brocade and it was being held up due to sevis review broadcom believed that by moving to the united states it could revoid that review it also believed that it would let them avoid cephas review of the qualcomm acquisition as well qualcomm was already doing the standard anti-takeover procedures but in january 2018 it also filed a notice with cephas urged by politicians on both parties cephas quickly announced that it would review the broadcom and qualcomm proxy battle the board election would be postponed by 30 days cephas sent over a letter to broadcom expressing its concern about the situation the letter took into consideration broadcom's private equity style and said that applying that to qualcomm would threaten the company's leadership position and telecommunications standards and if qualcomm were to lose its leadership placement then chinese companies like huawei and zte would fill the void such a situation would have negative consequences on american national security they also noted their concern about the debt load incurred on the combined company and how it would force management to focus extensively on short-term profit in its immediate response broadcom did not address the substantive arguments of the civis letter rather it made an angry emotional outburst in it they wrote this was a blatant desperate act by qualcomm to entrance incumbent board of directors and prevent its own stockholders from voting for broadcom's independent director nominees they mentioned the fact that broadcom was in the midst of moving from singapore to the united states and so they added upon completion of the redomestylation broadcom's proposed acquisition of qualcomm will not be a cephas covered transaction of course they probably should say that because i get the sense that cephas hit the nail on the head broadcom has to gut qualcomm and its r d driven business model in order to turn a profit and make the acquisition work it is literally how they had operated up to this point in march 2019 broadcom posted a letter to congress that said among other things that it would not sell any sensitive assets to form buyers and support the development of 5g technology in the united states they would invest 3 billion in r d and 6 billion in manufacturing out of the united states area of course other companies like at t have made similar-ish pledges before and gone back on them who is going to actually try to unwind the acquisition years after it has been consummated furthermore their letter proves the math qualcomm alone spent 6 billion in r d and fy 2020 alone to do 3 billion in r d across a combined broadcom qualcomm entity is a pretty clear statement of intent the broadcom people met with the trump administration in a last-ditch effort to save the deal there ceo tan who i believe became a u.s citizen in 1993 but i cannot be sure explained that he held top security clearance and had been a ceo for a company that made us military hardware components in other words a bonafide american patriot i do think broadcom was right when it argued that once it became an american company cephas would have no jurisdiction over the transaction that might have needed testing in court though but trump made the question irrelevant before cephas could issue a decision trump issued an executive order on march 12 in 2018 blocking the deal broadcom withdrew qualcomm reshuffled their independent board members and is today a 165 billion dollar company far above the 103 billion offering price broadcom for its part completed the three domicile and eventually purchased an it software company called ca technologies cephas did not get involved with that deal broadcom today is a 193 billion dollar company vod.com style of operating reminds me of another private equity story 3g capital 3g is a famous very famous private equity group that owns some of the biggest consumer brand companies in the world for example they own and run anheuser-busch inbev the biggest beer company in the world restaurant brands international which owns burger king tim hortons and popeyes and kraft heinz maker of that mac and cheese and ketchup warren buffett has been a big backer of theirs they hand out this book called how to double your profits in six months or less it's their internal bible they ruthlessly cost cut with something called zero-based budgeting a budgeting style in which all expenses need to be justified for each new period where before you roll over the next year and modify as needed with zbb each year you restart from scratch 3g's business style is the first buy a fat stagnant consumer company invest money in what it believes are its best parts i.e its franchises and fire or sell off everything else this style is lean and mean and gets financial results when 3g bought out heinz in 2013 it managed to raise its gross margins from the mid-teens to an amazing 28 percent that's astounding for a big company in a mature space they also fired a lot of people and closed a few factories but that's the deal broadcom is 3g capital style adapted to the semiconductor business broadcom's view is that over the years companies in the semiconductor space like qualcomm have gotten to be large incumbents large bloated and bureaucratic incumbents with lots of senior employees that are out of date unmotivated and incompetent they get big salaries and block the way upwards for the younger people who leave ceos don't want to fire these underperforming senior employees so they put him in charge of underperforming divisions that just end up wasting resources broadcom comes in and fires them they replace those top underperforming employees with younger people who might be able to do a better job and that's fine if they're more productive but even if they are then again what happens to the guy who lost the job and the family they support now in the defense of private equity investors i want to mention something 3g is not just a vicious cost cutting machine their overall goal is to not only get leaner but to also invest in the best performing bits of the organization something that tan from broadcom calls franchises that means those younger people they brought in might even get paid more than the senior person who got fired so they don't mind spending a lot on something they think is worth it many people think that the qualcomm block is about china and that's what the headlines certainly say it might be but i also get the sense that is also about saving thousands of high-paying jobs cephas just happened to have the jurisdiction to get involved i guess i can leave you with one last thing 3g bought heinz in 2013 and then merged with kraft foods in 2015. margins soared like i said and things seemed peachy then they tried to buy unilever one of the biggest food companies in the world but failed and without that next big hit to cut the fat on problems began to crop up a few years later consumer taste had changed to favor healthier organic products and the company did not have the right mix to appeal to them the stock fell and the company struggled it struggles to this day i do think that broadcom is doing something interesting in the semiconductor and now corporate software space it is going to change the way the industry works and it's going to make a lot of people and investors rich but i sometimes wonder if we are getting a bit too much capitalism here and need to think a little more strategically when intel brought back pat gelsinger to be its ceo people cheer because an engineer is in charge yet broadcom is almost as valuable as intel 190 billion versus 240 billion despite last profit and being run by the financial engineers people don't seem to like so you can say that the market favors the broadcom model over the intel model and i think that's a problem in the industry's long run competitiveness all right take care of yourselves out there if you enjoy the video essays
