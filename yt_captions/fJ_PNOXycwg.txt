[Music] hey what is up guys umhd here and this is the red oneplus 6. so it's the oneplus 6 it's everything you already know and love about it we've already reviewed it but the back is now this bright vibrant deep reflective red and uh that's it that's it everything else about the phone is the same but it's now red it's a red version of the phone we already know that we okay here's the thing about colored smartphones [Music] i love them but i also kind of hate them the way they exist and and a whole lot of these thoughts are already kind of floating around out there in these various chunks and bites on twitter and even in previous videos but it's worth putting it all in one place so this red one plus six dropped pretty recently and when i didn't put a video out right away about it there's like a couple comments and tweets here and there just like hey the red one like i thought this would be the one you'd love to make a video on where's your video and to be honest i was thinking about it i was thinking of reviewing it but then i was like it's the same phone it's the oneplus 6 i already reviewed it you already know everything about it it's just the new red color maybe just a photo at best but then i double back on that and here we are with a video why first of all you're right i do love red i love that they made a red smartphone and so now i'm sharing it with you because that's what i want to do but also i just want to talk for a second to you about colored phones in general so there's this really interesting video published recently of a bunch of potential alternate colors for the oneplus 6 on pc mag one of them included a colored alert slider i would have loved to have seen that uh but then there was also some more interesting colors this speckled one there's a wavy striped one and even this instagram one shout out to igtv and so the natural reaction when seeing all these colors that they could have done or that they were thinking about doing is why didn't they just do a bunch of these why didn't they drop all of these right at launch that would have been awesome well the answer is twofold number one companies generally would like to sell as few variations of a single product as possible as few skus as they can so if a company could sell all their phones in one color and one storage amount they would that's why i see car companies like bundling as many things as possible into one option package is because they don't want to have 75 different ways they can make their car they just want to make one so if you're a smartphone company and you can just sell black and white and maybe one other color then that's what they'll do but the number two answer right now is also that smartphone companies are using alternate colors as a press tool basically to remind you about a smartphone that already came out so there's something you can call a press cycle every time a new phone comes out there's a pretty predictable spike of attention at the beginning the height of sales and then it sort of falls off in this long tail as the device gets older maybe a drop in price might bump it up again but for the most part it'll never get that much attention again but releasing a brand new color of the same exact phone and delaying it a couple months after that release is obviously stirring up a brand new press cycle it creates a new wave of videos a new wave of articles brings a little attention back to the phone and at the end of the day we'll boost sales oneplus does it samsung does it apple does it almost everyone almost everyone's guilty at some point of doing this this special edition late release smartphone and if you pay careful attention to the way apple does it they specifically use new alternate colors when a new product has the same design or like the spec bump on the inside so when they went from iphone 6 to iphone 6s the design of the phone was exactly the same there's just a spec bump like apple does so they added a rose gold color so now you can tell who has the new iphone you can't get the iphone 6 in rose gold so you know that's the new one and then when they went to iphone 7 the design again was super similar so we got this jet black version so you can't get a jet black iphone 6 or 6s so you know that's the 7. even with the new apple watch when they came out with a new lte version they painted a big red dot on the crown so you know that person must have the new lte version of the watch truly classic apple and then this year rumors point to the fact that there won't be a huge design change with the next iphone 11 or whatever they call it from the iphone 10 so same design maybe new sizes but with that they're going to do new colors so we've got these rumors of a blue color and an orange color and a red color to all launch with the new iphone so you know you have the new one and the thing is i'm still pumped for it anyway like i love it and i hate it i love it because colored phones are actually really exciting they look really cool they're unique they're kind of personal and everyone does it differently to make themselves stand out there's about eight or nine different red phone finishes that have come out in the past couple years and every single one of them has different looks different hues different reflectiveness different color shifting my personal favorite i would say is apple's product red probably followed closely by oneplus new one and then believe it or not the blackberry passport in red but i'm so into all these colored phones but i hate it because i know it plays exactly perfectly into the manufacturer's hands they're gonna release a new alternate color of this phone that they could have probably released on day one but it's gonna generate this new batch of coverage and all these new videos and articles and probably new sales now to be fair i love what apple does with the product red stuff not only with the phones but with the cases and all that stuff where they're working with a great organization they're donating to aids research i think more companies should do stuff like this but the fact that the phone comes out six months after the original every time in red is pretty hilarious at the end of the day though i'm not gonna stop covering colored phones in fact i'm gonna cross my fingers for more of them i hope we get all those new colored iphones i hope we get all these new custom phones i missed moto maker back in the days when you could customize every little thing from the material to the back of the phone to the button colors and all of that that was peak smartphone customization in my opinion and that's where i want it to be but until then i'll just keep crossing my fingers talk to you guys in the next video thanks for watching peace
