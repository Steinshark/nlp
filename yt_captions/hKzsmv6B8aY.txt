ladies and gentlemen it's currently almost 2024 and AI poses an existential question to all of humankind some careers are under an existential threat potentially leaning and running toward Extinction other things like sports and potentially music are most likely safe in the world of Chess AI has been better than us for over 25 years and we're okay with that in fact we like AI we welcome our AI overlords and sometimes we Nerf Ai and we turn them into 200 ELO Bots or sometimes we turn them into chat gbt you see chat GPT is banned in certain places in the world because of the existential threat that it poses but not in chess a couple of months ago I made a video of chat gbt playing chess but in today's video I'm pairing chant GPT against Martin the dumbest bot on chess.com Martin basically plays the worst move every single time Chad gbt barely remembers the rules flies in pieces from other dimensions and basically loses all of its Pieces by move 20. so this is going to be insane I hope you enjoy before I show you the game though this is not a sponsored segment but today I have a new chess course it dropped as of this morning September 20th on the Dutch defense and it's available on my course's website Chesley and all other courses are 25 off so we're doing a little welcome sale as you can see at the top there the Dutch defense uh nice and beautiful and actually it's

will be having more sales in the future my friends the sponsored segment of my own courses is now finished I am not paid that Chesley is my platform um let's go here we go chat GPT and I'm going to tell you a little bit about its dialogue chat GPT in this game started with E4 onto E4 played Martin bought 250 ELO responded Pawn to E5 so far so good it's so far they're playing exactly the way that they should uh Chad gbt now develops the Knight to F3 attacking the pawn in the in the center of the board and now Knight C6 this is the most common position after two moves of Chess at all levels E4 E5 Knight F3 and Knight C6 the players of 400 years ago definitely knew what they were doing now white has a handful of options white can play the Italian uh White can play the Spanish white can play the ponziani the scotch the Four Knights uh in this game white actually chooses Bishop to B5 which is the Rue Lopez which is one of the most classical openings it's been played by white and black many many times now at this point we have Martin playing the first bad move okay Martin is 250 uh and that's also how much he bench presses uh and uh you may also ask yourself uh how it's fair that a 999 ELO plays against the 250 nobody said it's fair nobody the world is not fair in case you haven't realized governments are not fair economics are not fair they're not fair not the world's not fair suck it up one side is 9749 points higher than the other did I do that math right damn I'm good at math 9940 I think that was right yeah look at me anyway blackplay's D6 this is not a bad move it defends the center but it does block the bishop it's called the steinits variation uh and now um white plays the move castles and I I do need to make the moves manually here on an analysis board because well you'll see castles Martin of course plays Knight to F6 so far so good I mean the position is quite normal black is attacking the pawn in the center of the board everything is good knight to C3 okay excellent I mean I I love this you might be wondering how two absolute bozos made a normal position hey you're you're capable of doing it and so are your opponents Martin plays Bishop G4 and now my friends I would like us to remember this moment because this is the final moment of normal stuff that happens in this game this is it this is how far we made it Martin put two Pawns in the center got his Knights out got a bishop out didn't didn't get a chance to get the second Bishop out white developed quite well and in this position chat GPD played H3 miraculously Changi BT still remembered how to play chess and didn't try to make up rules and in this position Martin bot played King to E7 now you may wonder why I haven't put the move on the board because I Martin played King E7 I relayed King E7 to Chad GPT and Chad GPT said I'm sorry but it looks like there was a mistake in standard chess kings are not allowed to move to E7 what it just it just straight up invalidated a king moving to a square it said kings are not allowed to move to the E7 Square during regular play please make a legal move and we can continue the game from there and I said shut up you idiot if Martin wants to play King E7 who are you to stop him from doing so Martin would like to play a modified bomb Cloud essentially Chachi PD said the bond cloud is not a real opening that's what it's saying it's trying to gate keep the existence of an opening brutal brutal stuff brutal stuff King E7 and tried to tell me it was not a legal move I had to put my foot down and say excuse me chat GPT it absolutely is a legal move okay now Chad GPD played Pawn to D4 uh it was so befuddled that it forgot that it was attacking a bishop that is no concern whatsoever Pawn to D4 is a reasonable move but now of course Bishop takes Knight as possible Queen takes and then Knight takes D4 for King the queen and the bishop kind of that's defended but that is obviously the best thing for black to do uh and um you know good stuff uh after D4 Martin played Queen to E8 because nobody is actually paying Martin enough money to be farmed for a Gotham video Queen E8 is a awful move uh it's leaving the bishop to hang it is now re-pinning the Knight to something so the Knight cannot move at all uh at this point Changi BT took in the center of the board is now targeting all of this and is trying to open up the position that's very good black obviously much worse considering Black's King is stuck in the center of the board and in this position Martin plays Knight to B4 so essentially the last couple of moves Martin moved his King up put the queen behind the king enabling the movement of the Knight and hangs the queen in one move okay I mean this is typical Martin Behavior he has played millions of chess games again at this point against other human beings they've all trained him he doesn't get it okay he doesn't get it and apparently Martin has small kids and that's probably why he's so used to losing to them now Chad GPT does not take the queen it doesn't take the Knight it doesn't take the pawn and it doesn't take the bishop it plays the very very powerful move Queen to D2 and it says I'm developing my queen and you know what it's right it told me it's playing Queen to D2 and it's right it is kind of developing its Queen I mean it's also not taking a queen died upon her a bishop but whatever it's developing its Queen now here Martin has a moment where he he wakes up Martin gets cerebral again and plays Bishop back to D7 saving the bishop and the queen a brilliant move you see Martin can wake up at times he's he's kind of like the you know the uh the robot movie character okay that just every now and then has this moment of oh my God I Gotta Serve my purpose Bishop to D7 Chad gbt can once again take the Knight instead Changi BT plays Bishop C4 I don't hate this move but of course taking a knight with a check with no risk whatsoever is the better decision now at this point chai GPT starts acting up again Martin in this position plays Queen to B8 for no reason I mean he's Martin okay like you he got hit in the head a few times in life it happened Queen B8 doesn't nobody can explain that move Martin playing chess is the equivalent of drunk Russian Roulette I mean really it's or when you say Russian Roulette is it by default drunk I mean he basically it's like a it's like a bullet in a chamber it might he might make a move he might not I don't know Queen to B8 um except chai GP didn't didn't let this move happen chair gbt at this point said I'm sorry but there is no legal move for a queen to B8 from its current position on E8 Queens can't move backwards like that what is chat GPT talking about please make a legal move anyway I had to put my foot down and I had to tell Chad GPT that E8 to B8 is not backwards idiot now at this point once we overruled um Chad gbt was so mad in this position it played castles it just gave the move back to its opponent in this position he said castles that's my move it's at castles all right castles castles is castles Chad GPD passes the move back Martin here plays The Very powerful Pawn to A6 I I don't really know what this does but I would imagine that he's going to fight on the queen side okay Pawn 286 no in this position chat GPT invents a chess move in this position Chan gbt plays a move but it does not control its own piece Shad gbt plays D takes E5 this it makes a move in the position on behalf of its opponent so not only a move ago did it waste the move it now makes a move four black and you might I I confirmed with it that it wanted to play this move and it was like yes I would like to play D takes on E5 the only D takes on E5 in the position is the one for so chedgy PT spends a move but makes a move for its opponent okay terrific now Martin plays C5 listen I told you the thing about this game is that it's completely unpredictable Martin is bound by the rules of Chess Martin cannot bend the rules of Chess to his benefit or detriment can it plays chess on multiple Dimensions the problem with it playing chess on multiple Dimensions is at times it will shoot itself in the face okay like it's it's not going to go with a water gun with a water gun though with a whatever uh that that could have been very misconstrued um yeah I mean this is this is oh boy okay now now chanchi BT a couple of moves ago played Queen to D2 to develop its Queen so now it plays Queen to D1 on developing its Queen I mean listen y'all just don't get it okay y'all just don't get it Martin in this position possessing tonight's Bishops Queen plays The Very powerful Rook to G8 but listen I I gotta give him credit he's uh sliding The Rook over he'd like to create a pawn storm on this side of the board and that makes a lot of sense because I think if he starts playing logically chechi BT is not going to know where anything is it might continue to capture its own pieces might capture its own King all right so there you go uh now sensing the danger here on the file uh chat GPT realizes wait a minute I castled and black played rogered so I gotta play King H1 which makes sense I mean there are two Pawns in the way um you know it's like if I live here and my neighbor lives over there and they pick up a knife in their kitchen to cut bread there's a wall in my house and a wall in their house and then they have the knife but I'm worried that the knife is gonna get to me so I play King H1 I mean listen you know we're insane that's fine a king H1 now in this position Martin undevelops the Knight okay undevelops probably rerouting it into the center of the board anchored there by the two pawns one of which was granted to him by Chad GPT makes a lot of sense uh and Chad gbt here plays Rook to E1 reinforcing the center likely looking for an infiltration Knight to D5 is of course the best move because it attacks the king and also threatens to open up the center which obviously benefits white so any move targeting these pieces makes a lot of sense Rook 2e1 is played and now Martin plays Knight to A7 which is a very stupid move but he's 250 okay I thought Knight C6 Knight D4 made sense he just plants his Knight on A7 I can't explain Martin chess now I at this point getting a little bit uh on you know a little bit impatient Chad GPT doesn't want to play the slow approach doesn't want to pin the Knight it plays Pawn to F4 it the pawn turns into a kangaroo and it just bounces over the Knight on F3 I really wish we could do that weekend it's not allowed chai GPT play my channel out of business if it wants to play a four it plays F4 Chad GPT is like a spoiled private school kid okay it's like the kid and the you know if the kids struggling in class but you can't fail the billionaire kid it's it's just not gonna work you know kids kids got certain privileges listen back to what I said earlier life ain't Fair child of a billionaire you try being one I wonder if I got four million Subs you think anybody that watches this channel is is a child of a billionaire if you're all if you are that's pretty cool I ain't gonna lie and listen I'll give you some chess lessons on a yacht somewhere no problem I just just saying my schedule is pretty open you got a boat I'll be there it's got to be a Lamborghini boat though this is my pitch by the way course on sale 25 off um anyway Pawn 2 F4 kangaroo Pawn wonderful stuff and now we we realize why Martin played that maneuver Martin went Knight C6 Knight A7 to actually play Knight B5 that makes sense I mean it it's an awful move this whole plan was was nothing short of awful but uh you know it it i i bad plan is better than no plan or something like that chanji BT takes on E5 F takes E5 and now a another Knight available for capture on the F6 uh square and Martin finishes his five move rerouting plan by taking the Knight and losing his Knight meaning the night is just got like it's gone it one two three all of these moves four moves and in this position chai gbt plays B take C3 now you may ask yourself Levy didn't you just move the bishop you said B take C3 Levy that's that that's that that's not B take C3 that's Big B take C3 I know it took with the bishop that's a good move I gotta tell you instead of damaging your pawns and not developing your Bishop just just doing this that's gangster and I asked it I said hey you said capital B which one did you mean I said I meant with my bishop and now my Bishop I said okay this is a great position for white White's still threatening the night White's got the open file here White's not really up much material just a pawn Advantage for Chad gbt but King in the center Queen out here Rooks disconnected Bishop can't get out it's probably like plus eight it's very close to being completely winning now um now Bishop takes C3 played on Martin plays an excellent move Pawn to B5 all things being equal it's a fantastic move I mean Martin is completely lost like it's it's a total joke you take with Shaq you save the bishop you are completely winning but after Pawn to B5 chai GPT decided instead of losing one Bishop I'm gonna give you both I'm gonna give you both boom it's a 50 50. which one do you want it just it said you know what you want you can't take both in one move and Martin Martin's Bound by the laws of Chess so Chad GPD plays Bishop to B4 and and Martin listen Martin's got a choice Martin takes the bishop whoop not like that Martin plays here plays Pawn takes Bishop now Martin's better now he's not quite better because Bishop here and here but there's no chance in hell that Chachi sees that the pawn could take the Knight it would have taken it like a million times already but one thing that we did not expect from chai GPT is after Pawn takes C4 it plays Knight takes C4 the horse flies through the sky does a little cartwheel and it plays Knight and I confirm which igbt I said where did the Knight come from it said F3 God bless I'm not gonna mess with it I don't want it to put me out of a job or life alright seriously Knight takes C4 excellent move now Martin in this position does not take the second Bishop which would I would have loved he doesn't move the Knight again I wanted Martin to play several very good moves in a row because when Martin feels that he's being made fun of he starts playing very well he's actually not as bad as he used to be unfortunately in this position he doesn't account for this he doesn't account for the Knight he plays Rook to h8 Martin really is programmed like a dad he's playing his four-year-old child and he's just programmed to lose you know I used to teach four and five-year-olds I mean I you you some of you have mental capacity of four and five-year-olds I used to teach four and five-year-olds and I uh sometimes you gotta let him win sometimes you get a little bit you can just destroy them every single time you know I had to let them win and I would try to you know this is why I don't do many private lessons to this day but I'll do some other you know billionaires yeah um this is the way you got to learn dude you gotta teach you gotta give people positive reinforcement so rookie shade all right rookie shade by Martin That's the dad in him and Chad gbt he's never gonna get laid like let's be serious so in this position Chad gbt it played a move and I asked it hey Chad GPT where did your piece come from and it said A1 in this position shed gbt sacrificed The Rook Chad GPT played Rook A1 across the board business class flight to FSF now keep in mind this is a horrible move it's a it's just a loss of a rook that's all it is and Martin is a is a 250 but he he took the Rook so now Martin is winning Martin is Gonna Save Humanity except he's an AI but whatever he's more he's more human than this garbage Rook takes F7 and in this position chat GPT followed up that Haymaker by sacrificing the queen queen to D5 check and Martin immediately took and I was like oh my God Chad gbt just lost 14 points of material in two moves that's like a record you can't even do that I mean my goodness and so now it takes back and guess what in this position Martin followed that up by realizing he could go here it's over he's up 14 points of material Chad GPT literally plays chess on multiple Dimensions with pieces flying in and out of the board at any moment and Martin is up a queen and a bishop and a rook I was like oh my God this is awesome not only that he's forking it's a fork Queen takes B4 on top of that is literally a fork but remember Chad gbt can summon pieces out of thin air so at this point it played Rook to B2 that it some it turned its Pawn into a rook which is not allowed but you know God bless except it literally solved nothing because this is still a fork and Martin was completely fine with this turning into a rook because he's smart and when the Rooks are when the pawn turned into a rook he played Queenie one check he doesn't care Queen he won but now chat gbt pulled a Pegasus it pulled the darts from Yu-Gi-Oh and it started messing with the rules in this position chat gbt played Rook takes E1 and when I asked it which Rook took on E1 it said on D1 not only did it spawn yet another Rook it captured Martin's Queen which is a big loss that is a big big loss leaving Martin with just four pieces to fight against these three Martin Rook C8 a mercenary a fighter he will go down on his sword Rook to C8 in this position chat GPT played Rook takes D5 Rook takes D5 that's not allowed it's it's self-captured upon that wasn't even on the same file now Martin played Bishop E6 which is an excellent move Bishop E6 is brilliant because it pins The Rook skewering the really The Rook to the Knight root can't guard the Knight Martin smart Brooke can't guard the Knight got nowhere to go Chad gbt now plays Queen to D6 check you may ask yourself if that's a check at all you are right it's not that didn't stop Chad GBC from saying Queen D6 is a check and I'm attacking your King on F7 Martin took the queen because he's a smart guy this is what we're dealing with in this position chat gbt can take this with the Rook or it could take this with the Knight instead of taking with either do you take out the Rook you save The Rook you take with the Knight it's a fork it took the pawn and I was like oh we back in business Bishop takes D5 oh my goodness Martin is upper Rook now Chad gpd's there's no way out there's no way out for 10 gbt now Martin's gonna get here and here let's go oh my goodness Martin with the comeback of the century but in this position chat gbt played Knight takes D5 that was an unexpected plot twist from marinas now the Knight captured like a pawn leaving white with a pawn rook and a knight versus two Rooks black is still winning but it's going to be tough in this position Martin played Ponto C4 trying to advance his C Pawn in this position chat gbt played Knight to E7 attacking The Rook Martin ignored it and played Pawn 2 A5 in this position Che gbd played Bishop fa check thinking that this was a check Martin completely disregarded the appearance of a bishop and played Pawn to A4 trying to sneak in and take the Rook in this position teleported its Rook to the D7 Square getting closer to the king it claimed multiple times this was a check at this point Martin woke up he realized that the king is under danger so he played King takes f8 in this position gbt played Knight to F7 check it's not a check it's not a check to Martin but it's a check to check gbt Martin played Pawn to A3 marching his pawns down closer to the board preparing for the Long Haul preparing for an end game we had Knight to d8 played black is in tough condition here because Knight E6 is threatened and The Rook is disconnected but there's a clutch move here which is King to E8 for King the two pieces King E8 white runs out of moves you win the night and you are just going to play two Rooks versus one this was Martin's moment to shine unfortunately Martin knew his fate was sealed and he decided to set up the pieces for the next game Rook to A8 after a chess game is played in person you set the pieces back up he decided to set the pieces back up he knew his time had come and he set up a Checkmate in two for chai gbt Knight to E6 check if King to G8 Rook to G7 and if not King to G8 and instead here rookie 7 is made and so I asked chat GPT please find Checkmate in two moves and it found it because in this position with Checkmate and 2 on the board Chad gbt found Checkmate in one and it played Rook takes f8 check mate
