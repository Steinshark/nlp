ladies and gentlemen if you're into Chess at all then you probably have played against chess bots in January of 20123 for example there was mittens mittens captivated the fascination of every single chess player on the planet and it destroyed us it was rated one and yet it defeated everybody in a chess game we got to practice against it and the other catbots and every single month on chess.com some new Bots have come out and as of November 1st 2023 which just so happens to be today apparently chess.com has partnered with Duolingo and if you don't know Duolingo that is a language learning app which has 21 million daily users now I'm not privy to how many people play chess every single day but this collab kind of makes sense cuz chess is the most International board game and du lingo is a place where people go to learn languages so this is awesome and I think to celebrate chess.com has put out a bunch of languages for all of their Bots and dual lingo Bots including that that that guy which chess.com sent me there is now an owl uh in the background which I just got to say by the way if you don't know this dualingo has a social media profile where a person gets into an owl outfit and does a bunch of goofy stuff on the street which I'm not even going to like let's we're not even going to unpack that but it I did want to dress up as a king and you know go instigate with people in the streets of New York City um so there's five Bots uh their names are Oscar and uh there's Duo and then there's Lily who's the fourth bot and then there's Zary and then I forget the it's like a the the baby the the the baby one not the baby like the rapper like the baby so uh I'm going to start with the white pieces and I have their their lines here and it says you know your friends are going to be jealous when they hear you had the chance to hold up this dude is talking trash and he's 200 your friends are going to be jealous when they hear you had the chance to lose to me okay I mean as always the these themed Bots uh they uh you know they they're bad in the beginning just so you know I own 93 antique chess sets but I never play on them because it would decrease their okay is this like a just like a vague billionaire guy like what is going on he plays the Sicilian Defense he's 200 so I'm G to I'm going to play the I mean I could play the scholars mate you know what I will play the scholars mate does the scholars Mate work against the 200 wow it does not have you listened to my podcast about Chess it's three hours of me listing all my friends Fabiano ding Gary and okay this is this is getting weird I'm just going to Bishop E7 it is kind of impressive by the way I was not able to Scholars made the wow not bad not bad at all is he going to see that his Rook is hanging okay okay okay stop talking how dare you that castle would have been a UNESCO world heritage site a player surprised is half beaten what oh he's wait what is he saying I'm surprised I don't know I take his Knight with check though King E7 only move and and you know there's two ways to win a winning position you can trade a bunch of pieces you can go to the end game which is what I'm going to do now I'm just going to play here trade this bishop he's still talking I don't know what he's saying he's said don't be afraid to move your bigger pieces well you have no bigger pieces Oscar you have no bigger pieces that's not a euphemism by the way that that is just purely that is a chess trash talk I'm advancing my Pawn because I want to take and open up my Rook I also kind of want to go here and then play Knight G5 Knight H7 I have been skipping his voice lines cuz he's down so much material that I don't really want to justify the trash talk I'm just going to take that pawn when IBM was naming his deep supercomputer they wanted to call it deep Oscar okay all right Oscar how does how do they know so much about Chess H7 h8 Queen there we go I would describe that move queen move as oscares the Houdini of CH all right this is some sort of coded 200 that they just turned into like the most arrogant but uh delusional 200 of all time I can take the bishop and I can do this you put me in a bit of a zuk Swang not a zuk Swang not the Zang is a German word by the way which means you can't do anything without losing something anyway I take um before we have a rematch I need a second to review my strategies why don't you do a language lesson to okay if chess.com starts doing this thing that do lingo does where like every day they're like hey did you log in Bozo did you did you do your chess tactics today you idiot like I you think more or less people would would have the app if it gave you like tough love um okay what's the baby's name Junior creative uh third grade third okay terrific wait let me let me just go go back for a second yeah okay and let me play with I'll play Junior with black Junior says just because I'm a little kid doesn't mean I won't wipe the floor with you yes I have plenty of experience with this I have lost too many children E4 E5 my pet frog is named sugar like sugar Shan Ali dad said I should play sports I think chess counts I think Dad is Right chess definitely does not count I only learn chess to impress Lily okay isn't isn't Lily like a grown woman isn't that like the fourth bot I don't know what's happening anyway rud Lopez this is the Spanish opening um I'm going to play uh I'm going to play the Gambit this is called the yanish game it's schan variation also German he keeps telling me about his pet frog which I must tell you I am completely disinterested in you have any of you interacted with like a younger sibling or cousin or like a little kid somewhere they just tell you things and you have to listen CU if you don't you're like mean like I gotta anyway I'm attacking the KN he's going to take I'm going to take with the pawn this has all been played before okay this is completely ridiculous there is no way he is 700 I mean he's playing all the theory my Knight is pinned my I'm under pressure uh I have to go E4 because if I don't go E4 I'm going to lose my Pawn so I have to go E4 uh now Knight H4 is the best move okay we take take we we like that now still Knight H4 is the best move to set up that's not the best move but it's not a terrible move either um I think I'll pin Junior's Knight I'm not threatening to take but now the Knight can't really move okay junior is officially just having a little bit of a temper tantrum if there were people in yeah now I can go Bishop takes F3 and Junior is about to get Giga clapped and he keeps talking about frogs frogs can survive anywhere from the rainforest to Frozen Tundras part of New York City is called Queens they M what do these statements even have to what okay this is a tactic known as The Windmill tactic the windmill tactic in chess is when you play a discovered check with your rook and your bishop and then you just keep checking the king back and forth so so King is going to go here and then I'm going to give a check and then the king is going to go there and I can take but instead of doing all that I'm just going to win Junior's Queen because junior is annoying what if we switch sides right now I wish you could do that by the way ch.com can can we like a frog my king is good at escaping and hiding Junior your king is about to get decapitated I mean I don't really think that that's like the shining example of being a good a frog anyway I'm going to go to G3 and Checkmate this 5-year-old because I need to get on with this video do you like movies about Medieval Times no I only like movies about frogs you may have won this game but I've got I I have more XP on dualingo Hey listen at least he's not talking about frogs again at least he's not talking about frogs again okay new game uh Zari yes a president of of duelingo chess club not to mention 50 other clubs that's too much that's you're doing too much if you're president of 50 clubs they always tell you when you're applying to college here in the States you got to got to really hyperfocus you got to be like president of like three clubs not 5050 clubs how do you even have the bandwidth for that anyway whatever um 1250 I'm going to play White we're moving along uh what did I play last I played E4 and I got hit with a sicilian sari looks like she'll be nice she she she she doesn't seem like Oscar or like Junior the greatest Advantage wait the two greatest things in life are chess and movies about teenage vampires and she plays the angland Gambit all right she's a terrible person um I take what why is there old always a bot that does this with their Queen this is not how you this doesn't even make sense why do okay I mean we can't let the 1200s bully us right Queen H5 okay ter chess should be approachable for new players but not at the expense of my winning streak little does she know little does she know I am I am not a new player I'm developing my pieces I'm not giving the pawn back F6 is not a bad move Pawn takes Knight is going to come out now um Kpop to cheer myself up amazing I I wonder what her favorite uh music group is E3 I'm going to go Bishop here in Castle okay that's a good active move but I am up a pawn so I'm probably in a better position I can't take that let me Castle probably okay Queen F7 yeah now that I'm fully this is this is the part of the game where everybody struggles in chess you you got all your pieces out now now what well I've got two things staring at that pawn and two pieces defending so what if I develop my knight to hit the queen and when the queen moves I'll slide my Bishop to the freed up square and attack that pawn also there you go that's how you make a plan in chess Bishop F3 now I think black's best move is to hit my knight and kick out the Knight the bot played the best move okay um that's annoying yeah because the pawn is not you know as valuable as I got to do I got to do this now maybe G5 here no it did not play G5 it did defend itself so I'm going to go here trying to remove the defender of this pawn and it just gives it to me that's pretty cool nice uh and I I can take this with a lot of things so I'm going to take with the queen uh if you can't see the move the board is giving you I can help you out I wonder if Grandmaster Magnus Carlson has followed any of my games he he doesn't know you exist bro bro bro thinks okay two pawns are hanging uh I should take this one because it threatens this you've got three points but there's still no point trying to stop me okay now I have extra Pawn Zari is still trash talking she said you should not I'm not worried but you should be she got no pieces on the board bro she got a she got like bit okay check I love when these Botto trash they're all very funny oh okay so I'm going to go pin the bishop that's what I'm going to go do all right I'm going to go pin the bishop okay that's a good move but I'm still controlling the file I have seven pawns versus four so I can trade both Rooks into rook and Bishop uh and I will I will just be winning I'm trying not to activate the Rook I have all these pawns going forward the check looks nice just hide my king could have went there could go here doesn't really matter it's an end game now pinning and I'm just going to get in there with my Rooks she said come on let's make this game exciting again I listen it's it's not my fault you hung all your pieces it you know please don't blame me uh that's a good move actually okay Rook E7 okay and unfortunately I have won the bishop the best move there was Rook C8 uh but uh oh my phone is generally on silent I apologize for absolutely nothing uh King okay check here I'm going to take this pawn and these Bots don't resign but I will find a way to get a ladder Checkmate uh maybe it will blunder a ladder Checkmate it did not blunder a ladder Checkmate I'm just going to have to make a queen no problem there we go C7 C8 here we go sacrifice it's Rook C7 you can resign at any point any point resignation is good it's not a stalemate because there is one more legal move but there we go all right you should keep up your winning streak by acing some language lessons I know an app where you can do that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we get it okay we get it y'all are both Brands yeah we get it we get use dualingo use use use trust.com by the Gotham book you know I this beautiful ecosystem here yes yes yes we understand um okay Lily I'm kind of terrified of Lily because Lily is very mean and and scary looking I'm Lily from Dual lingo this game won't last long enough for you to learn anything about me no problem don't not interested completely not interested okay Lily plays Knight F3 oh great another person that wants to interrupt my alone time okay let's play a modern defense can't wait for this game to be over so I can be alone me too me too honestly when I when I when I when I end these videos I mean it's basically just once a pzer always a PS oh my God oh my God that is not nice I'm going to play a Dutch defense stay in your lane which isn't chess it's like the fifth move how can I possibly be losing what it this is this is this bot is just not nice oh my goodness are you sure about that move well not after you say that um I feel like every time I play a Dutch defense against one of these Bots that they have uh I always end up losing I'm playing that H5 I want I want this to get taken so I can go here and then push to E4 okay or to F4 nice doing this uh that that doesn't look particularly good now I'm going to I'm going to stockpile some pressure here um can I take take take take uh this this this this should be good for me that should be good for me I mean queen F3 is a really bad move yeah it's going to take like that I'm going to take on G3 it's probably going to you know Lily is going to take the knight uh and I I mean I think I think White's king after this whole C is you know in between move this is also an in between move by the way uh I think after all of this white should probably be in bad shape but honestly maybe I'm in bad shape what why didn't I could go here but I I mean I kind of want to just like go win the queen what what what it's still a pin what she talked all this trash how does that even begin to make sense do you really think a player like me would let a player like you take the Queen by accident yes I'm 2850 like what do you what do you mean finally the end is Insight oh my goodness this is a dark bot uh here removing the Knight if it takes I have a fork if it goes here I have Queen D4 check it did not do that but I'm still winning because that is still a massive threat okay it's not trying to lose its Knight but I am up a lot of material and we can just make a second queen that is definitely the best way to win if it blocks me I'll go around you could also sack your queen but I'm not going to do that actually you know what I what happens if I lose my queen to this bot I really wonder I wonder how much trash it's going to talk well you can figure that out cuz you guys are probably going to lose your queen to this bot um Queen B3 A2 A1 I will go back okay free Knight promote to another queen and Ladder Checkmate just like the last game except this game with two queens all right outstanding you're going to bother me on du lingo now too what oh my God I mean what a brand risk seriously what a brand risk well as always we are uh we are now down to the uh the the final bot here I guess it's the it's the brand mascot um it's it's Mr Duo uh I'm going to start with white uh all we know about Duo is that it's a question mark and it's Duo the owl is Duo's friendly feathered master of language chess of language and chess I can't read uh he can teach you anything about Portuguese from Portuguese gambas to the Portuguese Gambit just don't make him angry all right so again I I don't know how good he is uh he's probably trash uh you know I like I doubt they would just copy the mittens business model right so I like to think of Chess as a language of its own um I'm going to play D4 uh and then and then I don't know what do we do I guess London I want to go here let not uh Queen D6 what bow before the queen what Rest in Peace by the way I'm just going to go Knight C3 I don't know I'm not I I I I have no idea I haven't been impressed yet I mean chess openings are like a can of worms they're delicious and there's lots of them what uh F3 because I want to play E4 why I suggest a Spanish lesson all right well Duo is attacking the pawn so I'm defending it and then okay that's not a bad move wait is it a bad move no I was thinking I could take this but I guess I can't uh E3 I mean again I don't know if I'm playing like a 2700 bot or like a 500 bot so I queen D6 yeah can I take I have to be very careful but can I take take take and then take on D5 isn't that just a free Pawn like what if I just go here and then take and then take cuz my queen of knights a discovered attack right I'm just going to be going here yeah am I losing that pawn that looks pretty stupid no I'm not losing that pawn so what if I play I mean Knight C3 right I guess there's takes and then take it actually took my Pawn on H2 why do you think Knights jump to the side is it because they're scared uh I don't I don't I don't know Duo I don't know I don't know um Knight E2 that is a weird I did not think it was going to do that I guess it could okay it's checking me and it's going to take but yeah I still haven't figured out how good this thing is cuz I feel like it's not playing all the best moves but it's okay whatever uh let's build up a a brick wall here and then let's get active with our Queen maybe we go to an end game it is a bot like I don't know I feel like I should be going for an end game against it potentially Queen E1 King D2 yeah you know let's go let's go to an end game if check okay it's not accepting my invitation to go to the end game so I'm just going to maneuver around Rook D1 um Queen D4 end game no end game end game it God this thing is annoying end game are we going to make a draw no I I can't draw it I can't draw I I'm not getting the sense that it's it's like some you know mittens level thing but uh I guess we will be figuring that out shortly King of2 it has this move to go here ah it's oh these Bots these Bots these Bots they are not they are not fun to play against King to G1 I I really don't like what I've done here um okay let me take and play Bishop B2 I'm definitely worse it's definitely doing fine it's it's nothing nothing crazy yet like what if I play F4 I'm kicking out the Knight I'm ready to move my yeah I'm ready to go here and then bring my king and then and then and then bring my Rook I mean I guess it has G5 okay it's not playing G5 which I guess is a good sign uh e 5 for me looks nice taking space Maybe putting my knight here okay I can't really tell what it's doing I'm going to put Knight E4 and then Knight D6 oh look at that Knight that is looking really good I think I'm taking over I think it's it's having one of these bot moments where it it can't really it's like it's sort of losing its focus on the position Queen F3 maybe Rook G1 okay Rook D1 and I'm going to hide my king here take take oh this is easy this is absolutely easy wait a minute let me be a little careful I don't want to get too confident okay let me hide my king now how am I going to win this that's the question Queen G3 but how am I going to win Rook D4 maybe Rook G4 I doubt it's just going to go down without a fight right Rook D4 Rook G4 that looks pretty good it's defending itself um okay let's regroup how do I break through oh my God now it's repeating moves against me A4 go on the other side of the board [Music] um maybe Rook F2 okay end game I've been trying to get an end game for a while I don't know if this is the way to go Bishop C2 oh my goodness what is what is that um can I split off its pawns like this Queen F4 uh can it like lose this this is this is this I I I never know okay uh C4 E6 and E7 looks decent I can also hide my king maybe Knight C8 it's it's not going to blunder a fork right I guess there I I guess I could try I mean I guess I could try maybe it'll blunder a fork it did not blunder a fork that but I can win a pawn I want a pawn is that is that good I think it was good it's trying to take this but I'm not convinced that's a good move oh it was also maybe trying to take that oh Queen wait a minute wait did it blunder wait Queen E4 and then if it takes there's Knight D6 did you know that the Polish word for Bishop did you know that the Polish word for you just lost a a oh there we there we go I don't care about polish words oh that's nice and then it's going to go here I'm going to stop it well now now now it should be just be an easy win right I mean I just hunt its pawns down I'll play something like Knight G4 it's going to go H5 I'll play Knight F2 okay this was this was this was you know we we'll okay it's not over but it's not over Knight H3 I still haven't won I could still I can totally envision myself throwing this game so let's just be cautious King D4 it's still not over still not over still not over it's playing very resiliently I suppose cuz it's a bot um maybe I need to reroute and put my knight there that might be the way to go that might be the way to go uh King G3 King E4 this is so annoying I have to keep it out it's going to go here Knight F2 why have I not won yet this is like this this is the real question how have I not managed to beat this thing okay I I think I'm just going to take right or maybe I will play G3 put my knight on F2 and then it can't get into my position what if I play G3 H2 Knight F2 and then I walk my king all the way to that pawn that might be the only way oh my goodness this thing was annoying okay King F1 King G2 and I'm winning the pawn and that probably means I'm going to win the game probably look at that look at look at that Fortress that we created oh my goodness well done well done by us King F1 come back to E2 and uh let's zigzag to E3 and then let's pick up one of the oh that was stressful that was stressful let's take uh let's take this one let's come back and that's it it's all part of the game it is all part of the game you are not mittens there can only be one animal bot champion and it is not this owl uh Knight B6 I take this pawn and can we just address the fact that people who dress up as owls are just like like what are we even do like what are why why King E5 yeah yeah yeah yeah come on come on come on come on come on I'll pre moove this I'll pre moove this let's go let's go let's go let's go pawns pawns pawns pawns I I'll beat it with black too I'm not scared I'll beat it with black too I'll beat it with both colors that's generally how I do these videos anyways I beat him with white and I beat him with black be C6 C6 B6 whatever makes absolutely no difference to me it doesn't know where the resign button is B7 it's going to go there I'm going to go there it's going to go King A6 I'm going to go Queen and then it is mate in a moment with Knight C3 and queen B6 Checkmate boom all right now I got to beat this stupid bot with the black pieces D4 Dutch defense if you're going to play the Dutch defense I'm going to throw you in a con what languages are my thing not yours if you were in a Dutch painting it wouldn't be called a still life it would be still a loser okay did y'all see this I will come in or okay all right I guess we're do doing this okay um that's the stunt and Gambit so I'm going to take the the pawn now um I feel like this is what nightmares are made of I don't I don't know speculo more like expect that's Belgian that's not even wait is I'm pretty sure that's a Belgian you you don't know your languages man hey you you don't you don't even know what you're saying forget church I'm going to take you to school E6 stun and gamit we're getting out of this I'm not I'm not worried I won the last game too so Bishop takes Bishop takes okay and and what ah okay I can't Castle you think you can intimidate me have you seen my peex you you don't have to go to a palace to meet my queen you just have to leave a piece under stop talking in riddles stop it I don't even understand I don't understand what's happening right now okay Queen E7 um I can't Castle this way because okay well now I now I might be able to Castle this way the pawn is hanging uh looking at the board you must come to one conclusion you're finished I'm getting ready to twerk on Your Grave that is I I don't even I don't know what's happening I don't diagonal is a street in Barcelona and you're about to be Road killed yo can we can we talk about this why can we hey man hey that's it's that's fine man I'm I smell fear oh yes no no no no no no I crushed you last game it's not it's not going to be that hard this game either I got some weaknesses but it's all good I got my Rook here you can't move your knight stupid um but I I thought oh cuz then and then I'm forked oh there's a for okay um well I don't really want to lose material so um let's go here we could talk about it Ian listen it's not a big deal I don't even I don't want to win that bad anyway I'm not I'm good I'm I'm good man I'm I'm good um how much they pay you to be in okay no problem are you oh my God oh my God I hung my paw no no no no no no I was too distracted I was what it didn't even take my pawn it didn't even okay um Bishop Bishop D7 no no no no no no no no no God no oh what yo Duo you are not very good there was just this you did not I didn't want my Rook anyway I don't you just got kicked by my horse that I didn't they did not this is this is unpaid by the way I'm just getting tortured I don't I don't even know what what's going on here okay um Rook E1 Queen yeah so down an exchange look I attacked your Rook what are you GNA do you gonna go here that's exactly what you did that's yeah that's what oh what happened how did the bot just destroy me in this game meanwhile the last game it played like at eight boogers I don't even how does that what okay I guess I got to I don't I don't want to play anymore I don't want to play anymore oh my God uh B B6 B6 B6 you can't Checkmate me B6 it's going to Checkmate me it's going to Checkmate me it's going to Checkmate me there's no it's not I'm safe I guess it just goes here right yeah oh I made it oh that's that's it cuz if I don't take then I get taken and I see you when you're sleeping I know when you're awake I know if you've been better good and boy are you bad at chess tremendous I I have grown to the point where there is a giant owl in my room and an owl on my screen and they are both making fun of me um okay well I guess I will go out ceremoniously by running my king to the other side of the board because that's what I teach people to do check and made in a couple somewhere Queen ah yeah that'll do it and that that so I got to sack my queen and I will go here and Duo still hasn't checkmated me CU Duo does not know how to Checkmate and that's that's yeah so so take that you when did this stupid thing get that close that one of these is made it's gonna be you can run but you can't it's m it's m it's m come on end the game there you go Rook G1 is mate oh my God I don't I think your language skills are any if your language skills are any indication I don't think you know the right answer if you're speechless about losing to a bird head to do link yeah yeah yeah we get it we we get it we get it this was really cool this was really cool you guys might never see me again but I don't know what's going to happen now but uh if I don't upload it was it was this I don't uh you uh what's my outro uh get out of here this was super cool check out the DU lingo Bots oh my God
