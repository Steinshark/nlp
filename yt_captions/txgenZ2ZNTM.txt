wireless internet that goes 830 mil or over, 1300 km if you're not American or British amazing but how is this possible believe it or not this distance was a world record set by using a protocol called lauran after trackers were installed on a fishing boat off the coast of Portugal and connected to a Gateway in the Canary Islands they were able to do this partly because luran uses relatively low frequencies around approximately the 900 MHz Mark for comparison most standard Wi-Fi connection use either 2.4 or 5 or 6 GHz frequencies due to the laws of physics lower frequency signals can travel farther and bend around obstacles more effectively and penetrate through them but even so the amount of data that a signal can carry decreases as the frequency gets lower and the signal travels farther so let's be a little more realistic what kinds of distances and speeds can you really expect with a 900 MHz connection well in addition to lowan there's also a Wi-Fi standard called Halo for which the devices have just started to hit the market the ranges are a little bit different luran can get around 5 km in a city and about 10 in a more rural area where there aren't as many structures to block the signal however luran speeds are very low very low we're talking only as fast as a dialup connection under ideal circumstances often lower than that Halo on the other hand has a shorter range of about 1 km though we can reach farther under good conditions where you have a clear line of sight realistically these speeds can range from about 150 kilobits per second to around 15 megabits per second depending on how far away you are and any obstructions in the signals path though the theoretical maximums are higher so what exactly is the point of having long range internet if it's so slow we'll tell you more right after we thank ODU for sponsoring this video so what can they OD do for you well if you're looking for a highquality website for your business but lack the coding experience to make it happen their open source platform is packed with user friendly drag and drop Design Elements and features that can help anyone build a gorgeous website and with odu's AI copywriter powered by chat gbt you'll never have to worry about creating content odu's website e-commerce application is not only 100% free it also comes with unlimited hosting and they even pay for your custom domain name for the first year visit the link below and start building your dream website with ODU if we're talking about the insanely slow speeds of lauran it turns out there are plenty of devices out there that don't need much bandwidth at all think about a moisture sensor that a farmer wants to check without having to go out into the fields tracking of mass transit buses or even radiation sensors in nuclear plants that can penetrate through thick layers of concrete additionally Amazon sidewalk Network that uses Echo and ring products to link iot devices like sensors and smart lights uses luran so that the signal can cover longer distances and before you helium people start freaking now yes helium crypto yes that's loww 2o and because you don't need much electrical power to move such small amounts of data there are loroan devices that can run off batteries for many years before needing to be replaced Halo's faster speeds though mean that it can be used for applications other than just iot although these speeds are still obviously much slower than the average internet connection they're still fast enough to complete simple tasks and even video calls at long ranges this was actually shown recently in a test conducted by the company Morse micro which maintained a 1 mbit per second speed over a distance of 3 km even with Urban interference this is cool it's cool but most typical client devices don't use the Halo protocol so what could this mean for you well there are wireless bridge kits that you can buy to send a Halo signal from one location receive it in another and then convert it to a more common Wi-Fi standard that client devices like PCS and phones can use so while it obviously won't replace a regular home Wi-Fi connection and is still primarily more for iot it could help with basic connectivity in rural areas without much wired infrastructure or if you're just Rich have a huge tract of land and want to throw a bone to The Peasants staying in the guest house this is the protocol for you so thanks for watching guys if you like this video maybe you want to step back and see just what is a modem and a switch and a router anyway what's the difference we got a video on that check it out
