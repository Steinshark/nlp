hello everyone and welcome we are sitting inside of the 2020 nissan nismo gtr and so that's we're going to be discussing in this video now recently nissan gave me the opportunity to check out the 50th anniversary gtr the track package gtr and what we are in right now which is the nissmo gtr coming in just over 210 000. so as i am sure will come up in the comments we are going to get to you know the two things that i think most people are going to talk about with this thing the fact that it's old yes it's been around the block the gtr was introduced for the model year 2008 and of course the price tag uh both of those i think are going to be big talking points but the focus of this video is not uh the repetitive talking points that you will likely hear about this car instead we're going to focus on the technical changes that make this nissan's fastest gtr ever which they have built uh there are actually some pretty cool changes even though this is essentially you know in in many ways very similar to the car that came out 12 or so years ago so first we are going to talk about the engine so this has a 3.8 liter twin turbo engine yes it's that same 3.8 uh that we know and love from nissan's history with this gtr now just like the previous 2019 model year this still just has 600 horsepower just 600 horsepower it's plenty 481 pound-feet of torque same numbers same torque curve as the previous 2019 nissan gt-r and yet this one is quicker so how is that well they've made some changes to the turbocharger so they now have incorporated the nissan gt3 cars uh turbochargers into this road car so the race car into the road car as far as the turbochargers are concerned what changes they made to those turbochargers instead of 11 vanes on that turbine wheel they have moved down to 10 vanes and each of those vanes is 0.3 millimeters less thick so they've reduced the thickness of those veins and so what does all that mean well nissan says that that is good for a 14.5 reduction in mass of that spinning turbine wheel which results in a 24 reduction in rotational inertia which results in a 20 improvement uh in getting that engine response so the time it takes from you know not having your foot on the pedal at all to flooring it the time it takes to get full torque has been decreased by 20 you get it 20 quicker so there is an improvement in turbo lag a significant improvement in turbo leg would i say that i can feel it i haven't driven them back to back and the car still does have i mean even if you're in the appropriate gear put your foot down you do wait for that torque to come on uh they have added as you might be able to faintly hear from inside the cabin they have added those exhaust crackles and pops so a little bit of fuel enrichment with late timing and you get some pops in the exhaust as you're on those downshifts which is cool so the engine response 20 better response now what does that mean real world so what nissan says is if you take two cars if you take the 2019 and you put it next to the 2020 nismo gtr you line them both up on a highway at 55 miles per hour and both of them floored at the exact same time after five seconds the 2020 same horsepower same torque will be ahead of the 2019 by 2.8 meters now that's a little bit over half a car length so is it all that impressive not necessarily but it is cool that they have actively taken a step to reduce the turbo lag in this car and i feel like you know that is something that is pretty noticeable in this vehicle is the turbo leg so they've taken steps to reduce it i think that's cool now how much faster is the 2020 versus the 2019 well nissan's internal test track they say this car is 2.5 seconds faster around their development track versus the 2019. so that is a serious improvement the fact that they've shaved you know two and a half seconds off their track time and we'll get into some of the more other reasons for that aside from reducing turbo lag because honestly going around the track you're not going to have to worry too much about turbo lag you're going to be keeping that engine revved up and it's not going to be a huge concern so another big focus on this car has been weight reduction it's about 45 pounds less than the 2019 nismo gtr it's about 68 pounds less than the base premium gtr so where does that weight savings come from well they've used a ton of carbon fiber so the front bumper is carbon fiber the front hood is carbon fiber the front fenders are carbon fiber the roof is carbon fiber helping to lower that center of gravity the trunk is carbon fiber the rear bumper is carbon fiber the only body panels if you look at this exterior and say you know what's not carbon fiber the door sills those side sills are carbon fiber the doors are made out of aluminum and the rear fenders are made out of steel now here's my thing with this because the car is 210 000 right so that's pretty expensive and they kind of went all out but not quite all out with the carbon fiber so if it were me if i had the active choice of saying where would i want carbon fiber i would have rather had the doors and rear fenders than carbon fiber and then the front and rear bumpers if they don't want to make them carbon fiber fine do a plastic a fiberglass whatever lightweight material they want to do you know not as light not as strong as carbon fiber but those are those high incident areas so the front rear bumper where you're going to be likely uh to have an incident if someone's going to you know rear-end you or if you perhaps nudge something with the front bumper those in plastic to me you know it's a little bit heavier but it's so much more cost effective and then you could take out the weight savings on the doors and the rear fenders i think you can kind of offset things or just make it all carbon fiber because it's 210 000 so that's my kind of thoughts on what they should have done still having steel in the rear fenders is like why are we still using steel if we're actually really concerned about weight reduction and as far as the weight reduction you know this car is still about 3 900 pounds so it's not light and and it's not like the focus of the gtr was ever to be this really light car so the the weight difference you know versus the standard premium gtr is less than two percent of the car's overall weight uh so it's a difference yes you know 68 pounds versus the premium 45 pounds versus the previous generation nissmo it's always great to get weight out but it's still a pretty hefty car now where else have they taken out some weight so nissan uh says that the combined weight reduction out of the wheels do you want to take a guess perhaps 10 pounds they've taken out of the wheels maybe five pounds one pound forged aluminum raised wheels very cool wheels great tires on it uh is 100 grams so about a fifth of a pound has been taken out combined weight of the wheel so that's great now as far as the brakes there is some real weight savings there and that's not only rotational inertia but it's also unsprung mass so it's great that it comes standard with these carbon ceramic massive carbon ceramic brakes nissan says they're the largest used in any japanese sports cars history 16.1 inches in the front 15.3 in the rear just massive i mean 16.1 that's bigger than some wheels on cars uh you know today's cars are generally larger wheeled but 16.1 inch brakes massive anyways it saves 36 pounds versus steel rotor so an impressive amount of weight reduction done simply by switching over to these crazy expensive but very heat resistant brakes now these brakes they have yellow calipers yellow painted calipers why did they choose yellow paint well yes it looks good but it turns out that it was the best color for dealing with heat so long term they didn't have to worry about you know discoloring as much fade as much distortion of that color long-term use through heat cycling and it's good for temperatures up to 1800 degrees fahrenheit so very impressive that the calipers can handle that heat and the paint can handle that heat and the rotors themselves supposedly good for up to 2000 degrees fahrenheit and still have good braking so carbon ceramics meant for abuse on the track which is what this car is really designed for the nissimo gtr uh you need to take it out onto a track to fully appreciate it now everyone knows i love talking about tires and i'm excited to talk about them on this car because there's actually a really significant change and perhaps it's the most significant change for this car from a numbers standpoint so there is a new compound same size tire as the previous nissimo gtr and nissan gtr so if you want to put these newer tires on your old gt-r i would recommend doing that but new compound for them for the 2020 model year seven percent improvement in grip and that is very meaningful so you know i think the the turbo lag thing can kind of be overplayed as far as how much of a difference is there uh the weight reduction certainly overplayed because it's less than two percent of a difference of this car's weight seven percent grip i don't think people grasp how much of a difference that really is that is huge and if i were to bet my money on where those 2.5 seconds came from around their development track i would put most of my money on the fact that they have these different tires so it's a new compound it's a new tread pattern i'll show you kind of a difference looking at the rear tires so you know not super noticeable as far as looking at the tread and yet the tread has 11 percent greater contact patch you can notice a slight difference in the camber and where this tire is actually touching the road based on where it's picking up that dirt i pulled off into the same little dirt lot here to film these two side by side so interesting to see that change but not a huge difference in the tread pattern but enough so that they say eleven percent greater contact patch overall seven percent more grip and as far as lateral cornering it is able to hold a five percent greater cornering force five percent greater cornering force all you did was change the tires that is a huge huge numbers improvement as far as what it will translate to in the real world now there's also been some focus on the aerodynamics of this car so it still has a drag coefficient of just 0.26 and you know by today's standards yes there are cars that are getting below 0.26 but 0.26 is still very respectable especially when you start to look at the shape of this car you know it has this kind of menacing mean appearance to it it's kind of blockier than a lot of the cars that have lower drag coefficients than 0.26 and yet it's able to achieve that very aerodynamic design and they've improved the downforce on this car without increasing uh that drag coefficient so cool that they've been able to keep it at 0.26 apparently these front uh fender louvers which are carbon fiber you can see those kind of scalloped louvers on the front and left side of the car those are helping to pull heat away from the engine bay they also they say they increase downforce on the front end by 15 pounds and they do not increase drag so impressive that they've made some arrow tweaks to the car and maintain that drag coefficient of just 0.26 as far as the suspension they say that because they've taken out some of the weight they've chosen to go with softer damping so rebound which is when you are letting that tire drop it's moving away from the vehicle has been softened by twenty percent and compression has been softened by five percent so when the wheel when you hit a bump and it moves towards the body and so as a result honestly when i got in this thing versus the previous i believe i've driven a 2018 nissan gtr it does actually feel like a softer more compliant ride i mean the knees mode gtr if you put it in r mode with the suspension it's just going to bat you around everywhere you go and the whole thing shakes over every little bump but if you put it in this comfort mode here it's actually not too bad as far as you know what kind of car you're in and what the ride feels like it's still stiff don't get me wrong uh but it does feel better than the previous nissmo gtr which i drove and i believe some of that has to do with softening the damping of the suspension all right let's get to the juicy bit that everyone likes to talk about is this thing still relevant or is it this ancient dinosaur uh that no longer matters in the supercar world and you know i've actually been thinking about that question quite a bit as i've been driving this over about the past week and a half and what when i try to point out you know what what about this car feels old because yes we know it's old simply because it came out in 2008 but what about this car actually feels old and as far as the all-wheel drive system it's a fantastic all-wheel drive system it's able to transfer torque from 100 at the rear up to a 50 50 split so very cool for a sports car to be able to still have a hundred percent on the rear tires uh when you want it up to 50 percent of the front tires when you need it very cool that it has that you know 600 horsepower is plenty we've started to get into these crazy horsepower wars and you know you can get into 700 horsepower cars for 60 grand great i think it's awesome that we can do that but is it all street usable in this car you can use every one of those 600 horsepowers because of that great all-wheel drive system and 600 is a lot the car is quick 0-60 well under 3 seconds so you don't have to worry about speed in this thing it's not like it's slow suddenly because 10 years have gone by uh so the all-wheel drive system's good the engine is good the interior honestly in this nissmo is fantastic i mean i i hear a lot of rattles in many of the gtr's which i've been in but as far as the appearance here and i haven't heard too many rattles in this one thankfully at 210 000 uh and you've got apple carplay so it kind of brings the infotainment into the 21st century you've got all these cool gauges that you can look at while you're driving oil pressure boost that kind of thing so you know there's the interior is still nice to me the engine is nice the all-wheel drive system is nice the ride is fine the tires are great uh what gives away that this thing is old and really there's only two things that i can point out one of them being weight and i don't really think that this is fair to point out the car is really heavy but so are a ton of today's cars we unfortunately don't have too many companies that are really focusing on reducing the weight of their cars there's some good ones out there but it doesn't seem to be a major focus of many of the cars out there a lot of them kind of seem to prioritize how much power do they have let's not worry about weight people don't seem to care all that much so it is heavy for what it is uh in the 200 000 super car range you can certainly get into some lighter vehicles than this uh but i don't necessarily think that makes it feel irrelevant for today's time so the one thing that is uh not that great in this car and really truly shows this car's age is the transmission so what are my problems with the transmission well if you're on a track or if you're driving seven tenths of your you know your highest performance or above you're not going to notice problems with it it's very quick shifting it is capable of very quick shifts uh the thing is if you drive below seven tenths and you're just kind of cruising around town it's loud it's really clunky and it's slow to respond so it's kind of everything you don't want in transmission and that's what shows the age because this thing was developed you know mid 2000 2005 maybe they started developing this transmission and so when you drive i mean okay i'm in sixth gear right now i put my foot down first of all you get that loud clunk it individually drops through sixth fifth fourth third okay now we start to accelerate so you know in today's age we have the ability you can build in the logic to say hey if someone's driving at 35 miles per hour and you're in sixth gear and you floor it you should probably just go straight to second or third and then give it full power instead of going fifth fourth third and that logic can be built in so that's why i don't understand it's in r mode so it's in this like aggressive gearing mode and yet it's not capable of skipping gears it has to go one by one through them dual clutch transmissions don't have to do that they tend to pre-select the next lowest gear but that doesn't mean it you know it would still save time if it just went straight to second or third rather than going through all those gears on the way the other thing so i don't know if you heard when i put my foot down that loud dunk and it's just a kind of a brutal transmission i mean these things are pretty bulletproof you hear about them just tracking all day long and not having any problems uh and and so the transmission is great for that but as far as refinement it is not a refined transmission it's loud it's clunky and it's super slow to respond so typically if you want to be in the right gear and you're driving around town you're going to want to put it into the manual mode and then it's fine the shifts are fine they're decently quick you've still got that clunkiness to it if you're not going all out they're actually nice and smooth if you're just you know flat out going for it uh but in the kind of puttering around mode is where this thing does not shine and it's making all kinds of noises and it's not smooth transitions one thing i will give them credit for which i have been impressed by you know this is an old dct and it's very good at crawling so if you get down to one or two miles per hour this thing just does it all day long i was sitting in monterey car week traffic for a good week uh and this thing would do it all day long no problem crawl around at one mile per hour and you know that's clutch is slipping so i'm wondering is there going to be too much heat building up is it going to cope with it it did just fine and it's nice engagement you know it's similar in feel to a torque converter and you don't always get that with you know these clutch transmissions that are trying to slip so that you can inch along at low speeds so i have been impressed at the low speed operation and when you're going all out it's a great transmission but as a daily driver the transmission shows its age versus what we have in today's modern cars all right so now let's touch on price so the gtr premium starts at about 113 000 the track package at about 145 000 and this is about 210 000. so 65 000 over the track package gtr the track package gtr has the same wheels same tires it has the same engine with the new turbo chargers it has the same horsepower same torque that has the carbon fiber roof so for 65 grand more what are you getting you're getting some carbon fiber body panels and you're getting you know those carbon ceramic brakes the carbon ceramic brakes are a 15 000 option if you choose to get them on the track package so that puts you at a fifty thousand dollar gap for you know getting into the nissmo here which you know 40 to 50 pounds lighter than the track package so not a huge difference between the two and a massive difference in price so if you want the quickest you know this is the quickest but the gtr track pack is very close and even still it's not like you know the base premium version is slow it's down you know 35 horsepower 565 uh even less torque as far as the differential between them so the the gtr at that 113 it's hard to justify bumping at a hundred thousand dollars nearly to get into the nismo so are the performance upgrades worth it that depends on the buyer of course uh from a performance standpoint it doesn't really seem like it my my like personal thing if i were to choose one of these i'd probably get the base premium at 113 put on the tires from the gtr nissmo which you know the new tires which are fantastic they've got more grip and then you've got a killer core and you saved yourself nearly a hundred grand but truthfully i don't think this core is irrelevant today you know a lot of people think uh it's super dated but the performance is still there uh and the increase in performance has happened throughout the years the price is what's kind of a big deterrent there but it still seems quite relevant even in today's world uh 12 years later and i think the only really thing that shows its age is that transmission so overall it's a super solid car it's crazy fast you know the launch mode uh getting 0 to 60 well under 3 seconds like this thing is pretty impressive so a big thank you to all of you for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
