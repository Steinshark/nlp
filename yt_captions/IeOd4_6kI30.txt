- Oh my God (grunts). - Is that a cyber quad? (Crowd Cheering) (Thud sound) - Ooh. (Laughing) (Thud sound) - [Ken] So this is not
the real cyber quad. This is like the, we went to Toys"R"Us and found
like the miniature version. - Rest in peace. - [Ken] But Tesla still sells it. MSRP $1,900. - Oh my God, I don't think I can get this up by myself. - [Matt] I believe in you. - I don't. - [Matt] To rephrase, I believe in watching you struggle. - [Ken] Yes. That. - Ready and. Okay, I can't. I'm just gonna open the box. Just that I'm gonna open the box. - [Matt] What if we have to return it? - I'm opening the box. All right. One cyber quad has been assembled.  How fast is this supposed to go? - [Ken] 10 miles an hour. Okay. - Oh. Oh, okay. It has lights. That's cool. All right. Onward. (Quad electric motor sound) Wait, this is gonna be. (Squeaking noises) (Door opening) - [Ken] Oh, he is really going for it. (Beeping sound) There he goes. (Explosion sound effect) (Accelerating sound) (Excited Laughter) - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay. (Warped voices) - [Austin] How does 10
miles an hour feel, huh? (Chill music) - How's it going? Getting some cardio in? (Laughs) (Chill music) (Rewind tape sound) - [Josh] Can you pop a wheelie? - [Ken] Do you want to? - I can't do a wheelie, but I can definitely put it sideways. - Oh! OH! Ohhh! - [Austin] Keep it going! - [Josh] Wow! - I believe in myself. - Yo, if you just got the power of friendship and belief
you can do anything. That's what anime has taught me. - [Austin] Good advice. Ken, I'll race you! - Feels very weird on my body. (Shouting gibberish) - Vroom vroom Mother (beep) (Laughing) (Breathing heavily) - Hello and welcome friends to Austin catching boxes for the first time in his life. Oh. Oh, this is my item. Thanks. All right. So this is something that I backed on Indiegogo, I think a year ago. So the Xbox Series S is
a great little console but, you know what's missing? Portability, which is where the xScreen comes in. Do you remember the PS one with the display that
you attached to the top? Yeah. It's that same
idea for the Series S. However, while this is not an officially
licensed Microsoft product. From what I've seen from the many many Indiegogo backer updates, I've gotten over email the last year, they put a lot of serious time and effort into developing something which will actually make sense. - [Ken] Serious time? - Serious development. Now, I'll be honest. I backed this long enough ago that I don't remember
how much I spent on it. [Ka-Ching] You plugged this into the Series S, it takes advantage of
the HDMI and the USB. However, you are gonna
be losing your second USB as well as your ethernet. I guess it's fair enough. But you do still have access to your storage expansion and your power. And to be fair, you still do
have an additional USB port on the front, so you can charge
your controller and whatnot. - Yeah. That's just not
lining up right. Mm. - [Matt] If you get a running
start, I'm sure you could. - Oh, I got it. I got it. Okay. Took a little bit of persuasion. First thing, the color match
is very close, but not perfect. This I would say is a very
tiny shade of white off, it's a touch more sort
of beige versus white. How does it look when you close it? I mean, that actually. - [Ken] That's really good. - That's not bad. - [Ken] I like that. - What's the stand for? So open the xScreen flat, lift front of Xbox and attach feet. Ohhh. So it's like this. - [Matt] Yeah. So you can. - That's, that's cool! - [Matt] It gets to eye level. - I'm now much more convinced
that this is totally cool - [Ken] Oh that is awesome. It's like a little kiosk. - [Matt] You are blowing hot air directly into your face but. - Ah, that's fine, dude. The Series S, it's warm air. All right. Does this fit in here altogether? - [Ken] I would hope so. - It does nicely actually. And then I guess you could
put your extra power cables and whatnot here. - [Ken] Oh, that is,
that is a cool package. Whoa. - All right. Let's turn on the Xbox. I mean, I will say the
viewing angles are not bad. Also, it's a, it's a matte display. It's not glossy. I haven't played the game yet. I'm looking. I think this is this, this this is feeling like a good
product to me right now. - 2JZ, you can't go wrong. - [Game Character] Turn
around if it is safe to do so. - [Ken] Ooh, the sound! An 11.6 inch display
completely will mask any of the deficiencies in the
performance of the Series S because 1080p on a display that's this
small is gonna look super, super sharp. - [Ken] The pixel density
is way high on this. - Yeah. I will say this layout does
blow hot air towards you. I actually didn't think
it was that noticeable but when you have the
Series S directly facing towards you, you do notice it. - Huh? - Okay. Hang on. Let's try it in the
standard configuration. Huhhh! The Series S laptop! (racing car engine) - I'm not used to playing
games like this close so it actually feels a little bit weird. It does work though. - [Ken] But it's good. The screen it's good that the screen will
go back a little more. Yeah. - Yeah. I could definitely
like lean it back. And honestly, the fact
that it's anti glare, especially here in the
studio where we have so many studio lights actually
does help quite a bit. Supposedly if I close this screen and if I've set it up correctly,
it will turn off the Xbox. So there's the only way to find out. Right? And (Power off sound) - Oh That's cool. This video is sponsored by Kamikoto. Living life on the cutting

episode of Mystery Tech. Right. (drops box) You definitely just gave me a paper cut. (soft piano music) This is the FAO Schwartz step to your own tune,
giant dance on piano. Is this just an excuse for
me to dance for mystery tech? Because I'm all about that right now. All right. This is a lot of, oh my God. - [Ken] Wow. Most importantly
it comes with the alphabet. (laughing) - That's not the alphabet. Do not know music theory, Kenneth? - [Ken] So this is an FAO Schwarz staple. - [Austin] FAO Schwarz is
some New York store, right? - [Ken] It's a New York toy store. It's yeah. It's the toy store that everyone thinks of when they think of toy stores. - [Matt] It's the one from Home Alone 2. (piano notes) - Yeah. You know, piano notes? (Alternating piano notes) - My Pokemon's low on HP. What am I gonna do? ("Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" on piano) - Does it do chords? - I don't know. Try it. (out of tune piano sound) (Laughing) - Okay. This is gonna sound really racist but I wanna learn how
to play chopsticks and I've never done that before. - [Jared] Why's that racist? (random piano notes) (Descending piano notes) - No, no, no, no. - Oh. How are you? What? Whoa. He almost. Wait a minute. - That's racist. - Wait, what happens if you hit this? (higher pitch on piano) ("FÃ¼r Elise" - Beethoven) - Do it! - Oh my god! (Clapping) - Virtuoso! - Wait, wait. Get outta the way. Lemme try this. Lemme try this (classical piano music) - [Matt] Maybe, you just
need to know the rhythm? Which you're still messing up on. (Sped up classical piano music) Oh! (Fast classical piano) - Aw! Why did I try to catch that? Ow! - [Ken] You did that yourself. - I just put my hand underneath it to catch it
and it just squashed my hand. - [Ken] What's next,
you're gonna sniff it too? Just a disclaimer for this one. We've been sitting on
this box for a while. We haven't shot mystery tech since before the end of last year. When did Halo Infinite come out? - December. So it's been sitting around since December. Oh, it's a Halo thing. Okay. - [Ken] No way, shock. Oh really? Did you really ask that? I just, I gave you the hint. - Just a side note with Halo Infinite, Weapon is better than Cortana. - [Austin] Who? - Weapon. - [Austin] Oh. - I thought you played the
game, but apparently not. There's a lock on this crate. - [Matt] I feel a little
like with Microsoft, you always have to check
those pieces of cardboard. - Don't think I needed the lock. (laughing) - [Ken] To be fair. That, that I definitely
opened it beforehand. - (in disbelief) What?! - [Ken] I needed to. I needed to sniff it out
and make sure that it wasn't poison. It's not poison. - [Austin] Box number two. Oh God. - [Matt] Bro. - [Jared] Dude. (Breathing in heavily) - Found an elite controller. - [Matt] Why is it that everything
I plan on taking you drop - Yo. Okay. Even this sleeved cable. Oh my God. Yo, this is absolutely sick. - [Ken] Okay. I love the gold D Pad. The gold D Pad is really good. - [Austin] Yeah. That is ridiculous. I mean, look, the elite controller, (gibberish) shut up. (Laughing) Shut up. - [Ken] We get it. English is hard. It's all right. - Ohhh. - [Ken] Yeah. Yeah. - Don't, don't peek. The audience. They, they can see that. They're all very impressed. - [Ken] People think we
have a studio audience - Studio audience. If you wanna join the
studio audience, just send your mother's maiden name
and your credit card number. - [Ken] Oh my God is that Chief? Chief? Looks like a, looks about
150 pounds too light, but - [Austin] Where's the Arbiter? I didn't know that 1 1 7 stood for inches. (Laughing) - [Austin] Wait's still pretty good. I'll be 117 inches. - Yeah. That's still pretty good. You know, I've gotta say
the helmet like that kind of looks like Master Chief's head and I don't really like that. - [Ken] It's kind of like, you
actually beat him in person. and this is just your. - We defeated the Spartans. Oh my God. Oh wow. You guys actually got the mini fridge? So as a joke, when the Xbox
Series X first got announced everyone made fun of it because
it looked like a fridge. So the mad lads at Xbox they didn't take a joke laying down. They made an actual legitimate working Xbox. It's a mini fridge. And yet it is one to 0.5 to 1 scale. So it's even bigger than a Series X. Behold my friends,
something wiggled inside. I don't like that. Behold, the Xbox Series XXL. Wow. It's even got the
fake ports on the back. Do you see this? You got the mega USB. This is now 1.5 to 1 scale. That's way bigger than USB. That's huge. Yeah. That's oh - [Ken] Oh my God. Yo. Oh my, I can't believe
they included that in there. - Did you really put our
Series X inside the fridge? - [Ken] No. Yes.
