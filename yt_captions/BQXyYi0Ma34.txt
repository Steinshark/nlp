all right here we go security alert don't npm install https first off when I saw this this is crazy look at this I'm turning off alerts before one goes off I did it I did it there's no alerts yes yes yes yes this makes me feel so good try it try it go ahead clap for me clap for me right now thank you Albert I appreciate that again here we go it happened it finally happened I got it using technology there goes the meme don't worry it's coming back the node H the node.js https module is a built-in module that allows you to make secure https hypertext transfer protocol secure request to servers yes it's built in it's just already there you don't need it you don't need to install it it provides a way to communicate securely over the Internet by encrypting the data transmitted between the client and the server using SSL TLS protocols here's a very simple usage of it required in do a little bit of this do a little bit of that bing bada boom okay a package called https however also exists on this oh yes the https package has been published eight years ago looking at the package contents we can see that it contains just a manifest file and no actual code it looks like let's see it looks like a simple useless package until we see that over 1600 other packages directly depend on it and many more depend on it indirectly without even knowing it this is probably a result of the maintainer not being aware that https is internal to node and thinking they need to install it it also has been asked on stack Overflow multiple times you're telling me that nobody has taken this over and at least put in some malicious code like minimally you're telling me we can't even get a malicious https it's pathetic I was at least hoping for a Bitcoin miner or something ebn could you work on that ebn and pick I'm going to send my Haskell boys go get them okay well I go learn oh camel you go find that and get malicious okay deliciously malicious okay https is not even secure damn um let's see it looks like a simple useless package yeah yeah this is probably the result of the maintainer not being aware that HPS is internal to node.js and thinking they need to install it it's also been asked wait no this doesn't make any sense why would the main oh the maintainers of those other packages yes uh nodes require will uh load built-in modules first oh so it's not even a security problem so even if the code would be included in the new version of the npm https package it would never run by a simple required the danger of having HPS in your list of uh of dependencies rather comes from the possibility of the package being reactivated with a new version that contains an install script okay did you hear that edn pick you hear what's gonna happen here I like that you can actually install things that you cannot use and nodes like yeah that's cool Go For It npm Whatever not a big deal you want to do that got it um did you uh did you recover The Prime Time YouTube channel what wait I got hacked what no wait did I wait am I discovering right now that I just got hacked no no I did not I don't even believe you studio YouTube okay it's still right there worst performing video it's right there I did not get in trouble get out of here you guys all freak me out okay people get people keep going getting hacked okay jerk move I must have installed HPS oh gosh I cannot believe this is happening to me all right it currently gets downloaded more than 500 000 times per week and at any moment in the future publishing a 1.1 version with a malicious install script would enable potential attackers uh access to a great number of development and build machines to steal information and install arbitrary software oh my goodness please please somebody make a Bitcoin miner like look how amazing this would be somebody take it over you know luckily with npm it's very hard to take take things over you know what I mean it's very hard the sandstorm team has reached out to the package maintainers and authors that currently rely on this and suggest they remove it okay wow I can't believe oh cool there's a thing called sandworm about it okay and so I'll go through and tell you if things are dangerous okay I'm actually shocked that people do this I wonder how this happened like how did people how do you not know that hcps is a built-in module it's so that's one okay so if we're gonna be real here this is one of those things that terrifies me um about node in general right is that there's just really and truly no safety ever and then on top of that anyone can put up stuff right but on top of that there's like node.js is like the first thing new programmers learn and so the likelihood of them getting bamboozled is the like the highest out of anybody right you just have you have no experience you don't know what's available and you just install everything that you're told and boom I don't know seems kind of terrifying the highest next fixes this does Nix fix this Bamboozled as a service this has been this is left a man no the problem with left pad is that they didn't even go malicious on it really they just they just like stopped doing it I don't know what the story behind the person was I know I I've heard some various rumors but I tend to stay off the internet Rumor Mill uh but they just like broke it and all these like every single package on the internet fell apart I mean if anything it's hilarious about every package on the internet relying on left pad what what right like why we've already been over this on the article where uh on the stream where it's just like left pad is not even a complicated thing to write it's 11 lines in the most basic format it's super straightforward uh it's just shocking that people go in search of a module to do just that one thing and that there's even one like color JS yeah I've heard of color JS color JS at least is pretty reasonable to want to rely on because you don't want to be writing all those different terminal codes and everything to make stuff work out like that's totally reasonable to rely on the left pad's crazy uh does crates for rust have more I I know there's some there's some level of well I mean first off rust has one thing that makes it easier which is that you go to the standard first right is array is also built in and people still use israe module see that's blows my mind Israel has been built in I don't even know when is array appeared on the array namespace but it's been around for a long yeah the problem JS is that the standard Library it totally sucks there's not like there's no entry point into it and it's just as crazy uh they added a randomized infinite Loop in color JS really that's hilarious imagine how many people got bit by that oh that would be so awful I wonder if I use color Js huh yeah there's a lot of those is odd is even packages all that anyways it's just to me these are the things that seem to exist in a very dangerous way in node.js they're totally available also in Rust like rust isn't somehow immune from it but it just seems like there's less crazy packages in Rust and what I mean by that is you're gonna find I bet you the amount of packages actually installed and built every single day there's probably like 200 of the exact same ones constantly and then there's a few outliers right less Junior developers than Russ absolutely and so they're just the problems are a little bit different uh npm is just a Dumping Ground of all code yes I know there is an is odd oh I get that people put that in there uh anyways I don't know node.js huh you know it just I mean I think in general what this really speaks to is that we rely so much on the goodness of of Open Source all the time type one in the chat if you are actively sponsoring somebody on GitHub right now type one in the chat not a huge amount you know every now and then because you know I have a slightly public figuring and I also work at Netflix by the way uh Hey thank you very much humble thank you thank you you've or uh Hubert sorry I misread that I was looking at the small text thank you for sponsoring me hey baby I appreciate that uh I don't know why you just sponsored me I'm kind of shitty to open source guy um but real talk every now about once every two months I get a message that's just like hey man you work at Netflix and Netflix uses this open source package why aren't you sponsoring them Netflix and I'm like dude I'm first off I'm an engineer I don't speak for uh Netflix I I just I I work on a team that works in C plus and we have like we're just kind of by ourselves in our own Island I'm not really sure what you're talking about second off I can't speak for Netflix again it's always wild that that happens it happens quite frequently which is a little bit surprising but what can you do anyways sponsor open source projects is the moral of the story okay sponsor them I had a couple sponsors and then my credit card got stolen I haven't re-upped it I feel bad about that feels bad all right hey the name is the prime agenda
