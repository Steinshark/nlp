recently pycharm has added a new feature to their code editor called inlay hints and I believe that every code editor should have the option to enable this so to quickly demonstrate what it is I have a class called fruit that has an initializer that takes a name and some calories and next we're going to instantiate that so we're going to create a banana of type fruit which will equal a fruit and we will pass in those parameters so first we will insert banana and then we will say that banana has 50 calories and immediately you're going to notice two things first that we have two usages of this class and the first one is referring to the hint itself and the second one is referring to the class but something even nicer is that it automatically gave us hints based on the parameter names so we didn't pass in any keyword arguments we didn't explicitly say that the name is equal to banana and that the calories are equal to 50. the code editor was smart enough to infer which parameters we were using and gave us those hints which I think is super cool because very often I like to be quite explicit with my parameters so I would usually pass in the keyword argument instead of just the argument itself but now with these inlay hints I'm kind of getting a bit more lazy towards those keyword arguments because the hints tell me immediately what I'm inserting which will lead to me making less mistakes so that was a quick example using the class but it also works with functions so if we have a function that takes let's say three arguments such as a b and c and all it does is print a b and c we can then call that and we can pass in let's say 10 20 and some text and it will give us the corresponding argument names so I think it's quite a nice touch for any code editor if you are coding in Vim as something else of course this is irrelevant but if you like to use powerful code editors such as myself I think you will love this feature anyway let's move on to how you can activate this in pycharm if it's not already activated because for me after a certain update I started to notice that first the functions are now blue for some reason and second that I got these inlay hints popping up out of nowhere but I did receive some comments asking how did I do this and I had no idea myself so I did some research and obviously it's somewhere in the settings so first of all open up the pycharm settings and what you want to look for what did I want to look for and what you want to do is go to the editor and scroll down to the inlay hint section and here you have something called code Vision parameter names and other if you activate usages you will see the times that a class or a function is being used right next to the original function and you can also choose the position for that by default it's set to the top but I decided to put it to the right because it keeps on giving me extra lines of code which I don't really like so I made sure to keep it to the right then there's the code author in case someone else wrote something it will show the code author next to your function and then we have the parameter names where you can activate that for Python and that works for class Constructor calls and for non-literal arguments but once you have all of these selected you can tap on OK and you should start to see these cool inlay hints anyway that's actually all I wanted to cover in today's video do let me know if you found this feature to be particularly useful or if you see it being useful in the near future I would love to hear about that in the comment section down below but otherwise as always thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
