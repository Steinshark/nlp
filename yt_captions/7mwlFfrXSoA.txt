ladies and gentlemen few things in this world are truly perfect The Only Exception might be me staring at the camera at the beginning of every video but today I will show you a perfect chess game it's not sarcasm it's not one of my low ELO games this was a game played yesterday between Grand Master Hikaru Nakamura and Sam Savion at the American Cup in St Louis Hikaru played a perfect game of chess and I will be sharing it with you because it's actually fascinating how all of us have our battles at whatever ELO we are you might be 800 1600 200 2500 and I battle all the same uh kinds of things just against a slightly different ELO and Hikaru just made it look so easy he just made it look so incredibly easy and I had to share it with all of you this was a 90 minute game of chess this was not Hikaru playing title Tuesday or bullet this is a 90 minute game of chess and I would like to show it to you so let's watch give me about 15-20 minutes of your time and witness Perfection he did not make a single mistake he did not make a single inaccuracy let's jump in hikara started the game with the move E4 Savion responded E5 now already I would just like to say something at this level of Chess 2700 if you are playing a knockout format or you are playing any sort of event where a must-win situation with black does not exist there's like a 70 chance they're gonna play E5 because it's keeping symmetry is considered meta Hikaru plays Knight F3 Knight C6 and he plays the relopez aka the Spanish there is a lot of territory that they can Trek over to now Savion might play a Berlin or he will play the main line or he will play a sideline he plays A6 this is called morphy's defense but that's only information that you have to know if you want to win your local trivia night if for some reason there is a chess question now Bishop back to A4 Knight F6 and now Hikaru takes the first step the first Gander off the beaten path and rather than playing the mainline castles which could lead to an open Spanish with the move Knight takes E4 uh and then black might play uh sorry white might play D4 and then black likes to play B5 D5 this is something that I think Savion has played quite a bit of uh rather than entering into any of that or any of the other clotheslines Hikaru plays D3 now this is already a pretty big committal decision because normally in the Spanish white wants to go C3 and then play D4 in one go uh White will play C3 H3 and then D4 so the move D3 it's I mean it's not like again this is how you know how how nerdy chess players are if you move a pawn one square in instead of two squares chess players all go [Music] right and then that's essentially what chess is like at the metal level and now Sam has a decision to make he can play B5 kicking the bishop back and then developing more naturally with the bishop to C5 or he can block in his Bishop with the move D6 and he chooses that so Hikaru has chosen the second most popular option Savion has chosen the most part the second most popular option and now the players are still in a territory where there are thousands of games but Hikaru officially takes us into very very uh unfamiliar Waters and he plays a move that generally never happens in the Spanish I think the players of the past would have vomited and peed themselves if this move at the same time by the way uh if this move had been played Hikaru plays the move C4 this is uh again like this is when 2750 ELO chess might resemble 750 ELO chess what the entire meta of the Spanish as I thought we knew it was to play C3 and then D4 right and then bring the bishop back so now we're letting a guy go D3 fine but you're still gonna go here and then do this right or maybe you're gonna play here C4 well let me explain it to you okay so it's a very rare move uh and the idea is as follows number one B5 is never a thing now so this bishop will keep pressuring the Knight which therefore destabilizes the center what is the drawback of this move d4 is weak okay so you are now like if you can still play D4 at some point in the future probably your opening is a success you clamp down on some of these squares but you severely potentially weaken the D4 Square uh but overall I mean it's just a decision I mean it's just a very unique way to play now uh Magnus has played the move C4 a lot of Grandmasters have played the move C4 but it's not the most popular option and uh black normally will play G6 this is considered the main way to play here white might play H3 preventing black from developing the bishop uh Bishop G7 Knight C3 Black Knight Castle White might play Knight D5 trying to take advantage of that square that is essentially what happens here the move the move G6 uh the main line I believe is even putting the Knight directly in the center this has been played the most amount of times black will go here Etc Sam now plays so what have we got we got the second most popular move in that position we got the second most popular move in that position we have the third most popular move in that position we have the third most popular move in that position so we're deep in the woods now right um now here's a fun fact about this position and I have no idea if this was what Hikaru was inspired by a person by the name of Nicholas husenbeth played this way with white in 2017. husenbath was on hikaru's team when kikaru played the candidates tournament the most important Tournament of his uh recent adult life in 2022 so a grand master who's on the team of Hikaru helping him prepare has played this opening in the past could Hikaru have been inspired by Nicholas's annotations and his files maybe and that's the beautiful thing about Chess it's not like basketball you don't have all the players on the of the team on the court at the same time it's not like who shouldn't Beth is sitting right here like yo play that move it's that it's it's all the analysis you do it's all the prep work that you do before you go sit down these guys know so much about Chess these guys know more about Chaz than if I live three lifetimes I might not learn as much as they've already forgotten or not even used uh so the move Bishop G4 is extremely committal and it's committal because White's gonna go here and black really shouldn't go back you know why because at some point white will do something like this and Black's Bishop is actually just dead like it will never participate in the game because White Center is so solid and black doesn't have the mechanics in place to make this move happen so you have to take now what has happened in that trade okay Bishop for Knight exchange occurs that D4 square is now completely weak if black could get a knight there black would be super super happy however black cannot get a knight there because black is pinned so rather than developing Castle Black Goes Knight D7 blocking this and setting up the move Knight D4 now kikaru plays Bishop E3 you will notice Hikaru has not spent any time that is because he is still in his preparation Bishop E7 played Hikaru plays Knight C3 notice Sam is down 15 minutes he this is not his preparation and you may ask yourself why did Sam not play the move Knight to D4 I have a feeling it has to do with the transformation so something like this and this Knight is gonna be better than that Bishop it can go here maybe the queen will drop back and white will get more Center space this is all probably something Hikaru has had in his notes so Sam went here and then in this position Sam played the move Knight f8 this has occurred in one game ever the idea of Knight f8 is to go here and here that is the point now in this position uh Hikaru plays Knight E2 you will notice Hikaru spent eight minutes on that move which is either a really genius Bluff pretending like he's on his own or he actually had to think about the position a 92 simply fights back against the move Knight D4 but you know what else it does it enables the move d4 I said a while ago that if white is able to pull off the move d4 it's going to be the greatest heist in history because he gets to play two light squared pawn moves create a gaping hole on D4 and still get rid of it and he's able to get rid of it because of the mechanics of the position again if if you waited even one move castle castle and then you didn't take the Knight you went like here oh black is chilling Bing chilling by the way like he is 94 and life is good okay she's Knight D4 he's vibing so D4 take take take take black castles and now you would think Bishop pair is good right don't trade the bishop for a night unless you have a good reason the good reason is that if you go here the Knight will now move and that Bishop has nothing so he takes now we have this Queen Rooks Bishop seven Pawns who is better and why white is better why white has a better Pawn structure and a little bit more space and active pieces and that's it that is all you need at this level that's why it's 0.6.7 Advantage white has a bit more space a bit more activity and long-term targets white structure is just Bulletproof now this move is the only move of the game where stockfish kind of kind of complaint it was a microscope and I think if you let it run to like depth 35 it's gonna think that both these moves were good Hikaru in this position rather than castling short and allowing black to play C5 that's the key move if black can play C5 and not uh allow white spawns ever to go forward he's going to equalize so Hikaru needs to stop C5 he has two ways of doing that he can put a rook on D1 so that C5 can be met with Bishop takes and he can also Castle along to a human canceling long is not the most natural of moves the computer thinks it's microscopically better than playing Rook D1 Hikaru kept his options open and Castle short side I already only spent three minutes on this move because long castles is just a bit ridiculous now the move C5 is not possible because Bishop takes and if the queen tries to sidestep it I mean queen G3 I might mate you I might force you to do this which is the bishop just looks like a lava lamp on E7 I mean it's not doing anything uh well if it's shining but that's you know it's immobile so rookie 8 played and uh Hikaru castles and in this position Savion is going to live a very very boring life because he bought a house 25 below market value on the outskirts of town and he doesn't have a car and the closest thing in walking distance is 40 minutes uh welcome to certain corners of New York uh he can't do anything in this position like if he goes here that's not even a threat like Hikaru will play B3 rookie one and just start marching forward and at some point when he marches forward C6 will be weak so Savion in this position is forced to play this kind of ugly move Bishop F6 the point of Bishop F6 is that Sam doesn't mind damaging to his structure because probably he will be able to draw The Rook end game but Hikaru knew that he was on course to play a perfect game of chess and make it into a Gotham video and his own gonna recap it right so the second that the bishop removed the layer of Defense from C5 Hikaru went here once again the perfect move that move does not rush into exchange and I told you a long time ago white has targets D6 is a target the queen is a Target and by leaving that pawn fixated on the C6 square that is a weakness and so is all of this Savion now plays rookie six he's still defending to the best of his ability now the best movies to take how is that possible how is the best move to take and allow your queen to get hit a lot of people wouldn't do that because Queen C3 and you build behind your pawn and you build behind this and that and that and that so if black plays H6 in this position E5 smashes through rookie 6 CD CD Queen C6 and I'm in I'm in there like swimwear all right like I'm get I'm we're taking everything so rookie 6 takes Queen F6 and now Queen F6 correctly exchanging even though your queen was the one that was supposed to do the damage why did Hikaru trade because if the Rook takes its eye off the e-pawn the rest of the game is super simple Hikaru is gonna play F3 then he's gonna bring his King then he's gonna bring his Rooks and this structure is losing what this is chess at the 2770 ELO level the structure of your pawns which was determined by the opening that you had memorized indicates whether or not your chances of survival exist don't what so Savion was like well I can take with the Rooker of the Jeep on he makes it an inaccuracy takes with the Jeep on he does that so maybe he can do this and allow The Rook to get in maybe rookie five and F5 Hikaru plays F3 Sam attacks his Pawn Hikaru defends his pawn and now is ready to double up do you notice how there was a tripled Pawn possibility here yeah Rook C2 and hikaru's knocking on the door I am the one who knocks C takes D6 knocks and AKs by the way I'm the one who knocks oh that's genius I'm stealing that CD Rook C6 as well as Pawn to B3 savion's got no Pawn Mobility he just can't move anything so he does this ladies and gentlemen may I present to you the ugliest Pawn structure of all time I am not one to judge I don't care how humans look okay I'm not I'm not the handsomest guy myself I do care how a pawn structure looks and I 100 will judge you okay like those gossip magazines we have tripled isolated pawns two loners and doubled ice what even is that what even is that what and the rest of the game all I will say is in the rest of this game Hikaru imitates Pac-Man Rook D7 takes the pawn Sam tries to create counter play Hikaru brings his King everything is defended counter play is literally impossible as Sam's Rooks have to stand there and just guard everything Hikaru brings the king Sam brings the king Hikaru plays Rook A7 Sam gives a check Hikaru walks out to F4 Sam defends everything what's gonna happen is hikaru's not gonna rush to take anything he is going to take away all of Sam's resources in the position and then he will make his move he's going to take maximum value away from Sam who is completely unable to defend himself Rook A8 cuts the back rank Sam plays H6 another Pawn bites the dust and now what is the Domino that is going to start the entire collapse of the black position there it is Black's position is hopeless he cannot move a single Pawn he tries he goes here A5 Now The Rook has to make a decision which way it goes Its sidesteps Rook B8 and that I mean you you are you are just out of time to quote the weekend King H7 now the king comes back King comes back G4 taking away the last pawn move Rook C6 and Rook to D2 ladies and gentlemen the game is over because black has no moves Rook goes back Rook B6 takes away the space and he currently just takes the Rook it does not matter that the pawns are now connected because my king will block them I take A6 I go for your other Pawns I push my Pawn A7 Rook A3 Rook B7 you create a little bit of counter play and in this position Savion resigned he resigned because he can't make a damn move if Sam Savion plays D3 Hikaru will play E6 he can also just show you how ridiculous this position is black cannot take his eyes off this Pawn he cannot push the pawn he can also not push the king he can't go to the back rank because Rook CA check he can't move that way because I take the pawn and he can't go F6 because I take the king Grand Master Hikaru Nakamura played a perfect game of chess the only mistake that Sam made in this game might have been playing the move Bishop G4 like Sam's opening was complete completely fine maybe the entire setup of Bishop G4 just does not work that well which is crazy maybe Sam's inaccuracy was Knight f8 in this position black has played castles in the past Knight D4 in the past Sam literally made a move in the opening that had been played before and Hikaru blew him off the board an absolute positional masterclass negating every single one of Black's pieces and essentially taking their soul well done I what more can you say this was not an animal viciously tackling another one to the ground in the middle of the Savannah this was a snake wrapping itself slowly around its opponent preventing it from getting any Oxygen this was unbelievable unbelievable game a deserving win and isn't it just incredible the levels of Chess that exist out there like you're out there in the dumps beating up the folks of your own ELO I'm out here playing stupid gambits and crazy aggressive lines against 2700s and Blitz Hikaru sits down for a 2700 feet a rated game 90-minute game and it it it it it just looked so simple incredible stuff get out of here
