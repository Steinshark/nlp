you've done this to me a bunch of times now on camera so now it's your turn at the end of the day I want you to do the intro all right hey I'm markovansky CEO from the Masters my background is building uis I've built like over a hundred large user interfaces in my Consulting career and I think the most famous project that I created was the jQuery UI day picker and so I've been in the game a long time built a lot in vanilla JavaScript built a lot in with you know every framework probably on the the back end and the front end so got a lot of experience building software and I I love coding to this day and it's so what you're trying to say is that you are a front-end Master you could say that yeah I'm gonna be in that hot seat again here soon mark yeah right there I know I I don't know how I feel about it but I'm gonna be there soon yeah teaching uh blazingly fast JavaScript is that even possible well bun has definitely changed the landscape a lot I just try I literally tried dropping in an application the application I'm going to be using on front end Masters I dropped it in just to see and it's legitimately the same as like four or five perf improvements their integration with set timeout and Promises is so good that it actually makes promises usable again the thing is if you have a really hot path and Promises like if you have a series of awaits it destroys your performance it's shocking how bad it can actually be absolutely which I did yeah and then you're teaching uh htmx after that right we're doing a little hdmax a little short htmx course um I'm trying to still figure out what application can I do that makes sense in like a three to four hour kind of window you know because you can it's not like you can do a whole bunch especially you know you're doing a little bit of go laying trying to keep that simple plus a little bit of that you know there's just a lot of things you have to do to build any one thing yeah and I don't know much about htmax maybe you can enlighten me but as far as I know it's kind of a DSL like for in HTML for Network requests right so and then it also has like some interactivity stuff with CSS but in general you know it's it's more the server that's handling everything right in that case that's pretty fair that's a fair take that's a fair take uh effectively it just has a couple data attributes or attributes on HTML to turn them into points of change in your application and so it can say where to get the change how to swap in the change how to reduce the change if needed and then any version or any interactivity you want you can just you can just do that in JavaScript right so you just have your JavaScript like so you can build web components and then your web components can emit events and htmx can create server requests based on custom events it can create them based on right right so well I guess that is it's a DSL for essentially like interacting with the server with data attributes or custom attributes yeah that's fair which like our our video player for instance our promo player we have data attributes on our promo player or our video player can be embedded in a lot of different ways and we'll have data attributes that'll Define like hey here are the end points yeah kind of thing and so we can just kind of pop in a new video and put it in a different context it can we can edit annotations we can you know obviously have the video player like the courses player the promo player all this kind of thing and um the thing with that though when you're marking things up with a declarative you know I look at like Tailwind as something similar for CSS right it's like a set of utilities declarative apis for you know styling your page in this case it's declarative attributes for interacting with the server but then like what are the Escape hatches you know that's always like the Crux of this stuff like how much can you do with this data attribute building the situation and then like what are the Escape patches because you know any DSL like the good ones might handle like 80 of your use case but then that other 20 or whatever like I think in hdmax it's like the on attribute or something like that you can actually do even more than that this right here here's an article where someone made htmx for all their outer app and everything they thought was complicated they put into react so it's like it's just that nice and so react ends up creating a bunch of children and ends up emitting custom events and then the custom event is listened to Via both htmx and react depending on how they wanted to do how they wanted to you know go do something right so it's a HTML DSL for interacting with the server so the the server interaction piece now you're offloading the hdmax and then the client piece you're using react or whatever exactly exactly so it doesn't it doesn't eliminate the need for like any sort of UI framework if you're going to do anything really complex I don't think a UI framework even makes sense this that's my personal take is that it never actually did make sense to begin with uh in the sense that you can break down everything you at least this is personal opinion here you can prove me wrong um which is that you can break down pretty much everything you do into a series of server actions and showing it to the client any of the transitions the highlighting the the doing things almost all of that could either be server driven or just some small bit of you know JavaScript to make it interactive right you want something that pops up as a model well the reality is Modells are 50 of the reason why front-end sucks because you've created a state in your application that's virtually impossible to recreate with a URL and so now you're just like okay what have I done is this actually a good idea and what my example of that is that when you hit the Tweet button while navigating your home page you cannot recreate that state Again by Just Simply Having twitter.com right because there's an offset into some dynamically generated list that's below your model and all that kind of stuff and so htmx just says if you want to do those things you kind of got to just go off and just write your JavaScript for it if you don't everything else just works right so there's like they're Spinners that's what I'm talking about like 80 of your app you can is interacting with the server it can be handled by hdmax and then like if you have something very specific that's really client-side heavy you're gonna need something right and in our case we don't use a framework so we're we're obviously you're literally the perfect candidate yeah there's no there's no framework at all on front of masters.com or the new search thing that we're maybe going to talk about today that's all custom built the player the video player the courses player it uses a video JS under the hood for some of the but we can we might rip that out because at this point like even video is pretty cross browser we only had that in for like cross browser stuff so but yeah everything is custom the only thing that we implemented um we're talking about like DSL htmx being a DSL for server communication but um I think for HTML itself if you want to render Dynamic HTML um we use lit HTML so we for like our data grid component and our search uh we use lit HTML because you can just basically create template strings and throw it at the uh the page and render it and it's it's super fast there's no jsx there's no like X extra data structures being created it's just like the perfect I don't know yeah so if you need to render on the client like that's the only thing that we do so here's an example of htmx this is a purely client-side interactivity point I'm doing right here it's Conway's Game of Life there you go we're playing Conway's Game of Life I can pause it and then I can actually just save that when installed into a database so that is htmx this is just the you know so you can separate out the two right they're pretty easy to make into two different items so it's pretty cool I feel like this is as good of an example of client-side interactivity you can theoretically make yeah and so you wrote The Game of Life and just pure JavaScript right yeah I just wrote in JavaScript attached to the page this is before I try to I think a web component could be pretty fun to make this happen I don't know I'm kind of in between on how exactly you want to do it but it's interesting yeah just simple JavaScript to generate everything yeah web components are like good to have like a declarative like I said we're talking about uh hdmax being like declarative attributes to talk with the server like obviously the component model is cool to like uh encapsulate code and be able to yeah have an API of different attributes to you know have it behave in different ways but the only down behind every htmx I would really say is that when you're first using it you have such a react brain that I think it's really hard like I think you honestly would have no problem you'd use it and go okay this makes sense this is how I do it okay yeah yeah and you just literally fly through it because you don't use a framework at front end Masters at all so therefore you're just fine whereas you know if all you've ever done is react htmx is like a really big jump and it feels Arcane and it feels wrong and it feels Incorrect and it feels all these things just because you're just simply not used to it yeah I mean you're not used to the fact that the server has all the control right where you're the server is running all the HTML and hdmax right so like if you transition to something else the server is kind of the source of Truth Versus like worrying about client-side rendering and that kind of thing yeah or you want to give us a quick uh like three minute on this little exploration sale yeah sure uh yeah we're doing a hundred dollars off yearly memberships so that's obviously cool um and we launched uh the search feature so if you go to I mean it's better if you're logged in but if you're if you go to front of masters.com and you hit the search icon or whatever uh we built this you know super fast search that searches everything across the platform and uh the team built it in go uh with um AWS open search and then again the the client is is vanilla JavaScript with and someone was talking about lit uh lit element and we don't use lit element we only use the lit HTML package which is the renderer it's it's like three kilobytes that's that's like the only dependency that we have on on the search and the entire search this interface the ability to you can click into like see where it says matches 21 or whatever yeah you can click in there and you can see exactly where oh camel is mentioned in each video and you can click into that very specific part of the transcript so that's super cool so you can actually go straight to that oh I'm not logged in but you could go straight to that point within the video yeah within the video and so and this search is embedded everywhere on the site as well as inside the video player so if you want to search a course or you want to search across the whole platform and again it's like a thousand lines of client-side JavaScript like that's it and this three kilobyte lit HTML package and then it's built on you know go in the AWS open search so it's just like look at that super super fast and lightweight that's me talking about lrus I remember saying this there you go that's actually super cool yeah go by the way yeah so yeah the whole site yeah people constantly ask like how is the site so fast like we get tons of comments on Twitter and Linkedin and all over the place like and so that's it it's uh as little JavaScript as possible and rendering as much keep it all in the go land and keep it fast and and go to like we we keep to the standard libraries as much as possible so it's it's that same philosophy like our CTO kind of has the the same philosophy uh on the back end is is I do on the front end and and you know our entire engineering team obviously yep all right so what I I got an important question I get this constantly yeah everyone even just today they said I can't buy a subscription to a place called front end Masters it's just front end yeah I mean we started there right so I spoke at like 60 different conferences and met everybody in front end and like taught workshops we're talking about 12 years ago yeah you wrote jQuery date picker right yeah anyone that's from that era knows date picker and it is clearly the greatest plug-in of all time well it solved 100 of everybody's use cases at the time right so it's like it had every option in the world we're talking about like declarative you know markup like in this case it was like you know a Json object that you could just throw up you know there's like 50 60 options and they all work together and they handle every single possible use case and so obviously the code itself was like ended up being bloated and we kind of split it apart and all that kind of stuff but that's that's 15 years ago you know 16 years ago something like that when I think it was like 2000 six or 2007 when I wrote it in vanilla JavaScript and then jQuery came out and I was like this is amazing like because I wrote all these components and back when you had to smooth things over with all the crazy yeah there's no Sizzle backs and all that kind of stuff yeah yeah if you don't know what Sizzle is it just shows that you just don't know the Pains of growing up there was no Sizzle at one point you had to make everything work yourself absolutely Dustin Diaz's post like top 10 JavaScript functions from like 2005 was like my Bible it was like amazing anyways so this is like way way back in the day but yeah Jake were you I did picker and all this other stuff uh you know interacting with uh you know components and all that kind of stuff so that's my background uh teaching on on JavaScript uh back then and so yeah that's where front end Masters came from right it was was it was all about front end and over the years over the last 10 years obviously our audience has grown people have become leaders and organizations it was just wild and like you know they're asking for fundamentals and taking our approach to you know the server and devops and all those other places so yeah we have all that content we have rust we have Docker and containers and we have all this other stuff but it's like man we spent a lot of money to try to Rebrand and the people are asking like millions of dollars for these domains you know and you got to get the social accounts to go with them and all this kind of stuff it's you got millions and then more millions and then more Millions absolutely so so without Towers it's an identity crisis but it is an identity crisis without telling any of the names you were going to choose estimate how much it would have cost you to be able to switch to a name that's more generic if you will oh well the one that we loved it was uh well over 2 million and that's just for the site right so the domain yeah basically he said we'll start at seven figures and I was like start at seven figures are you kidding for this domain so yikes so it's like okay if you search on front of Masters or search front of Masters across Twitter across LinkedIn across whatever Google whatever like we've got a well-loved brand right like people people love the quality of these courses and so it's like to switch is a big thing it's it's a lot of time and effort from the entire depth team and yeah obviously a lot of money if you want a good domain and a good brand like and people are just asking exorbitant amounts for these domains these days insane so yeah yeah I assume backend Masters was too expensive as well uh back-end Masters does not sound like a training website for coding it doesn't have that ring of educational Pursuit does it it does not uh yeah I mean we even looked at we bought Dev so we have devmasters.com that's a great one but like there's a company in Irving California that has like a training platform or training like in-person thing and they I think they do some online things called Dev Masters so it's like if we rebranded there then we're gonna get sued it's just like yeah what do you do man what do you do when you have a loved brand and people don't care it seems like people don't care except for when they first hear about it you know they first hear about like oh there's a go course or whatever like you know initially but in general like our customers are watching the heck out of all that content go rust Docker whatever they're learning it on there so so how come you don't have uh any little blips here to help people understand that right Advance your skills typescript go rust docker yeah I think we were uh we changed the title on like our our Twitter and all that other stuff to like front end to full stack and even when you click join but where does customer acquisition come from now um big red yeah mostly that's where it comes from big red button most yeah mostly word of mouth I'd say it's like at this point 40 percent word of mouth and I think it's like 30 percent you know Google and people searching Us in various platforms and that kind of thing and then like 10 social media and the paid like we do just a couple paid sponsors and obviously we we donate more to open source than we spend on you know sponsors that's good I think that's a good move um because open source there's there's only an article every 15 minutes describing and lamenting this current situation of Open Source so that's probably a good move to keep doing that all right I got I got a good question for you as a front-end master what do you think is the most important thing you should consider when creating a front end that's a heavy question um I think when you're choosing your tools like like we were talking about hdmax right like what are the what are the needs of my app and as it grows like how do I extend this like what is my plan to extend it what is my plan to customize it like you can start as high level as bootstrap as you want and like in certain circumstances and you can get a UI going and it just works right or or Tailwind is like one set lower like Shad CDN or whatever that uh whatever it is it's like a UI component Library there's all these layers of abstraction right and whether using react and you're creating your own uh your own components and you're thinking about your apis and that kind of thing it's like what level of abstraction are you gonna go and then as the needs of your app change like how are you going to extend things right how are you going to handle that 10 of use cases uh that are difficult in your app like and really think about those I think that's that's where like the hardest part of I think front end you know so in our case we chose zero abstraction we just want to build right on language patterns because guess what the code I wrote and uh you know two thousand 2014 or 2017 or whatever like I still look at that and I'm like that's great like we can use some new new features or whatever from the language and uh it just lives forever right and so that's the the uh level of abstraction we didn't need the quick wins that you get from Frameworks in the early stage we'd rather like think about the problem ahead of time and just use language patterns and principles uh to address things and then that code will live forever and it's easily extensible and now it's like we dropped in the search this search works with the courses player and so now we have two custom systems that work together we don't look at the code and be like oh yuck it's like no that code is really fast in performance so we chose you know zero abstraction but you can go one layer deeper and you can go with you know htmx or then you can go a layer further and go with you know something like svelte or whatever and then uh obviously if you need something from this giant react ecosystem or your company uses it or whatever like you need to be awesome at that and and understand you know when it makes sense to use various patterns and how you're going to escape um when you know the component API doesn't match what you need now how do you escape out of that and how do you create something custom to fulfill the the difficult use cases in their app and so I think that that's what you have to really consider when it comes to a front end and choosing you know understanding what layer of uh abstraction you're willing to deal with and then understanding when things get hard like where are the Escape hatches and how can you make those like difficult use cases uh work yeah you know we have a lot of those at Netflix um you know because what people don't realize is that apps live on until the company dies effectively and you rarely get to rewrite very few companies get the chance to just full rewrite and so I mean I'm still considering edge cases when I have to do some underlying you know performance Feature work whatever for uh using unsafe component uh components will Mount component will receive properties right we still have a bunch of class-based components and sometimes that's the only thing that makes sense and even though it's not supported in current version of react we have to make things supported we have to make things work out even at that like very far layer and so it just goes to show that it's not as simple as people you know make it and that the needs of your application or the requirements of the framework can change underneath you and now you have to deal with the complexity of that and so I I get why you'd want to you know I get why the no framework choice can probably in the long run be the best choice but I think it's very hard and it's just not a um it's not really part of the Zeitgeist at all to think of things from first principles but more to think of them from you know starting way out and like okay the default choices reacts just because it's the most popular I'll start there and then as the problems come up you have to find exceptionally clever Solutions around making these two things communicate like communicating from the search bar to a video player is non-trivial in react there's quite a few layers of abstraction you're gonna have to hop through to be able to make these things you know run whether you're doing you know some there's a lot there's a lot of things context would probably be your friend there but nonetheless you still have to do a bunch of kind of weird tree visualizations to make all that stuff work which is just much harder yeah I mean that that course as player is completely customizable you can open and close drawers you can you know now you can search and click through you can take notes you can do all this stuff right and it's it's like uh because all that's built you know custom like it's like it's easy to to see underneath like every line that makes that happen yeah right and so there's no like oh why did this thing like render a bunch of times and like we're in an infinite Loop or why are we out of memory or whatever you know why why is uh Chrome eating the memory on my computer or whatever uh because there's no like double upping what you know all these libraries talking to each other in jsx and you know hopping between Frameworks and all that kind of stuff it's just like hey look this is where it happens here's the exact lines and so yeah people I think the yeah like you said it's not part of the Zeitgeist because it's it's not you know it's just like that's not how we do things like it's too hard right or whatever but I think uh in the long run it's paid off a ton for us well hey thank you very much Mark have a have a beautiful day you too bye
