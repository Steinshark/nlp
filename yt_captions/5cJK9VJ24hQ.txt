a quick thanks for this video's sponsor my 
favourite VPN it's Private Internet Access more   at the end of the video Great Britain is divided 
into 91 ceremonial County 60 of which touch the   ocean that's pretty good 60 of them Seaside access 
if you're in any of the others so for example the   next 27 in you have to go through at least one of 
those 60 to get to the Sea so if I want to take my   dog to the ocean because I live in Surrey I have 
to go through West Sussex or Hampshire or east   Sussex or Kent those are my options but I need to 
travel through at least one other County before I   hit the ocean the number fans amongst you may have 
noticed that 60 plus 27 is not 91 there are four   missing and those four counties are more than just 
standard landlocked they are doubly landlocked   however before we look at that I need to point 
out that the counties I'm using are the ceremonial   counties there are there's a ridiculous number 
of ways you can provide Great Britain up into   counties as Jay Foreman explained nicely in one of 
his map Man videos England today has nine regions   comprising 47 ceremonial counties alongside six 
Metropolitan counties comprising 36 Metropolitan   districts 26 Nom Metropolitan counties comprising 
192 non-metropolitan districts and 56 unitary   authorities not including greater London which is 
a ceremonial County and not a county comprising   32 boroughs in the city of London which is a 
district under County and not a ceremonial County   and we haven't even talked about Scotland Wales 
or Northern Ireland where it's different absolute   state of this you can watch Jay's video for all of 
the details the point here is I'm using diagrams   based on the lieutenancy areas and I've done that 
because they're consistent across Scotland and   Wales which otherwise have different definitions 
of counties this was the most straightforward   way to do it and it means we get to include the 
adorable little Rutland look at it it's tiny it's   embarrassingly small and if you're using any other 
kind of County it get absorbed into leicestershire   we can now take our map of the ceremonial counties 
we we can reduce each one down to a single point   and show the linking between it and all the other 
counties it contacts you've now got the blue ones   those are the 60 ones that touch the ocean one 
step in the yellow ones they touch a county   that touches the ocean and then you have the four 
doubly landlocked counties they have to touch two   more so I actually use the notation n landlocked 
where n is the minimum number of other regions   you have to travel through to get to the ocean so 
we've got full red that are too landlocked we've   got the 27 yellow which are one landlocked and 
of course the 60 blue which has zero landlocked   no land locking at all the four two landlocked 
counties are bedfordshire buckinghamshire West   Midlands not the rest of the Midlands and the city 
of London crazy city of London entirely inside   greater London which is itself landlocked someone 
should make a whole video about the city of London   anyway those are the four doubly landlocked 
counties and actually I probably I should have   gone to one of them and filmed this video there 
there what are you gonna do look I can't just up   and go to arbitrary locations on the whim because 
the video needs it however back in 2019 when I was   on tour I went very close to a significant point 
when it comes to UK County boundaries because you   may have seen on the map that northamptonshire 
looks like it should be doubly landlocked but   it isn't and that's because if we go back to the 
networked version you can see it's connected to   what is actually Lincolnshire you think it doesn't 
touch Lincolnshire that's it does it touches it   with the UK's shortest administrative boundary 
uh everything is wet okay there's the path   wow we just walked out along this foot path which 
carries on under the A1 over there but where we're   aiming for is in the far corner there we've 
made it just over there on the far side of this   stream we're in the motorway and a train 
line this little bit of disused unloved   land with litter and garbage on it that is 
the shortest administrative Border in the UK   site to see and behold absolutely worth it that 
tiny 11 meter stretch on the far side of a ditch   on the edge of a muddy field is the only reason 
northamptonshire doesn't get to join the exclusive   Club of two landlocked counties and they must 
be pretty annoyed because in any sensible World   Cambridge here should contact well on my map it's 
Rutland let's be honest it's leicestershire but   they don't it's not even like it's a passable 
boundary if you're in northamptonshire you can't   get into Lincolnshire and then to the ocean but 
technically as far as the map is concerned the   ocean is a mere Lincolnshire away if we were to 
cut that ridiculous link on our Network you can   see that Northampton share it kind of pings back 
and gets its rightful position as a two landlocked   County but sadly no deal but enough about counties 
nobody cares about counties people don't even care   about where they are we're going to do countries 
it's the word Google thinks you're trying to type   anyway and there are a lot more countries than 
there are counties here we've got a map of over   200 countries and miscellaneous country-like 
regions and you can see that 37 of them you   can count them if you want are one landlocked 
and two of them are too landlocked just two   countries that's Uzbekistan and Liechtenstein 
now Uzbekistan is a bit difficult to get to on   a whim but Liechtenstein that's a lot easier to 
get to hey you folks want to go to Liechtenstein   I'm in Liechtenstein in fact I've 
been here the whole lichten time   good joke good joke love it okay let me 
just check in the script here uh Lipton   time joke oh and now it says video montage 
of Matt enjoying Lichtenstein let's do it Switzerland Liechtenstein Switzerland 
back in Liechtenstein foreign foreign Liechtenstein is a tiny country with a population 
of millions 0.04 million so it's 40 000 people if   you're in America and you're familiar with 
Tampa Florida Tampa has the same population   as 10 times Liechtenstein for British people it's 
the same population here as the county of Rutland   and about half the area you see Liechtenstein is 
small in terms of area as well as population the   whole area it's 160 square kilometers it's less 
than Washington DC if you were to measure from the   very top in the North to the very bottom in the 
South which is the long direction for the record   it's only 25 kilometers you can walk that in a day 
it's like 15 miles it's bordering on embarrassing   in 2006 they re-measured the border of the country 
and they accidentally found an extra half a square   kilometer of area which for most countries would 
just be a rounding error for Liechtenstein an   extra 0.3 country just lying around and this 
whole tiny little country is wedged between   there's Austria over in that direction towards 
the West whenever in the East behind me those   mountains that's Switzerland and both those 
countries are one landlocked level countries   which makes Liechtenstein here a record making two 
landlocked doesn't really matter if a country is a   non-zero amount of landlocked well yes not having 
access to the ocean is a big deal particularly if   you want things to come and go from a country 
Which is less of a problem for travelers these   days because visitors can just fly over the other 
countries in between although a fun fact here in   Liechtenstein this is one of only five countries 
in the world that doesn't have an airport to get   here we had to catch a bus International 
bus travel anyway ignoring moving people   around when it comes to imports and exports now 
you've got a problem if you're moving Freight you   absolutely need access to the ocean Lichtenstein 
is the world's biggest exporter of false teeth   apparently if you go online you will see this 
fact repeater they're the biggest exporter of   false teeth and the theory is that evocla had 
their headquarters here in Liechtenstein and   they produce I've seen it reported 20 percent of 
the world's dentures and that makes this country   the biggest exporter but I was like is that true 
and I tried to fact check it but I couldn't get a   reliable figure on that and then I realized I was 
Googling like I was Googling denture production   by market rate and I was like this is ridiculous 
I am so far off-piste at the moment so I don't   know for sure if anyone can check which country 
is the biggest exporter of false teeth I'd love   to know but the point is countries often make 
things more than they need and so they export   them and if they've got things that they can't 
make but they do need they import them if you   get to the ocean that's easy you can export you 
can import if you get to the ocean you can trade   with the world if you can't get to the ocean you 
can only trade with your neighbors and that's   just trade we haven't got near anything else like 
fishing and other food access and even strategic   military access to the ocean being landlocked is 
such a big deal that in the United Nations 2015   sustainable development goals in Target 10 point 
B they explicitly refer to landlocked developing   nations as requiring extra help because of the 
incredible challenges that they face this is why   you'll sometimes see a country making a bit of 
a cheeky desperate reach for the coast so for   example the Democratic Republic of the Congo has 
one tract of land that goes through Angola to be   able to get to the ocean and in 2005 Moldova did a 
admittedly quite complicated exchange with Ukraine   to be able to get 450 meters of access on the 
denube and that may not sound like much and in   fact it's a fair way up the river but that River 
does have official access that anyone can use to   get to the ocean so that counts as ocean access it 
was worth it to get that small bit of land so they   could put a port there and often if you see one of 
these small weird borders on a country or indeed a   county there's some extra reason like this some 
kind of access which just cause that to happen   although we're still not sure if this 
was the motivation for northampton's year   this is ridiculous this is this is Peak stand-up 
maths if you will so we're going to leave the   geography aside for a second and actually 
talk about some mathematics specifically   these amazing diagrams I love these so much my 
friend Christian lawsonperfect made these and   they take a geographic Arrangement and then 
they convert it into pure pure mathematical   information it doesn't matter where the 
individual counties or countries are we   just put a node for each country and then the 
edges show how they all link together and a   standard issue human would call this a network 
mathematicians call it a graph for really annoying   reasons it just makes it hard to Google but 
the point is it's able to take something like   any situation where you've got things that 
relate to each other and by turning them into   nodes and edges you can rearrange it to better 
understand the information I love them so much in our case graph particularly useful because 
on the map it's often hard to see the very small   linking bits like the one between Lincolnshire 
and northamptonshire on a graph because all edges   are equal and you can move things around and you 
can see where the links are you're not going to   miss detail like that so it's a super useful thing 
to see how everything links together and there's   some things you might have missed looking at a 
more accurate map graphs are so amazing there's   a whole area of math called graph Theory this 
is where we develop techniques and approaches   to analyze graphs and there are so many of these 
great techniques that graphs have been used to do   everything from looking at how computer networks 
work and how robust they are through to analyzing   higher dimensional shapes it's an incredible area 
of mathematics and actually a while ago I had my   five five letter words with 25 distinct letters 
projects and some of you may remember one of the   first big steps in viewers improving my code was 
applying graph Theory to the problem so they made   a graph where each node was a the Father the word 
and the edges linking them were words that had no   letters in common and then they could use graph 
Theory techniques to find Solutions and they were   able to do that I think from memory slightly more 
efficiently than my code I forget all the details   but the point is graph theory is amazing it's 
incredibly powerful and I love it we have one   outstanding map we're going to turn our graph3 to 
and it's the United States of the United States of   America and for the record I did double check if 
you include the subdivisions of Mexico and Canada   doesn't change any of this those are two very 
very watery countries but if we just take the   states the contiguous continental United States 
and we split them apart you can see quite a few   one landlocked we've got 16 of them we've got ten 
two landlocked that's 10 states on a Liechtenstein   level and finally there's one more a new color 
cyan what is that that is a three landlocked   state as far as I'm aware the only three 
landlocked or higher region in the world there   may be others if you find one let me know in the 
comments below but as far as I'm aware it's only   if we wind it back Nebraska here's the list 
of things I know about Nebraska it is the   birthplace of comedian Amber Ruffin it's the only 
Tripoli landlocked region in the world I'm aware   of end of list that's it I don't know a lot about 
Nebraska but it is somewhere in the middle of the   difficult to get to on a whim spectrum between 
Uzbekistan and Liechtenstein and I was actually   there late last year a couple months ago I was 
in Nebraska so actually there is another thing   on the list that I know about Nebraska but that 
would be a spoiler that'll come out in a video   in the future the problem was when I was there I 
did not realize I was in the only three landlocked   region in the world now I'm kicking myself and 
the video we filmed there was entirely inside of   film studio we did not film a single thing outside 
in Nebraska we scoured all the footage we took we   checked everyone's phone who was there and the 
only footage we have out and about in Nebraska   was seven seconds that my camera person Alex 
took on their phone so I was driving the car   to our film shoot Alex saw what they thought was 
some turkeys and took this cinematic Masterpiece no those aren't picking there's a turkeys that's 
incredible so there you are the only triply   landlocked turkeys you'll ever see and the only 
official stand-up Mass footage of the only Tripoli   landlocked region in the world I believe if you 
find another one put it in the comments below   oh when we filmed that right it was it 
was like in October right before both   Thanksgiving and Christmas so I've got some 
bad news about our Tripoli landlocked turkeys   it may not look like it but I'm currently in 
sunny Australia at least I will be in a moment   thanks to our sponsor private internet access.com 
slash stand up maths I'm just loading up the app   now live and oh that's it's classic Australian 
salt gritters okay so I am now going to choose   Australia on my app here it's going to connect 
and if you're watching this video you know how a   VPN works it's encrypting all my data sending it 
to a server in Australia decrypting it there so   as far as my phone is concerned I'm in Australia 
and because a lot of websites and search results   depend on where you are and as someone who travels 
a lot it gets real Annoying if I'm in one country   and I have to do business or admin in a different 
country but now I can switch to whichever country   I want and breaking news with a single private 
internet access account you can now install it   on infinitely many of your devices and unlock 
things like region specific videos on YouTube   if you get sick of waiting for John Oliver's most 
recent video to be available worldwide which takes   forever for some reason you just ask your device 
to be in the United States no problems if you go   to privateinternetaccess.com stand up maths you 
will get four months free you'll get 83 sent off   you're paying just over two dollars a month so do 
go to the URL on the screen and in the description   below I mean I don't I pick the URL of a different 
Creator I want to support but you should use mine   in the description so anyway I think 
it's incredible I've been using it for   ages it's super useful if you ever 
want your device to appear to be in   a completely different country now if 
you excuse me I have to go hit the surf
