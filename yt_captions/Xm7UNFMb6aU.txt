so kanye west put out his album donda finally as you know i've been watching kanye west for several years and since the album has been out many people have been asking me whether i'm going to give some kind of review of the album and people have been asking me you know why is kanye west uh working with marilyn manson and the baby why is he you know producing little nas x you know why is he doing all these things if he's supposed to be a christian what is going on you know what is the meaning of some of his actions and so i want to look a little bit at uh again at kanye west at you know let's say his faults his difficulties and also what it seems that he is trying to do and what that means within a christian context and of course in his kind of role as this as this strange fool that is kind of bridging contradictions let's say we'll try to look at that and try to make sense of it a little bit this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] and so when the donda album came out i have to admit that in listening to it my first reaction and i talked about this on the q a was that the album is all over the place that it's somehow is very disparate in terms of sound it seems very uneven even in terms of production and it seems to be scattered all around and this of course is compounded by some of the actions that he's been taking you know this thing of collaborating with someone like marilyn manson who is one of the most anti-christian characters in music let's say and people like the baby that has been very controversial recently on the other side you know making kind of uh kind of homophobic comments supposedly i don't even know what he said but he's been controversial because of that and so what is going on and of course you know getting involved with little nazix and all of this uh who has put out this kind of weird satanic inverted video why is he doing this and so i think that the first thing we need to understand about kanye west and let's say his kind of role in what he's doing is that from the very beginning of his career and from the very very beginning of his music he is a man of extremes that is that in his music making you will find the most radical of extremes you will find you know these songs about jesus like on his first album songs that are about his mother kind of in tribute to his mother which is not something that rock stars and rap stars tend to do but then you'll also find these some of the most vulgar you know kind of uh degenerate songs that have ever been made explicitly very sexually explicit you know very disturbing and and and uh and dark and so this is something which has kind of inhabited him for a very long time you know he said in in a long time ago even in his early songs he would self-identify as catholic but then also engage in these darker this dark humor and these very dark songs and so this is something we need to understand about him as a person he's someone who is extremely who kind of manifests these extremes and has kind of been living in contradiction for a very long time there's a particular song where you really see this and i remember there's a song called lost in the world where he expresses this very clearly in talking about his wife this is actually something which came out of a poem that he wrote for his own wife i don't know if they were married at the time but then he wrote for kim kardashian and i remember hearing interviews about from kanye talking about how this is there this these lyrics are very important to him these bars and so let me just read you this part where he talks about about kim kardashian and he says you're my devil you're my angel you're my heaven you're my hell you're my now you're my forever you're my freedom you're my jail you're my lies you're my truth you're my war you're my truce you're my questions you're my proof you're my stress and you're my masseuse and so of course what he's doing is of course inhabiting these opposites and showing how his experience of this woman is manifesting it's manifesting itself to him in these extremes let's say and he does the same even in this new album in donda uh there is a uh there's a verse from the from the video from the song come to life where he says i get mad when she's gone mad when she's home mad when she's gone mad when she's home sad when she's gone and so this idea that he experiences the world that's contradiction he experiences his relationship with with his wife as contradiction now this is something that we all experience of course we all have this experience of contradiction within ourselves you know to a certain level but in his let's say that in his case this seems to be something which embodies him to the extreme and which is part of a little bit of his own madness and a little bit of his genius as well is to be able to really perceive these kind of extreme contradictions in the world now my impression or let's say my impression of what he's trying to do with donda now that i think about it and now that i kind of understand i've been thinking about these contradictions that he's what he seems to be trying to do in this album is trying to pull everything together that is take all the extremes of his own music making and pull them into one place and so a lot of people have been saying that donda is something like a like a mix between uh you know his last album jesus king and jesus which was this extremely harsh album with very harsh beats and extremely kind of uh just this just this really extreme hardness about it and so on donna you get these songs that have these heartbeats and then other songs which have the using these this kind of spiritual choir with the organ and this more kind of uplifting spirit spiritual uh sense of them but you also have on this album something which reminds us of the older albums of kanye which has this kind of soulful uh more soulful singy song to them you know like this this more dance aspect to it as well and so it seems that he's really trying to kind of bring it all together into one place and um in that song come to life if you've seen the uh the video of it you really do get this imagery in the video itself where you know in the chicago event where he played his album for everybody he had a version of his house in the middle of the stadium and then at the top of the house he put an image of the cross and so he's trying to join the the notion of the church with the house which is something that i've done before and trying to explain people's symbolism that there's something about the hierarchy of a house the hierarchy of intimacy which happens in in the home uh and this this kind of movement into a sacred space that you find in in a church now in in other videos you'll we'll talk about it a bit later but out of this church house comes uh marilyn manson and the baby with with uh kanye west we'll talk about that a bit later in this in the video of come to life you see uh you see kanye west inside the house burst on fire and then you see him walk out of the house as the house is on fire and then you see an image of kim kardashian in this wedding veil kind of walking down and you find kanye west coming to him and then removing his mask like people don't some people don't know but ever since it seems like they've announced their divorce kanye west has hidden his face basically nobody's seen his face he just wears this mask uh you know all the time and so now he is here he is kind of encountering her and then removing his mask in front of his bride yeah you know i mean obviously it's all very strange because they're supposed to get a divorce but in terms of symbolism you can see can you see the extremes like you have this sense of the home church in which which is set ablaze and then he burns he burns this house down which i guess is supposed to be some kind of a baptism but in terms of extremity you can really see that on the one hand you have this kind of extreme image of this house bursting on fire with him inside and then you have the joining of him with with his wife where he removes his his mask and comes face to face with her you also see him at the very very end removing her veil and now kind of joining together and so you have this extreme of fire and in the fire he's also wearing a mask a fire of separation of just this contradiction and then coming to meet with his wife and so i think that this is like an image of what he seems to be trying to do and in the song come to life you really get the ultimate image of this which is it's a very common image but if you understand it in the way that kanye west who he is you get an you get a very powerful image of this um and so in this verse where he he said what i said i'm going to reread it but i'm going to start from the beginning where he posits these extremes so he says don't you wish the night would go numb i've been feeling low for so long ain't had a high for so long been in the dark for so long night is always darkest before the dawn so notice he's going from light to dark light to dark light to dark gotta make my mark before i'm gone i don't want to die alone i don't want to die alone and this is where he goes i get mad when she's gone man when she's home mad when she's gone man when she's home sad when she's gone then he says floating on a silver lining yeah you know where to find me riding on a silver lining and my god won't deny me tell the devil get behind me and all the stars are aligned lift me up every time you know exactly where to find me which is riding this silver lining and i think that this is really one of the most powerful images of kanye that you can find which is that he is an image of the edge he is an image of these extremes which manifests themselves on the edge with his obsession with fashion his obsession with you know with kind of popular music and also all these contradictions that i let out for you but that he is trying to transform this edge into a silver lining he's trying to show or find the light in the edge and trying to make it bright and make it shine and in this desire to kind of reconcile all the opposites i think that this is exactly what he's doing when he does things like reach out to marilyn manson of all people and include him on his album reach out to these controversial figures you know reach out to little nausea and produce his albums he's he's saying i'm gonna go to the edge you know he he seems to think he seems to want that this notion that the love of christ is going to kind of reach unto the edge and he's going to be able to ride the edge and to turn it into a silver lining now you might think that this is kind of silly and extreme but think about the very album donda think about what he did he made an album with just dozens and dozens of guests of guest features and chris brown jay-z all of these new rappers that i don't know anything about and he made a clean album he had them on his album without swearing without talking about disgusting things without going into the disgusting subjects that he that these people usually go into but he on the contrary he had them all involved in this cultural project where by joining themselves with kanye it's not him who was infected by them but it's them who were somehow brought into this kind of new identity that he is trying to give himself and so this is something if you want to kind of understand at least this is my understanding of what's going on with kanye now whether he's fully successful i'm not sure i felt like the donda album was uneven in many ways uh but nonetheless i think that this is what he is trying to accomplish and as usual we can just continue to watch him to watch uh to watch you know as he kind of continues to move in culture to see what kind of effect he's going to have and he if he's going to be able to pull all these threads together and ride that silver lining so everybody thank you for your attention and i'll talk to you very soon as you know the symbolic world is not just a bunch of videos on youtube we are
