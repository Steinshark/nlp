- We built the world's largest cereal bowl and we're gonna fill it with powdered milk and expired cereal. - Expired? - And now we're gonna pour powdered milk in our 2000 gallon cereal bowl. It smells like milk. Innovation. Now you might be wondering,
why did we make this? Well, there's a good reason. Captain Crunch, come here. - Ahoy, matey. - Mr. Trix, come here. Fred Flinstone. Come here. - Yabba daba doo. - So you know how I usually
do last to leave challenges with you guys?
- Yeah. - Well, last one of you to
leave that gets 10 grand. - Oh, okay. - Just kidding. Here's the deal, Chris. I want you to go find
someone random in public and they're gonna compete for you. - Alright.
- Same with you, Chandler. Same with you, Jake. If the person you find is the
last leave, they get 10 grand and you get five grand
if you pick the winner. - Whoa, what?
- What? - Go find someone random. I want you to go find someone random. If they win- Yeah. You got it. You got it. Go ahead.
- Okay. - And the fourth person
is me, Tony the Tiger. I'm gonna go pick someone. - Alright, so I'm goin' to recruit some random
person off the street. Hey.
- Hi. - Come here. You wanna come sit in a
pool of cereal for 10k? - 10,000? - Come on, just get in.
- Why not, let's do it. Let's do it.
- Just get in. - Alright, I've gotta go find
my person to compete for me. I don't really know who I'm gonna pick. Hey, actually, Connor. - Yeah.
- Are you busy right now? I'm grabbing Connor. - Hey. - You didn't say I couldn't. - I'm gonna go get a better person. You're goin' down, Connor. - Alright, so I'm on my
way to pick my person. I've already got in mind who I'm usin'. Hey Scotch, do you wanna win 10 grand? - Sure. - Alright. Come with me. - Hey, do you wanna be in a YouTube video? - Sure. - Oh, really?
- Nice. - So before we have random
people get in our pit of milk, I'm gonna test it. Oh my gosh. It's disgusting. What is a giant cereal
bowl without cereal? So this is now the world's
largest bowl of cereal. I think it's time we
bring out our contestants. Alright, so Chris, this
is your competitor? - His name is Connor. He's
trained hard for this. - You are now in the world's
largest bowl of cereal. Chandler, Ty is your competitor. Chandler is in charge
of taking care of you. Jake, introduced us to your contestant. - This is Scotch. - Clean entry.
- Okay. And then this is my teammate, Becca. She's gonna win. It's
gonna be an easy dub, guys. I hate to break it to all of you. So whichever one of you
leaves this cereal bowl last gets 10 grand, and your
partner gets 5 grand, they're in charge of helping you. I don't care who wins. I
don't care how long it takes. Have fun. Actually, I do care, I want her to win. I take it back. She's winning. We're gonna add just a
little bit more cereal, everyone ready? - Oh wow. - No, wait, there we go. - They signed the waiver, right? - Yes. - So we can kill each other?
- Yeah. Yeah. You guys can kill each other. - Alright. That was that. - Alright. This is mine. - So Ty, I've never won a challenge. - You're gonna win today. - We're gonna win today? - Or tomorrow. - Or tomorrow? - Or next week. - Okay. I'm gonna win through you buddy. Yes.
- Why are you touching me? - What?
- I don't wanna be touched. Oh. - You know I don't have
to give you a pep talk 'cause you know you're gonna win. - We got it. - Start deciding what to
spend your money on, buddy. - I'm only gonna say one thing. If you lose, you're walking
back to Florida. Okay. - I'm not gonna lose. - Do you need anything? - No, I'm great. - Okay. We're gonna win, alright? - I know this. I'm gonna enjoy it. Just basking in it all. - What was going through your mind when a guy in a Tony the
Tiger costume came up to you on the street and was
like, "Wanna be on camera?" - At first I was like, this is how I die. And then second, I heard your plan out and I was like, sitting in a bowl cereal,
every nine year old's dream. - And you still might die, so there's that.
- Yeah, yeah. - You weren't givin' me an option. - It's been 30 minutes. Feels like a year. - This is what we are in. - I dare you to lick it. - Absolutely not. Whoa, almost died. - So it's been one hour.
How do you feel so far? - I feel like it's probably
been a little more than that, but just sitting in
this pool of pee, sugar- - Who's in there poopin'?
- dried milk. It's a dream come true for most. - It's been one hour so
far. How do you feel? - I've peed three times. - Oh, three times? - Three times.
- That's why it turned yellow. - Yeah.
- Okay. Gotcha. - Morale is strong. Still
got a lotta willpower left. - Alright, so how do you feel right now? One hour. - I'm determined. - Determined?
- Yeah. - You have another two more hours in you? - No, I got like five. - Five?
- Six. - Six.
- Seven. - Seven. - Times two.
- He just keeps goin'. - Yeah.
- I like it. - Are you hungry? Do you want food? - Honestly, I'm just a little thirsty if you got me something to drink. - Okay, water. - Amen. Cheers to that. - Here, I got you another towel. - Oh, nice. Two towels? - Yes. Do you want another one? There you go. Now you have three more. What else do we need to do? - Let's see. Maybe granola
bars, protein bars? - I'll be right back. Alright, attention, everyone, attention. I'm gonna go buy some granola
bars. Becca's in charge. - Who? - I'll be right back. I got her her granola bar. - Thank you. Oh yeah. - There you go.
- Three kinds? - Yes. I didn't know which one you wanted. - All of 'em. - Ty, are you thirsty? - I am thirsty. - Here you go. - He's gonna have to pee soon. That's gonna be a lot of water. - I'm already peeing. - Do you need to poop? - I don't need to poop, but maybe after you get me
Chick-fil-A it'll be my pleasure. Alright, I'm goin' to
get some chicken nuggets from Chick-fil-A. He's hungry. Alright, so we just got
back to the warehouse. I got Ty's Chick-fil-A.
Let's go give it to 'im. - Did they say my pleasure? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'll share with them later. You know, when it comes
out the other side. - Hi Connor, what do you want to eat? - Can I get sushi? - What were you doing? Alright, so you want sushi? - Sushi. - Alright, I got Connor's
favorite. It's gonna help him win. Connor.
- Yes. - Do you know what a shogun is? - I hope it's sushi. - A shogun is a warrior. - Mhm.
- Is it good? - Yeah, this is gonna help. - I went out and got my guy sushi, what did you get your person? - Three granola bars. - Are you fighting? - Go. - I think we know who's gonna win. - Everyone, I cannot have
you dying on my watch so we're gonna do a
little bit of exercises. We're gonna start off with
just some little squats. The obliques, we're gonna
hit those real quick, back and forth a little bit. - Ah. Let it out guys. Ah. - There we go. Now bend
over, touch your toes. - Yep, not happening. - Just kidding. - Goin' pee again. Number four. - You're peein' right now? - Yeah. - I'm on five. - You're on five pees? Were you guys locking eyes while peeing? - We were carrying on a
conversation while peeing. - You guys don't get performance anxiety? - No. - Wait, I think six is coming. - You haven't had any liquid,
where is it coming from? - I have no idea. - Here you go, Connor. - Dude, he's not even gonna
be in the milk if you do that. - No, he's just gonna be
sitting on it in the milk. - Get outta here. I broke it. - You didn't see a second stool comin'. - Can I see it?
- Yeah, sure. - I bet you didn't see
a third stool coming. - Wait, no. They're not breaking this time. I'm gonna go to Walmart and
walk up every aisle for you and see if I could find anything
that would help you win. - Okay. - Do you think Becca wants some muffins? - Some chocolate muffins? Yeah.
- Yeah. Becca needs some bananas. I think we need a little bit more cereal. She needs a lot of towels. That should be good. - Ah, look who it is. The competition. - I'm goin' all out for her. - What'd you get? - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Alright, see you losers later. - You think she wants to
learn about Gucci Mane? - Yeah. - Alright. Well, there we go.
- Good choice. - I think she wanted some floaties. She definitely wanted a pool noodle. I think she needs a poster
of puppies for motivation. - So Connor said he wanted
an inflatable neck pillow so that way it doesn't
get all soaking wet. Alright Connor, I just spent
13 of my own dollars on you. You better win or I'm gettin' that $13
back one way or another. - 312. Becca better win. So I got bananas. - Right, potassium.
- Potassium's probably good. I got you a book in case you get bored. Blue Gatorade, also red Powerade. Here's your little floaty thing. - Thank you. Thank you. - So what do you have over there? - I have an inflatable unicorn, a whole box of Rice Krispie Treats, some Capri Suns, M&Ms,
Honey Buns, Spinwheels. - Ty, what did Chandler get you? - Chick-fil-A - What's the point of all this food if you're just gonna get out? - Hey, look at this.
- They have the food for like a month - What is that?
- and they're gonna be out in like three hours.
- Hey, you got some change? - Look at all the stuff I got Becca. And then look what Chandler got you. Are you glad Chandler picked you? Or would you have rather Chris
- I'm lying, it's Polynesian sauce.
- or me pick you? - Wait, that's so good. - You know what, I'm cool with Chandler. - So has it been an hour? - It has been an hour. - And every hour we put more cereal? - Yeah, so- - Because that cereal's soggy? - That is very soggy. - What do I like more? Oh yeah. - Hey.
- It's just cornflakes. - Don't pour it on my contestant. - She jumped into it.
- I know, but then that's when you move it.
- She jumped into it. - That's when you move it. - Can I have this box? - Sure. It's your box. - I taste it when I breathe, there's so much dust in the air. - Your teammate left you. - He left me. - I'm sorry you got Chandler. - It's okay. - And Chandler couldn't even
stay here for five seconds. - You already beat Chandler. - I beat Chandler. - I've now peed five times
in the last two hours. Currently still peeing. - Do we have any orange juice? - It depends. Becca, do you want orange juice? Oh yeah, I want big glass of orange juice. - Alright. Yes we do. Alright, so Becca said she wanted a big glass of orange juice. So I went out and I bought a big glass and I bought a bunch of orange juice. I don't know if this is enough for her. If I win this five grand
I'm gonna go homeless and then I'm gonna have to
buy another Lamborghini. Here's your orange juice. - That's a Mr. Beast orange juice. I'm gonna take it to my corner. - Vitamin D up. - Calcium in the pool? - Whoops. - I hate when that happens. - I know.
- Shatter it. - What's your least favorite cereal in this bowl right now? - Tony the Tiger. - Why is that? - Because they're just grr. - They just went out to get it, right? - They're not- - They're not grreat, they're just - That wall is disgusting.
- grr. - Alright, what about you, Becca? - Probably the Frosted Flakes. They're just plain, soggy, - Yeah. - limp noodle. - That's what Ty said. - They're just grr. - Hey Chandler, what you go there? - I don't know. Let's go. - Wow. Look at that meal. - Damn. - Hey, Ty. I gotta go to the chiropractor. I'll be back in a little bit. Stay strong, man. - You stay strong. - You guys ever thought in a million years you'd be sitting in a bowl of cereal. - The way my life has been going, yes. - Your meal has arrived, sir. You ordered the steak
and lobster, correct? - Yes. - And with the biscuits, of course. Ah, look at that. Ah, yes. I'm gonna grab a little fry
here. Yum, yum, yum, yum. - I need three water bottles. - I got you a steak!
You're gettin' needy, man. Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
- I need water. Sorry.
- Here you go, sir. Alright. Love you buddy. I'll be back.
- See, Connor looks like he's outta energy. She looks alive. But I think it's safe to
say Ty's gonna be first out. If you won, what would you buy? - Imma hold on to it. - How about you, Connor? - I'm putting half of it away, and the rest I'm going to Disney World. - How about you, Ty? What are you doin' if you win 10 grand? - Good talk. - I'm really cold and
tired. Morale's so low. So low. It smells really bad. I've
never done anything this gross. Hello? - Hey, you seriously wanna get out? - I don't know. It's so cold and smelly. - Hang in there until I get there. - I can do that. - Are you sure you wanna get out? - The hypothermia, man. - Alright. - It's just tellin' me to get out. - Well, she's out now. - Feel weird.
- Ew, there's literally milk coming... I'm sorry for putting you
through that. That's kinda gross. So you made it six hours. How do you feel? - Such a great experience. No one's ever asked me to stay
in a bowl of cereal before. And my competitors are a
lot stronger than me, man. - So Ty, how do you
feel now that she left? Gotcha. Cool. So two left, how you feelin'? - Oh, I'm good. I can go another six days. - How about you Connor? - I'm goin' to Disney World. - No matter what? - No matter what. - Alright, so with Becca down we've pretty much divvied up
everything that Jimmy gave her. And we've decided that if Ty ever decided to come back to life, he
gets whatever he wants. - Chandler is not a good coach. - Chandler's brought him Chick-fil-A once. - So we're seven hours
in. I want some coffee. You want some coffee? - Eh, I'll wait till
the mornin' for coffee. Oh, hi Ty. Good morning. - Alright, Connor. It's almost 11 o'clock.
You asked for Gushers. You ask and you shall receive. How you feeling?
- Feeling great. - How you doin'? - He woke up. He was out for three hours. - I'm doin' well. - Chandler came by. - Really? What'd Chandler say? - He just said, "I came
to check up on you. Gotta go see the girl." - Didn't even bring him any food. - Geez. - Alright, so what's happening? - I'm gettin' out. - Why? - They're not getting out
anytime soon and I can't hang. So heavy, bro. - And he's out. Tidepool Rego is out. Think of all the things
you could have bought. - Could have bought a car. - So many Gushers! - And then it was just us.
Let's see how this goes. - Hello? - Alright, so have you talked to Ty? - No. - Well did you know he left? - No. - You were asleep. You
should have been here. All you had to do was
sit here and babysit him and you coulda won five grand. - It was once full, but
now there are only two. Cannor,
- Huh? - has become virtually useless to me. I don't understand exactly
what's going on anymore. 14 hours. But, we're about to hit the
coldest point in the night. It's supposed to get down
in 58 degrees, roughly. It's gonna get real cold, real fast. See who gets hypothermia first. - What did I just hear? - I'm callin' it.
- Connor. - Thought I had it, but- - What about Disneyland? - It's too cold now. - Hey, I'm calling Chris. If he doesn't pick up, you can step out. Let's see what he says. He's not picking up. Chris, you missed your
chance to talk him out of it. Alright, with the whole world watching. Go ahead, step out. It's not too late. Oh, oh. Your feet are still in. You take those out, you lose. Like a fish. Alright, Connor is out. This means you won 10 grand, and Jake, your partner, won five. Oh gosh. You smell like urine and milk. Alright, let's go wash you guys off. Hey, what's up Jake? - Hey, you called me? - Yeah. So your guy got out, Connor won. - What? - Yeah, it happened like an hour ago. I was tryin' to let you give
him words of encouragement. So how does that make you feel? You weren't here when he got out. - I'm bummed. - I know, right? You coulda been here for his support. Okay, actually I'm just kidding. Connor left. You actually won. - Let's do it.
- Are you serious? Yeah we won, are you
kidding? It's me, Jake. Let's be fair here. - So yeah, Jake, you won five grand and he won 10 grand. How does that make you feel? - Holy this is amazing. - The competition's over, and in 100% truthfulness, Connor lost. That's why I was trying to call you. I was trying to tell
you to jet on over here. 'Cause, you coulda
convinced him to stay in. - Oh my goodness. Connor, why? - I told him if he got the dub I'd let him plug something. What do you wanna plug? - So, I stream every day
on twitch.tv/scotchty. - ScotchTY. Alright. I hope you guys enjoyed. If you're not subscribed, subscribe or I'll delete
