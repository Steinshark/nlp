hi welcome to something new this is this week's meetings plus blog roll highlight and um this is a new series where i want to talk about the highlight which was in the block rule and i'm going to do that every now and then okay and today it's going to be about a blog post from ben dean who wrote a nice blog post about a new function syntax [Music] 23 that's also kind of the title of this blog post so um i'm going to have the link in the description this is kind of the beginning of his blog post where he you know states that we have various ways to do that but um with 23 we actually able to describe and actually implement a multi argument bracket operator array operator index operator however you want to call this thing you know and use it in this example like he does here versus actually with a string view and you know then return a string or a string view and that's that's good that's something nice i thought i wanted to highlight that um he mentions the paper which which this is based on which is p2128 um and that's a paper from last year which went into superplus 23. and here you see uh basically their motivation is to have this maybe become part of mdspan and then you can do like a matrix multiplication as like one of the examples they um have in in like you know i've heard as examples uh which like i think the next thing we should look at like you know um yeah quick quick shout out to mgspan um it's not yet totally covered in the cpp reference but this is also something which is coming 223 which you might want to get familiar with um so this means that with 23 we are able to overload this index operator um to have either no arguments to have the traditional one argument like we are used to it and um also have a multi-argument operator which then uh you know it is your job to implement that and as far as i understand it you also this is like a normal function argument so you can give that various types so it doesn't have to be audience uh it could be like an int and a string or something else you know you can be creative with that um open questions as far as i understand the paper is they do not support to make the static but are open to it and they also did not cover to have this as a non-member operator which would allow you to adopt types which do not have this implemented right would be a nice thing but that's outside of the scope of the paper from last year at least um so that's potentially something which will be added to the language later for the time i understand it in the way that this is four member functions at the moment so if your type wants to support that that can otherwise um that's how it is uh potential for edsl so which stands for embedded domain specific language so i mentioned matrix multiplication uh multi-dimensional areas is also something which um this i think the md span example uh about my personal thought was like this could also be used naturally to to show grouping and encode like you know we assign those variables now to this to this element uh to this composite for example and um it is you know it is a function syntax that is correct it's basically a function call which you get with this in an operator but as it is an operator it's not a named function so um your your plane when you learn normal function and c plus is not affected by this and you cannot use great bracket just want to point that out which brings me again to uh this block roll um this block entry s3 interesting and yeah so link is in the description go read it it goes on and explains a few other things um and i do um want to mention there's of course more highlights in this week's block roll there's also some videos there are the lightning talks which we had at meetings was online uh there is the talk which we had this week at me see us online about co-routines and um then there's so the the things which i found interesting is the move from optional which is probably something you want to look at the case for optional void or reference types on void there's something cute block has a bunch of updates um and so you know there's a lot to read and there's even another blog post about sql 23 having a new pre-processing directive thanks to c23 um and if you want to subscribe to the block rule that's uh also we'll add the link to that and last but not least you know this is as it's already mentioned at the beginning this is a new thing i do and not every week i have to have time and there has to be something which stands out of the other blog posts which i find interesting and not always will be about 23 it can be a lot of things um and it has to be popular so for block authors um the best thing you can do to have your blog your blog post covered in this is to kind of you know um make them popular just like you know if i post them on social media if you're on twitter retweet the tweet like it that it you know get seen by more people and then i see you know i get more reactions to it i post it even on linkedin etc you know and then i might pick it and so don't don't let me try to make me pick your properties but your blog post what i'm trying to say um and that's it thank you for listening now uh go read ben's blog post and maybe you know look into little rock roll to look at the other good blog posts which i've noted this week thank you
