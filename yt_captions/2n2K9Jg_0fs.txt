apple's mac studio set a high bar for performance in a compact workstation but hp is here to say no way san jose or cupertino neat what is it glued it the z2 mini g9 according to hp it is the world's most powerful mini workstation but then also according to hp that's a big load of horse poo so what exactly is it then well it's a sleek mini workstation boasting up to a core i9 12900k and nvidia a2000 graphics and those are some very impressive specs i mean clearly hp is bringing the heat the question is then can they keep cool under the pressure like i keep cool when segwaying to our sponsor jackery their explorer 2000 pro portable solar generator provides a massive 2000 watt hour capacity charges up to eight devices at once and more on prime day you can save 900 on an explorer 2000 bundle learn more below or at the end of the video hp has gotten a pretty rough ride on this channel and deservedly so nearly every fascinating innovation they've brought to us has been spoiled by poor pricing arbitrary hardware limitations and anti-diluvian build quality sometimes all three they just can't seem to point the gun away from their foot maybe this time will be different but maybe it won't looking at the z2 mini g9's i o we're off to a reasonably good start here they offer a range of display usb thunderbolt and network connectivity and they provide both a pcie 4.0 by 8 half height slot with gpu support and a flex i o slot that can accommodate anything from extra display outputs or usb ports to serial ports though a likely use for it will be to remedy the inexcusable in my opinion absence of multi-gigabit networking in the base spec hp this is a workstation product and even at my purchase volumes two and a half gig ethernet costs four dollars per chip the case can lie flat or be vasa mounted and if you want to get really fancy you can pick up a vertical mount and flip the logo around wow the front is all mesh for better airflow and hp helpfully points out that if you really wanted you could buy a whole gaggle of them and put them on a rack mount shelf neat first though we need to drag race it against the other most powerful mini workstation and see if there's any reason to buy one of these things let alone seven of them as configured rz2 mini g9 is nearly identically priced to the m1 ultramax studio spec for spec let's begin in apple's weakest category gaming hp pulls out an easy way wait what in shadow of the tomb raider the m1 ultra beats it with the cheaper max tier tying the hp workstation boy this is not a good start and this trend continues in total war warhammer where again hp is bested by the mighty mac ultra the story flips with counter strike but this is mostly due to cs go running on opengl on mac os now obviously game compatibility isn't going to favor the mac but given that we're evaluating these machines as workstations our true objective in running games is to find the performance potential of the hardware and it is clear that hp's tiny workstation is limited by nvidia's a2000 a cute little gpu that can be thought of as a 3050 but on a 70 watt power diet with a whopping 12 gigs of vram and certified drivers for professional applications for high resolution video editing and 3d modeling a gaming gpu it clearly ain't so let's move on to productivity where surely the story will stay exactly the same in puget bench premiere hp loses to apple again though in photoshop hp does score its second win though it should be noted that puget bench relies on rosetta for photoshop on mac os so it's not really apples to apples after effects is another win for apple given we couldn't get the benchmark to run on rz2 mini g9 so we can just skip that i guess and as for blender well in cpu rendering it loses against the ultra in our bmw test and in gooseberry which raises some very interesting questions because we had a similarly configured test bench in our mac studio review that did win with a core i9 in our gpu render testing rendering with optics wins every time but with cuda the mac ultra pulls ahead again as for synthetic productivity benchmarks in cinebench hp wins in single threaded performance but then fumbles in multi-threaded performance and the same goes for geekbench signaling the existence of a clear trend here core i9 12900k plus heat name a more iconic duo i'll wait oh yeah i guess the wan hoodie and when sweatpants from lttstore.com now it should be noted that our m1 ultramax studio is decked out with 128 gigs of ram but that's unlikely to heavily factor into the tests that we ran today what that means is that hp must have screwed something up in here to find out what we have to take a bit of a deeper dive inside actually we won't even really need to do that because like you we did a double take when we saw they were trying to pack a core i9 into this tiny three and a half liter enclosure i mean the mighty nhd15 can barely handle this cpu and it alone is four liters in volume did hp engineer a magic 240 watt cooling solution out of unicorn horns and leprechaun blood nope they didn't even try in fact you can see it right here there's a sticker on the cooler that says 125 watts so naturally the poor thing throttled hard throughout our testing in cinebench the z2 performs a whopping 30 percent worse than the exact same chip on our test bench in blender our render times increased between 20 and 50 percent over our test bench and premiere pro we see 10 percent lower scores in puget bench with similar losses in geekbench this performance hit even bleeds into gaming where we see 10 losses for the hp workstation in tomb raider warhammer and cs go we also took forza horizon 5 for a spin and saw again a 10 hit and even more damningly running the benchmark for an extended period of time drops the z2 mini g9's result even further why would that be you might ask surely the cpu is already thermally throttled and you're right but as it turns out thanks to hp's brilliant case design which provides next to no clearance for the gpu cooler the gpu overheats too that's right even our tiny little 70 watt gpu is throttling to the point where longer gpu renders complete 25 faster on our bench compared to the hp it's just sad even cranking the gpu fan to a hundred percent which is well beyond the factory curve only delays the inevitable throttling and as for the cpu well we tried some simple adjustments to their cooling solution in an attempt to prevent hot air from recirculating inside the case and we were able to marginally improve our scores but what we really need is a way to adjust the fan curve something that hp either through their performance advisor software or the bios shockingly does not allow and it needs to be adjusted look at this we started up a benchmark this thing is running full bore right now and it's dead silent the fans didn't even spin up until after the cpu had already thermally throttled we tried every performance mode from quiet to high performance and they all behaved basically the same the only possible solution was to set the idle fan speed to 100 percent which unfortunately locks it at maximum which unfortunately is 7 000 rpm on this model which is loud as all hell and adding insult to injury the machine still throttles to demonstrate that this is a cooling problem rather than a spec problem we actually swapped out our core i9 with a core i7 12700k and in this exact system that i7 actually beat the i9 in rendering premiere and in cs go even our less power hungry cpu though it still throttled partially because hp's cut tang power limiting made yet another surprise appearance so sorry i gotta turn this off hp not only equips their workstation with insufficient cooling their workstation class motherboard can't even power the hardware anyway i mean knowing that hp employs some incredibly talented engineers it's hard for me to imagine what goes on behind the scenes for a train wreck like this to make it to market unlike lmg where you can watch the train wreck in slow motion behind the scenes on floatplane.com rather than just imagining it let's come back around to hp's claim though that the z2 mini g9 is the fastest mini workstation in the world we called that horse plop before we even knew that the machine throttled like an aging white dude on a harley why because their qualification for that claim is that it is based on hp's internal analysis of non-gaming small form factor desktop workstations with between three to 20 leaders a minimum three isb certifications configurable professional graphics and a dedicated workstation brand as of march 2022 good gravy i mean by that kind of logic based on my analysis i have the most subscribers on youtube of people with at least eight channels that make tech videos based in surrey canada and we haven't even started on the price much like the mac studio this thing is very expensive i mean i get it it's a business system so there is a premium and you do get some benefits from it the parts have undergone extra reliability testing it uses a workstation chipset ecc memory isv certification you know the whole corporate kit in caboodle but charging 1100. for a 12 900k that is 500 over retail for the privilege of running it throttled that's just insulting hp this could have been a very sleek capable workstation and for less powerful components it still could be an excellent fit for your business but as configured it simply shouldn't exist you know what should though our sponsor jackery whether
