in the physics department we had some commodore pets and an apple ii i think and a few other things and you could play some reasonably decent games on that i remember space invaders on the commodore pet that we actually managed to hack and change around if you knew the right assembly when you moved across to the sort of mini computer which we had the pvp 1170 people were always a little disappointed you know got my friends to come along and say oh yeah look at this we've got this big computer here i say well first thing was four games can you play on it and uh this was the version seven which uh i did find a um a virtual machine for somebody made you can actually all go and experience the virtual 7 environment if you really want to but it had a very poor set of games really i guess that wasn't really their intention in making unix they were all very much sort of command line so it would print something and you type something in and it would print something else sometimes you might get a screen full um i think there was a there was a chest but we never really got going with that because that was quite experimental at bell but there are other things uh so if you're playing checkers or something it would print a board and scroll up the screen and obviously this was at uh early days of computing and the board rates were not very fast so i think we'll mostly be on 300 board but we still use 300 board for some things and that's painfully slow is this like networked gaming then no this this isn't no this is just just regular connected to the computer so despite talking about board rates this is literally the terminal talking to the machine that's right yeah we're so used to i know wi-fi broadband super fast broadband fiber this that and the other that to go back to these kind of baud isn't it board measured in the hundreds what does it what does it mean in terms of say an ascii character well it's it's really really slow i mean i've written a uh a short term emulator to show you what 300 board is so if i look at the manual page for one of the games arithmetic and i print it or show it how it would appear on the screen at 300 board you can see it's a relatively painful experience because you know it's actually printing slower than i can read it so if you kind of get quickly frustrated so that's 300 we didn't get very many things that ran at 300 a lot of the campus ran at 1200 board though so if you wanted to connect to other machines or just connect your terminal up to the computer center that certainly ran at 1200 and that was a bit better i mean you can see here it's coming it's it's about the same speed as you could read at least scan so you know things coming out at that speed is this a little painful 9600 which we were running uh all our terminals in the math and physics building that's much better i mean you can see that's coming out actually faster than you can read so that comes out at a reasonable rate and you could actually do some things with that that was kind of the the backdrop to it that uh if you wanted to play any of these games they because they all came out so slowly there was very you didn't want to print out a lot of stuff on the screen because uh he would take forever to display it there was an adventure game that people may well have come across and that was all very text based you know you're in the forest and you don't go left or go north or go south or into the building and then it would chunk through and say oh this describe the scene and then it would abbreviate the scene because you didn't want to take all this time showing the scene again because it just takes so much time so that's kind of where we were at and say there was various games you could play tic-tac-toe and something called which i never really understood some mystical thing and uh there was a nice quiz game that um you could actually load a database so you say they have one state capitals and states so what's the capital of new york and things like that and you could play it in either direction you could say okay uh given given the capital what's the state or whatever and you could write new games for that so that was quite fun and there was a hangman game i remember but they're all rather poor and uh boring to some extent and that's kind of the way it stayed until we upgraded to uh the next computer which was the vax 750 running berkeley 4.2 i think we've got him we might have run one of the 4.1 versions berkeley 4.1 is that a completely different kind of fork to version 7 units yeah it was taken from that so we have version 7 which only really ran on a few things so pvp 11's and i think they've pulled it to a couple of other things and then they did get a vax at bell labs and they did a quick port which i think was called the 32v 32 bit version or something and it was really just a straight pause the pvp 1170 which had no virtual memory so it was just wanted straight over and so just ran like a pdp 1170 but didn't use any of the extensions so you were still limited to 64k programs but ken thompson went to berkeley and took version of it which is kind of why berkeley got involved he spent a year there as a professor i think and they just sort of descended on it and said well we can do much better we can actually start using the virtual memory so we can have programs as big as we like we can we don't need to be constrained we can have paging and all this sort of stuff so i think they started with a version two on pdp elevens that didn't have virtual memory then they went to version four dots here presumably that uh worked on the backs with virtual memory but crucially it had a new game um and this was uh something called uh rogue uh which is uh subtitled exploring the dungeons of doom and this was came about by two uh guys michael toy and glenn wichmann who were working at uh university california san diego i believe but they eventually moved up to university of california berkeley which was the people who produced this 4.2 so this game was around in the atmosphere and it got included into these distributions and it was based on something written by ken arnold called the curses library so you imagine the scene we're all sitting at these terminals which are just like typewriters with screens attached but there are all sorts of different ones so we used tdi912s there were things called vt-100s there's a hazel time they're all much the same in if you just printed characters to the screen you printed a line of characters and then a carriage returned line feed will get you to the next thing so scrolling up the screen was easy but they also had mechanisms to position you at the screen so you could say go to the home position or you could go to an arbitrary position on the screen and but they were all used very different sort of character sequences to do that so what worked on the tvi i want to to put you to here would sort of turn into gobble to google something else so we had a few programs that knew about this but they were all sort of very hardwired i said what turtle am i on there i'm on a tbr 912 but i don't i know how to get there i want something else i've no idea how to position myself to a place in the screen but ken arnold came up with a library that knew how to position itself on sort of pretty much any any terminal was and uh had it had a database so you could add new terminals to it sort of mini programming language just by linking with this library you could say in a terminal independent way go to this location and draw something and it was very much optimized to work with 1200 and 300 board terminals so that uh you've got a good experience whatever so here is rogue so what's happening here is you're looking down on a dungeon you're in a room here that's um surrounded by these dashes the doors are crosses the monsters are capital letters so we've got a snake there waiting to get to us and we're the at character highlighted and there's a bit of gold over there that i can go and get you can see the snake is after me and i've got i'm on level one of the dungeon now with 44 gold pieces 12 out of 12 hit points 16 out of 16 strength armor class 4 and no experience i can get some experience by attacking the speak all this snake is attacking me though i've got three points of experience so these two guys using this library they could actually they'll get to display on the screen anywhere you could have this sort of adventure game and you could actually move around the screen and chase monsters and monsters could chase you and so on so it was a fantastic thing so there we are i died never attack ice monsters we spent many hours on it it was also procedurally generated so each time you went into the dungeon you got a new layout so you couldn't learn it as such you could learn what the monster did and you could learn what accessories were potions and scrolls and things like this and new weapons you could find so you gradually built up your own database in your head of what was good and what was bad but you didn't know what the dungeon was going to be like it was new each time uh you could save your progress but uh you couldn't copy the save file and they made sure that so you could restore it and carry on but you couldn't cheat by saving yourself and then trying something out and if that went wrong go back to position so they thought of that so uh yes it was a fascinating thing and really changed things around a lot and i think it's partly because of this curses library partly because the the board rates were getting faster and you could actually get somewhat interactive at this point it's really interesting the idea of procedurally generated maps i believe that elite on the bbc used procedurally generated maps here how might that work yeah elite is a really good example because they tried to cram as many star systems into a world as they could but found you could just haven't got the the uh space to store all this so instead they worked off something procedurally generated so you take a couple of numbers and you do some arithmetic on it or something and you get a sequence building up from initial seed so you start with something and multiply it by three multiply it by three again or something and you get a sequence of numbers and then you use those to map into sort of planets or something like that so rogue was very similar i mean it it did have some rules behind it it actually divided the screen into sort of nine sequel nine squares three by three so you would probably have a room in each of those three squares and then they would be connected by corridors but they would move around within those boundaries and sometimes it would miss out a room so there wasn't actually a room there was just a corridor that went through it and do that so yeah they played around with that and they played around with lots of these ideas and um eventually also ken arnold who did the curses library came on board and helped him uh improve and uh i think he also did quite a bit extra work on the curses library so that it would be sort of optimal because there's more than one way to get to a place on the screen if you happen to be already almost there you could just move across a couple which would only be two characters maybe rather than maybe four characters to jump to a specific location so you can optimize things in that way so yes we we played this rogue game for hour after hour after after hours in fact because you weren't allowed to play games during the day um about 5 30 a script would run and games would be turned on and all descend on that i don't know anybody who ever completed rogue i think you have to get down to level 24 in the dungeon where you pick up an amulet and come back and be the winner i don't i think i got down to maybe level 20 once that was as far as i ever got i don't know anybody else in the department who got much further than that and certainly nobody completed it there were stories on the internet of people who completed it but i've never met anyone who have so it was a particularly tough game so you know the first few levels were quite easy but after that it got progressively harder is it available as an emulator could be black yeah i just had a look in fact you can get it on steam there were versions that they ported after the unix to ms-dos and windows they were always tinkering with the game and a couple of reasons for this one was just to make it a little bit more exciting and so on but there was also another branch to this which i'll perhaps talk about in the uh next video we make of this where um there are other ways of playing it so uh i'll just leave that there as a little taster of what's to come but uh yeah once once i'd discovered this second level i stopped playing the game and went went to do something different instead which uh we'll talk about next time if you do that this unix will get you started in the great world of multi-user on simple terminals you can do your own thing you'll run out of steam after about four or five years it's all done taken care of and julie on the first of uh april it came out as this ipv9
