[Music] for me one of the best things about working in film and documentary specifically is that no two working days are ever the same some people might find that kind of change annoying but I personally love it and the constant variety of travel and learning are for me will make this one of the best jobs in the world and since for the last couple of months you've been seeing me make these videos from up here in the snow thought this would be the perfect opportunity to bring you on set with me and show you what it's like to work on a big budget doc Series in a remote location so in this video I'm going to show you what 48 Hours on occasion with the documentary cinematographer looks like the kinds of filming missions I get assigned on a typical day and how we move in the Arctic with gear and a bunch of other stuff so you can decide if these are the kind of shoots you'd like to be doing yourself anyways I'm almost back at base camp now I'm just going to take a second to grab my gear and pack my bag then we'll head out and start shooting so right now we're inside the gear room where myself and the other DPS keep most of our stuff and spending a few minutes in here packing is usually the first thing I do at the start of a workday I said workday there like there are days off off but actually I've only had one day off since August 17th but that's another story for legal reasons I can't really tell you much about the show itself but I can tell you we're working with a 10 plus million do budget and a 3-month shooting schedule so it's a fairly high-end shoot by doc standards I'll just say it's a bigname survival show that broadcast on most of the bigger streaming platforms out there and I'm one of the two main DPS I'll also just quickly mention that this is a condensed version of this video and we actually shot so much footage that I was able to put together a way longer version that I'm going to be sharing with the filmmakers enrolled in my documentary cinematography course the course launched this year for the first time and sold out in like 4 days and the next intake is going to happen in early 2024 I'm guessing it's probably going to sell it again because I'm only letting in really limited numbers of people so if you want to reserve a spot plus get exclusive access to expanded content like this you can sign up for the wait list below when it does go live again you'll also get a discount for being on there first so if you're interested at all it's a good idea to sign up anyways I didn't really mean for this to turn into a plug but for all of you enrolled keep an I out in the members group for the long form version coming soon anyways back to what I was saying this is sort of a weird production because we're out here for over 3 months without a break and that means that there's quite a bit of autonomy and self- motivation involved which isn't all that normal a typical shoot might be packed into I don't know a couple of weeks and the director is going to want to shoot pretty much all day every day to make sure they get what they need on the limited number of shooting days they can afford on this show while there are a fair amount of verit Beats to cover we spend a lot of our time just trying to visualize the environment which is really just a fancy word for Gathering a crap ton of b-roll and when I say b-roll here I'm not just talking about like slow motion hero shots of people blinking into the sunset we're doing all sorts of stuff from placing motion controlled trail cameras to capture Wildlife we're following game trails and animal tracks hiking up mountains leaving time lapses in weird places and helicoptering into the middle of nowhere to get a few sweet drone shots anything that represents the physical world out here is fair game and a lot of the time it's up to us the DPS to decide what to focus on it's pretty cool to have all this freedom and to have the budget and resources to stay up in such a remote place for so long and it's definitely not something I take for granted so I'll just finish packing up quickly I'll get my winter gear on and then we'll get out [Music] there so this is one of our camera benches it's really chaotic cuz we've been here months shooting so it's sort of bit of a mess but I thrive in this chaos sort of um nothing complicated I'm just going to grab all the lenses I need for the day change out batteries and then I'm want to get out of here as quickly as possible this might look like a Preposterous amount of layers but when you're going to go stand around behind a camera for 5 or 6 hours gets cold out there fast it's likeus [Music] 15Â° [Music] [Music] so I think we found two Carib we're trying to sneak up on them now I don't know if it's possible but we're [Music] trying well we Race Across this Lake didn't find the Caribou they smelled us and ran but in the words of my illustrious Countryman Wayne Gretzky is 100% of the shots you don't [Music] take round two I guess we are oh we didn't bring the white cap issue ice clearing device oh [Music] yeah so right now you might notice I'm wearing fishing waiters and I'd love to play it off all cool like I was just about to go in there and like anything to get the shot but I actually already fell into the ice over the waiters and flooded them got completely soaked had to redry all my stuff fried a bunch of electronics so it was really clumsy I think I got some photo evidence of it that I'll post somewhere here so we're going to try it again and hopefully it's not such a big disaster almost went in and soaked the entire R and all these ice shards that are formed on the river are really beautiful and as soon as it snows they're going to be gone forever so waiting into the water shooting some long L stuff hopefully don't tank the entire [Music] camera oh hi there just another Tuesday here at YouTube Studios bet you're wondering what I'm up to should I do a fake one oh hello there I can't do it I can't even fake it take the L cap unless you want definitely going in the [Music] water oh oh the algorithm all right in all seriousness a big part of my job on this show is to visualize the natural environment and for whatever reason all of these ice shards have sort of forced as the river flash freezes overnight because sometimes these moments are going to pop up and you maybe have other things to do or you don't you know feel motivated to get out but they're never going to happen again you know today I have other stuff to do I'm trying to finish an edit but this has to be shot cuz it's going to disappear and it's super important so wearing fishing waiters and kneeling in an ice bath for the last 15 minutes but hopefully it's worth it or maybe it's not worth it maybe they're not going to use the shots at all and it's all a waste of time but you still got to try so one thing about being uh doc DP on like really long shoots is that there's no one standing over my shoulder like telling me what to do on a day-to-day basis it's not like people have the time or the energy to like supervise and direct me all the time minutes oh God yeah helicopter's coming in so a lot of freedom and you need to really be selfmotivated to make sure you're still getting the stuff you need no one's telling me to do this I'm just sort of decided this is going to be my afternoon project so we're out here shooting it and actually you can hear the helicopter coming in U I'm guessing the mic is picking that up but there's a helicopter landing uh and then pretty shortly we'll jump in and we'll move off to our next [Music] location all right so we're just about to start the first mission of the day even though it looks like it's 6:00 in the morning right now it's actually almost 10:30 just way up North so it's dark forever we are heading across the ice to try and get a couple of shots that the director has sort of dreamed up um so we've got our trusty safety consultant over here drilling the ice make sure it's okay I'm going to walk across the river and then try a whole bunch of things like sliders and gimbals and maybe a time lapse or something to show these ice sheets well this backpack is way heavier today I'm going to fall for sure man please don't hurt yourself oh I think I think he's done it all right he's done it nice success so the safety guy said it was mostly safe to cross this River as long as we stay far enough apart um so yeah we're just heading over to do these ice shots now to me this is like one of the best possible things about this job where where else do you get to like where is this the morning walk to work Crossing this random Arctic River I absolutely love it the whole reason we're out here is just to go shoot this one hypothetical ice shot that someone dreamed up is this a real job I don't know all right so the ice just made super concerning sounds and I've done really well so far not falling and embarrassing myself so going to try and oh we're on another thick ice sheet going to try and stick the land in and get out of here without [Music] falling I'm constantly putting down gimbals and Ronin on this channel it's become like kind of like a meme of mine almost but I do use them uh so today we're going to try and use this zon micro slider to get some shots looking up under the ice this thing is definitely not designed to function in an environment like this it's for everyone who gets upset every time I talk badly about uh gimbals and Ronin and things like that and Sliders the point isn't uh that they're bad tools they're great I'm just saying don't overuse them use them when needed but sparingly do not fall down that Hill jeez you guys are forgetting a bu stuff pretty much pipe down all right I'm passing this down uh probably I don't [Music] know I still think this slider sounds exactly like C3PO playing the flute yeah there you go got to watch your demos I think it looks cool I think it looks good maybe turn the light down like 15% okay I thought 16 yeah hit it put it at what was it be were you 100 at first do it at like 75 flying it in here we go okay we'll roll it back it's probably going to stutter like crazy I think that's pretty cool let's try one more version all right uh uh put the light on this or get the one on the stick y put it at like 6,000k and point it like here okay slide slide back towards yourself okay yeah there all right so we're going to shut it down for the ice shots I think some of them worked all right some of them were better than others and overall is worth it we're going to go back to Camp across the river eat some lunch all right so it's the end of the day and we're back in the gear room just found out that one of the fs SS we were using uh got damaged and is not going to be usable for shooting anymore so uh I'm just going to spend the last little bit of today building out uh another camera uh it's pretty dirty but we're going to get it out get it ready just in case we need it uh can't be without backups it's a good lesson I know that everyone doesn't have the luxury of having multiple cameras and you know I get that that's totally fine but you know when you start to get up into a higher more professional level where there are Stakes like starting to think about having a backup around is a really good idea because you can get into situations like this we've been out here already for almost 3 months now you can probably tell like you been watching these videos for the last couple of months I probably look more and more hey the longer this goes on it's been quite a while and uh the gear is showing the wear and tear just as much as we are uh yeah try and build up redundancies and backups um and another thing is always travel with a cleaning kit uh I think I've talked about this a couple of times just some basic stuff in here tools yeah not going to do a full tour now but get cleaning stuff together so that way when your gear gets dirty you can clean it off and then get back to using it so that's kind of what it's like to spend a couple days like on set with me up here in the Arctic um hopefully in the next couple of weeks or so I'll be going back home uh make these videos in a bit more of a controlled environment but that's more or less how we've been rolling out here and yeah I hope you all liked it see [Music] you I have the end
