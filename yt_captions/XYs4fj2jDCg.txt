[Music] if you're building software at any kind of scale Beyond personal projects then there's something else you end up needing to build too and that's a community I mean at the very least you've got a group of users who you should be talking to but these days it's often a mix of users and other developers contributors potential contributors people who would like to be users if they could just understand what they're doing so on and so on there are a lot of people to consider on the other side of the code you're building and I think that's great I think it's one of the joys of programming to see other people using the things you've built and then collaborating with other developers to build bigger and better things it's great Community is essential and I'm glad it is the problem is that while I think software people are generally a warm friendly affable Bunch on the whole if you ask the average coder how do you build a community well I think we're largely stumped on that question it's an important question but I don't think the answer comes naturally to programming types so I thought we'd bring in an expert and listen to them just to give us some ideas and some guidance on how you build better communities why you want strong communities what's it all for how do we go about it and this week's guest is Ali Murray she's been a community manager in the tech world for coming onto a decade now I've worked with her she is a joy to work with and she's also very good at her job um most importantly she's very practical at her job she's got solid advice and it's a pleasure to hear her impart it so let's do just that I'm your host Chris Jenkins this is developer voices and today's voice is Ali Murray [Music] thank you joining me today it's Ali Murray early how are you over there I I'm great I'm really excited to be you here I've been looking for an excuse to talk to you on the podcast for a while I'm glad you found it absolutely yes so you are a community manager professionally for many years right and we're going to get into what that actually means and how we can learn to build better communities but how did you get into that what took your career in that direction yeah yeah it's a it's a funny one because I started um so this was not very popular when when I started um and I started because I interviewed for a company called Data Stacks oh yeah um work with Apache Cassandra and when I interviewed I actually interviewed for the role of event manager for marketing but as I interviewed the person who eventually hired me said well actually we have two roles open and we would like you to choose which one you would like to go to um this one is events and this one is community so when he explained to me about the community I said listen I mean it sounds lovely but I have no idea what you're talking about so you know I had been doing events for ages for for many years by then so when he say that I just was very honest I said I have no idea what this is about and his response was no one goes no one knows how to do this um I I can just promise you that I'm gonna help you on the on the way to to learn and we can learn together so um I ask him you know what's your recommendation what if you were me what would you do because you know the rules and you know me now that you've interviewed me so what would you do at um his response was something that definitely changed my life uh which was uh you can always go back to events and because it's always going to be there but if you specialize in community um I can Envision that it's going to be something very valuable five years from now and um if you really get um very deep into that topic I think you're gonna end up being finding that it's a very valuable experience for you and for for your career and your growth so I just thought yeah why not like I can always go back to events so that changed my life nine years later I'm still in community and I really um very appreciative and thankful to to him his name is Christian Husker and he was my mentor for a long time and we learned how to communicate together and it was yeah the best choice I love it and I still love it and you're saying and I'm just totally totally in love with the community work and and everything that has to do with it which we're going to talk about yeah you've always seemed like a complete natural for um just reaching out to people and Community Building type stuff oh thank you I really enjoy it and I think that's part of why why it looks natural that comes across so maybe we should start with um how you how you found your feet in that role I mean where from scratch what what the first things you had to learn Karthik at the beginning because obviously we didn't know what we were what we were doing we um just tried it was trial and error really so we would just tried a few things failed at a few things and then we identified the ones that we really succeeded at um and then we started to go from there um so some of the things that we failed at was to treat it as a marketing uh opportunity um but with the community um target audience and that totally failed we learned very quickly that that was not the approach um so that's one of the things that definitely we steered away from and uh some of the examples of things that worked with was to really focus on community for um community building and not for marketing purposes and with that prevailing on our strategy everything everything else fell into place so okay it could be that we were doing events that looked very similar to the ones that marketing were doing and which we ended up ended up being calling meetups which you know realizing that they were meetups um but they looked at the a bit similar to what marketing was doing and we realized that the or difference to that was the the approach from a marketing perspective rather than from a teaching perspective a perspective and an educational perspective and uh Community Building perspective so um I don't think that we build community I think that we build platforms that encourage the community to build it itself and those were some of the platforms that that helped so meetups slack channels and all these uh you know blogs and all these things that that we ended up doing we just had core information in them and that helped it to succeed that's really interesting that it's what that you think farming in that sense you're like you're not really you're not building a community you're not constructing it you're not dragging people into it you are trying to build a pasture in which these things will naturally organically grow themselves that's absolutely it I think it's it's very difficult to force it is completely impossible to fake it uh it's very transparent you if people see through it through it you know it's it's completely transparent so I think that to be a prepotent to think that you're building something and building a community is completely useless I think you realize that you're actually just giving the tools for people to build the community themselves then that becomes much easier on your strategy building on the way that you see the job as well but also on the transparency that comes across from the community thing to the community itself um so yeah I I like that analogy I think it's definitely like that you're not you know you're not growing the fruit yourself you're like just making that making sure the environment is right yeah yeah yeah it sounds like trying to do it as a marketing play early and failing badly was actually very educational that's true that's true I'm really glad that we failed a lot and we were running really fast uh and I I'm really glad that we discovered that very early on because it definitely allowed us to test everything else from a more pure perspective um and with that other problems arise arose I don't know how to say that but basically um problems like the making sure the company was happy with the results and the measures and all that stuff it came you know because of that because if you are tied to marketing then it's much easier to to make sure that you can justify the work with numbers and um yeah when you're not doing it is much more difficult but the results are long term and they are completely different and that's what you need to to to understand as a community manager is you cannot compare yourself with marketing and you cannot measure yourself in the same way and if you understand that they're completely different topics it's much easier to come to come to terms with that but what's difficult is to make everyone else in the company yeah I can totally believe maybe we should maybe we should start let's step back and look at that then if my if a community isn't a marketing strategy and I completely agree with you it's not what's it for what do you put all that effort in for well that's a great question and I think it's for everyone it's it's for the company it's for the people it's for the project I think everyone benefits from from the work of of the community uh building itself uh the people benefit themselves because they find a group that of like-minded people that support them into you know whatever they're building or learning how to build whatever they're building and they support them on you know not being alone in that road that is so lonely sometimes when you're learning those new um skills and and the ways that that you need to to figure out your projects by yourself you're not by yourself anymore it benefits the project because not only Project Style all the time because of the lack of of activity but it just helps it Thrive it helps it and make sure that it's healthy that it's the smartest people in the room are you know um collaborating and and contributing to it so the project grows and evolves and matures and it's very good for the project and it's really good for the company because they end up um you know what what you want as a company is for people to use the technology that you're interested that you want them to use for whatever reason and every company has a different reason for that um but if if you see a lot of of people using that technology that you really wanted well of course it's beneficial for the company so I think it's for everyone I think everyone that's involved benefits from it and as long as it's you know pure and and respected yeah yeah so we'll get into when it goes wrong yeah but let's save that for a second you there is a need because of those three groups right the the people who come along to the community the project and the company it feels like the company is the only one that's worried about measuring yeah I mean naturally because it's the is the it has a business behind it and I feel that the um stress of a company to just show results all the time it's yeah just behind that and I think that or I have I have been very lucky to land in a company where that hasn't been distressed because the the founders have been really um part of the community from the beginning and I they've understood that so they've allowed us to have that freedom of not having that stress but um it hasn't always been like that I have been in other companies where that there is that stress and um I think that if if the measuring comes to play um the purity of the work of the community manager it's affected and and that doesn't allow you to work very well or Pure or how it should be done in my opinion and that ends up contaminating the results as well um which ends up working you know affecting the the company on the first place so I think um if you as a company have that long-term vision of understanding that these results are not going to be like you're used to or like your other business reports and your other business measurements um and you give it a little bit of a of a space and a little bit of Freedom they find that the results down down the way are going to be more impactful than you thought and you're just gonna look back and go oh okay this is what happens when I let this happen and when I'm not in that stress business okay so persuade I'm just thinking if I if I'm a company I'm sitting there and seeing there are 20 people on our slack Channel right and I've just hired the amazing Ali Murray to help build our community am I not going to want to like 10x that number 20 or something I mean instinctively that's what I want to do yeah that will happen but um if you just start putting the pressure up we have to just literally get people in here I don't care how we get people in here we have to double triple you know whatever this number yeah this amount of time then the pressure becomes oh no I need the numbers so let me just find random people to join the the community and then just get it but if what you really want is the people and the quality it takes time it will it will not happen in a month or in six months like you are used to in your business but it will happen over time and um the quality of the people that you'll find in there it'll be a much better measurement for for a result than the number in x amount of time so what I always say to to the the managers is that is if you give it the benefit of the doubt that it will get there eventually just not in the same Pace that you're used to but it will end up with better results because it will be it'll be a more active a more engaging a more Dynamic and a more um a safer Community then you'll look back and you'll realize that what you wanted was not those numbers what you wanted was those numbers with the quality that comes with that and to get there it takes time but um if you just focused only on the results and then and the numbers it just it doesn't work then what I say to people that that ask me for advice on that regard is then just do marketing because that's what's gonna help drag those numbers and and then the company is not prepared in a in a you know in the maturity stage to to put everything to the community efforts yeah yeah you've it fundamentally it's one of those plays where you've got to believe in the value of the thing for and of itself rather than as a funnel to other departments yes yeah though having said that I'm going to challenge you one more time on this okay so here I am running my I've I'm convinced that my slack Channel with 20 people will grow organically and happily but I look at this and I think there are 20 really good people on my slack Channel having good conversations and surely there's another 200 out there who would be very happy here if only they'd heard of me like just just finding the people who naturally want to grow in your garden is is that a job for marketing or is that something that you were also doing no that's such a poor Community for sure because that's a different problem the first problem that you challenged me with was the numbers and the results right so how do we get all this how do I multiply this one is how do I actually get the people that are interested in what is happening here and these can be valued for them and that's where I come from or that's what I come to really it's um I am not selling them anything I am providing them with the right environment for them to grow and and to to help themselves really so that's definitely a job for community and that allows me to find those right 200 people and not the random 200 people down the street so um your slide Channel becomes active that becomes valuable and you feel that you are giving value to people which is what I think ultimately is the is the goal for the community department is to make sure that you're giving people value because if you're not then it is another marketing effort yeah yeah I think maybe that's really the hits the nail on the head it's not that you're you're not measuring a community by the number by the numbers that you've got but actually by how much value you're giving away in a sense absolutely and and the way to do that is yeah you you um build a strategy which we're going to talk about later and uh with with the strategy that's how you start bringing people towards your your efforts onto towards your environment and that environment can live in many in in many places right we're talking about as an example but it could be many places it could be meetups it could be used like overflow you're ready I don't know whatever you have everyone every company and every project and every person has a different set of um environments that that the community lives at and I think that's very important to distinguish and also to distinguish that your community is not your slack Channel your community it's not your stack Overflow is everywhere people live at um and everywhere that people that are interested about your technology are hanging out uh and uh that's a tool but your community is the actual people that are there and that's the that's what you need to create value for okay so do you think when I look out into the world and I realize scales fall from my eyes and I realize it's not just slack there are people talking about it on stack Overflow and other places where should I be looking and then are there different strategies for making those places more valuable to people I'm depending on the medium yeah absolutely you should be looking everywhere because that's where you find them so you know your community is not slack is who lives since life but they don't only live in slack they live in many other places so you should always be looking everywhere the challenge comes to um when it's time to work on those other places I think the first thing to do is to step back and then just have a look at all these places and decide which one brings the most um value to your community and to yourself and where do you want to actually drive the efforts to so then maybe you say I don't need this lecture a a space actually because people are already living very happily in my Reddit group let's say and so why am I going to create something else to drive them away from that but then if you start becoming becoming a little bit more interested in bringing them value then you go well actually if I move them from ready to slack and I try to to guide them towards the the dislike then we can have more valuable conversations on threads that they won't get lost and people can find the topics easier so if you focus on okay what do I want to give them as valued then you can decide side where to put your efforts and every Community is different so I cannot tell you you know it's a rule for everyone because I don't think it is so different communities live in different places Discord twitch discourse everywhere and and they they find themselves in many other places but in this particular case let's say that you decided that actually slack was the best place for them to go um then with the strategy just start making that the priority towards the environment that you're building and and preparing for them to live in a more in a healthier way so your focus will be on this lack um a channel so oh there's like a space so in that way you know that all the efforts that you're going to make on your strategy that will waterfall to a waterfall your goals to then it's all focused on that's like um it depends on as well how many people you have working for your team you know obviously if you're a team of one person which is a lot of the times then you need to focus on one effort at a time or two efforts at a time maximum then if your team starts growing then you can start looking at more places so then suddenly you say I don't actually need to select only I can mix like and stack Overflow really healthy places for for people to live um in in both of them and and I'll be happy with that so then if you have more team members then you can just start increasing your scope uh regarding the environments that you're targeting so it depends but if in an ideal world if I had 50 people in my community I will be definitely targeting all of them because I don't think money is better than the other and I think you should just go over the community leagues you should meet them where they are yeah yeah so yeah you definitely need to go where they are and but also think where they could be offered more value and I guess that's what you're saying if you're one Community manager you get to pick those two Targets right the one where they currently are and the one potentially different one where you think it could be most improved you've got it yeah okay oh I'm learning I'm learning I'm learning a lot here okay so but do you think within that I mean we know all the usual roll call of places you'll find the community like slack twitch Reddit so on do you think each one has a different character has a different particular set of values it offers people I do because the people that hang out in them are a bit different so you don't find the same craze sounds like um if it was I think that the the channels are what the what the community makes them be um so the crease that brings a lot of values like won't have time to bring the same value to stuck overflow so then analy raises there to make that in a different space and I do believe that the the influencers of the channels are the people who are the most active in them and they are the ones who set the tone for um the health of the channel itself so not all channels are the same but it doesn't mean that already groups are the same so I'm not saying that you know for project a b and c uh all the reddits are the same I just think that they are all very different according to the people that live in them yeah so you're saying go and find the tone and learn from it in that particular place in that case let's get on to this topic which is a thorny one what if you come in as a new community manager to a new job and you find that most of the conversation is on let's pick Reddit and it's kind of a sour conversation as happens there are toxic places on the internet that you could inherit find yourself serving what do you do when things go wrong Ali yeah well that's really the most difficult issue to face you're working with communities and I think it's important to try your best to not let it get to that point if you can if you are already if like you say coming into it um I think that there's a few things that you can do um I think setting an example is the best thing you can do in this case uh and the people who say things the example are are various people so one of them uh is yourself and your community team whether that's you alone or anyone else it's uh anyone who's close to your community team like your developer Advocates uh your integration architecture everyone that's close to it that has interactions at least in this channel that are part of the company the leaders of the company that pop in here and there uh whether that is the founders or people who are very influential in the community from an engineering a standpoint that join into the into the channels they are very influential and another group of influencers is the the people who are the community influencers so they're not part of your company but they are very um huge in the project whether that is because they uh use it or they choose their funds or they are committers or contributors or anything that that they are there's some very strong voices and I think those are the people that you can Target so because you cannot Target a group of 30 000 people right it's very completely impossible so what I think is if you work really closely with that group of people which could be 5 or 20 but it's much more money manageable than 30 000. um you can help them be the good influence in the in the community the in the in the space so um for example if I see that one of these people are not using the great you know tone that I wanted or they are not very kind to someone or then I'll just have a word with them and then just just talk and then explain to them that they are very visible because people are not aware of the huge influence they are they have most of the times and so I make them aware that you are an example and thanks to whatever you say that's how the community is going to behave then people normally will go oh actually I didn't realize that thanks for telling me I'll change my tone from now on and that's it and it's worked 99.9 of the times and the same goes for when a random Community member comes and then just becomes really you know rude or anything sour as you say in the community I think the best approach that has worked for me is to just go on on a direct message or on a phone call or however the environment allows you know DM on slack or however the environment allows and say the same hey you know listen there's another human being on the other side of the of the computer and um they might not speak the same language that you speak and you are um you know becoming a little bit worked up because of that and maybe just is Lost in Translation or you don't know the the set of stress that this person is on there right now maybe that be a little bit Kinder or and I always try to remind them of the human side of it and they'll every single time or 99.9 of the times go ah you're very right I'm sorry I won't do it again and they don't um and I think that's that's key and I'm very proud to say that in six years I've had to block maximum five people from our slack um everyone else gets it and I always also believe in second chances I'll also always believe in let's not do it again and but if you do I'm gonna have to block you because it's not the example that we have to that we want to set for our community yeah only a handful of times I've had to do it again and so it does work and people do realize that it is that it is human and that it is a a core of the community to treat each other with respect and to not become sour so I do think that if you treat people like people and not like Bots or not like Trolls but like people yeah then you give them the benefit of layout and most of them do come come around yeah I can believe that it's roughly been my experience you know there are a few bad actors in the world but most people are just not aware of the whole perspective of their actions right but they want to be they want to be good but this sounds very moral but they want the best for the community but maybe don't see all the angles for their behavior yeah yes exactly exactly and once you pointed out to them and they step back and they see it again this morning oh okay yeah I can see it and and maybe they're a bit more aware that the the next time so yeah I think it does work yeah yeah I can believe that that raises the question of like as a community manager let's say you're dealing with 30 000 people as you said would you actually involve I mean are you broadcasting to 30 000 people are you contacting individuals how do you Ali Murray interact with a large community yeah it depends on their strategy and on the um status of the strategy at that time because the strategy changes over time my strategy right now six years into Confluence is not the same one that a year in or then when I first started so it just depends on the strategy so my interactions uh change with that maturity of the of the strategy and that change of the strategy so at the very beginning it was way more one-on-one and I knew everyone and you know it was only I don't know 50 of us or 100 of us in the community and we all knew each other and I knew everyone and it was a matter of building that very core um group of people that would just then expand but right now with the 37 40 000 people in Drag and 200 000 people on meetups it just becomes um a completely different way of approaching so the way we do that is now with the different um groups uh that that really come down from their strategy for example one of the groups that we have are the influencers um which are the MVPs another group we have is the speakers another group we have is the hosts another group we have is the um um so we have Mbps and we have influencers there are two different ones so we do have these different groups of people that we interact with so that's what becomes uh my interactions become tied to those groups of people depending on where the strategy is at the moment and how big the community is because obviously I cannot be pretending to know 30 000 people or to talk to all of them um so the efforts are focused on those groups of people who are then going to influence the rest of the community right so your speakers they influence everyone else your influencers your MVPs your hosts they all influence everything everyone else so they become an extension of you so those are the people I interact with the most um but obviously sometimes it becomes the broadcasting messages because we want people to know about something so yeah we definitely broadcast something or we want to include someone in in one of the component everyone in one of the components that might be a game at Summit I don't know so then we include everyone and that becomes more uh like a broadcast message but um it's mostly depending uh and his waves there's there's times where you are talking to everyone and uh you know the strategy just points you that way and then there's times where it's more quiet and it allows you to more of the administrative work but um yeah that's basically did that answer your question yeah yeah yeah I'm just but it makes me wonder right so you have these MVPs ambassadors right I was talking to someone last week who said um what they really want for their Community was that wonderful viral effect when you get people that don't work for your company talking about your what you're doing and spreading it and I can see why a company wants that but there's also a risk of abusing that to make the MVPs and your community basically be free devrel how do you tread that fine line that's um I think is not as complicated as it might sound in my opinion I think that um you need to provide them with the value that that they want and everyone is driven by a different thing so I think it's a matter of learning what drives them what what makes them tick you know and uh and help them with that so help them achieve that so if one person from your influencers for example what really they really want this to become well known and to make sure that they are a good presence in the community then you work with them to help them be their face on a lot of talks become you know very important at the role of summits or things like that and and you help them um become more active in dislike channels by maybe making sure that you point topics to that that you know they are very good at to them and stuff like that so one of the things we do for example is we ask all of our MVPs what their experts on and uh what they what they want so what do you want from this so some of them they say oh I just want um to be recognized by my um skills some of them want to be recognized by their the way they present and the way they uh they speak some of them want to just build CV by naming there that they were MVPs fine yeah you know so depending on what drives them I think that's where you need to meet them I found more difficult to actually get the the help from them that I need rather than abuse them from from my side you know so like rather than just make sure that that they are not you know okay overwhelmed by overwhelmed by what I'm asking I think it's uh better to just make sure that um that they are comfortable and that they are not doing too much for us but um I found that is definitely more difficult to get them to do stuff for the company rather than the other way around um but yeah I think that's that's worked very well uh it's uh what what makes them makes them uh happy at the moment and it's different as well every year so we've had some Mbps for example that in what one year they they really want to work on their speaking skills and we help them be at many meetups and conferences and whatever and then maybe that same person next year becomes an Mbps again but what they want to do is to just be really into the the code or into the technology itself so then we make sure that they are more um they're tagged more on the slack conversations that include that those topics and stuff like that and I think that's the best way of getting the best from people to help them achieve what they want so again it's the same strategy at the individual level what you're doing is stopping thinking what you can get from them and how can you support the people are already doing actually quite useful stuff for the community how can you support them absolutely and I think that's the key to it it's just to know that they're not working for you no one is the community is not working for you you're working for them yeah yeah you could almost but you could have flipped the arrow from what a company would expect their building Community for yeah literally yeah yeah the the word that keeps coming to my mind is nurturing do you what kind of personality makes a good Community manager I think people that care about people uh and that that for standard people are people and they are not numbers you know phases to be sold to and someone that understands that and I think diplomacy is a big one definitely particularly to deal with uh the sour uh conversations on track and stuff like that it really definitely takes someone with um a diploma uh mindset to to talk to to people that are not in seeing the the things like you're seeing them um but I also think that definitely someone that's organized and that knows um you know that what they're doing because this is very chaotic it's a lot of things happen at the same time um and it's really difficult to keep track of that and it's really good to keep track of all the people that you're talking toward once so someone that's very organized next to needs to be that person so organized diplomatic and the most important one uh to care about people I I genuinely care about people I genuinely care when someone is successful with their projects it's like you know that yeah as well as well uh but before that it's just I genuinely care because I've seen their their um path and to to to get to there and it's just fascinating to be able to to see that and and to be part of that and in us in a certain way in a very small small way but it's just great to witness that yeah yeah I think that came across from the very first day I met you actually yeah that's great to hear I have to ask because you've you've done this entirely for technical technical communities right but I don't think I think I'm right and saying you don't really have any technical skills you don't have background in programming do you think that's held you back does it not matter so I think that a lot of the times when you're too immersed in the same topic it's like a relationship if my husband and I work at the same at the same uh you know company we either get along really well and which is really great or we get fed up with the conversation differently so I think it's that you really have to be very lucky to to find that person who who talks to you exactly your same language and just walk the path with you and I think it's the same with this is um I see things in a different way and in a different perspective I think that um having the technical knowledge would probably I know myself and in my own case I'm too much of a perfectionist and I will probably just focus a lot on the technical side part to be good and there's a lot of people in the community that already do that so the fact that I focus on the people being good and you know being well I think that has helped me a lot if if I don't if I take the technical eye out of it and just focus on the person behind it um I I'm able to do my job better and that's me not is not the same for everyone or for every Community manager a lot of people do prefer having a technical eye so they can which I totally respect they they can know what the best you know response is to a certain question and stuff like that um I I'm not technical so I I do rely a lot on the technical people that work next to me and I really like that I really like being able to connect those thoughts and being the bridge and I do feel like a bridge um I feel that a lot of the times when people um all think the same it's difficult to find that bridge that person that Bridges them and so I really like being that I think it hasn't helped me back yeah yeah I I think we there's definitely a reputation among programmers as not having those people skills first and maybe that is a large hole in the market where we need people like you early Maybe [Laughter] definitely you know one thing I wanted to ask you as well on top of this was um like if put it this way if you had to jump into a brand new community if you were looking for a new job as a community manager would you rather start with an existing Community or try and build one from scratch um that's a very good question because I think it also depends on where that existing Community is um I have seen um and I have friends in the community management industry as well I start from fully scratch and is great but some of them start with um on healthy Community or a community that has been you know not neglected or just not worked with in in the way that that I would like to do it so if that's the case I would definitely rather start from scratch and just being able to build something healthy from from the beginning I I do think it's both of them have their challenges I think it's very hard to try to steer something that's already going in that direction um I think that's very hard and I also think it's very hard to start something from nothing so uh both have their challenges um I think it depends on the strength of the challenge in each one yeah because it's it'll be very much easier to build something from scratch that is already like that is a very good topic and that's a very good technology versus something that's just not really that great of a technology or that is you know maybe an old topic and something like that um and the same for something excess that's already existing if if it's already existing and it's just starting and it's just going on the right direction it's much easier to just jump in and then just keep steering it than if it's something that started a few a couple of years ago and it's actually just going in a direction that you don't want it to steer it back um if I had to to choose I think I would probably rather do it from very early days so um I've really enjoyed doing it from early days in the places that I've worked at and I think that that allows you to build that Health in the community that I was talking about um with the setting the example of how you want people to talk um when something is already sour changing that is very more difficult yeah yeah plus I would have thought there's a risk that in that situation you're going to come in and look like an outsider yes exactly so trying to change the way things have always been done yes what's this person doing and yeah that's a little bit more difficult it is not impossible and a lot of people react very well to it but there's always a bigger risk in my opinion yeah it's funny as a programmer you face exactly the same shape of problem coming into a code base that's unfamiliar and like it's it's easier to go in and work with a code base that's already well refactored and neat and runs well than to try and correct the ship especially if there's a big team there that you're trying to think about programming in different ways of course it's funny it's exactly the same shape a problem that's true yeah absolutely and the same if you're gonna start from scratch it has its challenges because how do you even begin then once you start it's it becomes better but if you're gonna start with something that's already a bit broken then it's very kind of thick as well so yeah it's exact same exactly yeah it really is so that kind of leads into the uh and I'm afraid I'm not hiring but this is going to sound like a job interview at the moment um but when if hypothetically you were looking to get a new Community Job manager job or let's put it this way someone listening to you is thinking of becoming a community manager what are you going to be looking for in the existing Community as green or red flags what what conversation are you going to want to have with the management hiring you about their thoughts about community that's really interesting so that's the actually the first thing that I advise people to do when they start a community role is sit down with your management and Define what community is for them um because it's defined differently for everyone and I think agreeing on that very basic definition is the start the start to everything so total green a red flag for me is an opportunity to Market or monetizing the community for me some other community managers are very into that which I totally respect and it's a completely different approach it's just two different ways not one of them better than the other just two different ways for me I um they're not monetizing way um um secretly you think those other people are going to fail well not really but it's just not Community for me okay you're far too diplomatic to say that but um to me I think total red flag if if you are going to start in a company and you come and tell me hey Ali I'm going to become my community manager at this company but they really want me to show them how we how much money we're going to bring from the community in a year I would go I don't know I wouldn't advise you to get into that role because I think your life is going to be incredibly difficult because you cannot do to the two of them together in in a in a healthy way in my opinion either one of them is when I get hurt either the business side or the community side but one of them is gonna get hurt and you're gonna be in the middle of it so that would be really hard for me um I think another red flag would be if the community is as you say somewhere it is already unhealthy um and they they come to you and they say hey Chris this is your job now and you need to fix this it's uh just really bad at the moment I would really I mean a lot of them are very um possibly solvable but a lot of them are just doomed and I would just make sure that you're not getting into a dumb when um and that way to to know that is very easily just going in there and then just making sure if you if you would feel comfortable becoming into like coming into a community and as another Community member and just hanging out there would you feel comfortable would you feel accepted and welcomed and respected and if you're not I would really say this has maybe gone too far on this our side and it's just very difficult to steer that ship so that's another red flag and I think that's the the two main ones everything else I think it's very workable um it might be more difficult but it's workable but those two things are definitely no-nos to me yeah yeah I guess you've got to go into it with the mindset or if you're about to spend the next few years of your working life in this community how does that sound exactly exactly and a few years ago I actually got approached by uh by a Joe job that uh I looked into and it was a very very nice job and um uh I just looked into their community and I thought I don't want to be working with these people all the time it's just definitely not what I want to do in you know my everyday life to yeah to literally deal with fires all the time I'm not going to ask you which company but what sector was it no I can't you're not even gonna say the secret okay fair enough okay so then in that case to wrap this up um I've got a sense of what some of your answers are going to be roughly on this but at the end of the day what do you personally get from it um so I get I get the feeling of being able to help people who are able to change the world so I I'm not capable of doing that myself I love being able to work with such smart people that I can help them find an environment that will help them change the world and I think that's great I love that but I also I really enjoy it I love people and I love being able to just be that bridge I love it and it's a personality type so I get a lot of satisfaction from that um I am also really attached to the communities that I've built and I see them as my babies and I still you know go into the previous communities I worked into and just see how they are and if they're thriving I really feel amazing about it I'm like ah I wish I could do something about it I they're my babies so I love it and I really get very attached to it so everything that has to do with that is is what I get from it so that satisfaction of it thriving and that satisfaction of uh people being able to find each other in there and being that bridge I really like it it's just it's just great for me that is a beautiful note to end on and may I say that we're very lucky to have people like you in our Tech communities building those bridges thank you Chris I really appreciate that and likewise we're very lovable and amplifying all the messages well on that wonderful note Ali Murray thank you very much for joining us thank you Chris I really appreciate you uh hi Ali thank you very much there's a lot to think about there regardless of what kind or size of project you're working on whether it's a small open source thing or a company that's trying to grow you need to understand your community and serve them to help it grow it's actually something I need to start thinking about myself this podcast because it's all about listening to the people who are trying to move the industry forward talking to them in due course it would be nice to have a place where we can all have that conversation together and when that moment arrives I'll come looking for you I'll find you not in a Liam Neeson way I will find you in an Ali Murray way I promise in the meantime please don't make yourself hard to find if you want to get in touch for any reason my contact details are in the show notes as always let me know what topics you'd find most valuable to hear about I am currently researching new guests so that will help feed into the pipeline I look forward to hearing from you and until then and until next time I've been your host Chris Jenkins this has been developer voices with Ali Murray thanks for listening foreign
