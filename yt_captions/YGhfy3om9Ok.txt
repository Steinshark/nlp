in my hand is the single scariest GPU in the world this Chinese GPU is so threatening that it's got Biden flying around the world begging semiconductor manufacturers to stop working with China why well because it's completely homegrown from the Shroud to the sand that makes the Silicon this is a Chinese product and it took only two years to create more threads has been extremely secretive about its development but now that it's out of their Testing Lab there's nothing to stop it from spreading around the world into my hands allow me to introduce them the brand new fourth player in the dedicated GPU space but then if you consider that a behemoth company like Intel has had such a rocky road to bringing a GPU to Market how could this unproven Underdog possibly hope to compete with the likes of Nvidia and AMD they're gonna have to be fierce almost as Fierce as this Segway to our sponsor build Redux looking to level up your game experience build Redux is here to help they'll create a custom gaming PC that is tailored to the specs you set out while offering competitive pricing compared to building your own follow the link below and start building your dream gaming rig today more threads first showed up on our radar in 2021 and since then they've gone from fledgling startup to raising a total of half a billion US Dollars and no fewer than five skus listed on their website absolutely Wild but also not as unexpected as you might initially think you see they're helmed by James Zhang who previously was VP and general manager of nvidia's Chinese Division and they're funded by you guessed it the CCP so when we learned that they had finally launched their first gaming GPU we had to get one except we couldn't unsurprisingly as members of the western media War threads was completely uninterested in returning our calls and the first wave of gpus that they released to customers were only available for those who managed to get their hands on a purchase code through a lottery system kind of one plus style thankfully we were able to find one such individual who was willing to send us the GPU to take a look at thanks pal okay the script just says unbox is there anything interesting ah well this is interesting rather than use a standard pcie power connector more threads has an adapter that appears to go from Dual pcie E8 pin to eight pin EPS which is the connector that you would normally use for a motherboard not for a GPU this is something we've seen before on server gpus but not really on gaming ones whether it's due to the aluminum shroud or the relatively wide spacing of the heatsink fins it feels kind of light compared to a modern top tier card like a 7900 XTX it's rated for 255 Watts total board power though so depending on the performance per watt it could end up within spitting distance in games that 255 watt TDP could also help explain our 8-pin CPU connector this guy is rated at 300 watts compared to the 150 watts of an 8-pin pcie connector though there are other strategies for that like putting dual pcie 8 pins on it the more likely possibility is that this is pretty much the same thing as their new server GPU the MTT s3000 that happens to have the same number of compute cores clocked slightly higher and twice as much RAM just with a gaming oriented shroud on it in servers pcie based cards like nvidia's Tesla now known as data center gpus commonly use EPS power connectors for a couple of reasons first and foremost it's faster to plug in one cable than two and also because the EPS 12 volt connector was established by SSI or the server system infrastructure Forum way back before pcie power connectors even existed and it's just kind of never really gone away what makes this gaming then honestly not much it's got a triple fan shroud compared to the blower style that you would normally find in server or workstation cards and ample display outputs this is three DisplayPort 1.4s and an HDMI 2.1 making it extremely modern and that's not the only way it's modern this is the first GPU with a pcie Gen 5 by 16 interface that's right they beat Nvidia AMD and Intel to the punch it's got 16 gigs of gddr6 memory 4096 Musa compute cores clocked at 1.8 gigahertz giving it 14.4 teraflops of fp32 compute power so maybe not trading blows with the 7900 XTX that would put it between an RTX 3060 and a 3060 TI in terms of raw performance which is sort of disappointing I mean I thought this thing was supposed to be scary right adding to its modernness it supports vp9 h.264 h.265 and apparently av1 encoding and that 16 gigs of memory is connected over a 256-bit memory bus giving it about the same maximum memory bandwidth as a 3060 TI though with twice the amount of ram which again could be lie its server Heritage the GPU at its heart is apparently based on their chunchow architecture Andy's not here to help me with the pronunciation though so that could be way off feels so naughty as a member of the hated Western media I'm not supposed to be playing with this thing at least not yet oh it does have RGB pretty oh right and of course as well kind of like nvidia's tensor cores though exactly what we can do with them we're not sure yet these Chinese gpus are making me thirsty it was a good time lttstore.com that's it it's up I don't know why but I expected this to require a little bit more faffing about well there was some minor faffage before you came here I don't know why I'm so surprised I mean obviously if it didn't display a Windows desktop they wouldn't ship the thing you'd think right but but it just works 120 hertz it only actually supports 17 motherboards total they actually only sell it in a bundle because they're so worried about people buying the card and then not being able to run it so we tried it in other boards and it just it's not a validation thing it just doesn't it doesn't appear so we were very thankful that we had one in stock of the ones that they supported does it support HDR it does not appear to be any HDR support it's not in English I think I can infer a lot of this though GPU clock GPU usage GPU temperature it's quiet ish man I just immediately want to go off-road Okay I lied I went over doing OBS what's aom av1 I've only got SVT av1 and aom av1 well I've got x264 but that's CPU so I do I guess typically it would show like Nvidia and bank or something yeah a node or Intel AV one well here we'll see if the usage goes up okay well the encoder's there but it's not supported at least by OBS at this time this might actually have um screen cap in it I know it has overlays that's controlled a I saw a yellow thing flash up I wonder if that was screen recording okay well we know what that is that's gaming overlay or whatever screenshot oh so we just hold it down it's basically a screen cap okay so let's get into a game what game do you want to play I want to play League of Legends really you do well I just assume that this is going to be a beast for League of Legends because that's like the most popular game in China yeah do you want to try anything more modern like try the Tomb Raider is a good place to start everything runs on Shadow of the Tomb Raider sure it's good we don't have to do Eternal because really oh shut up [Music] shut up no support for DirectX 12. my resolution drop down has very few options uh I guess we'll go with 4K I wonder if their scalar sucks and my monitor refresh rate options are super weird 24 okay 30 yeah 60. sure thing 82. what are these refresh rates see it it can barely even render this box my first more threads gaming experience oh this is okay I can tell from your face this is as far as it goes isn't it yeah oh it's completely locked up here's the situation aside from supporting only 17 motherboards it also only supports DirectX 9 games with some DirectX 11 games and this is in large part thanks to its lack of tessellation support I mean it booted really fast they actually just added 23 more games the back to my initial Instinct then can we fire up League of Legends yes oh my God there's an update well you're doing that we'll compare it to this other system we have oh right there's a second system here I assume that has a like RTX 3060 in it that would be the spec for spec it's a 1660. oh it's price comparable though okay well that gives me a different set of expectations with respect to Performance but then already it didn't run the first game we try to run look at all the things in this stupid dashboard that are not play the game start your Legend is not it play league is not it the game is temporarily unavailable okay am I an idiot or I actually I don't know either I don't know how to get this to open play DotA the superior MOBA okay control all X no windows keys not working control alt delete hey there we go how dare you it is totally control altx okay oh antique sheets I mean it's smooth I really wish I had an FPS counter right now but it's working it's at medium okay I'm setting it to very high still working still smooth how's your experience great actually I'm getting over a hundred frames per second boys at 4K everything maxed out I don't think it's that hard to run it's gonna get Dead River Press F but that'll want to pay respects no it heals you I think look I don't play this game all right so there's things called creeps there's like I know how the game fundamentally works there's more than one enemy hero that I have to fight it's stupid Team game not only is this running but it's been Rock Solid I don't see any graphical anomalies and it's actually really quiet all right time for some Counter-Strike what are your settings just go through make sure they're the same The Game just crashed so cool and maybe you should get a more more threads GPU you'd have more luck interesting fact that I learned is that the Bots are controlled by the GPU so having Bots actually affects your GPU results I thought they were CPU maybe that's why they're so dumb I get killed by Bots a lot in CS go all right you're playing kind of terrorist oh this is not good that says 30 FPS but these frame times are extremely inconsistent yeah it's pretty smooth for me I'm between like 160 to 200. okay try looking at the ground there you go look at all those frames dang it I have to imagine that it's probably not designed with 4K in mind with that said if you have 16 gigs of vram and a high performance GPU it's not a big stretch to say oh well it performs well it's 1080p it should also perform well 4K I'm gonna try switching to 1080. wait I can't remember my resolution drop down was borked and other stuff well I brought another monitor out for you oh my god really okay well let's at least set it oh and I can't even set it above 60. wait why can't it go above 60. this monitor can almost certainly do at least 120 over HDMI yeah let's try DP you nuked it monitor's doing stuff it it's it's it's having to think yay there we go it's not a good sign for your product that we're excited that it turns on at all 120 FPS on a two-dimensional splash screen the smoothness of the frame delivery is better what I suspect is that they basically just didn't test it at 4K at all this is a smooth 50 FPS whereas that was a dog crap 2530. the rough performance of this GPU kind of sits around the GT 1030 which is a 30 watt card this card pulls about 250 Watts GT 1030 is also 80 dollars more threads more like less frames there it is I got 300 FPS for a second there wow I'm at 90 right now in the tunnel yeah so it's the Bots interesting the hard part about making a CPU is that you're trying to make Hardware that can do everything the hard part about making a GPU you're trying to make Hardware that matches these already established standards so you know what your Hardware is going to do but getting it to cooperate very challenging I was getting like 400 frames per second in the tutorial for a second there then this guy shows up I dropped down to 130. I was so happy with my 3 to 400 FPS he's getting a thousand okay what what settings are you running at what settings are you running at okay I'm at very high oh let me let me set that I still at a thousand once again I'm at an eighth of a performance with double the power consumption it runs the game I mean that's improv it's better than I could do Team Fortress 2 let's go I want to see if it glitches that's all I need to know used to be so good I instead of going downhill for me when they started having different weapons yeah it was flawlessly balanced there was some pretty bad balancing especially at the start and I think that you're a fanboy I'm not a fanboy it's actually legitimately so fair and it's because of the size of the teams that allows for like kind of offside battles as well as like the sheer variety of weapon combinations makes it so that there's not very little poem about it dude I probably have already it's obviously not getting the kind of performance that I would get out of a base tier Nvidia GPU but I'm anywhere from 70 to 100 FPS even in a firefight look now when we tried games that were not on the supported list was it just universally not compatible like factorio is that supported nope oh but you get a lot of these they're making driver checks and calls at the start yeah and they'll just be like nope so it's fairly crap then yeah it's basically garbage I mean I couldn't build one but then I haven't likely stolen a bunch of Ip from Nvidia it took them two years to make a GPU and you three years to make a screwdriver yeah thanks for that Adam that's really helpful oh here we go wow interesting they went and they created a custom connector here so that they can carry all of these pwm signals and 12 volt power to the fans separately this 8-pin EPS power connector passes through to a 4 pin does it even actually draw 250 Watts or whatever it's reading you saw it drawing 250. oh but they're actually doing it through a 4 pin plus the 75 Watts from the slot uh okay all the vrms are along the top edge of the board I don't think I've ever seen that before this is a little like grounding tab for the cooler Samsung memory chips I mean they're labeled Samsung it's definitely a more threads die though curious product on the one hand it supports the latest standards but on the other hand it barely works you know if you were wondering if there's any Merit to it outside of gaming unfortunately we weren't able to test AI maybe that's part of their play since right now China's having a hard time getting their hands on powerful AI accelerators but if the AI performance is anything like productivity performance let's just say the lack of a seven day no questions asked return policy is not a big surprise to us so why is it bad unlike CPUs there are very few options for open or licensable GPU architectures the biggest players all like to keep their secret sauce firmly in their Satchel meaning that more threads had to design their architecture from the ground up or well I mean they probably didn't even if you possess considerable knowledge and funding making your own architecture iterating on that putting it into a board and shipping it could easily take 10 years let alone too and this is just their first consumer GPU more threads have already released several Enterprise gpus meaning something is amiss here and that's where we got to kind of pull the sheets off of China's big secret this isn't quite a fully Chinese GPU Korean Tech Channel bull Labs did some digging and noticed that the company actually licensed IP from imagination Technologies the company that owns the power VR architecture you might have heard from them from when they helped make gpus for Apple in the days of the early iPhones and iPads now lots of companies license IP from others I mean all of Apple's impressive m-series chips are based on arm but they also don't claim to be all American chips except technically imagination Technologies is owned by Canyon Bridge Capital Partners who are in turn funded by the Chinese central government making this well technically a Chinese GPU now China understands the disadvantages of needing to lean on the rest of the world for their chips that's why the Chinese government announced they were investing 1.4 trillion dollars into Tech in 2020 making Biden's governments 53 billion dollar chips act look like walking around money and while more threads is the most prominent player that we've seen at least over here in the west China's not putting all their eggs in one basket and actually has numerous GPU projects and companies on the go so then does this mean we're going to see rip and fast Chinese gpus in just a couple more years probably not I mean first off tensions between China and the US are pretty high right now we've seen the Huawei ban a potential Tick-Tock ban and Joey B cracking down on Chinese access to Western designed gpus from the likes of Nvidia not to mention important semiconductor IP so there is a chance that these gpus may actually never end up being sold in North America though that could be a bit of an advantage for them because it would mean that there was that big leak of Nvidia IP a little while back they could utilize some of the things they found without worrying about any kind of import restrictions on top of that the Chinese government seems more interested in limiting gaming performance than investing in gaming Hardware so it's likely that this is more of an AI play than a gaming Play Nothing is for certain though right now except that this card totally sucks and even if you have access to it you shouldn't buy it and that I have this message to tell you about from our sponsor xsplit xsplit is a Cutting Edge software company
