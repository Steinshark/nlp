hello everyone and welcome this video we're going to be talking about variable valve lift and variable valve timing and to help explain this we have Charles mr. Hubbell Mocambo who brought some VW parts some outtie parts to help swing this so what is in front of me right now so these are camshafts and a cam bridge out of an own Einaudi a four this is almost the exact same setup that you'll find in the 15 and up mark 7 GT is we have our exhaust cam with variable valve lift and we have our intake cam with variable valve timing sweet so yeah as you mentioned we've got our intake right here intake cam exhaust cam and the basics we're going to start here with the variable valve lift which is on the exhaust side and basically what you're doing you have two different cam profiles so you have this higher cam profile and then you have a little bit lower of a cam profile and you have an individual system for each cylinder so you can move this back and forth it's on a spline so you can move that and each individual cylinder has its own control and so Charles can you kind of explain the details of how this system actually moves back and forth to change that cam profile right so like Jason said these are essentially sleeves that are spline to the camshaft we have two solenoids that will control this sleeve one solenoid will pull it one way the other solenoid will pull it the other way when the solenoid is activated the pintle will come down and ride in this channel and it'll actually slide that sleeve over to change the profile of the camshaft that the rocker is riding on so if we are riding on our high lift this solenoid will activate it'll pull it over and that will allow us to ride on our low lift when we're ready to go back to high lift this solenoid will activate pulling in the other way and allowing us to ride on the high lift profile of our cam and of course this will have two valves per cylinder so you'll have a rocker here as well as a rocker here this is a pretty narrow rocker to be able to ride on both of those profiles and so kind of interesting thing about this is that it's on the exhaust side and not intake side you have one and profile here on the intake side on the exhaust the reason for this this is a turbocharged engine and so you've got pressure pushing in air it's fairly easy to get that intake charge but it's then difficult to get all that air all that exhaust out and so once you get into the higher rpm at higher loads and you're burning all this air and fuel you want to open these exhaust valves a little bit more so it's easier to get that air out and you can create more power less losses more power so that's kind of the beauty of this VBL system right this also improve throttle response a little bit and makes for a pretty fun car yeah it's pretty sweet now just because this engine doesn't have this on the intake side doesn't mean you couldn't do that you could have two different cam profiles and use a very similar system on the intake side and you'd get that benefit of getting in more air once you're at higher rpm higher loads so you can make more power and you can also change the duration with the two cam lobes so you were saying you notice you know these are it's not just lift we're not just great opening the valve more we're also opening it sooner and we're actually closing it a little bit before we would on the low lift okay but not very much so the duration is actually longer as well okay so much more time and lift for all that air to get out for efficiency and you know not not losing all that power getting too much pressure going out your exhaust so very cool yeah and that's all ECM controlled so the engine computer is going to do that based on the scenario the vehicle is in it in a lot of ways knows better than most of us on what it wants from the engine definitely me definitely better than me yeah I just poked at computer in try beep yeah so moving along to the intake side this as you can see just a single cam profile and what we have here is our variable valve timing and so if I hold this stationary and you can see the chain won't move and we can advance it or pull timing back and the timing so as you can see on intake there is only one cam profile and so all we're doing is let's say you know you have your cam profile open close you're just shifting when it opens and closes back and forth and that's all you're doing the cam files remaining exactly the same so we're going to talk about why you would want to shift when the intake valve opens and closes but first let's take a look inside and see how this works so the variable valve timing is all based on oil pressure when the profile wants to change one way the well will fill up here and shift this way if it needs to shift the other way there's another port and it will shift this way and then when it wants to bleed down the pressure there's actually a release or relief hole right down here at the bottom then this oil will fall down the timing chain side and it'll reset back to zero cool so all you're doing I mean you've got this little you know complicated chamber that's sending out oil and all you're doing is filling either one side with oil or the other side well they both have a port and then you can drain it out the back there that's it it's all controlled there's actually on the timing cover which goes in front of this there's a solenoid that goes there this is a spool valve like you said that has different chambers and ways to pass oil through this there's actually another part to it right here that you guys don't need to know about so as you know you know probably worth mentioning that when you're thinking about this this gear is remaining stationary I mean obviously it's spinning right but the cam is rotating in relation to it the actual shaft is rotating not the cam gear so this is more what it would look like if you could get in there and see it in action so now we're going to talk about why you want to do this why you want to change the valve timing and so we're going to start with the example of a late intake valve closing so we're closing our intake valve later than usual so why would you do this well when you do that that means your cylinder is going to be starting to go back up to compress that air and your intake valve is still going to be open so you're going to push some of that air fuel mixture back out into the intake manifold now there are some pumping losses associated with that where you're going to reduce those pumping losses because you're now charging your intake manifold but really the main thing you're doing here is you're controlling how much air and fuel you have in that combustion chamber and in doing so how much combustion you're going to have how much you know power you're going to make and so you can reduce the temperature of that cylinder by using less air and fuel and so by reducing that temperature you're going to have NOx emissions so the common theme of all these different scenarios of kind of choosing do you open the intake valve earlier late or the exhaust valve you you know you closed it late or early the common theme with all of these is going to have to relate to emissions right that's how that's how we look at it is and it's mostly done by controlling temperature and therefore controlling Analects emissions so Jason why would you close the intake valve early well Charles let me tell you why the intake valve early this really has to do with situations where you're basically just idling or it's super low load so what's happening when you're just sitting there idling is you really don't need much air fuel to keep this engine idling and so you'll close that intake valve early and effectively what you're doing is reducing the amount of pumping losses you have because that piston is trying to pull in air and fuel you get enough you have enough for what you need to just idle the engine and then you close that intake valve early it continues to go down and you're no longer pulling on that vacuum and then you would have more pumping losses so from an efficiency standpoint it's just a smart thing to do when you're sitting there idling to close intake valves early so Jason why would you open the intake valve early well Charles let me tell you why you open the intake valve early so this means you're on your exhaust stroke so you're pushing out that exhaust gas and now you're opening that intake valve so what you're doing is you're pushing some of that inert gas that exhaust back into your intake manifold and this is kind of similar to the principle of like EGR why you would use an EGR system so that inert gas is in there that comes in you're controlling the temperature of combustion chamber once again to reduce NOx emission it's all about the NO x all about the NO x yep so Jason why'd you change the time and you closed your exhaust valve well Charles let me tell you about closing exhaust valve so the important thing here once again comes back to NOx emissions so if you close the exhaust valve early what you're doing is trapping some of that exhaust that ignore gas in the combustion chamber and then when your intake stroke occurs you still have some of that inert gas in there and thus you know you're going to have lower combustion temperatures and lower NOx emissions the other side if you want to close it later of course you can get all of that exhaust out of there so that you can fill it completely with fresh air and fuel and get more power now obviously you don't want to open the exhaust valve early that's during your combustion stroke as you can just be sending power out your exhaust and shooting flames which would be cool but you wouldn't it appeals it is the peak of inefficiency and that's where like combining these two together really get interesting with lift and timing because you can control way down way way down and what you're trying to get under your engine super down out of your engine well thank you all for watching and Charles thank you once again for
