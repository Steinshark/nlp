- Are you going to just film
us for the next hour as we die? - Mmmmmm! - [Matt] Fifty more
seconds for the next one. - We're done! We're done! - Post it Matt! - Hey guys, this is Austin! And today, well today we are about to make some mistakes, aren't we Jake? - We are. This whole thing was a mistake. - I regret it already because today we're not only going to be
building a gaming PC together, but we are going to be eating
hot wings at the same time. Not just any hot wings, this
is some Hot Ones (beep). - [Ken] What?! - [Matt] We can't actually afford... - I mean is that copyrighted? - Every five minutes you're going to have a hotter wing, and then a hotter wing. - So because we're professionals, we'll have the entire
PC built in ten minutes and it won't be a problem, right Jake? - Yeah, got this. We, yeah. - You don't even sound confident! - Just so you know, the
clock starts right now. - So just to... I know the clock started, Matt. - It's fine, we're not in a rush. - However, my goal is to never
drink any of those things. - [Austin] Okay. - And also, I do want to,
out of morbid curiosity, try the hottest one. - Well, let's not do it on purpose. Let's win and then we'll
- Oh yeah, we want to win. try it in victory, all right.
- We're gonna win. - I'm also terrible with spicy things. - Okay, well cheers. This is three hundred Scovilles. - This is so wet. - This is very wet. - You know, it's fine. - It's like lemon pepper. - Yeah. - This is fine. This is not spicy Matt. - [Matt] Well that one is banana pepper. - [Austin] Banana pepper? - Mmm, yeah I get hints of banana pepper. - It's nice. - [Matt] Just for the record, you have another wing in three minutes. - Okay we should start with the case, I wanted to pretend it was heavy but it's not cause I'm so strong. - I mean obviously. - How's that camera angle
doing, probably not great. - Great. - Oh, you're doing it. Do you need help? Nope, you did it! - Yeah! - Austin did it guys, he did it guys. - This might not be a good sign, my lips are actually a
little bit spicy right now. - Really? - Just a tiny bit. - Well, you know what might help? If you rub that spiciness
off on like Ken's lips. - [Ken] No. - (laughs) - Ken, take one for the team! (lips smacking) (whip cracking) - [Austin] What's this one? - [Jake] It's 1500, so that's 1500 hotter. - [Austin] I can't wait. - Mmm. - Okay that's not so bad. - This one, I'd say, is
comparable to the first. - Mmm, I'm getting a little
more spice on this one. A little bit more. All right, X570 AORUS Master, pretty high board, we are
taking advantage of Ryzen, which I have it right here, pre-opened because I thought ahead. So this is the Ryzen-- - Is it because you thought ahead? Or is it because it's
from a previous build? Out of curiosity, I
have no prior knowledge. - Are you trying to insinuate that I have recycled some parts from some previous project
for some nefarious reason? How dare you? - But no I think this is gonna be a really great PlayStation. As one might say. Tell me more about this
board and this processor. - So if you watched our
building the PS5 video you might recognize some of these things that I am shamelessly recycling. - Cause I'm a super fan. - So this the Ryzen 7 3700X.
- Smash that like button. - I'll let you just
install that, go ahead, I'll let you do the honors on that one. - Ah, thank you. And then I push this down, until it snaps. - There we go. - Boom. - Perfect. - Seated, that's what we
call it in the tech biz, is seated, right? - That is, that is true. - [Ken] Yeah. - So I'm just gonna put our RAM in. Would you like to do the
thermal paste application? - Oh yeah okay, do we
like doing like the rice? - I want you to make a giant X on it and make as much thermal
paste as possible, - (laughing) - Nah I'm kidding, yes a grain of rice is
exactly the way to do it. - Grain of rice. Oh, it's like a long grain. Ah! It's art. - It'll be extra cool it's fine. - It's a Jackson Pollock. (whip cracking) - [Matt] So here is
your next set of wings. - [Austin] 17,000? - [Matt] 17,000. - How's it smell? - Ooh, yeah, that's nice. - That's a little spicier. - I like it. - Cheers my friend. - Aw, cheers buddy. - That's really wet. - Not bad. (intensifying music note) - These are actually pretty
tasty wings, good job Matt. Ooh. - You make great wings Matt. - There's a little spice
to that one though, ooh. - Is this when I find out
that you're whiter than I am? - That's not possible. - (laughs) - Next, let's actually, let's start putting stuff in the case. - Okay! - Oh wait no I lied. - Ah, so close. - We need our SSD. - Oh yes I've heard
this is a very fast SSD. - It is. So it's a PCI Gen 4 two terabyte SSD, so it's another AORUS product. But essentially, actually
it can go right here. - Oh right there. - It's a two terabyte SSD, you
can put everything on that. - Oh it's two terabytes? I was not listening when that happened. - Yes. - Did you say that earlier? - I did. - Where am I, did I blackout? - Two terabytes. - The cool thing is though
we still have tons of-- - I have like Vietnam footage. (guns popping) (explosions) - Okay, end scene. Keep going. - Anyway, so tons of storage, with that we can actually start
mounting this into our case. - Oh this is so nice the
standoff is already there. - Standoff's already in. - Did you prep this? - No this is actually
the way the case came. - Oh really? - Yes, another thing is the IO shield is already attached to the motherboard, again it's built in. - Really, you didn't do this? - I didn't touch it! Look it's literally like screwed in. - I mean it's literally been three years since I've built a computer, is this how far its come? - When it comes to higher-end systems, yeah that's actually
starting to become a thing. - Oh I like how you kinda threw in there that I didn't build high-end systems when I was building computers. In the higher end system
game, the WiFi comes built into the motherboard. (whip cracking) - [Austin] Is that 30,000? - [Matt] 30,000 Scovilles. - I can do that. Look at us, teamwork. - Makes the (burps) dream work. - Wow, that's quite impressive. Jake we haven't been this close
since you cut my head off. - (laughs) I just want no more
context, than just that. - I mean you can check
out the new episode-- - When I circumcised him, what? - See I was just gonna
give you a shout out, we can't use that anymore. You just ruined the shout-out. - [Jake] You said the the S-word earlier. I can't say circumcised,
it's a medical procedure. - Already? We didn't even get anything done. - I screwed in something. - [Matt] Number 5. (whip cracking) 50,000. - [Jake] Dip it a little more so you get a little
bit more of that flava. - You want to go to Flavortown Austin? I gotta one way ticket baby. - I want nothing to do
with Flavortown at all. - Ooh, that's fine. More vinegary. - It's very vinegary, ooh,
it's a little spicy though. I'm definitely tasting
the spice in that one. Ooh! - [Jake] Okay another screw is in, this is, we should, are
you, what are you doing? What did you do? What did he do? Kenjamin! (yelling) What did he do? - That's some very warm milk. (laughs) Okay, so you're gonna do graphics card. - Oh heck yeah. - Okay, sweet. - And this is the 1060. - Super! - 2060, Super, 2060 Super. Which is great for 1440p gaming. It has 8 gigs of RAM, seven,
whatever name they have for their ray tracing cores, or is it six? Six, might be six. - Six ray tracing cores? - I think it has 6 ray tracing cores. - I think its like hundreds
of ray tracing cores. - Well they call them six. - [Matt] It's at least six. - Let me read the back of the box. - Wait no put the thing in! - No, no I'm reading the back of the box, cause now you've questioned me. - [Austin] What is that? (whip cracking) - Whoa! Did you say 250,000? (groans) - All right let's
just get this over with. Cheers. - Oh, cheers. - Uhuh. It's actually delicious, but uhuh. Oh, I hate how it's going down. - Before coming here I shaved
right there a little bit, so it's a little irritated and I got some of the hot sauce in my little shaved spot, but besides that it was fun. Okay, you feeling good? Feeling good?! - Nope, nope. - Are you pumped? - Okay let's go. - But I need to find out
how many cores this has. - No you don't! Just put the thing in. - Oh, they vacuum sealed this
is gonna take a little bit. - Oh, the spicy is kicking
in, the spice is kicking in. I am not happy right now. - Oh good, there's a graphics
card guide, this will tell me. - I'm just gonna start cabling it. - This will tell me how many cores. - Wait, wait, god (beep). You have to plug in all
my modular connectors and I screwed it in. (groans) - Unfortunately this doesn't tell you, here let me just briefly look
up on my Galaxy Note 10+. - Jake. - How many-- - I'm gonna delete your channel. - So, the 2060 Super offers six gigarays, NVIDIA's term for counting
ray tracing speed, so when I said six, I
seem to have been correct. So there you go, six gigarays guys. - So you get to eat my next wing. - No I don't think that's how it works. - [Matt] It sounds like
you eat his next wing, cause he got it right. - That's not true, he said cores, that's like saying like my
four-core processor is-- - [Matt] He was vague
enough that he was right. - How dare you Matt? - And that's how you make science videos, you're vague enough until you're right. Okay let me put this in. - I'm gonna unsubscribe
and delete your channel. (whip cracking) - [Matt] So here is number seven. - [Jake] Oh 600k! - [Matt] A whopping 600k. All right cheers. - Cheers buddy. Oh I guess I won't throw
that away just yet. - Oh! Oh, that's not good. Ah, I got sauce on my lips. If I do it like this, I
have to use my tongue. - [Jake] So back to the CPU,
it is getting pretty spicy. I'm gonna be honest. Now it's hitting me. - Yeah. - Okay! Here we go. - Why did we do this? Ah! - Put it in! (exhaling) Okay. (both mumbling) - Do you have it? - Just no, I don't have
it, gimme, gimme gimme. - Take it, take it, take it. (laughs) - It's not funny anymore
just give it to me. - I'm giving it to you man! - We're touching fingers now. You're pushing it too far in. - Oh, look at that, there
a hole there. (laughs) (whip cracking) - [Austin] Matt, no. - [Jake] Ah, one million. - [Austin] We got nothing done. - I pulled some cables through. - Okay here we go. Ah, this sucks, that's bad. - (loudly coughs and groans) (yelling) All right here we go. Ah, you didn't even put the
CPU plug in yet you pathetic (laughing) you're not pathetic. - [Austin] I just blew my
nose into the same thing I used to wipe my hands. (Jake groaning) - That was a bad idea, oh god. (sniffles) I got it in my nose. - Okay I'll do it. - Here, lay down, lay down, lay down. - No, okay. (grunting) Ah! Ah! Put it in! - Okay, USB3, going in. Can you plug it in the power supply? (heavily breathing) - Get the other one in. Ah (beep). Oh fudge come on. Come on you (beep) 'ccini
Alfredo, get in there. Oh I got it! - Yes! - (groaning) - All right, don't celebrate,
where's the, yeah yeah. Where's the, screwdriver? - I don't know man you we're using it. [Jake] Matt, no! - [Austin] 1.4 million, how
did we get to 1.4 million? How'd we get to number nine? Here I'm dropping off for you, here go, - Oh, that's for me thank you so much. How is it? - [Matt] So while you guys scream, - Oh it's terrible. - [Matt] This is a-- - What the (beep), Matt? - [Matt] This is a Trinidad
Butch T Scorpion Pepper. - Trinidad, (beep) you Trinidad! - This is the worst thing
I've ever done for a video, I'm not playing right now. - [Matt] I'm going to remind
you that you set these rules. - All right we're almost done. - We got it. (groans in pain) (heavy breathing) - Here it needs to post,
Jake, it just needs to post, and we're done. (coughing) - [Austin] Here, take it. - Oh, it's even worse when I comes up, I don't need your bucket! - What is the time, Matt? I will murder you! What is the time?! - [Matt] Twenty seconds. - Oh! - It's okay, it's okay,
gimme a screwdriver, gimme a screwdriver. Screwdriver! Screwdriver! (Jake groans) - I'll jump it, I'll
jump it, I'll jump it, Yes! Yes! - [Jake] Is it posting? - So this doesn't look very cable managed. - [Austin] How dare you? - We got some loose
cable hanging out here. The case, the sides aren't on. I don't see anything on the screen. - [Austin] Give it a second,
it's fine, it's still posting. (whip cracking) - [Matt] So unfortunately,
it did not post in time. - [Austin] It's posting! - (burping) Rules are rules. - Ah! Oh! Oh! It's posting, it posted! - [Matt] Cool, if only you had done that roughly fifteen-seconds ago. - He's fair, he's true, he's right. - So if we eat it, we win. - [Jake] Cheers, buddy. - [Austin] No, no, no, dab
it off as much as possible, it's not cheating. It's the way the rules
were meant to be written. - [Ken] That's not what
they mean by "The Last Dab". - [Jake] (laughs) Cheers. Where's our bucket? - [Matt] I would get on that because in another minute-and-a-half, you're going to have to have another one. Clean it! - Bucket is over here. - I'm never doing this again. Give me the milk. - I mean that's pretty clean, right? - [Matt] That looks great! Jake's good at this. - Should I spit my spit out? (exhales) - (mumbling) - I don't know what to do with my hands. - It's like a waterfall,
no not on the computer. 'Sup ladies? You wanna go out with me? - Okay Jake, you take this computer home. (all laughing) - No! Ah! Thank you so much! - (burping) - Subscribe to Austin Evans,
