there's a good chance that at some point you're going to need to buy an SD card but there are so many confusingly different options that pop up if you just go and search for one on Amazon how do you know which one to pick SD cards are different from each other and only three important ways the physical size of the card the data capacity and the speed let's start out by talking about the different sizes standard SD mini SD and MicroSD standard SD was the original SD card and it's still quite common in cameras while you often see MicroSD and smaller portable devices such as the Nintendo switch and the smattering of smartphones that actually allow you to expand their storage the good news is that you don't really have to worry about mini SD anymore as that was a tweener size that virtually no newly manufactured devices are using it's not awkward in between phase you know it's kind of stinky these two sizes offer similar speeds and capacity so just make sure whichever one you buy will actually fit into your device but if you want to write protect your card to make sure nothing is accidentally overwritten or erased you can only do that on a standard sized SD although you can get the same effect on MicroSD by using one of these handy little adapters now let's take a look at storage capacity which is a little more complicated the modern SD spec can theoretically hold up to 128 terabytes on one card wow but in reality it's currently difficult to find anything above one terabyte the only other thing you need to remember about capacities is to look for these symbols an SD symbol without anything appended to it means you're looking at an older style card that can only hold up to two gigabytes SDHC which stands for high capacity will give you up to 32 gigabytes XC or extended capacity up to two terabytes again in theory and UC or Ultra capacity will let you reach that 128 terabyte Mark if such SD cards ever become readily available it's not just about size though be sure to pick whichever combination of letters your device asks for as some older devices won't support the new XC and UC cards though you might get them to work with a reduced capacity if you format the new card with the older FAT32 file system we're now going to talk about arguably the most confusing bit right after we thank your Tech goods and their magnetic charger for sponsoring this video it comes with strong front-facing magnets that hold your phone steady over bumps and sharp turns while you drive it works with any phone or case including magsafe cases and thick boys like the OtterBox they even include a free magnetic ring that turns any phone case magsafe compatible so there's no need to switch to a new case to use it your Tech Goods has a great unboxing video that helps

files such as game downloads and it can be very important if you're using a nicer camera as slower cards can't keep up with recording HD 4K or 8K video but the reason it's so complicated to figure out what you need is that the markings that SD cards use to tell you their speeds are rather cryptic so let's break them down first you're going to see a number either within the letter c or the letter U the C is used for slower cards with the number indicating the right speed in megabytes per second while U is for faster cards called UHS for ultra high speed and here the numbers work a bit differently a number one inside the u means it gets at least 10 megabytes per second of write speed while a 3 indicates at least 30 megabytes per second but that's not all you UHS cards will additionally have a Roman numeral this indicates the bus interface or a maximum theoretical speed that you're more likely to get close to for reads rather than for rights most cards currently on the market are uhs1 or uhs2 but UHS 3 delivers up to a whopping 624 Megs per second about the same as you'd get on a SATA SSD but if you see an ex or Express instead of a Roman numeral it means that the SD card supports the PCI Express Bus meaning you'll get close to one terabyte per second and possibly even more if that card supports newer versions of PCI Express or uses multiple Lanes finally another marking you might see alongside the others is a letter V with a number after it the v stands for video speed class and it's just another quick way to show how many megabytes per second can be written to the card v30 is recommended for HD with V60 a good amount from 4K and v90 for 8K you know it would be so much easier if they just clearly printed the speed on the card itself but I guess sexy branding like XC and Ultra draws people in more effectively oh God RGB SD cards are coming aren't they and thank you for coming to this place to watch this video all the way through hey like the
