ladies and gentlemen welcome to one of the greatest terrible chess games that you are ever going to see in your life and in particular on this YouTube channel and that is saying something because I have really shown you some exceptional stuff um like all good stories this began on Reddit a couple of days ago when I saw this game uploaded um but I actually don't know who played this game because they never posted a link to the game uh and uh I also don't know their level so you and I are going to have to figure that out in a joint effort now before we get into the game itself it's important to cast the scene once again I am in a prison style setup there is a curtain behind me an anonymous undisclosed location also this laptop is currently sitting on a bed because I'm in such a small hotel room there is no table in fact I will pan this down for you now that's how I'm you know currently uh currently doing things um if I reverse the camera my wife is on the other side and maybe we should do a challenge like we did some other time like if there's a certain amount of comments like if 2003 thousand people comment on this video she will join me for a video um we are currently taking a vacation and I have not been on vacation in some 10 years probably and in particular since the chess boom started so um yeah you can try to guess where we are based on the curtain behind me that's the only context that you have maybe the Shadows of the room without further Ado allow me to show you this game I'm on vacation but I cannot really sit here and claim that my job is particularly difficult so I will still try to record a video as long as I have an internet connection I made like 10 different video ideas so um yeah let's go and let's make a bunch of new memes with the Gotham World Tour so the unfortunate victim began the game with Pawn to D4 which is a very sensible move and um probably a good start to uh to most games and the opponent responded with the move F5 there is nothing wrong with the move F5 I like the move F5 it's the Dutch defense I'm imagining that these individuals are probably something like 1100 because of what you're about to see Knight F3 Knight F6 everything so far so good and our unfortunate victim plays the move Bishop to F4 which by the way they are already a victim they are playing the London um wow I look really red I'm not sunburned I promise um anyway the London system on the board and black plays the move E6 right trying to get this bishop out so far so good right black has played the Dutch can't really complain about that nothing stupid has yet occurred in fact nothing stupid occurs for the first four moves because it's really difficult to do something stupid in the London some 30 000 of you watching this just probably went well yeah Gotham hasn't seen me play the London you guys probably play the inverse London which is just The Bishop's opening um so here black plays the first kind of like little dosage of stupidity which is the move Bishop before check this is not a really stupid move it's like minorly stupid which if we could reduce our governments down to that I think society would you know Advance them three decades um yeah Bishop B4 is like a minorly stupid move because white can just play C3 it can block the check and you know that's exactly what happens so black kind of helps white not like the worst thing in the world but not really necessary either and now black plays the move Bishop to D6 again black could have just played that move you didn't have to go Bishop B4 okay whatever I mean Beggars can't be choosers or whatever the saying is Bishop D3 castles castles pretty normal so far so how did this get completely out of control well soon you will find out now in this position black should not make three moves with the bishop like this this is very bad I would argue because you've moved the bishop half of your opening moves and now the bishop is gone now this particular trade on F4 you would think is like good for black because oh doubled pawns and you know doubled pawns mean your opponent melts into a puddle not really this exchange does double White's pawns but it gives white really really good control of the E5 Square uh not to mention the fact that the move Rook to E1 is possible now which actually does something there used to be a pawn here so The Rook on E1 is going to be very happy um so yeah this is a pretty Pleasant situation uh for uh for white black now plays the move Knight to G4 Knight to G4 is not a good move um which makes me think this is a three-digit ELO game uh but again I I don't actually know what the ELO of the players is or are black should be playing B6 and Bishop B7 because it complements the development because if you're going to build three light squared Pawns in front of a bishop that moves like a light Square you should probably put the bishop the other way just like if you've yeah I mean like I always say right if you just have an apartment and it has absolutely zero windows it's kind of tragic right so that's what black should do is play B6 Bishop B7 but black plays the move Knight to G4 and there another reason why this move is not a good move is because what you will learn as you improve at chess is these random knight jumps into your opponent's position if they attack nothing they're not good because your opponent can just play H3 and there is just absolutely zero plan like you you didn't even have a one move threat you just move the Knight there and the thing is sometimes you should ask yourself okay and what if I get another move like let's say queen H4 was like legal I mean it is legal it's just an awful move but let's just say white didn't have that even then this is not even mate right so black should be developing more pieces white plays Knight bd2 which is completely reasonable Pawn to H3 would have also been fine black plays H6 which doesn't make a whole lot of sense but again blacks just for some reason really hates all their pieces they're just like I'm not moving any of my pieces I don't care now I like White's next move again I would still play at the move H3 and then I would play rookie one and then I would probably put my 9 to the center of the board white just decides to skip to step three of that plan which is playing the move Knight E5 which is nothing wrong with this move but um for the long-term development of a chess player there is something wrong with this move you don't actually want to trade these pieces you would benefit greatly from kicking this Knight out of the position and then infiltrating onto G6 straight away and then maybe transferring the queen over there through F3 which you enabled but by moving the Knight but okay 95 is played and and now black does correctly spot Queen H4 with the Knight no longer on the F3 square and that is Checkmate and that is where the game concludes as white plays Pawn to G3 and gets checkmated in one move no that's not what happened um that would be an awful video like what would that would can you imagine I mean I'm really out of ideas if I'm just lying to you about the video content um Knight to G6 here is a fork but it blunders Checkmate the Knight G6 is a great example of being a selfish chess player you're like oh folk and then they take on H2 and you get mated Knight takes G4 F takes G4 um so far nothing really too Sensational has happened which is generally how these videos go like the players play with a certain degree of integrity and brain cells and IQ and EQ and lack of colonoscopies and you know F takes G4 is played here and uh okay there's no more attack right so white plays G3 which I I get the move G3 you don't have to play G3 because now there's Queen H3 but this is not scary however all chess players at some point or another which none of you do this you need to think for your opponent you need to think okay well if my opponent could get a few moves in a row what would they do like what would be and and how would they mate me well you might say Rook F5 Rook H5 Queen H2 that's correct Queen H2 is made if you allow all of those moves but you would take the Rook so that doesn't work um B6 Bishop B7 and then Queen to G2 is made correct and B6 is not really stoppable Bishop B7 is not really stoppable you know what is stoppable this queen you could play Bishop E4 and then here and you're completely safe also if the bishop does get to B7 you can always play Pawn to F3 White's position is actually quite resilient and the move Queen E2 is a good sign of that white actually has their own plan the way white is playing this I would think white is four digits the way black has played this I would think that black has three digits but they're probably the same level which means that they're four digits um and queen E2 is designed to probably do this and it is at this point that the game turns to Absolute garbage okay so buckle up prepare yourselves because it ain't getting any better than this the move Queen E2 is POS and queen E4 and all of this is possible for one reason and one reason only and it's the fact that black has negated good chess principles black has not played this position well black is trying to hunt white with one Queen which has no targets the queen on its own is not going to do any damage Okay click Damian Lillard in Portland and blank plays the move B6 now you'll notice that the eval bar shoots up to the ceiling the reason for that is that White's entire plan was Queenie 4 and queen H7 now the move Queen E4 is made a lot sweeter because there is a rook hanging on the opposite side of the board it's like black saw the truck coming and like removed its brakes you know like it just it doesn't make it it doesn't make any sense it's like there was a sprinkler in the in the front yard and it was just you know it's do my best sprinkler impression and uh and you put like really expensive furniture out there and then you're upset that it got damaged like you did that to yourself stupid so you know I'm not saying anybody's stupid here but I am saying that you have facilitated your own demise now you have to be 100 sure this is not Checkmate you should probably save The Rook because you know if you like run the king I'm I mean I'm just gonna win the Rook like no questions asked so black plays Knight C6 and allows Queen H7 now it's not mate but black is completely lost um the computer in this position after Queen to E4 uh I believe wanted to play I don't even I mean it it basically wants to lose the bishop and then like lose a bunch of Pawns and you know it's like plus four and a half it's not like completely lost black does this and after Queen H7 it's over um it's over because it's not that this attack is Checkmate it's the fact that White's attack is so devastating that white is going to take like you know they're gonna rob the bank on the way out and they're not doing anything bad in the position so white plays Bishop G6 which is fantastic now the next move is Queen takes G7 if you play Knight to uh King to F6 it delays the inevitable not only does it delay the inevitable it actually facilitates the inevitable with Knight to E4 check and now your king can't even Escape so you can't go anywhere you would play Rook F7 and then you would get brutally checkmated in a variety of Fashions and that would be the end of the game but that would not make for a good Gotham video If white one like that we would never be sitting here okay fascinating how the butterfly effect works how every chess move that you make could affect my legacy your legacy the Legacy Legacy of uh humankind anyway that's all to say that in this position black actually played technically what would be the right move but technically the wrong move because they undefended the pawn and now the king is going to be Pride from the defense of the Rook and white is completely winning now the post on Reddit was called how did I lose this position and what you are about to witness is something that only God knows like this is not teachable it is teachable kind of but like only God knows how white lost the following position black in this position played Knight to E7 because if black played the only king move in the position black is actually now out of moves and Bishop back to E4 is mate I don't know if that would have been found like white could have played C4 check and then King D4 and now it's still mate in a few moves or white would have won Queen C5 and hung the queen in one move which is probably what you would have played and yet look at the e-value you're still not even that much worse because of how ridiculously bad the position is uh for black which is kind of hilarious um low-key actually not low-key at all in in fact very very very high key um but black went Knight E7 White NOW continued the hunt and the general rule of thumb here is your upper Rook the king is in the center just give checks the only types of checks you don't want to give are the ones that accidentally remove Defenders from things so in this position black obviously moves up white can give checks but white correctly realizes that Queen takes Knight is a completely reasonable move white now has a nine point material advantage and it's Checkmate very very soon black should just try to sneak in over here that is the only thing that black has there are multiple ways to play a losing position uh in this case you are not going to be able to defend it you're gonna have to create counter play like there is you're gonna have to find a way to win the game by some sort of Miracle so Bishop to B7 uh White NOW plays Pawn to C4 again this is the type of check that I would not give because it blunders two different things um you should continue to hunt with the queen in this case this would be shag taking on C7 taking on B7 I actually think that does happen though again but one thing that you're not doing here with white is you're not giving a check and that doesn't always matter but we are foreshadowing we are foreshadowing because because you're not ready okay when I tell you you're not ready trust me you are not ready if this Knight wasn't here this would be mate right but it is so so white Place uh excuse me black plays E5 I can't really explain this move other than black was just sort of clicking around and then you know one of the pieces that illuminated a legal move so they played it you know you click this it does it shows you so you just play it white correctly in my opinion plays Queen takes C7 this is a check which is a very very good move and now you are going to remove the only piece that poses you any sort of thread at all you also at some point can get rid of this with a bishop or a queen you get your queen here you force a trade you can trap the queen somehow um black plays King takes D4 and now you have made you have two different mates you can move either of these Rooks to the D file the way you even prime yourself for that is you just ask do I have a check you might be tempted to give a check with the queen um you but but you haven't moved these Rooks which is just like you got to realize like you're up material right a lot of you make this mistake you're up material but you don't use it white is up a rook the Rooks are not being used right now just wait a minute I haven't moved my Rook boom Rook D1 nice but white plays Queen B7 I don't hate this move this Rook is not going to deliver a checkmate with the queen it's just not going to happen so the queen now has to uh The Queen Is Now attacking The Rook white has a 12 point material advantage Rook to G8 is played now I can see where this is going to become a problem like if somehow some way this actually does occur you know black is going to win the game it's going to make for good Gotham content but white plays Queen D7 right back again missing the mates King to C4 it's made in two it's made in two in like a lot of cool different ways like you could probably checkmate with a pawn at some point uh you've got like you know Rook check Queen all sorts of different Queen checks but white plays Queen E6 that's a great move because you're gonna win the Rook you're gonna have a 17 point material advantage and that's it none of these ponds are going to deliver any sort of Checkmate like the pawn is in the Queen's way the queen is in the Pond's way the queen also has no way back the queen is absolutely trapped this game is absolutely hopeless King to D3 now it's made into once again 49 million different ways you have Queen D5 you have Queen B3 you have like Rook checks uh you have a discovered check with your knight with your Bishop excuse me that will win the queen uh you can also just cleanly take the Rook like every single piece here is on the verge of death white decides to play Queen takes G8 uh and now is going to come back and deliver the kiss of death black doesn't really know what to do but follows my philosophy of not hitting the resign button and just moving the king running the king forward you never know Queen takes F1 is checkmate actually no it's not all right well white in this position plays Queen C4 and it's Checkmate on the very next move um you also could have played Queen to B3 you also could have played rookie one check you literally are spoiled for Choice with the amounts of check made in two that you have in this position white plays one of the moves King to F3 and my friends as we all know in chess when you have Checkmate in one move with Queen to D3 with Knight to D2 with made in two a million different ways the best thing to do when you have Checkmate in one move is to allow it for your opponent this person posted and said how did I lose this position the way this person lost this position is very simple don't stop giving checks when you are up 17 points of material and the opponent's pieces are just standing around waiting to be set up for the next game Queen C2 Queen G2 is inexcusable I was gonna have dinner seeing this game ruined my appetite I might fast until tomorrow morning anyway my friends the Gotham World Tour will continue you might see a different background very soon maybe you'll see a relative of mine that's terrifying maybe not but yeah if you want Lucy 3 000 comments I'll see you in the next video I'll see you in the next city get out of here
