your most recent book titled Einsteins unfinished revolution so I have to ask what is Einsteins unfinished revolution and also how do we finish it well that's something I've been trying to do my whole life but Einsteins unfinished revolution is the twin revolutions which invented relativity theory special and especially general relativity and quantum theory which he was the first person to realize in 1905 that there would have to be a radically different theory which somehow realized to resolve the paradox of the duality of particle wave for photons and he was I mean people I think don't always associated I started with quantum mechanics because I think his connection with it founding as a one of the founders I would say of quantum mechanics he kind of put it in the closet is it well he didn't believe that the quantum mechanics as it was developed in the late 19th middle late 1920s was completely corrected first he didn't believe it at all then he was convinced that it's consistent but incomplete and that also is my view it needs for various reasons I can elucidate to have additional degrees of freedom particles forces something to reach the the stage where it gives a complete description of each phenomenon and as I was saying realism demands so what aspect of quantum mechanics bothers you and I Stein the most is it some aspect of the wavefunction collapse discussions the measurement problem is it the the the measurement problem I'm not gonna speak for Einstein but the measurement problem basically and the fact that what is the measurement problem sorry the basic formulation of quantum mechanics gives you two ways to evolve situations in time one of them is explicitly when no observer is observing or no taking place and the other is when a measurement or an observation is taking place and they country they basically contradict each other but there's another reason why the revolution wasn't completed which is we don't understand the relationship between these two parts general relativity which became our best theory of space and time and gravitation and cosmology and quantum theory so for the most part general relativity describes big things quantum theory describes little things and that's the revolution that we found really powerful tools to describe big things and little things and it's unfinished because you wouldn't have two totally separate things and we need to figure out how to connect them and so it can describe everything right and we either do that if we believe quantum mechanics as understood now is correct by bringing general relativity or some extension or general relativity that describes gravity and so forth into the quantum domain that's called quantized the theory of gravity or if you believe with Einstein that quantum mechanics needs to be completed and this is my view then part of the job of finding the great completion or extension of quantum mechanics would be one that incorporated space-time in gravity so where do we begin so first let me ask perhaps you can give me a chance if I could ask you some just really basic questions well they're not at all the basic questions and the hardest but you mentioned space-time what is space-time space-time you talked about a construction so I believe the space-time is a intellectual construction that we make of the events in the universe I believe the events are real and relationships between the events which caused which are real but the idea that here is a four-dimensional smooth geometry which has a metric and a connection and satisfies the equations that Einstein wrote it so good description to some scale it's a good approximation it captures some of what's really going on in nature but I don't believe it for a minute is fundamental so okay let's we're gonna allow me to linger on that so the universe has events events caused other events this is idea of causality okay so that that's happy let's in my in your view Israel or hypothesis so the theories that I have been working to develop make that assumption is so space-time you said four-dimensional space is kind of the location of things in time is whatever the heck time is and you're saying that space-time is both space and time are emergent and not fundamental no sorry before you correct me what is it mean to be fundamental or emergent fundamental means it's part of the description as far down as you go we have real yes as real as real it could be so I think the time is fundamental and quote goes all the way down and space does not and the combination of them we use in general relativity that we call space-time also does not but what is time then I think that time the activity of time is a continual creation of events from existing event so if there's no events there's no nothing then there's not only not no time there's no nothing so so I believe that history universe has a history which goes to the past I believe that a future does not exist there's a notion of a present and a notion of the past and the past consists of is a story about events that took place to our past so you said the future doesn't exist yes could you say that again can you try to give me a chance to understand that one more time so what the events cause of their events what is this universe because we'll talk about locality in nonlocality good because it's the crazy I mean it's not crazy it's a beautiful set of ideas that you you proposed but and if causality is fundamental just like to understand it better what is in what is the past what is the future what is the flow of time even the error of time in our universe in your view and maybe it was an event right Oh an event is where something changes or where to I it's hard to say because it's a primitive concept and the event is a moment of time within space this is the view and general relativity where two particles intersect in their paths or something changes in the path of the particle now we are postulating the theories I have two fundamental level a notion which is an elementary notion so it doesn't have a definition in terms of other things but it is something elementary happening and it's it doesn't have a connection to energy or matter or exchange of any ties to have a connection energies masses at that level yeah that it involves and that's why the version of a theory of events that I've developed with Marina Cortez and it's by the way I want to mention my collaborators because they've been at least as important in this work as I have marina Cortes in all the works since about 2013 2012-2013 about causality Carlos set and in the period before that Roberto mangabeira Unger who is a philosopher and a professor of law and that's in your efforts together with your collaborators to finish and finish so yeah and focus on causality environmental yes it's fundamental to physics so and and there's certainly other people we've worked with but those two people's thinking had a huge influence on my own thinking so in the way you describe causality that's what you mean of time being fundamental that causality is from the earth and what does it mean for space to not be fun about though to be very good this is a level of description in which there events there are events create other events but there's no space they don't live in space they have an order in which they caused each other and that is part of the nature of time for us so I but there is an emergent approximate description and you asked me to find a version I didn't an emergent property is a property that arises at some level of complexity larger than and more complex than the fundamental level which requires some property to describe it which is not directly explicable or drivable is the word I want from the properties of the fundamental things and space is one of those things in a sufficiently complex universe space three-dimensional position of things emerged yes and we have this we saw how this happens in detail in some models both computationally and analytically ok so connected to space is the idea of locality yes that so we talk about realism so I I live in this world at like sports you know locality is a thing that you know you can affect things close to you and don't have an effect on things that are far away mm-hmm it's the thing that bothers me about gravity in general or action in a distance the same thing that probably bothered Newton or at least he said a little bit about it okay so what do you think about localities it's just a construct is it us humans just like this idea and are connected to it because we exist in it we need it for our survival but it's not fundamental I mean it seems crazy for it not to be a fundamental aspect of our reality it does and you comfort me and a sort of as a therapist like how do I I'm not a good therapist okay there are several different definitions of locality when you come to talk about locality in physics in quantum field theory which is a mixture of special relativity and quantum mechanics there is a precise definition of locality operative field operators corresponding to events in space-time which are space like separated commute with each other as operators so in quantum mechanics you think about the nature realities fields and things that are closed in a field have any impact on each other more than farther away that's yes that's very comforting that makes sense so that's a property of quantum field theory and it's well tested unfortunately there's another definition of local which was expressed by Einstein and expressed more precisely by John Bell which has been tested experimentally and found to fail and this set up is you take two particles so one thing that's really weird about quantum mechanics is a property called entanglement you can have two particles interact and then share a property without it being a property of either one of the two particles and if you take such a system and then you magically make a measurement on particle a which is over here on my right side then particle B which is over here and what somebody else makes a measurement in a particle B you can ask that whatever is the real reality of particle B it not be affected by the choice the observer at particle a makes about what to measure not the outcome just the choice of the different things they might measure and that's a notion of locality because it assumes that these things are very far space like separated and it's going to take a while for any information about the choice made by the people here at a to affect the reality of B but you make that assumption that's called bell locality and you derive a certain inequality that some correlation functions of correlations have to satisfy and then you can test that pretty directly in experiments which create pairs of photons or other particles and it's wrong by many Sigma in experiment in exact match so what what does that mean that means that that definition of locality I stated is false the the one that Einstein was playing with and the one the one that I stated that is it's not true that whatever is real about particle B is unaffected by the choice that utility' makes as to what to measure in particle a no matter how long they've been propagating at almost the speed of light or the speed of light away from each other it's no matter so like the distance between them well it's been tested of course if you want to have hope for quantum mechanics being incomplete or wrong and corrected by something that changes this it's been tested over a number of kilometers I don't remember whether it's 25 kilometers or 107 kilometers but so in trying to solve the unsolved revolution in trying to come up with a theory of everything is causality fundamental and breaking away from locality absolutely fun a crucial step you so the in your book essentially those are the two things we really need to think about as a community especially the physics community has to think about this way I guess I my question is how do we solve how do we finish the end finish revolution well that's I can only tell you what I'm trying to do and what I have abandoned yes not working as one ant smart ant in an ant colony yep I may be dumb that's why who knows but anyway that's become my view of the we've had some nice theories invented there's a bunch of different ones both related to quantum mechanics related to quantum gravity there's a lot to admire in many of these different approaches but to my understanding they none of them completely solve the problems that I care about and so we're in a situation which is either terrifying for students or full of opportunity for the right student in which we've got more than a dozen attempts and I never thought I don't think anybody anticipated it would work out this way which work partly and then at some point they have an issue that nobody can figure out how to go around or how to solve and that's the situation we're in my reaction to that is twofold one of them is to try to bring people we evolved into this unfortunate sociological situation in which there are communities around some of these approaches and to borrow again a metaphor from Eric they sit on top of hills in the landscape of theories and throw rocks to each other and as eric says we need two things we need people to get off the hill and come down into valleys and party and talk and become friendly and learn to say not know but but yes and yes your idea goes this far but maybe if we put it together with my idea we can go further yes so in that spirit of talked several times with Sean Carroll who's also written an excellent book recently and he kind of he plays around as a big fan of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics so I'm a troublemaker so let me ask well what's your sense of Sean and the idea of many worlds interpretation I've read many the commentary back and forth you guys you guys are friendly respect each other but have a lot of fun debating I love Sean and he know I really he's not he's articulate and he's a great representative or an ambassador of science to the public in four different fields of science to each other he also like I do takes philosophy seriously and unlike what I do in all cases he has really done the homework he's read a lot he knows the people he talks to them he exposes his arguments to the to them and I did this mysterious thing that we so often end up on the opposite sides of with these issues it's fun though it's fun and I'd love to have a conversation about that but I would want to include him I see about many worlds well no I can tell you what I think about many I'd love to but actually on that let me pause Sean as a podcast you should definitely figure out how to talk to Sean I would I actually told Sean I would love to hear you guys just going back and forth so I hope you can make that happen eventually you and sure I want I won't tell you what it is but there's something that Sean said to me in June of 2016 that changed my whole approach to a problem but I'll have to tell him first yes and that that they'll be great to tell him on his podcast so I can't invite myself to his podcast yeah okay we'll make it happen so how many worlds anyway um what's your view many worlds we talk about nonlocality many worlds is also a very uncomfortable idea or beautiful depending on your perspective it's it's very nice in terms of I mean there's a realist aspect to it I think you call the magical realist it's just a beautiful line but at the same time it's very difficult to far limit human minds to comprehend so what are your thoughts about it let me start with the easy and obvious and then go to the scientific okay it doesn't appeal to me it doesn't answer the questions that I want answered and it does so to such a strong case that went abroad among about anger and I began looking for principles and I want to come back and talk about the use of principles in science because that's the other thing I was gonna say and I don't want to lose that when we started looking for principles we made our first principle there is just one world that happens once but so it's it's not helpful to my personal approach to my personal agenda but of course I'm part of a community and my sense of the many-worlds interpretation I have thought a lot about it and struggled a lot with it is the following first of all this average himself is what's in Everett and there are several issues they're connected with the derivation of the born rule which is the rule that gives probabilities to events and the reasons why there is a problem with probability is that I mentioned the two ways that physical systems can evolve the many-worlds interpretation cuts off one the one having to do with measurement and just has the other one the Schrodinger evolution was just a smooth evolution of the quantum state but the notion of probability is only in the second rule which we've thrown away so where is probably come from and you have to answer the question because experimentalist use probabilities to check the theory now at first sight you get very confused because there seems to be a real problem because in the many-worlds interpretation this talk about branches is not quite precise but I'll use it there is a branch in which everything that might happen does happen with probability 1 in that branch you might think you could count the number of branches in which things do and don't happen and get numbers that you can define as something like frequentist probabilities and Everett did have an argument in that direction but the argument gets very subtle when there are an infinite number of abilities as is the case in most quantum systems and my understanding although I'm not as much of an expert as some other people is that ever its own proposal its failed did not work there then it doesn't stop there there is an important idea that Everett didn't know about which is decoherence and it is a phenomenon that might be very much relevant and so a number of people post Everett have tried to make versions of what you might call many worlds quantum mechanics and this is a big area and it's subtle and it's not the kind of thing that I do well so I consulted that's why there's two chapters on this in the book I wrote chapter 10 which is about Everett's version in Chapter 11 there is a very good group of philosophers of physics in Oxford Simon Saunders David Wallace Harvey Brown and a number of others and of course this David Deutsch who is there and those people have developed and put a lot of work into a very sophisticated set of ideas designed to come back and answer that question they have the flavor of there are really no probabilities we admit that but imagine if you if the Everett story was true and you were living in that multiverse how would you make bets and so they they use decision theory from the theory of probability in gambling and so forth to shape a story of how you would bet if you were inside Everett in the universe and you knew that and there is a debate among those experts as to whether they or somebody else has really succeeded and when I checked in as I was finishing the book with some of those people like Simon who's a good friend of mine and David Wallace they told me that they weren't sure that any of them was yet correct so that's why I put in my book now to add to that sean has his own approach to that problem in what's called self referencing or self locating observers and it doesn't I just tried to read it and it didn't make sense to me but I didn't study it hard I didn't communicate with Sean I didn't do the things that I would do so I had nothing to say about in the book in I don't I don't know whether it's right or not you
