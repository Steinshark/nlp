oh didn't expect to see you here so 
early this is how as a programmer I   automate my morning write a script to get dressed there that's better I need some coffee 
I can just write a script for that right   there we go oh perfect temperature too 
all right all in a day's work [Music]   hey friends welcome back to my video as you know 
I love to automate everything from workflows to   my morning to anything I can I try and automate 
it it's the programmer in me I'm inherent to it   and today we are going to do just that you know 
I love Logitech products I've been using them   for years now you've seen them in all my coding 
tutorials and I recently picked up the new MX   Keys s combo and I've been chef's kiss loving it 
mainly one of the main things that I've really   been loving is the smart actions that I've been 
creating with them these are smart actions that   you can literally customize your workflow from 
pressing certain buttons on your keyboard or   your mouse whatever you choose to do and it will 
open up say your terminal or specific URLs you can   customize it to whatever you want I literally have 
a Smart Action to pull code from a repository for   me and today we are going to go through some of my 
favorite smart actions that really help automate   my workflow when it comes to productivity comes to 
coding and just everything life and in turn I get   a lot of time back let's get automating all right 
morning setup this is the most important set you   asked me other than of course the one thing that 
is yet to be automated I'm sure it will be soon   I just need to invent it is injecting coffee 
into my veins but until then that's okay you   know at least we can automate the coffee maker 
more important though you can see here on screen   I have up my lodgy options plus and then also 
too you can add a device I already have my two   devices connected though also too I really like 
as a side note you can see how much battery is   left in each or energy is left in each because 
I'm always guilty of leaving it to last minute   if you go up into the right hand corner you can 
see here smart actions and when I click on it you   can see here I already set up a morning setup but 
I erased my other setups and I'm going to modify   this one because I really want to show you how I 
set up or automate my workflow alright so let's   go into let's start by going into templates and 
this was a great place for me to start because   it really shows some examples of preset templates 
that you can use and I mean it's super important   and key to customize them but this is a great 
place to start if you're like I don't know what   I want I don't even know what I want to automate 
yet so you can scroll through here and see some   of them one that is really interesting too of 
course is reply with chat GPT uh pull project   changes which is super useful and we'll dive into 
in a bit here open URLs and then also too you   can create right from scratch so for my first one 
though for morning setup I'm actually going to go   to manage where the one that I created is already 
set up and let's go to here click on it and what   I have set up right now is the if and this is 
really I love how they set this up because it's   very uh programmer focused meaning there's that if 
this happens then do this kind of like in code if   else statements so it's super easy to use clearly 
I have not had enough copy yet so if we go into my   if statement this is how I set it up in my mouse 
here you can see right now I have the back button   because it's super it's just I did what is user 
and intuitive to me what I can easily remember   so I clicked on back button to start with and then 
for the keyboard I did the brightness the morning   setup the brightness uh key the reason I did this 
was because it looks like a sunshine and it's   so let's go confirm trigger now right now what 
I have is if those two uh that sequence is set   in motion so the back button and then the 
brightness button what will happen is Google   Chrome will open up now I do want some other 
things in my morning routine to open up so   let's go into application and you can see here 
all the applications that I have so let's scroll   down a bit to visual studio code there we go and 
once again you can see do you want to bring it to   the foreground close there's many different 
things you can do with these applications   so I like how it's very customizable in 
this case I want to open the application   firm so once this sequence is in motion it will 
open Google Chrome for me and it will also open   the application for visual studio code now when 
I'm starting my morning I would say well let's   scroll let's see if there's anything else 
I typically do those are usually the main   two things that I need opened but let's go back to 
application see what else if there's anything else   I usually open the terminal first thing so we 
don't need that let's do I think that's a good   way to kind of start my morning is simple to the 
point having those two applications set up all   right so let's put this into motion so picture 
this going back to I wake up first thing in   the morning get my coffee come into the office 
and then after I do these two sequences of the   back button and then the brightness button 
I automate my workflow try it out confirm all right so I'm going to press uh the back 
button followed by the brightness button   and and see here it opened up in the other tab 
my other screen but these two you can see now I   my Google Chrome opened up in the background here 
and then the Forefront which is my vs code so this   is super user friendly and it just makes it such a 
fun way to kind of start your day okay next up is   code time uh I think that that's what I'm calling 
it anyways I don't know if that's actually the   term but it's code time and for this you know 
I've already had my morning kind of set up I   usually do a bit of meetings in the morning also 
to responding to emails so then by mid morning   early afternoon I can focus on writing some code 
so in templates again I'm going to actually start   this time with let's start with open URLs because 
I want to open a specific URL so I'm going to   start with this template and then modify it to 
to my own personal so let's go if adding the   trigger is always the most hardest thing to do in 
my opinion it's kind of like when you're naming a   variable it's like okay what what do I do it's 
like the simplest application or the simplest   actions are always the most difficult so let's do 
forward because we're Forward Thinking and on the   keyboard I'm gonna do mute because when I'm coding 
I need it to be quiet I need peace so forward mute I'm not getting creative here so the first 
thing I want to do is bring up GitHub and   I actually was thinking when I was customizing 
this I was like what URL do I want to open in   GitHub is it my like a specific project or is it 
my profile but I'm actually going to do github.com   I'm always logged into it and the reason for that 
is because I not only have my personal GitHub or   my personal projects on GitHub but I also have my 
work project on like my day job on GitHub as well   so I wanted to be kind of generic that I see the 
feed and also to well let's just pull it up here   so this is what I want to open up um so you can 
see here my top repositories I also can see some   trending repositories recommendations and then two 
I have my stack bit which is where I work and I   can open up that as well so let's copy this copy 
and close actually now let's go into our then so   bring to the foreground Google Chrome so be the 
first thing that we see which yes and then after   a three second delay we will have a new browser 
Tab and then we will open up right now github.com and then I also well right now they 
have another one which is gmail.com   and for this actually I want to open up one of my 
favorite websites right now it's called daily.dev   highly recommend you check it out it's really 
cool they always have like trending stories   um I love it all right so let's go confirm [Music] start with I think that feels good all right so now 
let's do it so we go forward mute [Music] all right and you can see here it opened up GitHub 
and then a few seconds later it opened up daily   gem so this is really great um and it's super 
simple kind of getting into the there is something   about routine when you are doing a routine you 
have a routine it just makes you feel like your   mindset Gets In the Zone I'm sure there's studies 
on this action I should include some stats here   around it but this is a great way all right I hope 
you enjoyed going through this video automating   some of my life well more so my workflow with me 
it is so fun I just think being able to really   customize your actions and your workflow is so key 
to success and I know it sounds kind of silly like   you know having these uh tasks for smaller tasks 
like opening your browser but the significance in   having a routine when you are doing this when 
it's the same URL opens every day the same app   opens all the time it really is the consistency 
part of it that is so huge as well not only from   a time saving aspect but also to just getting in 
the Rhythm it's one of those things that when you   do uh what is it when you do the same kind of set 
of actions day in and day out your brain knows is   triggered as to what's going to happen for example 
before I typically start work as you know this is   my Home Office I work from home I'll always make 
sure to get out in the morning whether it be to   a workout class whether it be for a walk but that 
is key for me because it tells my brain okay this   is kind of the Rhythm and flow we are going to 
get into for the day it doesn't just start by   walking into my office same kind of thing when I 
use these smart actions it's not just something   that I use once in a while I use them every day to 
be consistent and then also to especially with the   coding ones the coding setup ones when I do those 
smart actions it just kind of gets my mindset into   the frame of okay now it's Focus time now is 
coding 10. I linked the MX keyboard and mouse   Down Below in the description so make sure to go 
check them out and if you haven't already hit that   subscribe button give this a button give us a like 
and I'll see you all soon let me know what else   you can automate I need I want to hear all the 
smart actions you automate with okay bye everyone [Music] thank you
