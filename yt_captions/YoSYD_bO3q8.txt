[Music] welcome to the complete battery drain test between the brand-new one +7 Pro and four of the top flagship phones available right now we're pitching it against Samsung we've got Apple we've got Huawei and due to popular demand the me9 from Xiaomi and the first thing we're doing is putting up a white page and then using a luxe ometer to calibrate the brightness level each phone has Wi-Fi NFC location as well as Bluetooth turned on and then pretty much everything else off now that I've done the initial setup I'm gonna unplug the cable from each phone and start the timer and bare mind that whilst the brightness and the color profile of each one will look a little different to you as because of the different angle each phone has from the camera so we're starting this test in the deep end we've pulled up epic battle simulator - it's a physics based game and it's very demanding if you take a look at the battery specifications just below the names of the phones you'll see that the oneplus 7 pro is shaping up pretty well it's got a four thousand milliamp hour cell which is just below the 4100 on the s10 plus which in itself is just below the one on the p30 pro so you're probably looking at the batteries in the iPhone and the Xiaomi thinking that they're gonna get blitzed it has so much smaller but both of those phones actually have their own unique advantages in this test I'll explain so if you look at the battery percentages on top for both the oneplus 7 pro in the s10 plus it's not looking particularly good for those versions especially considering that they have two of the largest batteries of the bunch okay so take a look at the oneplus 7 pros display specifications just below its battery specs it's got a six point six seven inch display with a quad HD plus resolution and a ninety Hertz refresh rate so right out the box this phone already has three things going against it in terms of battery life it's got a massive display to power it's got a huge amount of pixels to push and it's screen is refreshing 1.5 times as fast as the other phones which are at 60 Hertz there is a similar story with the s10 plus whilst it doesn't have a super large display and it doesn't have the super high refresh rate of the oneplus 7 pro it still does have a much higher resolution than all the other phones and that will contribute to its degradation and bear in mind in some of these past battery tests I have set all phones to full HD resolution but I think in this particular case it does make sense to keep them at maximum it fair because if one plus and Samsung are selling their phones based on key features like these screens then it's useful to factor in how much the battery life will be when you actually use those features all right if we draw our attention back to the test now you can see that an hour and a half has passed we're just moving to using Spotify on all the phones and that the p30 pro has already established a pretty substantial lead we already know that this phone is a complete monster when it comes to battery life but this lead is more than in our past tests and that is because of the resolution the iPhone is actually holding up pretty well too that's partly because of how well optimized the software is and partly because iOS kind of lies to you I've done enough of these battery tests to see a trend with these iPhones in that in the first few percentage points they remain very strong they almost stay on 100% for a very long period of time and then as the percentage starts to fall it falls faster that brings us onto the sharmini 9 and in the three ways that the oneplus phone is disadvantaged this phone benefits from it's got the smallest display of the bunch it's got the lowest resolution and it refreshes at a standard 60 times a second so it'll be interesting to see if this is enough to offset it's significantly smaller battery ok so we've just closed asphalt and now we're opening up the camera and recording 4k 30 frame per second video on all the phones and we're gonna keep doing this continuously and then open it up in a video editing application so in these phones our captor recording for 10 minutes at a time so we have to stick by that but after 30 minutes in total we're gonna close that down and open it up in kinemaster I think it's called the idea being that we're just going to load up a video in each phone's timeline and then hit the export button and see what it does to the battery already though even after this much time we've seen enough to be able to answer a few questions you might know that one plus is oxygen OS is famously very efficient and so these differences are almost completely coming down to the differences in displays and we've already seen that when the Galaxy S 10 plus is running at 1080p it gets close to the YP 30 Pro although it still won't beat it so number one yes having your device set to quad HD plus resolution does massively impact the battery life if I have to guess it'd be somewhere between the 10 to 15% mark and number 2 setting a display to a 90 Hertz refresh rate is going to have a further impact on top of that yeah on the 1 plus 7 Pro you can set your resolution to full HD plus you can set the refresh rate to 60 Hertz but then you're missing a big part of what this phone offers personal preference though if we take a look at battery percentages again oneplus is pretty neck-and-neck with Apple here you've then got the s10 plus and the me9 which are also pretty close and then the p30 pro which is kind of in a league of its own at this point thankfully we are approaching the 5 hour mark which in this test given the applications we're running is what I would call a safe mark after which you've kind of got a phone that is at least acceptable in battery life it's one that you won't be worrying about it too much at least not for the first six months to a year ok so the iPhone tennis max is the first phone to go and yeah not mind-blowing performance but at the same time it's well past the 5 hour mark so I'm not hugely worried then we have the oneplus and even though for a while it was hanging on to those last few percentage points it has managed to make it a fair bit past the iPhone tennis max closer to the 6 hour mark I gotta say I'm really impressed with the me 9 even though yes the odds are in its favor in terms of screen size and screen resolution its 3300 milliamp hour battery would be very easy to dismiss even though it's on track to coming second in this test it's not wrong for Samsung calls it a day and the show-me me 9 a couple of minutes after Evert that leaves always p30 pro as the winner so that's fast forward and see what the final times are and how they stack up against each other okay so in fifth place is the iPhone 10's Mac's pretty good time considering the battery capacity it has but at the same time I'd really like to see Apple start to beef this up the 7 pro lasted about 15 minutes longer and is a perfect example of how you can't really have everything if you want the best qualities of the display then the battery will take a hit the Galaxy S 10 plus doesn't have that awesome super fluid display on the oneplus phone but it does last half an hour longer and to a lot of people that would be more important and that was pretty much neck and neck with the me 9 6 hours and 12 minutes and a bit of an underdog in this test leaving the qua weight p30 pro 7 hours is the time that it got which you know is crazy but the Huawei is limited to a full HD plus resolution so if you have a discerning eye if you really want the highest resolutions then this test is not to say that Huawei is the only way to go more vert even the 1 + 7 pro or the s10 plus can still offer ultra high resolutions while still having good battery life if battery life was the only thing you were looking for than yet Huawei would be king but there is more to a firm than that thanks all for watching and I will catch you guys in the next one [Music] you
