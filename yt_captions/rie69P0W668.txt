[Music] what's up guys mpbhd here and it's that time of year again so for those who don't know all the smartphones we're about to see for the second half of this year you know galaxy note 10 huawei mate 30 pro pixel 4 iphone 11 all the designs for them are pretty much done behind the scenes already and one of the most consistent cycles and press is the dimensionally accurate dummies that come out for the iphone case makers to make their cases for the new iphone so we have hands-on of these dummies shout out to sonny dixon and for 2019 we will again have three new iphones iphone 11 iphone 11 max and iphone 11r i guess we're technically not 100 sure that's what their names will be they could stick with roman numerals iphone xi seems like they probably won't do that so yeah i'll just call it iphone 11. and so the main major change that we've all been seeing in these renders for months now is this new camera bump on the back this new tile looking apple watch looking alien eye bug looking camera bump and i gotta say i have very mixed feelings about it see on one hand i love that we're getting a meaningful upgrade to the camera on the iphone it looks like that's gonna be the biggest change to the new iphone and so triple cameras is the wave you have your standard your telephoto and your ultra wide and that's fun that's what we've been expecting to see for a while and i'm crossing my fingers that that ultra wide is just as good of quality in photos and videos as the other two imagine ultra wide 4k from an iphone as a video camera like i love the mini trend of adding an ultrawide camera to these flagships and the rumor that the pixel 4 won't have an ultrawide camera makes me sad so i'm a fan of the focus on the camera pun intended but i am not a fan of the way this looks like this rounded square thing it's gonna look awkward on the pixel 4. it already looks kind of awkward on the huawei mate 20 pro but at least it's smaller and centered which actually seems to make a pretty good difference and making it less jarring and less alien like and clunky uh but yeah it's gonna look kind of awkward on this iphone and it's bigger also not sure if they keep the color of the phone back in the camera bump or if they just make it all black i've seen renders do it both ways this one's by venia geskin i kinda like it a little bit less than having it all black right now apple does all black in the cameras but either way it just looks kind of chunky and also still having a camera bump not making it flush i've said this before you can make the phone a little thicker and have no bump and that would be cool with me i remember the days of the iphone 5s not having a camera bump but this still has a bump i guess i just don't really know if i buy that this is the best design for a new iphone 11 that they could come up with like we know they usually have the tick tock strategy 6 and 6s look the same then new design for 7 and 7s and 10 and 10s so i was thinking about this potential new sort of boxy modern design like the ipad pro for the iphone 11 and we even know tons of people are going to be waiting for this new iphone but it kind of seems like they just mailed it in it's just the same design with the new camera i don't know makes me wonder when we're going to start to see iphones not designed by johnny ive anyway just just stop ranting about the new design for a second what else can we expect from these three new iphones well it's looking like we'll have the same screen sizes for the iphone 11 and iphone 11 max you know still 5.8 inch and 6.5 inch still oled the front-facing camera suite is also expected to be similar likely new sensors for improved and faster face id but still one selfie camera still a notch still the same kind of huge notch in the world where almost everyone is rapidly getting rid of theirs and then the signs are strong that they will actually be getting rid of 3d touch so if you remember the the pressure sensitive deep presses and force touches um to me this is fine this isn't something i use all the time other than maybe lock screen flashlight and camera shortcuts but you can get them with a long press anyway so i'm not super bummed about that i just wish it made it cheaper anyway we should get a new spec bump of course to the new chips alongside ios 13. but aside from that still lightning again still asymmetrical speakers at the bottom no usb type-c thanks apple and overall just the rest of the design is pretty much the same as the 10 and 10s same shapes same rails same chamfer same or very similar colors you know that's the whole deal and then with the iphone 11 r it'll be interesting to see what they do with the display and the cameras the display just because that was basically the biggest complaint a lot of people like me had with this iphone having a low pixel density and not the greatest display even though it turned out to be not a huge deal for most people and they end up buying it anyway but you know fingers crossed maybe they'll improve that a bit and then of course the iphone 10r had a single camera in a world of dual cameras it looks like this iphone 11r is also going to have one less camera than its brothers so if you look closely at these models you'll notice the flash is in a very different place on the 11r where the third camera would be and so sure enough there's only two cameras on that budget iphone where there's three on the flagships and i am hoping that means it's going to be a standard and an ultra wide i kind of think apple's going to end up doing that because you can still do portrait mode without the telephoto and they got rid of the telephoto for the 10r so i think the 11r will be standard and ultra wide i hope then as far as extras like reverse wireless charging can't really tell from the renders i mean they're still going to have the glass backs most likely but we don't know about that so yeah no usb type c the battery may be marginally larger a little bit not hugely no 120 hertz display is expected anyway fingerprint reader under the glass also not expected if they stick with face id like they're supposed to just overall a pretty underwhelming update this really seems like the first time they're not doing a major design shift after the s version of the iphone we go from 10s to 11 and it's looking very similar usually for these videos looking at the models we would go super hard with after effects magic so you could get a better idea of what it would look like on a working phone if you're holding it in your hand but the differences are so minimal you almost can't tell it looks just like an iphone 10 or 10s like just from looking at this piece what this model is telling me is the camera is going to be the biggest upgrade on the new iphone it'll be interesting to see how they sell that and they'll probably go super hard about it on stage to justify this but if you're one of those people who's you know pretty opportune to upgrade every single year with the new iphone based on having new features that is pretty much the only new feature to look forward to as far as we know but yeah that's been it i'm kind of curious would you skip this new iphone i know a lot of people you break a phone you kind of need a new phone and you just gotta wait till september and then this comes out and you get it but would you skip this new iphone let me know in the comments section below i'm curious either way thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace
