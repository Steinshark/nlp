i asked this former hedge fund manager to share the secrets of the stock market with us because i sure don't know what the hell i'm doing he's a finance professor he's got multiple books on the subject and he's a youtuber welcome patrick boyle hi how are you doing good now listen it's obvious these are dark times inflation is reaching all-time highs a new variance is here global supply issues are here so i want you to shoot straight with me does anybody know what's going on it's a it's a tough environment but you know the truth in markets is that it's always tough like there's there's this idea that there's certain times when everyone knew exactly what was coming but of course when you think that something else surprises you okay okay listen here i'm against everyone knows i'm against giving financial advice to my viewers so we're just going to turn off the cameras for a second and i'm just going to ask you yes or no should i buy gamestop because i'm all the kids are into it honestly the 10 million studio it's rough on the bank account you know rent's very high i need a little windfall okay as you know i'm doing this giveaway i i need the cash flow is gamestop a goodbye right now i don't like to use the term to the moon that often but you know all jokes aside i i wouldn't touch it like i i just think that there's it's a it's all risk and rather questionable return to me okay let's hit the hard questions here uh patrick patrick uh omicron it's here the the avengers the transformers in game is here now do you mean omicron the uh the virus or the yes the virus oh yes oh yeah yeah i know we're gonna get to the crypto don't worry listen we don't know how bad it is but should we be should i take my money out of the market what should i do here you know i don't think so because in truth we're we're sort of prepared for viruses or the idea is there and actually the world knows how to deal with it much better than they did a year and a half ago when the first version of covet came and in truth i i don't think it's it's worth panicking in terms of investing because what i've seen in the past with investors is often they'll panic when you know a bad piece of news comes out and they'll pull all of their money out of the market and we'll say even if they're right and the market falls they never buy on the low they always think it's going lower and so then it's kind of five years later and they buy at a new high you know so unless you really have a plan for how you're going to get back in i think if you're invested and if you're investing for the long term just stick with your plan yeah that's very true uh if if you look at my portfolio i think the honest truth is i've been probably buying i and uh selling law it's actually the biggest problem for investors there's a really interesting guy jack schwager i actually i interviewed him on my channel about a year ago and he's studied kind of how investors behave and one of the really interesting things he found was that even with some of the best performing funds like the highest return lowest risk funds he's found that people invest in them always after they've done well and then on any little sell-off they take their money out so the average investor in the fund doesn't actually get the return off the fund and so in effect once you're aware that people do that you you can possibly see some of that in yourself and you just have to adjust your behavior to sort of not make the the mistakes that we're almost programmed to make in markets yeah guys look it's easy just just buy low sell high it's just that it's that simple uh no that is that is very interesting now i do want to ask because as much as kind of we kid it it does seem like we are in an interesting time especially with how the fed has been acting and where the stock market is and i want to ask you about inflation okay so everyone heard the headlines we had like six percent inflation in october or an annualized inflation and i get the basics like you print more money more money's in the big pool your money's worth less that's not exactly how it works i i think can you explain for someone like me just a sort of a novice with this stuff how inflation works well the truth is inflation just is complicated like if you're confused by it it means that you're you're thinking about it you know and so there there are many things that are coming together to cause inflation you know so we have the simple idea of sort of extra money being printed that makes very logical sense that sort of the more you print the less it's worth but interestingly enough there's some sort of complicated things relating to the supply of money where often that money's getting printed and essentially it just sits in bank vaults it doesn't actually go out to people and so actually the supply of money in the market hasn't really grown as much as the supply of printed money which is kind of interesting but what what we are seeing at the moment there's a few things there appear to be big energy problems in the world that relate to basically all of the oil wells and whatever being shut off uh a year and a half ago and then essentially they haven't turned them back on because there's two reasons one is just that that it's difficult to sort of turn an oil well back on if you're not sure that the oil price will remain steadily high and the second thing is there's just been quite a strong uh green push over the last 12 months where a lot of governments are essentially saying that they don't want the oil to come out of the ground which then makes the oil companies choose to leave it in the ground then we also have the supply chain disruptions and they are you know hopefully a lot of people understand them but it's even that what happened what we're seeing in inflation is actually inflation in goods much more than inflation and services because when people got locked down they had money coming in and they spent it on stuff rather than eating at restaurants or going out on experiences and so you end up with a huge amount of we'll say just everyone bought extra extra computer equipment for home uh cameras all sorts of things uh which drove up the price of those uh there was the the computer chip shortages there's even just the shipping problems in moving stuff from you know a lot of the stuff is made in china and shipped over here and all of those ports are having problems there's all these backlogs and so a lot of the inflation we're seeing is really just money chasing goods that aren't being made like it's you know if you look at the price of used cars right now they've rocketed but equally they they were impossible to to sell uh you know a year ago in the depths of the lockdown so it's it's really the the effect of sort of shutting down and reopening an economy has caused these problems and then when we look at a a new variant that could possibly make do it all over again it's it's really uh interesting to see what would happen but inflation is kind of coming at us from multiple directions uh it's it's a great oversimplification to just say it's printing money that's caused it well yeah and yeah exactly and that's what i try to avoid is these oversimplifications but i'm just sort of not smart enough smart enough to really get my hands around it i just put put all my trust in jay powell basically um which i'm not sure is the best idea but but am i cynical for thinking and just in general that we are overdue for some sort of correction because let me explain my thinking on this like it seems like okay if you go into a doctor's office and you you somebody slammed uh a hammer on your hand your hands all mangled and the person is not reacting the hand is not hurt yet there's something wrong with the situation okay you're gonna go oh you'll feel that tomorrow whatever in the same way i feel like the stock mark or the economy got like hammered by the by the virus and then the stock market did not reflect what had happened to the economy and it's sort of it i feel like it hasn't reflected that maybe you can explain differently but am i cynical for just like waiting for us to feel the pain it's a funny thing because if we look back a year the the market actually reacted very rationally because you know if you remember january through march of 2020 the the market sold off horrifically like it was just down down down and then essentially like the the global governments just came out and said it doesn't make sense for all of these we'll say good well-run businesses to just be shut down because of a random event that happened and so they intervened in the markets essentially saying that if you're running a bit like if you owned a restaurant they say to you we're not going to have your restaurant go bust but equally you can't open the restaurant and so and all businesses got that you know ppp and other type uh it was a global thing but what it meant was that that you could invest in stocks and in companies with the idea that they won't at least in the short term shut down because of covert so then it became that you just looked at the long term earnings you essentially looked through the whole covet event towards the the bounce back you know and now i guess we're we're in the bounce back and the question is have things gotten too fraughty like do there's always this problem in markets where if if investors don't ever sort of get punished for bad behavior for sort of taking inappropriate risk they do more bad behavior take more risk right and so that's kind of what what we're possibly seeing is that not only have investors kind of decided that that there's no way they can lose money but they've also decided that the craziest bets are the best bets you know because if risk doesn't exist well then you just shoot for return while normally you're trying to balance risk in return so okay let me ask you this it seems like every 18 year old with a 100 bucks from their mom can invest easier than ever um but my question is do you think we're actually doing a good job of training these new investors to like think and like we're giving retail investors sometimes like the power of what you might used to give to like an institution but are we training them to actually wield that like like as someone who's taught students what do you think is it like feels like we're giving everyone like f1 cars like you know 100x leverage you know these things that can like completely wreck you uh and then just telling them oh yeah go ahead like there is that thing in in that you know especially new investors they they sort of like i you know i started out investing in the dot-com bubble in the late 90s and it was a very similar thing back then where it was almost like the crazier the company and the wilder the claims the more it went up you know so a lot of people my age kind of piled into all these crazy stocks and everyone said this is madness but you know these guys were making 100 return in a week you know and it looked great for a while and then the problem is that you know reality uh reappeared and you know that that kind of has to happen with everything you know like the the and a lot of people they all think they'll know when to get out and the problem is that that you don't really in fact i have a finance professor friend who i was talking to a while ago and he kind of loves the idea of investing in tesla but it always looks too expensive to him because he kind of you know analyzes it and he he managed to buy tesla a few years ago you know and it instantly it kind of doubled and he and it once again it was too expensive so he sold it and of course it went up 10 times since then and the problem is you know like when you get in and out of these things like you know how do you get back in again you know and and he actually i i like his point of view he says he doesn't feel bad about it at all because he has a system and he follows the system and yes if he broke the system on tesla he'd have way more money but if he broke it on everything else he would have lost all of his money so yeah do you so in that way do you think it's much more uh you'll be much more successful if you just have a system and you stick with your system and don't like basically take short-term lessons from things like tesla which seem like they're very hard to predict well that that's kind of my belief is that well it's just because my approach to investing is essentially like a a back testing approach where i just download a load of data and work out how prices have moved in the past and try and try and invest based upon that and so you know i'm of course going to tell you that that's the best way of doing things because that's how i do things but it seems to me that if you if you can come up with a good system with like good reasons i even say to a lot of people even if you're not kind of a quant investor i i feel that if you buy something write down like just get a notepad write down why you bought it and when you'll sell it like what how much it will have to fall for you to sell it or admit you were wrong and if it goes up at what point is it reasonable to sell or do you hold it forever you know but but to come up with a plan in advance because if you don't have a plan you know one of my favorite quotes is a mike tyson quote i don't know if you have told you this one already um where he says uh you know everyone has a plan in boxing till they get a punch in the face you know and it's the same thing in investing right where people you know they they think they'll get into the stock market and they'll be really rational and and they have great ideas and then you know the minute it either falls too much or rises too much their emotions take control of them and it's gone you know yeah yeah yeah that's absolutely true sp speaking of emotions getting the best of us um meme coins i've just been dying inside watching that all uh that that whole facade go up listen like sheba coin all the floky listen i think personally it's ridiculous speculation bubble i've been very clear about that i think it's basically a ponzi scheme but i heard a large youtuber the other day is finance youtuber telling me over the phone like not for an audience he just goes look i legit think meme coins have inherent value i think the fact they draw attention gets the money that money will then turn into utility somewhere down the road sort of argument like we'll just we'll sell you a plane and then we'll get a lot of money and then we'll build the plane with the money we raise basically uh what do you think about that the problem is you could make that argument about anything you know like to say that there's inherent value to something that's firstly like it's very difficult to say anything that doesn't have cash flows has inherent value right like it's just it's just a thing you know it's kind of the same argument can be made about any sort of collectible like art like uh you know you name it old stamps things like that and so yes there there possibly is something to the idea that if something sort of have has had value for a long time and there's a big community that believes in it that that it could possibly hold on but i'm not sure that that relates to like you know the deal the funny one over the weekend was the omega cryptocurrency you know i guess there was one named that anyhow because it's a greek letter and as soon as it was announced that there was a new variant of the virus people went out and bought the cryptocurrency that has the same name as the virus unbelievable how much did it go up i i believe 900 with the thing i saw you know but but the funny thing is there's actually kind of a long history of this in markets um a guy i used to work with had done all sorts of studies on this and you know whenever there was like good news in we'll say the tech sector every stock would sort of micro or something like that in its name would go up and there's even things where stocks that have ticker symbols that sound like um the ticker symbol of the company that has good news will go up you know and in truth you could build a system to invest based you know to make money to trade based upon that but it's not uh you know if it works it works and i feel you know you can do what you think works but in terms of like for someone to put their money in something as a long-term store of value i really don't think that like you know sort of a coin that's tied to an internet joke has any long-term uh you know investment potential wow the memers are gonna be very upset with you about that the the reddit memers not happy uh okay speaking of reddit let's talk about bitcoin okay uh michael saylor is a famous ceo i don't know if you know that is he's gone a hundred percent basically a hundred percent into bitcoin well he was a big guy in the dot-com bubble as well and now he's back with with the crypto uh well we'll get to that yeah he's he's famous now for claiming that bitcoin will basically do anything for you it'll make you immortal it'll save the world and also by the way make everyone rich uh and incidentally make him rich too which is a nice side effect uh what do you think what do you think of that strategy of all in it's you know we always hear diversify diversify or diversify here's a guy he's putting his entire reputation on one coin you know it slightly depends on what you want to do like if you work nothing and you walk into a casino you should probably take the riskiest highest return bet and odds are you'll you'll you'll probably walk out with nothing but there's a small chance that you'll walk away with a fortune right and that's what that type of bet is so if you've got like a hundred bucks and and you're retiring in three years time you know you've no savings you might need to just roll the dice like as as inappropriate as that is as investment advice but for most people like the way people really grow their wealth and i've seen this with you know hundreds of people like it's most people i see who really grow their wealth and who sort of reach a retirement age with with uh you know a large excessive wealth tend to do it slow and steady like we're just sensible investments that work like they you know investing in in good businesses good ideas you know like yes you can you can go crazy the question is even if you do make a fortune on a crazy bed do you have the good sense then to realize that you just got lucky and now do sensible things afterwards and the problem is not a lot of people do yeah exactly exactly so i want to talk about financial advice youtubers i'll say slash influencers there's been a lot of talk about the hashtag not financial advice movement you know people will give you financial advice but then in a weird get out of jail free card they will just say not financial advice and it absolves them of all responsibility what do you think about that people giving out stock picks sort of more blatantly or i don't know cavalierly than ever it's funny to me it's just it's not something i would do and it's not something that really anyone i know as a professional would do simply because different people have different risk appetites and so on you know and so if if someone it's kind of like being a doctor and going on youtube and saying like this medicine will fix everything that's wrong with you it's like well you know normally before writing a prescription you ask a patient the uh you know to describe their symptoms you know while the problem with a youtuber telling you what you should buy is the is that they don't know your financial situation your goals anything and also it's rather questionable to me like a lot of the financial youtubers i've seen are sort of real estate agents who've worked out that you can give financial advice on the internet and it's not obvious to me that they're very knowledgeable but i i just i wouldn't want to take responsibility for someone's losses like if i announced on my channel that there's this stock that you should definitely buy the the problem with that is like if it goes horribly wrong that person can't come to me and say patrick you you you put me in this thing i i'd say oh i didn't you know and and equally if it goes really well will will they stick to my channel for me to announce that it's now time to get out of it you know it doesn't to me that's not how financial advice works and i'd rather see people learn so that they can give themselves financial advice like if you educate yourself if you read good books on the topic and if you study up on it and learn how professionals look at the market you can then do your own analysis and then of course you're relying on yourself you know you you you know why you made the investment and so you equally know when it might be time to sell for a variety of reasons and to me that's much more value-added than you know there's a lot of youtubers and they're like here's my portfolio this is what i bought this is how much i made it to me like i you know i they they can do what they want but it's just not obvious to me that that's value added for for a viewer now pivoting a bit from that and this is sort of one of the final questions i want to ask you it does feel it does appear to me that the game is rigged okay and so my question is sort of so now what so something i find in crypto a lot is that the influencers and the developers are often in on it they sort of collude marketing deals they have private sales that exclude the average investor they always just sort of know things that the average investor does not and sometimes they include to scam obviously but most of the time they just have more information so the game is the game is tilted and this isn't new though this is sort of always been the case in traditional markets as well of asymmetric knowledge what would you tell investors who are looking at the market they see that but the answer doesn't seem to me to be to just throw up your hands and go i guess i'll never invest in anything because i i you know the game is rigged i don't think that's a good answer what would you tell the people who sort of realized that you know the the game isn't as rigged as people think the problem when you look at things like crypto it's like looking at you know i think uh the head of the sec is described as the wild west and in many ways it's kind of like the most extreme emerging market that there is you know um now good example actually in the united states in the in the 1920s pre the 1929 crash there was a huge uh you know eruption of uh interest in the stock market and stock values went up and it was uh you know in many ways a golden age for investors but equally a golden age for fraudsters where people like charles ponzi and so on appeared around that time with this uh with that growth it was during a time in which uh big companies didn't give you any accounts right like so they'd they'd issue stock in the company partial ownership in the company they wouldn't tell you any accounting any earnings any detail and so people really just invested based on kind of gut feeling and rumors they heard and of course the rumors were all spread by uh you know people trying to try to pump the stock so it all ended horribly in 1929 and that's when a lot of securities regulation came in you know all of the the regulation that the meaningful regulation came in in the early 1930s that basically said that companies can't lie about stuff and they have to issue us a certain amount of detailed information it might need to be audited and so on interestingly you look around the world and in many emerging markets you'll find similar situations to the united states in the in the 1920s and so you look in those countries and you speak to people like you know i've made a series of videos on ever grant the chinese company and all chinese people just invest in real estate okay it's the only thing they invest in and the reason is because they don't trust any of the other stuff and it's because of this sort of questionable accounting and so on now the great thing about the united states is actually it's one of the better regulated markets in the world and so actually you do get a pretty fair shake when you invest in american uh you know kind of blue chip stocks in the united states so not penny stocks but like kind of any respectable big you know exchange traded stock you can invest in is you know they are forced by law to to release honest information on a quarterly basis and so on and this is a good thing and so the problem now is that i think a lot of people look at things like they look at the world of cryptocurrencies and they think that they get the same protections that they get in in the u.s stock market and it's like look you don't get those same protections in a foreign stock market not to mind in cryptocurrencies you know logan paul doesn't care about you and your savings you know no don't tell me that i thought logan cared what i know it's it's amazing that a youtube prankster isn't uh isn't providing the the best financial advice ever crazy it's crazy listen i i do have to actually ask like okay that that is a fair point and i'm i'm glad you balanced that uh that idea out however we do see and i gotta bring it up look we've seen a lot of these stock these uh these nancy pelosi types these uh the i think tom cotton cotton might be another one they're just a bunch of senators who i think it was like over 50 who just this year allegedly have broken the stock act okay which is the insider trading law and it doesn't appear that any of them are gonna face any kind of problems and they all seem to be amazing investors right out of the gate having never been really been into finance before it just seems this amazing thing what do you think about that like should i just copy i'm just starting to think i should copy uh i think it's pelosi's husband who trades it's not actually her it's it's her husband it's just this amazing amazing market i don't know what you'd call it timer uh profit so yeah what do you think about that you know that is a problem but it's something that's kind of it has been dealt with and they're passing new regulation about that so it was actually up until only very recently i forget what year it actually was not against the law for them to trade on the information they had that related to them passing laws because insider information meant information from inside a company rather this was sort of outside information that they gathered within their their careers so of course there have been laws and there are more laws coming to to reduce that but it um you know obviously the thing i don't like about that is it causes people to lose faith in investing and i i really do think you know if you look at the long term returns of the stock market it really is the the best thing to do with your savings like it outperforms real estate it outperforms bonds there's you know it's a really good place for people to put their long-term savings for retirement and of course then when you see these scandals the problem is that people do lose faith and they they decide to make maybe sub-optimal decisions because they they don't want to be scammed um go ahead yeah oh no yeah no i'm chomping at the bit here because you just you just offended a lot of tick-tockers okay they're upset at you because actually a lot of people say look the stock market that's for that's for boomers who don't understand the power of flipping houses or uh you know all these real estate schemes i think real estate's fine i mean real estate you can make money with real estate but i didn't i don't have good data on you know real estate versus stock investing do you do you have something to tell us there i didn't well i mean there's lots you you know you could even just google this and you'll find it like this i i studied with a guy called elroy jimson in london who created a time series of sort of almost every asset in the world like collectibles um real estate bonds stocks uh every country in the world and you're able to look at the you know over 100 years of returns data on that and you really see that just the reason that a a stock investment should earn more than a real estate investment is just simply that a stock that you buy it's actually a business like you're investing in a business and they're creating goods and services and selling them at a profit and that profit then goes to the owners of the business which is the shareholders with real estate in particular if it's a home you live in you're really just getting price appreciation which is kind of driven by dynamics like increase in population or uh or really just inflation you know and a lot of the return you'll see is is tight inflation and then you've got other things like as interest rates come down home prices tend to go up just because people tend to buy them with borrowed money and so the lower the interest rates are the cheaper you can borrow the more money you can borrow for a given cash flow so you can spend more on a house so therefore you see the overall house stock in a country increase in value as rates go down but of course we're now possibly at a low of interest rates and that that's a trade that's worked since 19 i think it's like 1982 when interest rates started falling and have continued to fall since so you know you you kind of need to understand the drivers of the different asset classes in order to to decide how you might invest based upon like how you view the economy at a given point in time that's an amazing answer i i've learned so much here today patrick thank you so much for giving us the stock market secrets and especially that last answer uh was incredibly insightful for understanding why real estate appreciates over time what stocks appreciate over time if people want to find you they can find you at patrick boyle the youtube channel is that right yes yeah that's kind of my main sort of communication tool to the world so yeah guys go subscribe to him he puts out amazing analysis all the time i love to have him on the channel yeah amazing i'm glad we got the chance to do this thank you for having me on all right hope you guys learned something be safe out there thanks for watching see you in the next you one relate this part of the story don't just pan away
