it's no secret that it's been harder than ever to get a job recently there are some really scary things about the recent Tech layoffs that nobody wants to admit but there's also an antidote and actually there's two I'm going to share both of them here so the news has been plastered with tech layoffs every CEO keeps saying we over hired during Co and while that might be true it's actually not the reason for the tech layoffs everybody is kind of lying take a look at this chart here we've got meta with -3% in headcount but their net income is up 73% Paypal down 9% up 76% people keep telling me that there's this big recession about to happen but it seems like everybody's actually doing pretty well so why are they firing people so I'm going to talk about two things one is how do I get hired now and two is maybe I don't care to get hired and I know that sounds strange but just hear me out so there are actually Four trends that are coming together that's detrial for junior devs one is companies did over hire during Co but that explains to 2022 layoffs 18 months later in 2024 that doesn't explain it two Elon Musk bought Twitter and he showed just how much fat truly is in a tech giant say what you about Elon Musk but even his biggest haters can't really deny how much he's brought the operating cost of Twitter down three Junior devs know how to code but they don't have deep knowledge and four AI knows how to code but doesn't have deep knowledge let's explain what the real problem is you have no deep knowledge I feel like there's been no shortage of content lately about how new Junior Engineers have no deep knowledge and honestly I think that content is often promoted by people that also don't have very much deep knowledge deep knowledge is tricky cuz every 6 months I look back and realize just how clueless I was about a technology I was using using 6 months prior most people suffer from the Dunning Krueger effect in the beginning they learn just a little and they're overconfident in their skills they think they're a genius then when they realize how much they don't know they lose all of their confidence and it takes years to build it back up I usually feel like I'm somewhere in the valley despair there's way more to any problem or system than you could possibly know so try to be humble the know-it-all types tend to always be at the peak of Mount stupid I I tend to stay away from those people having said that I do think there's a new age script Kitty phase that people tend to be going through and the answer is simple but not fun you have to eat your broccoli every year people tell me that being a tech is tough cuz you have to stay on top of the latest Technologies honestly I've never understood that I've never had that experience as long as you spend a lot of time learning the fundamentals well you'll see everything else kind of shares the same Beginnings for example let's say I'm learning a new program language and I want to learn how to write a variable easy enough but not if you're a python script Kitty cuz in C++ if you want to learn a variable now you need to know static types pointers references heat memory if I'd gone the other way around well the python variable would have been really easy to learn because it's just the subset of the C++ one usually new technologies don't introduce a new way of doing things they just make the old ways much easier to do so as long as you know your fundamentals you're fine and I guess this would follow up to my next point which is learn something very well if you don't have deep knowledge you need to obtain deep knowledge in something now I've already made videos on my recommendations of what programming language is to learn I'm not going to talk about that here I ultimately don't really care just learn one thing really really well don't worry about running after the new shiny object every 2 minutes there's been an uptick in what I'd call Tech news recently in YouTube and Twitter it's always talking about the latest JS framework or you know why the new jQuery release is really important now I do love that content I spend a lot of time watching that content but I don't use it as a blueprint for what I should be doing it's just so I can sound smar to people when I'm at parties it has no bearing over how much money that I can make in my career when I say learn one thing it it could be anything it could be a tech stack if you're full stack person it could be one backend framework really well if you're backend it could be the lady shiny JS framework if that's what you're into whatever you get the most Joy from learning just learn that learn anything except rust don't learn rust kidding kidding kidding I just wanted to see how much of a reaction I could get rust Fanboys don't come to my house now everybody's being dishonest I think let's talk about ai's real role in all of this so strangely before I talk about that let's talk about OIC OIC has been taking the World by storm they're not today's sponsor by the way there's no sponsor today OIC is a miracle drug that helps people lose weight just by taking a pill the thing is people aren't really being honest about when they're using it they want to pretend like they're just getting there naturally now I was reading Scott Galloway recently and he had this article that was basically explaining how AI is Corporate OIC this is such a good article there are a few points I want to highlight from it quote one recent financial news features two stories layoffs and record profits a company lays off 5 10 even 25% of its Workforce and 6 to 12 months later its operating margin hits new Heights the ultimate peanut butter and chocolate shareholder confection is meta which produced a singular Hall of Fame quarter in Q4 this is actually pretty scary because it tells us what we actually feared which is maybe our Utopia of tech jobs is over and to some degree I think it is in its current form but there are two really redeeming points in this article I want to bring up this will correctly raise concerns about a dystopia where no one can find work but AI will ultimately create jobs is there will be new windows of attack against corporate Titans the AI Revolution will inspire a golden age of startups with lower infant mortality as there will be fewer people I.E less risk required to run sustainably so basically there's much more opportunity in startups and there will be for the coming years so an antidote to if I could sum up this entire channel in one phrase it would be build something that people actually use I've been saying it for years and the reason I've been saying it is teach a man to fish I want you guys to understand that coding doesn't have to be a cute little job where you get a nice pat on the head from Daddy meta and possibly a paycheck if they think you're still valuable for now you can literally create value and you can create it in a scalable way you can be rewarded 1,000x for your input now I get that this isn't what everybody wants to do in life but I want you guys to be really conscious about making that decision imagine yourself as aing from Airbender I keep telling you that you're the Avatar but you just kind of want to keep being a kid and have someone else take care of you you have way more power in your own life I'm trying to help you realize that if you haven't already if you learn to fish you'll realize you don't actually need a tech job in fact this could be the best time for you to start a startup AI dramatically lowered the bar for creating a sex AI dramatically lowered the bar for creating a new successful Tech startup if meta can use it why can't you use it against them specifically with llms there's so much unlocked opportunity that people can do and here's the thing everybody is trying to hire a senior Dev but senior devs have just as much llm experience as you or I do because llms are so new even if you decide not to make a startup if you're currently unemployed how could building a real product that people actually enjoy hurt you even if it's just an open source project or a free product you're going to learn the skills that make you super valuable as a senior engineer I think the future is full of billion dooll companies that were started because their Founders were laid off from kushy tech jobs right now when it comes to startups I just launched one one year ago and I have to admit I've learned more in one year than I did from 3 and 1 half years working at Microsoft I'm going to give you some advice you don't have to take it my goal on this channel is to never be The Annoying knit all kid to be that kid on the Polar Express or Professor Umbridge and Harry Potter so many people in the world say you have to do everything in a very specific way but you don't really you just have to find what works for you and I'm going to share what worked for me you need to understand the entire process of software engineering end to end if you want to actually get deep knowledge on anything it's one thing to develop on Local Host it's another thing to figure out how to get that product into the world get people using it get feedback and iterate on it that's what you hire senior Engineers for you hire senior Engineers to design these systems and then they basically just tell the junior Engineers what to code and because you're stuck down down here you have yet to experience the Deep knowledge you can get from owning something end to end so there's one recurring theme that I've felt in my computer science career and that is you can either go for the candy or the broccoli the people that always eat the candy never develop deep knowledge because they're just going for the new shiny thing they don't understand the fundamentals and the people that always go for the broccoli never build anything very interesting because they always need to build their own custom solution and they can't build off of the shoulders of other people so you need to consume just enough broccoli that you really appreciate the candy and understand how the candy is made my analogy fell apart but I think you get what I mean now I want to employ the gentleman's agreement between you and I if you've watched one or more of my videos before and you enjoyed it then uh you have to subscribe that enables me
