every morning I get to wake up around 11AM go 
into my home office where I spend about two   minutes typing in some prompts to AI put out my 
hands get fed millions of dollars for this work   I do and then close my computer and go on with 
my day this is the life of a prompt engineer what   exactly is a prompt engineer why does it pay so 
much and is it worth actually learning to become   one or is this a job that in a few years will 
fizzle out these are all questions we are going   to be answering in today's video we keep hearing 
and seeing on the news or in job postings about   these high paying roles called prompt engineers 
and of course this has become a recent hype with   AI becoming about and there's really two main 
camps or parties if you will one team being   like prompt Engineers not a real job and the 
other team being like this is the way we are   moving to this is in demand I mean some companies 
are paying over 300 000 us for this role for a   reason all right let's explore this role answer 
some questions around it and well get into it now I think to start with prompt engineer gets 
kind of a bad reputation because we oversimpify   the role we think oh prompt engineer my grandma 
can do that all I need to do is put in a prompt   and the AI will give me results in reality 
though what a prompt engineer does is much   more complex than just that prompt engineer is 
a professional who yes works with generative AI   models such as you know chat GPT gpt4 and others 
now these models have gone through what is called   reinforcement learning from Human feedback which 
is how we are able to quote unquote speak to them   but more technically speaking give them prompts 
and they give us what sounds like a human response   however these systems are not perfect by any 
means they are still in their early stages   a lot of times they have trouble understanding a 
prompt or a query and then also to giving a proper   response prompt Engineers role comes in at this 
point where they come up with ways to make the   AI system produce a proper response one common 
technique that is used by prompt Engineers is   called Chain of Thought thoughts prompting which 
involves breaking down a query into sub queries   and some people in the industry the industry term 
that sounds so Tech probably but some people in   the industry also call this prompt engineering on 
steroids so I think this is a good point to do a   real world example let's do an example of let's 
say Healthcare a prompt engineer who is hired by   a Healthcare company or a tech company that is 
managing some healthcare technologies will might   be employed to refine the request that is made of 
generative AI in order to help doctors generate   more notes more efficiently with less errors so 
they're essentially going in and working with the   AI and making sure that the responses the AI 
is giving is more accurate based on whatever   prompt the doctor puts it it doesn't have to be 
as specific or structured in a certain way so   what skills are really required to become a prompt 
engineer can anyone become one and I think this is   why so many people are really hating or disliking 
on this prompt engineering role is because it   feels was like it's so easily accessible I know a 
lot of individuals who are Engineers are upset of   why are these people getting these titles of 
engineer when they're not an engineer that's   you know personal preference I guess or is it 
I don't know anyway that's a whole other topic   we're not going to go there but at the end of the 
day there are some really interesting skills that   are required to become a prompt engineer it's 
not something that anyone can just walk up and   get a job just like that paying three hundred 
thousand dollars plus there is a lot of skills   that are required for this job and the credentials 
really vary based on what company you are looking   to apply for this role at as I mentioned earlier 
in this video for people who are looking to get   into a specific industry so whether it be health 
care whether it be Fashion Beauty you will have to   have a background in that expertise as to what 
you are applying as we know Tech touches every   single industry now these roles with AI will 
affect every industry so the first thing is   if you are applying for a specific type of prompt 
engineer that works for a specific area as I just   mentioned you will also need to be to some degree 
an expert in that field because you are creating   prompts working with the AI to ensure that it is 
accurate and in order to do that you need to have   knowledge of the subjects you are teaching it 
other skills that might be required on some job   postings and on others I'm seeing are not but 
really important to have in my opinion having   a background in coding and machine learning might 
not be required on all job postings but definitely   is very important will help you succeed in this 
role having a background with coding knowledge   can become really helpful when you are creating 
systematic evaluations of prompts and working   with coding tasks now as far as machine learning 
goes this is very helpful as well and in some   cases necessary in order to really understand 
the overall strengths and weaknesses of AI   models now despite these technical skills it's 
not required of a prompt engineer you're not   going to be sitting there typically coding but 
having this knowledge as background will help   you substantially also too of course logical 
thinking reasonable skills can be crucial for   understanding how the AI will act these are 
skills that are really important and when it   comes to logical thinking this is a skill that you 
often pick up with coding skills so although it's   not required to have a background in coding if 
you do I think you will find this role a lot   easier and on that note I think you'll be able 
to negotiate a higher salary because of that   past experience I don't understand why do they 
get paid so much great question let me explain   prompt engineer actually before I even get 
into that let's clear something up here prompt   engineer does not always pay a ton of money 
we see these articles talking about it paying   so well and there are use cases which I will get 
to that do pay well but also too there are times   where prompt engineering roles right now are not 
that high paying relatively speaking there's a   really big range in those roles now what if I told 
you being a prompt engineer had the potential in   some cases to save people's lives let me explain 
I found this article here that was sharing a story   about a graduate research fellow who was working 
in the Innovation and digital Health accelerator   in Boston's Children's Health hospital and he 
is part and this individual named Benjamin is   part of a team that is hiring for prompt engineers 
and they are hiring to have someone who can come   in and work with generative AI to help doctors 
generate notes faster he explains he needs someone   who can help us refine the ass of the generative 
AIS so the information we're spitting out is   limited in hallucinations and each of these tasks 
he goes on to say is going to be really Niche very   specific their internal system isn't trained on 
Wikipedia and Reddit but instead by sensitive   notes about diagnosis patient billing information 
and comments between medical professionals about a   given patient in an extremely specific context 
see how this role can all of a sudden become   very important very intentional very meaningful 
when you start putting people's lives on it and   thinking about it in the realm of healthcare now 
this is one example of a very high paying prompt   engineering role and let's go into something more 
that's a little bit more generic because as we've   seen as well that can still be very high paying 
even with open ai's job posting around a prompt   engineer it was more generic it focused more 
on the technical side of things the technical   knowledge that you should possess or have 
experienced so there is the flip side to both   having that knowledge is really what is key and 
being someone who is very logical and a critical   thinker now now I've seen job postings going from 
40 000 USD to 350 000 us for compensation so this   definitely does range and I think that example of 
healthcare is such a great one to really highlight   how this job is legit and it's needed in a lot of 
fields for specific cases so are these jobs going   to be around in the future or are they here one 
day and gone the next this is another question   that a lot of people including myself have really 
been digging into to try and understand because on   one hand it seems like this in so many cases is 
here to stay it's really needed but on the other   the way AI is going it makes you really wonder 
will AI just get to a point where it doesn't have   a prompt engineer anymore that it's just its own 
prompt engineer well let's go back to that story   of the individual who's working at the Children's 
Hospital he actually goes on to quote that having   a trained person interacting with AI is going to 
be important for a really long time that might   not be the case for all Fields but certainly for 
a Health Care system and I think this is a really   great example of how this role will be needed in 
many different Industries very specific use cases   but it might not be the generic or as common of 
a job as we keep on hearing about today in any   case though I don't think that's a reason to not 
explore this rule if you are interested in it as   we've seen with every job especially with AI and 
the way it is going it's continuing to evolve this   isn't something new and if you are interested 
in prompt engineering and maybe starting out   with a very lucrative potential of a job why not 
go for it the skills you will build through that   the networks the connections you will build 
through that you can continue to build upon   whether you are if you're basing your decision 
right now on will this job be around in the next   five or ten years I don't think you're asking 
the right questions it's more so will I want to   continue to learn and grow with tech as it does 
as well because that doesn't just affect prompt   engineering roles it affects all roles alright 
I hope you enjoyed this video going through what   exactly is a prompt engineer how to become one 
and why does it pay so much leave in the comments   so are you interested in this role do you think 
this role is legit do you think it's a joke or how   do you feel about it I'm really curious to hear 
your comments and as always I'll do my absolute   best to respond to every single one if you haven't 
already make sure to hit that subscribe button if   you really enjoyed these type of videos leave down 
in the comments other topics you want me to cover   that's how I make these videos is for you alright 
I'll see you all soon thanks everyone [Music] [Music] thank you
