in late august of 1945 stalin and the soviet union appointed kim il-sung to lead the new occupation government in the northern part of the korean peninsula after the japanese surrender stalin probably would have preferred a soviet korean to run things but those people had little familiarity with the korean nation and kim came highly recommended by his fellow gorillas over time kim il-sung would purge his enemies remove any challenge to his power and center society completely around him in this video we look at how the democratic people's republic of korea constructed a cult of personality around its founding father and his family but first let me thank our sponsors at the asian armature newsletter i'll make it quick lately i've been putting more time and effort into the newsletter this includes an exclusive video on the hong kong dollar and another on semiconductors we can send to venus the link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show in september 1945 kim was presented to the public as a hero of the korean people his first ever appearance in the official newspaper of the workers party of korea the rodong sinmun refers to him as simply commander kim il-sung stalin on the other hand is referred to as the generalissimo the supreme guide of the weak and small nations in the whole world it is a lofty term and surprising to see in light of what would happen afterwards in december 1945 the soviets appointed him the chief secretary of the northern bureau of the communist party prior to this it had not been certain whether the man would be able to stay in power but now kim's position as the leader of the emerging dprk proto state was assured all political regimes feature the individual praise of their rulers just the nature of the beast but mere praise does not make a cult what defines a cult is that its leader is widely worshipped and venerated usually in a coordinated fashion this veneration goes far beyond mere praise and is a phenomenon in which it does not matter whether the followers are being sincere or genuine in their worship the term cult a personality of course dates to nikita khrushchev's 4-hour long secret speech in 1956 the speech would have large repercussions in the soviet world and we will revisit it later in the december 1945 issue of the rodong an article appeared titled the brilliant history of comrade kim il-sung's struggle it hailed kim's achievements as a gorilla a few weeks later kim would have the opportunity to address the nation in january 1st 1946 his first new year address a tradition he carried until his death in 1994. in may 1946 the rodong printed a list of propaganda slogans and in here two significant changes first was that stalin received a demotion he went from the generalissimo and supreme guide to quote friend of the korean people commander kim il-sung on the other hand became chairman kim il-sung the great leader of the korean nation october 1946 the country's first university opened and it was named after him kim il-sung university the university would be the country's first institution to be named after the growing leader in september of 1948 the democratic people's republic of korea was formally proclaimed and the soviet army withdrew from the korean peninsula the dprk's founding comes a month after the establishment of the republic of korea down south i want to take another pause here to discuss cult-building activities historically leadership cults have emerged in states showing three distinct categories of behavior first is the centralized production of praise and propaganda state power is directly leveraged to produce fawning content about the leader while preventing unauthorized works from circulating omnipresent praise of the leader's charisma and capabilities are often placed in public areas second is loyalty signaling or the creation of a common knowledge that those who publicly recognize the leader and his exceptional qualities will be rewarded and on the other side of the coin those who fail to get in line will be punished for instance those people wearing the mao badge during the cultural revolution or memorize quotes from the little red book these rewards and punishments need not be material sometimes people might be simply seeking to avoid social disapproval from their peer group but physical harassment or worse are not uncommon the third ingredient would be the use of cultural objects and rituals cult objects do not represent the leader per se but signifies some connection to them for instance during the chinese cultural revolution people started carrying mangoes pictures of mangoes were being put on commercial products and so on the mangoes are not a literal symbol of mao but rather convey his exceptional qualities or status rituals of worship are a way to intensify the emotions of the people so to build strong attachments to both the leader and the cult object they are encouraged by the state and its regime elites to build upon communal identity and over time create a shared language between the people kim's star was on the rise but the soviets held ultimate authority in north korea throughout the late 1940s and they styled the country after their own a centralized government with local level branches and the facade of a multi-party system for instance the korean democratic party nominally non-communist it was in reality allied with the ruling wpk and led by cho yong kong first supreme commander of the korean people's army and secret wpk member the north korean economy would be an orthodox centrally planned one with the goal of suppressing markets the state owned every business and provided every job and in 1946 the country seized land from its former owners and redistributed to the people the goal was to craft the stalinist little ussr that remains in the soviet sphere of influence thus the soviets implemented the kim il-sung cult for the dprk because the soviets had a cult of their own at the time the one they had for stalin the soviets followed a similar playbook for other countries they occupied after world war ii east germany czechoslovakia poland and so on in 1950 kim il-sung and the north koreans invaded south korea and started the korean war initial success soon gave way to a u.n counter-attack and then starting in 1951 a long stalemate on the 38th parallel domestically the situation was not good for kim he started the whole war after all and now it was going terribly at this point kim began purging his political enemies for their supposed mismanagement of the war effort in a likely effort to deflect blame in 1951 kim purged ho kae a soviet korean ho and kim disagreed over the future direction of the workers party ho wanted one more in line with the soviet party in that it should be run by the elites kim on the other hand preferred a mass line party more like china's the purge of the soviet koreans and the soviet union's general aloofnus throughout the korean war were the first signs of separation between the two countries and a further centralized kim's personal power in the dprk in february 1956 soviet leader khrushchev delivers his famous secret speech at the 20th congress of the cpsu the subsequent destalinization trend leads to a general thaw across the world's socialist countries several stalinist governments in east europe for instance poland and bulgaria fell and were replaced with more liberal ones these changes were not welcome in north korea the kim il-sung cult like as i mentioned is modeled on stalin's kim told the soviet embassy that he would implement its recommendations but the rohdong deleted the speech's comments on the cult of personality kim received a dressing down in moscow from crucia for his continued stalinist style of rule it opened the door for two factions of dprk communists backed by the soviet union and the prc to challenge his grip on power in a situation called the august incident kim used the secret police to track and eventually purge the reformists rather severely actually the purges would continue for several years with the last big wave in 1960 several faction members had to flee the country crossing the yalu river into china ultimately this solidified kim il-sung's grip over his country only 75 of the 527 members of the wpk central committee survived the purges kim and his guerrilla faction emerged with the greater share with 68 percent of the central committee seats however the whole kerfuffle also meant that his personality cult had to lay low for a little while throughout this time in the early 1960s official newspapers referred to kim by his job title the premier the cult certainly still existed foreigners there can feel it and kim still received praise especially during his birthday celebration when they referred to him as the esteemed comrade however cult-building activities you might say were at a minimum in 1955 kim il-sung gave a speech introducing his ideology juche which roughly means master of one's own self i'm not really going to go too heavy into this but the ideology's overarching principle is self-reliance the ideology soon developed into one where the dprk strove to achieve independence in politics self-sustenance and economics and self-defense and military to achieve this the nation must come together under the guidance of a leader who is at the center of society thus loyalty to that leader is number one the north korean government by now was honing its system for cementing that leader into the center of society the government began circulating new messages amongst the north korean diaspora living in japan pyongyang aligned koreans there published history books about kim's childhood and his guerrilla activities against the japanese their newspapers started referring to him as the esteemed leader and other lofty titles remember what i said about the three activities at cult building the north korean diaspora in japan would see the first of those activities the centralized production of praise and propaganda in 1967 kim il-sung wiped away the last remaining dissonant elements within his party and country within his guerrilla faction a number of his former comrades still remembered him as merely commander kim il-sung rather than as a living god they resisted his cult and led by pak kum chol a fellow gorilla and the country's second most powerful politician they would attempt a final overthrow this group was known as the kapsan faction and kim il-sung soon became aware of it and on may 25th 1967 he gave a speech attacking the faction calling for a monolithic ideological system centered only on him the faction was purged and now there would be nothing left to hold back the cult of personality growing around kim il-sung and his family it truly was a turning point in the country's history kim's son kim jong-il had a significant role to play in the cult's intensification up until the may 25th speech in 1967 the regime's leading successor was presumed to be kim il-sung's little brother kim yong-joo kim yong-joo recently died actually in december 2021 at the age of 101 what a life anyway the little brother said to be more of a classical marxist lost out in a power struggle kim il-sung appointed his 26 year old son to carry out the instruction that he gave at the meeting the younger kim well aware that he shouldn't mess this up went all in in 1967 the rodong ramped up its use of the word suryong or leader over a hundredfold from the previous year the state once more started referring to kim il-sung as the steam leader and added new titles like the ever victorious steel commander and of course the great leader in other words the centralized production of excessively flattering praise and propaganda notably the party dictated that all north koreans had to wear a kim il-sung badge on their clothing in other words the creation of loyalty signaling efforts kim il-sung's birthday on april 15th became a national holiday the most important day of the year the day of the sun on this day the nation holds massive military parades exhibitions and athletic competitions north koreans start laying commemorative wreaths and floral baskets at thousands of kim il-sung statues children receive candy and cookies at ceremonies in school after which they bow in front of kim portraits and say thank you in other words rituals and cult objects this is not a comprehensive view of all of north korea's cult-building activities i left out the massive golden kim il-sung statue but you get the point kim eventually expanded this cult of personality beyond himself to his entire family and has been used notably as a mechanism for succession a challenge for any authoritarian dictatorship while a couple modern regimes have gone from a founder to their children very few have managed to transition from the second generation to a third that egg succeeded shows just how much the family cult has been institutionalized within the north korean political system kim's descendants are now said to possess a sacred bloodline and the country's entire political system revolves around it it will be difficult to build a new system without that line being present in some way alright that's it for tonight
