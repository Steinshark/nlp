ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the freestyle Chess Championship ongoing here in February of 2024 this is a mixed format type of event with rapid chess classical long games of Chess and every single game that these players play is Fisher random or chess 960 where there are 960 possible opening setups I guess technically it's 959 because we don't count the traditional one uh it's been a tremendous ride so far today I will cover the games from the fifth through eth place kind of consolation bracket but I will also cover games from the semi-finals and uh we really should not have angered Magnus Carlson I don't know if this man got mad if he got inspired or what but oh my goodness uh I Will Show You dingl Ren versus Al Resa fua I will show you Vincent kimer versus guesh and I will show you Fabiano Carana versus lean Rodan and for whatever reason like the cut off here is just removing the Y and the G I don't know what's happening on ch.com but they're cutting off the Y's and the G's from all the players names my friends dingly Ren is the current reigning defending world champion of Chess and he is not having a good time he has played uh nine games and he has um he has one point he has uh he made two draws and he's lost seven games of Chess and now he is in the bracket to get fifth sixth seventh and eighth place and he's playing Ali Resa fuja and and it is a very unique setup by the way so D4 is actually a Kings Pawn opening right this is the setup that we have if you're wondering like I said fish are random you can look it up a lot of different setups and so on uh D4 played and um oliv Resa plays F5 so it's the Dutch defense kind of this is in traditional circumstances this is the Dutch defense players develop their pawns like this and oliv Resa opens up the center right away trying to get his bishop and his Queen active this bishop is active as well ding keeps the tension with Knight to D3 trying to get his opponent to capture maybe play E4 Ali RZA also keeps the tension bringing out his Knight to defend the center Knight G3 and ding's horse goes for a walk all right he's going to take his uh horse down the Oldtown Road he's going to ride till he can't no more he's attacking this Pawn on G7 which would then attack the queen oliv Resa thinks for a bit plays Knight E7 whoa Knight this is actually a fast fascinating position dingens I'm going Queen H4 uh Knight H5 is almost a losing move dingly Ren is nearly in a losing position after six turns and the reason is kind of insane this Pawn rather this Pawn does not need to be protected because the Knight has no way home you cannot play G4 because I just go here you have no way home you now have to go in and perish this is absolutely unbelievable ding plays Knight H Knight G3 Knight H5 and Ali Resa finds this beautiful defensive resource and ding has to go here and now G5 and the reigning defending world champion of Chess is going to lose a night after six moves this is the cruelty of Fisher random this is the cruelty of Chess 960 of free style chess of Chess 9 Alx or whatever damn branding they want to throw on it to make it more mainstream F4 Knight to H5 white is lost because there's no way to protect the Knight you can't take the pawn you can't take the pawn you get trapped so dingoes Queen H4 G5 he's got to take if you're wondering he can't play here because he's just going to lose the the piece maybe there was a way out like maybe he could have played Queen G4 he could have went here Bishop here Knight G7 he could have lost the queen Knight here then he could have went like here here and yeah there there tried to escape no no no no no no G5 he he he takes and he just straight up goes down a night he's just straight up down to piece like there was one way to survive and he did not find it and you know again he he ended up kind of looking like a gen is because he had a bit of an advantage like with pieces meaning his pieces were very strong and he was pressuring a lot but oi Resa goes here and just develops the rest of his pieces and castles queenside and he's just up a whole piece ding has 1 two 3 four five six seven pawns versus Ali resa's four so ding is not totally losing but Ali Resa just brings out the rest of his he just simplifies and starts an attack and I mean this Rook over here is actually doing a huge amount of damage the bishop is a sniper White's extra pawns are not felt and Ali Resa plays cleanup look at this Knight D5 what a nice idea to take you can't take back oh my goodness you can't take back because of Bishop B6 and Ali Resa cleans up Queen H2 ding resigns resigns because Queen H1 is on the way white just has nothing you can't play Queen D4 because I go here and I get Queen G1 and I win and and and and Ali Resa just wins he just wins with black I mean that is completely nuts what a defensive resource Knight back to E7 saying come and get some and dingly run is now one out of 10 two draws and eight losses that is unfathomable and today there was a screenshot cuz the players are wearing heart rate monitors uh just to you know make it more exciting for the fans and uh there was a moment his heart rate was 160 which like I hope that's a glitch cuz 160 is like running I mean that that would be really tragic if his if he had like anxiet or panic because of I don't know chess or something I really I don't know I don't know what I don't know what's going on I feel bad because I have to cover the games you know I just I don't know all right let's keep moving gcash versus Vincent kimer now we will analyze the uh the openings that the players are playing uh in every one of these games so uh we will be taking a look at like what type of opening setup so uh in this particular game they chose this setup all right in this game they chose this setup but um yeah let's keep moving right along so gukesh Vincent kimer these guys decide to attack the center right away they try to open up the king and the queen Knight G6 identical position Knight B3 Knight D6 so that's the way uh the imbalance is immediately created Knight B3 Knight D6 and now kukes plays Knight F5 so he voluntarily moves a piece two times but his idea is to of course dislodge the the defense of the center so making it difficult to defend the center yeah Vincent's not going to do that Vincent instead plops his Knight on C4 and says hey uh gkes who's going to protect this Pawn gkes plays Queen C3 which defends and now we have an opening of the center De Fe Ed Queen D4 check and Vincent voluntarily moves his King so he can't castle that way and he can't cast that way either but he correctly evaluated that for this moment in time for In This Moment In Time right here despite being weakened of the king bues can't do anything he can't develop that way and he can't develop that way and if white plays Bishop F2 black will play C6 bring the bishop and get in so you could Castle but then I go here and you're gonna lose a rook because that's Fisher freaking random for you so that's not gonna work suddenly gesha is like wait a minute plays Knight E3 and Vincent just brings out his Queen brings out his Knight gcas tries to create counterplay now we have Knight takes E3 check because it's Fisher random and the damn King is in the center and queen B4 and Vincent is just targeting the white position it is not easy to make a move here now gesh makes a king move to get the king out of the center but now here comes A5 and the bishop oh my goodness who called for an order of the Bishop from the edge of the board Knight C5 Rook d8 it looks like you didn't even need to Castle and now Knight C4 is a threat everything is a threat C3 Queen C4 Knight back to D7 you can't move the Knight because you are pinned lukash plays here and Vincent is up a night and Aon and then then he ends the game in style Rook D1 he ends the game in style Bishop E6 targeting The Rook targeting the queen and if you take the queen I take your queen and if you take I take and then if you take I take and you are down a knight in an end game and I don't care if we started with Fisher random chess 960 or chess 9 Alx I will beat you in this end game because you are down a night that was a weird one that was a weird game this game played between uh Ding and fuja had a very you know obscure kind of setup where this happened but in this game these guys open up the center right away and then somehow when the dust has settled move nine white was lost which is which is weird like this is a weird type of Chess man this is a weird type of Chess and the players don't even realize it like stuff just happens and then that's it and then the game is over so we will keep an eye out now here is we're in the semi-finals now and we will get to this incredible game between Magnus and Norbeck but this is the other semi-final right and this is Levon versus Fabiano these guys have played each other probably like 70 times if not 100 times uh E4 E5 so these guys just play like a E4 E5 game but then there we see this setup we saw this exact same setup chosen by gesh this exact position right right this is a carbon copy but Fabiano plays these three and then plays Bishop C4 okay so plays Bishop C4 that's not a move that we've seen yet Knight C2 clearly Fabiano's idea was to get rid of this bishop he did not he thought that Bishop was an issue and he thought getting rid of it was going to be easier B3 and there he takes that was Fabiano's idea that is why he spent 13 minutes and decided you know what before I do anything I'm going to play Bishop C4 I want to trade the bishop which is interesting I mean we we'll see if this decision was correct Queen F7 and now Levon has many choices but he just takes as much space as possible just like in traditional chess space is good man it is really difficult to play a game of chess when you don't have space all right when you are lacking Fabiano castles and Levon doesn't wait at all he plays D5 he just continues to March forward into Fabiano's territory and this is a very close position both sides have eight Pawns in positions like this you look at maneuvers of pieces but you also look at Pawn breaks and I got news for you fabbiano ain't never playing this move F5 he is never playing that move for two reasons number one is loses a pawn but even if it doesn't lose a pawn it opens up the line of assault at your king and I'm not sure you want to do that so Fai takes takes blades and says all right do your worst and according to the computer the position is in the balance Levon plays here Queen F2 and Castle short and this is our position and this game will be one and lost either by infiltrating the queen side or by shutting down the the queen side not allowing black to get in on the queen side and then attacking over here but white is going to control the pace of this game so the cards are now fully in the hands of leavon Here Comes Fabiano like I just said King to H1 and his idea is to kick out this Knight he doesn't want to take and transform the structure so he moves his King out of the way to enable this move otherwise that would have been a fork Fano captures he captures because there's no point going backwards that Knight is just going to be a target for White's attack so Knight E2 Queen E2 fabbi is down in space so he wants to trade some pieces leevon brings out his Bishop says if you want to take my Bishop you can take my Bishop all right but I'm not taking your Bishop you got to take my Bishop all right D6 Bishop back to D2 Bishop into D4 and here comes Rook D1 remember I told you a while ago controlling this black can't get in so nothing in White's position is accessible nothing which which means leavon has made the necessary preparations and now the only way forward here for white is F4 you have completely and totally shut down the queen side these Rooks are symbolic Fabiano braces himself spends seven minutes finds the wrong idea the right idea was apparently Queen E8 queen d8 queen B6 for reasons I cannot explain to you that is what the engine wants him to play or Rook B8 and Bishop A7 again if you put stockfish on trial in a courtroom it wouldn't be able to defend its story H6 however is what Fabiano plays because he has an idea to create a defensive setup But Here Comes Levon and Levon is a monster when he gets creative and when he begins attacking he completely shuts down Black's position and now if Levon at any point is able to play H4 G5 and get in he's going to win so Fabby plays here Levon doesn't trade Fabby plays here Levon does trade by damaging black pawns now Fabiano was relying on Rook to C3 we're going to see who's right and who's wrong Queen G3 Rook d8 immediately he takes the file he weakened D6 he made his opponent go here now he takes over Rook D7 and there's H4 Levon calling the shots from start to finish Rook C8 let's trade I'll replace the Rook your knight goes to E7 I'll make a preparatory move I'm not going to rush your queen goes back who's going to defend the pawn in the center that you put there a while ago I got news for you nobody and guess guess what your queen steps away I'm not even going to take your queen stepped away from the defense of your king G5 hello Knight G8 defending everything and now Levon makes a very big decision he locks the position completely the point is that black will now suffocate there is absolutely no way out all of these pawns are now liabilities because if we ever get into an end game and I win one of them it's over so not only does your king have no breathing room and back rank made is always possible now I turn my focus to winning the pawn in the center of the board in this position he could have just taken on D4 but he opted for this and the computer doesn't even begin to realize that this is a really really bad position for black it's still trying to claim like Queen d8 and there's a fortress and black can't get in and maybe this is what Fabiano should have gone for but he goes here and then they get the 40th move of the game right they get their bonus time and Fabiano sneaks in but that's not what he should have done apparently instead of that he should have went Queen d8 put his Queen on A5 and all Fabiano can hope for is Perpetual check this is the most miserable King and Knight in the history of King and knight ever Queen B2 and Fabiano does get in and get a pawn but leavon now has a complete Clean Slate yes material is equal but it's not going to be equal for long Bishop C2 he gets the pawn on D6 you may wonder why is Fabiano just not defending his Pawns C5 that's why because when Levon suffocated these pieces that was for this how miserable is this position how look at you can't move your only move is to lose the night and you play H5 play D7 d8 best part is I'm going to play D7 d8 I'm going to make a knight I'm going to mate you not actually because you'll go here but it's misery and it's just a matter of time Levon just has to avoid Perpetual check he gets his Pawn as far as possible and uh he's going to win the game because once he escapes Perpetual check the Pawn's going Fabiano resigns what a game by Levon what a game by Levon he took this space Advantage all the way to the bank this game must have felt horrible this must have felt like a root canal for Fabiano oh my goodness and I'm a fan of Fabiano but let me tell you something let me tell you something I love that I love that clip this this is hard I mean this is Fabiano's got to get revenge tomorrow Levon leads this semi-final one to nothing now again I will just circle back to the opening in this game obviously very obscure uh not a full setup like this not a full setup like this one lastly we have Magnus Carlson versus no Abdus satov which of course is a very fun matchup of generations um and um yeah here we go grub leave it to Magnus all the other sheep playing in the center now obviously I'm not insulting the players it's a joke I'm just saying that everybody else is playing in the center Magnus Carlson sits down and he plays the grub and he wrote it on a score sheet too uh a score sheet they they posted like you know him notating I don't know why players still have to write the moves down I think it's like for claiming 40th move or whatever but um he also said it was 2023 we've all done that what is like the cut off by which you should not be writing 2023 on your dates anymore uh in the in the new year um I don't actually know so anyway Gro Nock is a principled man Nock is the youngest ever uh man to win a world championship title I I keep saying this he was 17 years old uh hoon is the youngest woman to have ever won a she's actually the youngest person ever to win a world championship in any field 16 and she won the overall uh Women's World Championship no won the rapid World Championship at the age of 17 and uh he said many times like he doesn't there's there's no there's no respect there he's trying to beat Magnus every game Knight G3 F6 D4 okay wait I beg your Parton isn't this not protected yeah absolutely this is a pawn Gambit by Magnus whose idea must have been F4 to take space and if NOC had played C5 I actually think Magnus would have just went straight up Gambit Style and just gotten an initiative and played like this I mean I have no idea but I'm not exaggerating he straight up is giving up a pawn maybe he would have gone Gambit style right away I I don't know I I don't know but what a move what a concept we we have yet to see if it's going to be good or not Nock says no thank you he says you you can take my Pawn now we do see this setup employed you know the world champions of the world playing the same type of structure over here now we have F3 so longterm this bishop stays open we're we're going to obviously move the C Pawn at some point in the future and this bishop is going to stay open as well and where are the guys going to Castle because we've seen everything right we saw these guys just straight up strap a dynamite and blow open the center we saw here tragedy as ding ventured in and tried to get this Pawn these guys played a very unique setup but what's going to happen here Pawn takes Bishop takes n plays C5 and before Magnus can get started moving he plays C4 so he takes the fight directly to Magnus and forces Magnus to give up his Bishop to damage Black's Pawn structure create potential long-term weaknesses right in chess Bishop for Knight is not usually a good deal but um this is Fisher random so nobody knows anything about this format and the truth is when you give up a dark squared Bishop for a knight inherently what happens well white loses an attacker on the dark Square black loses a controller of both colors black loses a controller of light and dark so after takes takes and Knight B4 who's going to stand up for the light squares in the center right now we have C3 so Magnus Now by trading the dark squared Bishop will regroup and potentially create a fortress on the dark squares and Target Black's weak Pawn fascinating so I just you know I would love to know what goes in his head when he trades this and he plays like this and now C3 Bishop Bishop F4 from Nock apparently an error apparently it would have been better to play G6 negating the forward mobility of this Knight then moving on with the rest of the game but he opts for Bishop F4 which kind of cuts the position for white and clearly his idea was to reroute the bishop over here where he thought my Bishop is better placed than your knight Magnus says okay F4 let me wall out your Bishop that you just put there I love how this is just like a silent debate of who's the bigger idiot like that's the I mean that's really what chess is all about even at 500 where you're both idiots but you know even at my level of Chess I'm also an idiot and so is my opponent so it's basically the idiot to make the last mistake this is like you know Galaxy brain level chess I mean like it was it smart for norre to put B I don't know F4 he castles long Magnus brings the Knight back and is like okay well your Bishop doesn't really have a role in the game and by by the way I just want to say what about D4 I mean this looks absolutely horrifying if I'm playing white but guess what combo Bishop F5 and I long Castle too so it's kind of like a bait you know it's kind of like I'm baiting you in and I'm ready for the counter punch so norre decides I'm not going to do any of that I'm going to spend 10 minutes and now I'm going to not allow the Knight to come forward and I'm also going to block your Bishop Magnus plays E3 so instant replay Magnus took the Knight on B6 now look at these three pawns this is very smart positional chess C3 F4 E3 so now I've slowly put a bunch of my pawns on the dark squares and I've left you with a weakness and doubled pawns that could be weak in the future nobe best move Queen D7 it's a very tense game though all right he's got ideas of his own he's going to go here and Target this Pawn where's Magnus going to commit his King by the way Magnus defends the pawn like this nck puts the rook in the center now a big moment white can actually already begin a fight on the queen side and castle that way white can castle that way right now right white could go this way right now get the king out of the center what is white going to do can he play Bishop C2 and Castle this way probably so he could leave his king castle that way castle that way or start an attack and it's all good and he's got 40 minutes to figure out so he plays Knight C2 and decides my knight doesn't have roll there I'm going to reposition and defend myself NOC can also begin advancing can double up his Rooks can bring his Knight into the game he opts for Bishop to f8 rerouting off of this to the C5 Square now Magnus plays B4 stopping Bishop C5 and inviting the on passant capture inviting this because obviously that would open up his rook and since no committed his King he might not want to get involved in any of that and as you can see from the trade white is now better so B4 is a big decision yet another active dark squared pawn bishop E6 Nock now says Magnus you better play H3 Magnus says all right that's easy H3 now H5 oh yes oh yes this is vintage Norbeck he's not going to sit around and wait H5 he's taking the fight directly to the goat if you take I take and I'm coming right back to G4 and I'm winning so H5 is a monster move now black could have just sat there and created a fortress by the way I'm just saying he could have played F5 and only black can win this position only black because the Knight will come in and start you know really messing things up here for white NOC could have played F5 he chose not to he plays H5 he doesn't want to lock the position Magnus plays Knight D4 big decision do you take do you push what do you do he takes now Magnus counter punches F5 supported by the bishop supported by the Knight and the Knight and the Rook now apparently against H5 the best move was F5 right away but obviously Nob wanted that he wants to open up the position and it's not clear for whom that is going to benefit because then his Bishop is going to reactivate so very tense F5 noet goes back Magnus takes Queen C7 targets the Knight okay Queen F3 defends now nobec reactivates the bishop that was the entire idea of playing H5 in the first place it was to bait all of this and now reactivate the bishop Rook e one friendly reminder Magnus never castled his King is still stranded in the center of the board Bishop G5 looking to get here and undermine the control of the position now Magnus plays A4 whoa we just had a massive battle over here and a Magna says oh yeah now I'm going to attack your king G takes F5 Bishop takes F5 check which forces the king into the attack but before we attack we play Rook E2 because Rook E2 has multiple ideas maybe I'm going that way maybe I'm going that way and apparently it wasn't even the best move apparently he should have played A5 apparently he should have just went for the attack obviously he liked Rook to E2 a little bit better now Knight to G6 with the idea of Knight E5 with the idea of Knight H4 Agnus gives up a second Bishop for a Knight to then plant a new Knight on the F5 Square it's Knights versus Bishops very complicated game he's basically though slow down the black position all black can do is double on the E file or infiltrate on the H file this is magnus's plan so if Magnus breaks in with A5 he's going to win the game Queen E5 A5 the biggest Crescendo of the game has been developed nobe decides you know what if this man does not have his Queen he can't M me what he could have done by the way is taken first because what happens in the game is he plays Queen E4 takes takes and Magnus realizes he doesn't have to defend his gpon he can take on B6 and this allowing this for nobec is a massive risk because your king is not going to feel very safe Rook takes G4 Rook A2 is mate now we see the full plan come to action no Beck is just in time to remove one Rook so now he's not going to get mated but it's bad news because White's attack is Unstoppable you might be sitting there like what are you what are you talking about like what if I don't what if I just play King A8 yeah Knight D6 so Knight D6 Rook E3 check King F2 you can't stop Rook h8 nobody can stop M and black doesn't have any moves like black can play black black doesn't have a move black is in Tang if he plays King C8 it's 96 if you take it doesn't actually solve anything because Rook to h8 is still a problem so Rook f8 I'm just going to go here and then here and you can stop this but then I'm going to go 96 anyway so somehow after everything is said and done Magnus goes here and no just resigns the computer doesn't even realize how bad the position is it doesn't realize it doesn't realize that black is an atang the threat is Knight D6 and there's no way to stop it you can play Bishop F4 then I play Knight G7 you can take my Pawn then I go here you can't stop Rook h8 you can make a run for it then I come here then there's Rook E4 then there's Rook h8 King D7 Knight C5 and I win The Rook at a minimum the computer claims you could maybe try to defend this position but obviously it's misery so the big Mistake by nck In This Ultra tense position the second Magnus arrived on the queen side what he should have done is taken first and then the queen trade was correct take take the king would have had breathing room but he rushed and all it takes against Magnus is one mistake AB that's it because the endgame is lost he probably thought I'm getting in as fast as possible but he actually could have respected this and taken maybe he didn't like something else maybe he didn't like this maybe he didn't like you know the opening of the B file but that was the one mistake Magnus wins a very nice positional back and forth game I love when Nock and Magnus play and tomorrow Nock has to beat Magnus on demand Fabiano has to beat uh Levon on demand black loses in both games of the semi-finals and um black uh one over here and over here but fifth through eighth place is tough to play for so uh cuz you know you kind of know you're out of the running that's all I have for you today now get out of here
