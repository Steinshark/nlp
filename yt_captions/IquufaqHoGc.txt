have i asked you the sound check question about the uh shortcut key i can't remember if i did it what's my favorite kill yeah i asked you that no no no okay what is your favorite shortcut key um i'm partial to a bit of windows d which just minimizes everything i also like windows windows m no hang on now we have to get the computer back eggs and bacon for breakfast what's your favorite shortcut key my favorite shortcut key my shortcut key there you go my favorite shortcut key interesting control c there we go [Laughter] that's difficult actually apple l i think which is the grab the location of a url from the from a uh browser it's a good question oh i like um trying to think of an obscure one now aren't you no no i'm thinking about one that i not not obscure one that i use a lot but that not everybody knows about it which is control r in actually i don't know if bash is doing it or if my uh terminal is doing it i'm not sure if it's the shell or the terminal i guess it must be bash um and it gives you like a search of your command history okay so rather than you know you're like oh i know that i ran a command that was like this recently and you hit up like 70 times to get to it um you can hit ctrl r and just start typing like the beginning of the command and it will fill out the most recent thing you typed that you know matches that what's your favorite shortcut key my favorite shortcut key yeah i don't know that was a short answer wasn't it so when you're working on your computer control octoly that's the only one worth worth mentioning was remembering just so i can get a little on how loud you're going to speak what is your favorite shortcut key uh apple f what does that do it finds whatever i'm searching for finder i got you okay good stuff the computers i used don't turn it wear them so um there's not such thing as a shortcut key it's just the key what's your favorite shortcut key shortcut key yeah what is that computer like control and v uh windows l what does that do turns off my computer well locks it favorite shortcut like control z [Laughter] i think it might toggle you know favorite shortcut key um the vulcan nerf pinch it does it does they're both the same oh okay windows d desktop yeah right oh okay okay yeah yeah i know that's fine sorry i didn't mean to question you when is the windows m it's not important also um i also like um windows e which brings up explorer so i can go to files because there's always a few clicks isn't it ctrl alt right shift delete what does that do it resets an older charity st it sort of does a full cold reset as opposed to control ultimately just as a soft reset um shortcut keys yeah i didn't hey i tend to use them all the time there's quite useful ones control u was always useful on the bbc micro that used to delete part of the line after what was i think or did it make things invisible i can't remember now it's been so long ago uh i remember pressing control u a lot always ask a silly soundcheck question so what's your favorite shortcut key oh uh control c [Music] i've never thought about that no i genuinely don't know what that would be shift control on biebs was quite useful as well because it would slow down the output of screens as listing you'd hold down shift and control and pause and you could release control and things yeah shortcut keys to isn't that what the mouse is for uh control underscore because it's undo in emacs tell me what's your favorite uh computer shortcut key oh control c ctrl c because uh it just cancels the things that i've done wrong control c because it breaks my programs basically when they're when they've when they've got into an infinite loop okay so can not control c as a copy but could you no control c as a breaking out of a loop basically ah so a few people say control c so i wonder if that's what they meant rather than copy because there's me thinking c and v which i use all the time on a knuckle that's that's command c and command v not control c oh maybe this is this is a apple versus windows versus linux divide shortcut key um [Music] undo yeah command commander oh i don't know f1 for help maybe f2 when i'm editing [Laughter] my favorite what a shortcut key oh i control that always oh my god most people say watch out for breakfast but this is computer file so i'm going to say what's your favorite shortcut key uh control shift t oh what's that do it brings up the web page you just close by mistake uh windows and m minimize minimize all yes yeah okay cool here pretty cool tell me about your favorite shortcut key uh control control zed because i make a lot of mistakes programming so pressing control z is my friend okay today's soundcheck question uh what's your favorite shortcut key doesn't matter what app doesn't matter where oh oh oh you know i make my own uh with uh single letter commands so i have m for male and f for my little cheesy formatter and things like that so it's not exactly a shortcut key but it's can i abbreviate a command that whose name i type frequently so i don't have to type so much favorite shortcut key oh control zed [Laughter] mx definitely meta x uh it's a way to enter into a command in emacs it's like the programmable shortcut key what is your favorite shortcut key my favorite shortcut key oh heavens it depends on what system you're on is it was the escape that's it escapes the best i was thinking about those so like where did shortcut keys come from was that something that came in with gooeys or was it something that i think it was you used to have to remember all the control sequences at the ascii low end like is it control g gets you a bell and unless some software gets in the way and intercepts it says no i'm not going to bleep the bleeder for you but if in on a raw sort of machine the ascii low end is done by using the control key right okay you know control a is asking zero i think um good stuff yeah that's great i'll get everybody who likes to hate on windows talking yep good good all right come at me bro right add something onto it throw it back and pass the token on and i've got it so i can load the value in add the value for my register store it back
