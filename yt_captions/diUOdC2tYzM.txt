just kidding it's me Yvonne I need help with okay that's not quite how the call screening feature in iOS 17 works but if Apple's demo can be believed the real thing is gonna be even better I mean that alone is enough to get me to consider an iPhone and there's way more I'm talking contact posters check-in FaceTime video mail and air tag sharing I mean that last one was barely even a footnote in Apple's keynote but has been generating a lot of Buzz here at the office I mean it's a fair question what if I need to find my wife's keys I'm really impressed I mean sure a lot of it's not new whether we've seen it before in Gmail or Whatsapp or even just plain old Android but the whole package looks like a big quality of life Improvement for iPhone users and it puts everything you might want all in one place everything except this Segway to our sponsor switch pod this isn't your run-of-the-mill handheld tripod it's lightweight Compact and nearly indestructible you can experience the freedom of quickly switching between handheld and tripod mode in seconds check out switchbot at the link below with contact posters when you call someone you get to decide what their iPhone displays whether you want a more professional looking black and white headshot or a silly pick of yourself photoshopped onto a gorilla the possibilities are endless but don't worry there's also a new content filter system that should block any unsavory content whether it's in a contact poster or an incoming pic or a video I'm not sure if they came up with this other of the blue or if it was that guy airdropping a dick pic on a crowded plane last year that lit a fire somewhere at Apple HQ the MAC address team did some quick testing by the way and the filter does appear to work though I wouldn't be surprised if jerks find creative ways around it I mean have you seen a Call of Duty Lobby lately it's better than it used to be but uh life finds a way another call-related update is called live voicemail which is what I was talking about in the intro and this is so cool on the recipient side it lets you view a real-time transcription of any voicemail that is being left so you can either leave your ex pathetically pleading to have you back to a machine or you can decide you want to pick up the call and tell them no in real time you can also turn on silence unknown callers and send new people straight to live voicemail I love this I mean for anyone born after 1999 this may surprise you but this used to be the norm people would screen their calls all the time by just listening to it being recorded on their answering machine then picking it up if it was someone they actually wanted to talk to and apple brought it back and one thing live voicemail does better than an answering machine is that it can Auto reject any calls but your carrier identifies as spam that's a feature Android already has but hey it's nice to see apple keeping up good job little buddy now something else they've caught up on at least compared to third-party chat apps like WhatsApp and Discord is interacting with text messages they've implemented swipe to reply so if someone sends you 15 texts in a row and you really only want to reply to one of them from the middle you can now just swipe right on it instead of holding to reply that way they know haha cool story refers to the bit about last Friday night and not the recent death in their family catch-up is also new if you open your phone to a giant wall of messages you can just tap the arrow and it'll take you to the top of the Unseen messages I mean I mean I don't think that one's a huge deal personally but I've also never been in a hyper toxic relationship so your mileage may vary speaking of toxic relationships you can now use check in to let someone know that you've reached your destination okay joking aside this actually would have been a great feature for me just yesterday my badminton coach was freaking out because his wife said I'm going out then he missed a call from her around the time that she should have arrived at the mall he tried to call her back a few minutes later many times but even though she's usually really good about picking up nothing which doesn't seem like a big deal but let me put it this way as a husband and a dad I know it would be going through his head did she call because she's at the Walmart and wanted to know if I need anything or did she call because she's bleeding out on the side of the road and she just wanted to hear my voice one last time before she dies with check-in he'd have known that everything was fine and she was at the mall and we could have started our session on time I also see this being amazing for anyone who's going somewhere new or meeting up with someone for the first time until you check in it tracks your progress and will ping you for responses which will notify expecting parties if you don't respond with helpful information like your location your battery level and whether or not you have cell service all of this information is end-to-end encrypted by the way just in case you were worried that Apple suddenly got lacks about security and if a friend who already checked in had somewhere else they can just send the new location to you with a simple tap from the plus button it'll go straight to your conversation no more exiting to another window this is going to be a great way for people to help their friends stay safe and in other location related news you can finally share air tags got a dog that you like to keep track of but your partner's out walking her well now you can just share that air tag and you can both keep track together you can share with up to five people just be careful who you give access to since they will be able Place sounds to pinpoint the air tag whenever they're nearby another big Improvement is the revamped search function now with filters in Apple's own words you can find the message you're looking for Faster by combining search filters to quickly narrow your search honestly wow thank you this is something that Android can't do yet and if it works as advertised it's going to be a game changer I mean I can't stress enough just how frustrating a bad search function is yes windows and Microsoft teams I'm not just looking at you I'm staring into your soul do better please and there are some more message specific updates like finding all of your most used iMessage apps by tapping the new plus button along with the ability to create stickers from objects and photos react to specific messages with those stickers or my personal favorite audio message transcription don't you Flippin hate it when someone sends you a voice note or an audio message and it's not a convenient time or place to check it right now because you know you have a life maybe you're deaf and someone you've been communicating with online doesn't know that and they send you an audio clip well with this feature you can say goodbye to that annoying back and forth and say hello to just reading what they said for real though this is a fantastic upgrade and feels just as much convenient as it does inclusive love it and if you like communicating through FaceTime that's also gotten a few albeit more minor updates now when someone misses your call you can just record a video or an audio message and send that off which continues Apple's IOS 17 trend of improving on voicemail and FaceTime is also coming to more devices those messages we just mentioned those be checked on your Apple watch and you can now connect your iPhone to your Apple TV as long as it's second generator actually there are a lot of asterisks about model specific features in this rundown but assuming you've got the right Goods you can finally use your iPhone as your camera and your TV to display who you're talking to just make sure you're wearing a button-up shirt from ltdstore.com so you look sharp during that call tell you every year we get closer and closer to living in Back to the Future I mean first Trump becomes president now your Apple TV can sort of call someone but what about when you're not using your phone and you want to completely ignore it well tin Apple decided that that's simply not an option so Apple has added new standby features soon you'll be able to display key info while charging your phone like a clock and calendar you can display Precious Memories or even just the music you're listening to and you can use live activities to show more pertinent information like how far along your delivery order is or who's winning that game that you bet on but don't care to watch because you're not actually a sports fan you're just a gambling addict [Music] hopefully that didn't trigger your phones um can also bring up information for you in standby now which is pretty neat and it's even easier now that they've removed the hay from Hayes Yuri if you feel like being more direct you can also interact with widgets right from the lock screen or from standby which is super handy if you've got a smart home but your hands are too full to pick up and unlock your phone actually the first phone I had that I could interact with things from the lock screen was a Droid something the one with that ballistic nylon back it was freaking amazing oh airdrop is also getting worked on in a number of ways with one of the biggest feature updates being the ability to just walk away and let your transfer finish that's right if the network drops or you can't wait around you can just allow the transfer to complete over the internet as long as both you and the recipient are signed into iCloud that's not out until later this year but it sounds great they've also made sharing your name number and other files easier letting you air drop just about whatever you want simply by holding your iPhone near someone else's and a big feature that's sure to kill basically every third party journaling app is Apple's new Journal it's also coming later but looks pretty robust and should allow you to save your memories however you want to almost like a digital scrapbook this isn't really new I mean people have obviously been journaling in their respective mediums for hundreds even thousands of years but now you've got an official app which will be synced to iCloud using end-to-end encryption the app will make suggestions from time to time but this processing is apparently all done on your device and apple says that not even they can view your Journal speaking of third-party apps getting sherlocked you can now make grocery lists that automatically sort items into categories for easier shopping pretty neat but not as neat as Apple finally getting its own PDF reader that can view and markup PDFs research papers and more it even has enhanced autofill so that you can use saved information from contacts to quickly fill out a PDF or a scanned document super cool but wait there's still more considering it better autocorrect and predictive text like you've got in Gmail Safari profiles to keep working homes separate auto fill Verification codes from your mail visual lookup to research objects in your photos password and pass key sharing adaptive audio for airpods offline apps it just keeps going they've improved quite a few things here and I'm of course happy to see that but one of the biggest ones is one I haven't talked about yet the health app they've got an entire separate page for this because aside from it finally coming to iPad there are some new features I'll be coming soon but new features that look very promising especially these days with Medical Care being harder to access and tons of people suffering from long coveted symptoms soon you'll be able to use more devices to better track medication and know if anything you're taking could interfere with it you can check your sleep metrics with insights into sleep stages share your health issues with friends and family who might be involved in your care or even search up your own medical records what's truly new though are the mental health and vision features need a reminder to keep your phone further from your face how about a notification that tells you to get some sunlight soon your iPad and your iPhone will be able to do just that on the mental health side you'll be able to log your momentary emotions and daily moods to see what states correlate with lifestyle factors and you can take standardized mental health assessments to see if you're at risk for depression or anxiety the however here is that while it's nice that this is going to be available to a lot of people it is not a replacement for proper health care and you shouldn't rely on your smartphone to diagnose you if you're suffering from anything serious I would highly recommend you get checked out by a physician remember these devices are fantastic little tools that have certainly come a long way in the last 16 years
