- Today, my task is simple, to build the cheapest possible
gaming PC on Amazon.com. I need to be able to find
brand new components, with Amazon prime shipping. That's it. So this my friends is everything we need to build our cheapest Amazon gaming PC. Oh boy, AMD Athlon processor! How much was the 3000G? The cheapest processor we
could find that wasn't ancient. - [Jared] You are sitting on, $93 worth of performance right there. - Here's the thing, when
this first came out, I'm pretty sure it was like 50 bucks. And 90 bucks though, I
mean, that's like what a Core i3 should cost. - [Jared] Speaking of Core i3. I think your entire PC is gonna be mute against this little guy. - What is this? - [Jared] That's a nice, cheap, or should I say budget, laptop. - So it's a, an Asus
with a Core i3-1005G1. Oh, that's, that's better. How much was this laptop though? - [Jared] That was 350. - Dude, are you trying to
invalidate this entire video by saying that you
should just buy a laptop, and try to build the
cheapest game PC on Amazon and get five frames per second
with your potato graphics? - [Jared] I mean, I'm
not telling you that, but we're gonna find out. - [Austin] The led monitor! - [Jared] This was $70. I mean, that's less than $10 an inch. - Oh my God. Jared, what the. - [Jared] Oh yeah. I like that. - This is like for a security camera. It has BNC, it has AV
and VGA, but it has HDMI, which is a port that is non-existent. It's got a slot for HDMI,
but there's no actual HDMI. - [Jared] Whoa, wait, so we, we can't plug in our HDMI?
- We have to use VGA. - [Jared] Does our, does
our motherboard have VGA? - I hope so. All right, we've got
ourselves a little stand. - [Jared] Wait, what? - Am I missing a piece? Ah!
- [Jared] You know what? We don't, we don't need a, a stand. We have a perfectly good case, that maybe we can integrate it with. - I didn't actually order a case. - [Jared] You didn't? What? - It's the cheapest Amazon gaming PC. So, I'm gonna build it in
the Amazon box it came with. To save myself $20. All right, next, we have
the MSI A320M-A Pro Max. So this is not a high
end board by any stretch, but importantly, it was cheap. - [Jared] It was the same price
of a brand new video game. Unless you have a PS5, $60. - 60 bucks. It doesn't have VGA. It has DVI and HDMI. - [Jared] So we can't even use our PC? - Jared do I have enough
budget to buy an adapter? (both laugh) Next up, got ourselves a Logitech MK120, the plug and play USB combo. This tried and true,
guaranteed to function as a mouse and a keyboard for, not many dollaridoos. Next up in my bag of goodies is, oh- (screaming) - [Jared] Wow. - 400 watt, Coolmax power supply. - [Jared] It was $19. - [Austin] $19 power supply! What could possibly go wrong? Josh, I swear to God, if you put up another shot
of my house on fire video. I could see, he was dragging
the clip on the timeline. He's like, "I'm ready for it!" All right, we're almost to the end here. Astra-gear, DDR4 memory! I mean the back is completely blank. You could lick it and it's fine. I wouldn't recommend that, but
there's nothing on the back. So it's, it tastes like Astra-gear. All right, and inside, we've got our, Adroitlark 2.5 inch SSD, baby. You know what, can I
date myself for a second? - [Jared] I mean, you're married, but you can date whoever you want. - My first SSD was a 120 gig, and it was, I wanna say 400
bucks for 120 gig drive. This 120 gig drive, is probably
just as good realistically, and this cost less than $20. - [Jared] This was $18. - $18. Modern technology is truly a marvel. Let's get building, shall we? Funny thing about building the
cheapest gaming PC on Amazon, it's pretty easy. (laughs) There's like four thing
we need to build here. All right, so I'm gonna install ourselves that Athlon 3000G. (upbeat music) All right, CPU installed. Look how simple that was. I feel like this is the fastest
PC I'm ever gonna build. Oh, I shouldn't probably say that. - [Jared] When you buy cheap,
you're given the luxury of not having a lot of
parts to put together. - Why do I have my tools here? I just realized, I brought
tools out instinctively. - [Jared] Well you gotta, you
gotta screw it into your case. (scoffs) - This is the only tool I need. (both laugh) Wow. This box is way too big. Jared, this box is too big. - [Jared] No, no, no, no, no, no. It's the perfect size. It fits everything doesn't it? I mean, that's all the
PC case needs to do. - Now, full disclaimer,
static electricity is a thing. But this is probably
not particularly safe, especially with the power supply that is so high quality and
well grounded as this one. As always, do as I say, not as I do. (upbeat music continues) So with my expert case
modifications complete, this actually, look I'm not gonna lie. I'm pretty happy with this. I mean, that's sturdy. Like I could pick up the whole box. - Okay, okay, okay. But you spent all that
time working on that. And this takes almost no setup at all. - [Austin] Did you just break my monitor? - [Jared] I would never. No, no, no. It was an accident, I mean you can't, look, it's fine, this is durable. So this, although, a little bit more expensive and technically it was on sale. - [Austin] Wait, what? - I mean. - [Austin] Wait, how much was it? - Well, we paid 350. but the actual price,
was you know, about 450. - [Austin] 450? Jared! You're trying to beat me
on price or performance, so you got some clearance
special for 350 bucks? - Look, it's not my fault
Best Buy has some good deals. - [Austin] Best Buy?
- You had to go- - [Austin] This is Amazon. - It's a computer and it
will out perform yours. It doesn't matter where it's from. - [Austin] Wait, hang on. You know, I would make
fun of your build quality, but it's not cardboard,
so I don't think I can. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! It's fine. - I'm sorry, did that, did that just flex? - [Austin] Don't don't break my, don't, don't break my case Jared. You got HDMI? Damn. - [Jared] Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Austin] Is that USB-C? You got USB-C, Jared? - [Jared] Yeah. We
actually have I/O on this. - [Austin] Ohh.
- [Jared] Look at that, we're already in Windows. Do you even have Windows? - Okay, so I have taken the
liberty of installing Windows on my system, using an
actual real monitor, because Jared had to get me an adapter. $22 will now be added to my total for this HDMI to VGA adapter,
to make my monitor work. I'm almost positive that this is the point at which, I could have spent the $20 and got an actual real monitor. - You definitely could have. - So here's my very expensive
HDMI to VGA adapter. So I'm gonna unplug my actual monitor. Gonna change input. AV. Okay. VGA. No, BNC. I don't want that one. Where's VGA? Yo! Let's go! Let's go! All right, wait, hang
on, so I got my mouse. Okay, that is terrible,
but it is actually working. Now, I think it's time to install this in the side of my case. Woo. Look at that! All right. Okay! There we go! All right, with my build complete,
I have run my benchmarks. So, let's see who's got the better score. So I had to screenshot because
the screen is so low quality. I actually have to screenshot
my score and zoom way in. - [Jared] It's hard enough
that it's really tiny. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Jared] And then the viewing angles, make it a even more difficult. - [Austin] So my Cinebench R23 score, is 1,639 points. - Really? - [Austin] Yeah. What are you at? - Not that much less.
- [Austin] Really? - I'm at 1,201 points.
- [Austin] Ooh! - I am actually very surprised by that. - [Austin] Clear win on the CPU side. - Only on the CPU side,
we still have graphics. And for graphics, I came in with a Fire Strike score of 1282. - [Austin] Oh! Wait. - [Jared] Whoa, whoa, wait, there's no way you beat
me in graphics too. - [Austin] So, Firestrike score of 1047. - So you beat me on CPU, but on graphics, I'm outperforming you. - [Austin] But okay, we've
gotta do the math on this then. So my total for everything you see here, mouse, keyboard, monitor, case all of my high quality components, $315. - 318, don't you try
and cut yourself short. Really trying to, really trying to get that price performance
score, aren't you? So again, this one over
here, for a 15 inch screen and pretty much the same specs, 350 bucks. 1282 divided by 350 puts me
at 3.66, points per dollar. - [Austin] So 3.66 is where you're at, price to performance. My score is. - [Jared] 1047 divided by 318. You're looking at 3.29. - [Austin] Okay. - So in the end, just
as I fully believed in, the entire time and never
had an ounce of doubt, the laptop is the better value. - [Austin] Well, slightly
when it comes to gaming. Slightly
- Slightly, very slightly. And again, this was on a $100 discount. So in reality, it's a $450 laptop. But we don't need to worry about that and the editors are gonna cut that out, and it's just gonna make me look like I'm way better in every way again. And it'll be great. Just like usual. - [Austin] I think Josh will have to put you back in your cage. (both laugh) - I don't like this. This, what this has become. - [Austin] It was your idea to be fair. So with the price to performance settled. There's really only one thing left to do. See if the cheapest gaming PC you can build on Amazon,
can actually play any games. We've detected the
following hardware issues, system memory doesn't
meet minimum requirements. Ignore warning. - [Jared] (laughs) That definitely
won't lead to any issues. - I'm about to see three
frames per second right now. I think that's actually
what I'm gonna see. So this is my viewing angle
on the actual display. So on the front, you can't see, but if you move it this way, for some reason it actually looks better, which is ridiculous. Like, I mean, if you get low, it's a little bit better, but like, you really wanna be all
the way out to the side to have any hope of seeing what's actually going on on the display. It's just taunting me right now. This is the point where it
just tells me it crashed. - [Jared] Dude, that's
what I'm waiting for. - [Austin] (gasps) Oh! Wait. It's loading! It's loading! It's loading! It's loading! - [Jared] Come on SSD, you got this. Dude, I could have completed
like four races by now. - [Austin] This is where it crashes. Oh boy. - [Jared] Dude, that's not looking good. - [Austin] This does not looking good. (Jared laughs) - [Jared] You know it's bad when it's lagging on the loading screen. - [Austin] It's one FPS. - [Jared] No! (laughs)
