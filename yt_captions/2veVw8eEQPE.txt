hey Nintendo we have exposed your Dev kits before and we are about to do it again this is the Nintendo ndev an early development kit for the Nintendo Revolution excuse me we when it was first announced Nintendo's Revolution console was purely theoretical in fact the physical demo unit at E3 2005 was a fugazi fairy dust didn't exist it was simply an empty plastic shell with nothing in it but promises to make good on those promises then by the start of the 2006 Christmas season Nintendo needed a way for developers to work on Wii software without having a ready for Market console available their solution was a GameCube dev kit with some modifications now that might have been fine for internal developers but you don't want third-party developers working with what is clearly last gen Hardware that's embarrassing even if it was basically what the Wii would end up being so over the next 12 of months Nintendo went from a barely modded GameCube t-death to a mysterious blurry Black Box to a more polished black box with no wireless controllers to this the final pre-release dev kit with all the bells and whistles of the retail console well sort of how do you play games without a disk drive and what sets this apart from the final retail unit and who's going to tell you about our sponsor eugreen I know you want to increase your productivity while using your laptop I know that so you should check out the ugreen USBC docking station you can connect multiple monitors keyboards and mice all through a single Hub while charging your laptop check it out at the link below this is one of those videos where the writer actually didn't really tell me a whole lot going into it other than yes you are allowed to open it so that's the first thing I'm going to be doing that's actually a lie I was also told to be extremely careful about keeping these screws organized because some of them are really long some of them are really not long and if you put the wrong ones in you can totally Fubar the whole thing wait why are we opening it up first we're going to talk about some of this stuff at the front we've got our GameCube memory card slots as well as four ports for GameCube controllers because early versions of the Wii were fully backwards compatible including four player multiplayer later ones removed the ports even though the hardware technically still existed inside so you can actually actually hack the support back in and then later ones cut the feature out entirely but hey we're Nintendo you're gonna buy it anyway we've also got the SD card slot that was ostensibly for expanding the storage so you could buy things in the Nintendo eShop but more realistically was just used for hacking the console though I actually used mine to transfer all my data to a Wii U so that's a legit use for it sync button for pairing controllers moving around to this side a Bluetooth module and this is fun you might think oh well that's an external antenna for Bluetooth no this is for a wired remote neat huh during development they were not wireless yet over here we've got a Wi-Fi module apparently why your Wi-Fi was not needed I mean why wouldn't they just put an ethernet port on it you know what it doesn't matter the point is at the back the sensor bar AV multi out for compositor component the regular USB ports you'd find on the Wii and these three USB type B's that apparently all need to be plugged in in order for this thing to operate now that's interesting eject button eject what [Music] it does not have a lot of cooling hey I mean I guess neither did the retail unit you've just got a single what appears to be a 60 millimeter fan back here slim too and then a passive heatsink that I guess by Merit of this being the only other hole in the chassis is gonna get some kind of airflow over it but like that's it hey that's wild right here next to what I assume is the GPU we've got 64 megabytes of gddr3 and then over here is what looks like 512 Megs of storage that's double what shipped on the finished console now there's supposed to be twice as much RAM as the finished console as well but I only see the one chip it's so cool the way that this engineering level Hardware will have flexibility built into it that not only will never make its way into the finished product but might not even be needed for the development product like look at this wi-fi attenuator so there's an antenna module here but while it's got these two little connectors so that you could add additional antennas to it they never even do that they just take a wire and like coil it up in here as far as I can tell it's wild this doesn't do anything but it could well that was easy that's some crusty thermal did you take this off is that why this looks like poop I am not the first person to take that apart and if you want proof of that check the underside of the top that you took off oh okay deadly foes was here I'm guessing that's who sent us this unit nope it came from the person who lent it to deadly foes really I mean do I need to take it now too I think that's appropriate maybe I'll just put a dent in it that would be pretty classic just just drop the screwdriver no I I can't I can't I can't a laser engraver on the other side of this wall I can't no I can't do it there's our ATI Graphics chip and our IBM today is an IP ad power wasn't it the Broadway was IBM and the Hollywood was AMD super cool goes to show you Nintendo knows gaming little CPU big GPU neither of them are powerful but boy were they ever little and big now we need to pry it up we can glean a lot just from the way the traces are run on the board here's our CPU so the CPU bones connected predominantly to the GPU bone which is connected to the video memory bone ah so I said there was supposed to be twice as much vram on this thing that's because half of it is on the underside of this top board this appears to be pretty much the entire Wii component of this development kit so what is everything else then on this board on your right we find a couple of xilinx Spartan fpgas because these are field programmable they could be doing quite literally anything but based on the fact that there are the three USB ports and a Serial port on here I'd say this is probably running whatever operating system that Nintendo is using to interface with the development kit as for this boy right here oh it's conveniently labeled this is ndav dash power Dash X2 so power that's power supply oh hilarious a lot of these big connectors that I was trying to figure out what the heck they do is just carrying power through this board and into this board nothing really that interesting down here just the AC to DC converter for our power supply oh I lied this does give us a better look at how all of those diagnostic LEDs and buttons and dip switches on the front are in fact wired up to what I said I suspected was the development OS board this one right here so hypothesis confirmed should we fire it up yeah all right let's do it hooked up our LED is working is that a zero is that it I don't know it's working anyway we have to run Windows XP we have to run Windows of some version I felt XP was the best to go with because 2006 what's your choice it's XP or Vista I'm gonna I'm gonna take XP I'm a Vista boy okay so we open a dilf yep unfortunately we weren't able to get our hands on any first party Nintendo games because they control their leaks a lot better than third-party developers but we do have what are our early builds yes of a handful of games well let's go Simpsons right yeah oh that's a GameCube game is it nope oh okay GCM a lot of the architecture for the Wii is backwards compatible with the GameCube so as a result a lot of the file names are similar hey there we go now it should tell you that you've got the wrong firmware because we don't have the right firmware on here that is hey wrong firmware version if you want to continue if you like to take these there we go so enter proper menu flow okay then no way that's how you know it's internal shut up I love it legal text here and placeholder one hey that's my favorite placeholder right up there with placeholder a oh yeah you want to try going to the Wii menu uh sure oh that doesn't do anything it does not do anything it's just a picture it's not even a button oh oh hey and now you've got the developer menu well this is wild I mean yeah I got all the cheats then it's okay well let's have unlimited calories in Homer ball and helium this is normally not how the game goes I do have kind of a way of breaking things dancing crusty is always a good sign uh did it just restart oh oh we got sound so hey there we go oh my God these loading times though well at least you're getting some sort of idea as to what's happening your memory there is getting used up it was getting used up did I break it oh nope hey here we go so you have to take the less nutritious thing yeah got him oh shoot oh what that took off that many points this might be a good time to cheat no I got this i got this no I'm gonna beat him oh what no I didn't shake this one I have negative oh oh no can I just punch him and can I just fight him I could take him this is hard how is this in the first couple minutes of the game okay I think we could try another game all right oh it occurs to me without the chassis cover on this heatsink is probably not getting a lot of airflow oh it seems okay it's barely even warm I mean how much did the Wii consume like 30 Watts or 45 Watts or something it was yeah so it was 12 volt 4.8 amps but most of that energy was used for the disk drive right okay so people were building portable Wiis that were using I don't know maybe like two amps at 12 volts wow yeah those portable Wii projects are so cool oh yeah where are these where are these games installed to how is it connected to that laptop is it just via USB yeah there's three USB ports all go into it and do we know which USBS do what I think the one labeled di is for disk input com is for communication how that's used I'm not sure then there's debug which I want to say would normally go to the IDE so the like text editor for the code which in this case think it's called codemasters wait you said this was golden eye that's what it was labeled as I have not actually opened it up this would be 2009 Daniel Craig GoldenEye they did a remake without Pierce Brosnan well what just happened is any of this in the real game yeah I don't think we can actually play this at all uh look at like what was that hey look at our 3D models and how they look like Daniel Craig other playable deliverables someone seems like they're like yeah no I'm doing stuff oh whoa cause that's how that works uh oh okay oh hi okay oh boy that she's she's sensitive what's gonna happen when you get into the world I don't know foreign okay well that was cool yeah clearly some proof of concept level stuff okay now now that I see how interesting these games are I kind of want to try another one wait David you had said there was something you wanted to try what was it is this is this it am I looking at what this is what's a block out oh okay you know what I think we might be looking at here is just the the building blocks block out of what these experiences might look like and then maybe these are slightly better yeah first pass artwork in progress okay what level do we want to have a look at I want to see the non-deliverable they never wanted us to see this Tanner it was non-deliverable oh wow this is amazing I kind of want to play this game I gotta say it'll be a lot scarier seeing a tank coming at you if it is fluorescent White this is so cool I have no interest whatsoever in playing this game but boy do I ever want to play this early development thing I always want to see what I'm not supposed to see yeah this is a little bit reminiscent of oh hey here we go oh don't fall down the pit number one rule of GoldenEye okay I will try not to fall down a hole this time can I go this way oh nope no okay next game I think yep oh oh that's some frame rate wow no further optimization necessary well this one is not done are we are we overheating at all is that what's happening I don't think so because this isn't even 3D this is just a cut scene Naruto goes hard they do their hand gestures and ninja magic does it have any secret menus I wonder no I think this one's pretty done we've got you beaten now let's see who we're dealing with here and I would have gotten away with it
