here's a smartphone you didn't see coming this is the Asus zenfone 6 and it's one of the only phones where I actually got more and more excited the longer I spend with it I just genuinely can't wait to show you what it can do as well as a clear plastic case and the device itself in the Box you get to the USB type-c cable you get an 18 watt fast charger and you get a pair of above-average looking earphones and here is the device itself a firm that manages to tick pretty much all the pillars of a good twenty nineteen flagship but at the same time comes with two standout features that are far more than just gimmicks my first impression was positive I don't think it's gonna win any beauty awards with its squarish aesthetic but the phone is encased in glass and definitely feels every bit as nice as their devices it's up against so one thing I'm thankful for is that as well as doing a couple of crazy things which I'll come to basis has made sure they ticked the key boxes it's using the snapdragon 855 chip and up to eight gigs of ram so it's up there with the most powerful phones in the world right now you only have to look at and - - for affirmation it's about thirty thousand points ahead of my ex in our space galaxy s10 and just behind the one plus seven pro oh yeah and this phone is way cheaper but I'll come to this as well you've got that headphone jack you've got stereo speakers on the bottom and the front and it oh she comes with a crippled slot tray so you can load two SIM cards at the same time as a micro SD card okay so two features this one has two flagship features that I'd say are compelling enough reasons to want one the first being this camera module it flips around but unlike other implementations that can switch between the front and the back it's a motorized system designed to give you complete control over the angle and this leads to some really cool outcomes motion tracking lets you pick an object and the camera starts to follow that object to keep it in the center of the frame it works like magic you've never seen anything like it on a phone on top of that panorama shots get a bit of a facelift say you find a really tall building or an object want up on this button and the phone will automatically start panning upwards to capture the whole thing oh yeah and the flip side of this is that you can do the same in landscape mode the resulting resolution of these shots thirteen thousand four hundred and forty by 2048 quite impressive you can also use the volume keys to adjust the camera angle manually but I do wish that the module had a constant acceleration the actual motion is a little juddery so that kind of restricts what you can do with it more importantly though this is thankfully not just a funky looking camera setup it's actually a really capable one too the main camera is 48 megapixels based on the same IMX 586 sensor as the 1 + 7 pro you get really powerful high dynamic range and a great looking night mode which actually takes 1600 photos and meshes them together I did a couple of side by sides with the 1 + 7 pro and well let me know what you think anyways that second camera is a 125 degree ultra wide and to be clear 1 to 5 really is ultra white it's even wider than the s tens one two three but things get even better the additional benefit of having this motorized setup is that anything you've got on the rear camera you can also have on the front with a couple of exceptions so that means you get the ability to take mega wide selfies you get a laser focus system which many phones Brya cameras don't have and you can record 4k video at 60fps on the front the quality blew me away to give you an idea of the quality this clip right here is being filmed on the phone's front camera in 4k resolution oh yeah and you saw how stable that footage was right that's pure electronic stabilization this phone doesn't have oh is at all and yet it somehow pulls it off also I'm not exactly sure how useful this is but because you can stop this camera module at any angle you can also use this phone's camera as a periscope you could technically pee around corners or even be looking down and seeing on your phone screen what's actually in front of you you do miss out on a telephoto lens but Asus have said that they'll be adding a 2 times lost a zoom via a software update but we will have to wait and see on that one you also get this smart key at the top of the phone which on one hand is a bit of a stretch to reach but at the same time it's a completely configurable button you don't see that very often I've currently set mine to open the camera with one tap but then with two taps I've made it open the camera and flip it around the second headline feature this phone comes with is a five thousand milliamp hour cream so for some perspective that's over ten percent larger than the behemoth cell on the galaxy s 10 5g which by the way also has a much larger display and this is the kind of capacity where it's not a question of whether you're going to get through a day but whether or not you can get through to it can reverse charge other phones with ten watts of power and it itself charges with 18 watts mind you that's not super fast considering we've had phones like the 1 + 7 Pro just launched with 30 watt charging but there is a reason faster charging batteries need a thicker separator in between they're a node and cathode so essentially they end up taking more space so this slower charging speed is the only way Asus has managed to fit this monster cell into a body that's not too monstrous the phone also has a 6 point 4 inch display that fills pretty much the whole front of the phone it's a Full HD Plus LCD though which didn't exactly have me jumping up and down in excitement but it is better than the specs suggest just not as bright as some of its OLED counterparts Zen UI 6 the software on the phone was also a nice surprise it's much closer to a pure Google aesthetic and it shows a company that's really listening to what people want it's based on Android 9 and whilst it's not functionally too different from past versions you do get some reach ability features as well as a dark mode I like that there's a built in screen recorder as well as an outdoor mode which lets your speaker rack up another 20% volume at the cost of a bit of distortion Asus is also promising an Android 10 update in the second half of the year okay so a couple of other things worth mentioning about the zenfone 6 to keep the costs down there is no IP rating and no support for wireless charging neither are deal-breakers for me but still worth bearing in mind the other thing is pricing and right now I only have the price in Euros but it's gonna start at 499 that's quite a bit cheaper than even the base standard one plus seven the non pro model so this is exciting if you enjoyed this video a sub would be massively appreciated and as always my name is Erin this is mr. who's the boss and okay two in the next one [Music]
