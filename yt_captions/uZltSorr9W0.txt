hello everyone and welcome in this video i am going to be putting on some new tires on my honda s2000 now as i've often talked about tires are basically the most important component of your car um so you know it's important to not kind of cheap out here and get some quality stuff when you're getting new tires there's several reasons why i'm getting new tires for my car the tread wear on the tires that are on there currently is fine but they're pretty cheap tires also the rear tires are not the correct size they're a little undersized so there's 205s on the back now that's the rear width versus 225s which is going to be going on it so about 20 more millimeters of width there which is the proper size that's the oem setup this actually came with bridgestone potenza so2s i believe was the stock tire these are bridgestone potenza re 71r so this is a high performance summer tire and hopefully we can see some additional grip out of them now because this is engineering explained i'm not just going to talk about my feelings when driving it i bought this race logic v box sport which has a 20 hertz gps engine in it so you can get super accurate data from it so i'm going to do some deceleration testing some brake testing and see what kind of distances stopping distances and stopping times we get with these tires versus once i put these tires on and i'm going to do my best to do it on days where the weather is very similar so that we get very similar data results so temperatures will be relatively the same when i test them another thing that's messed up with the rear tires is they have excessive negative camber i'm not positive what they are i did get an alignment check uh and they said they were exceeding at negative 1.7 i tried measuring it myself with a digital inclinometer not you know the greatest way to do it you really need to get a nice tool for this but they seem to be around negative 2 to negative 2.2 degrees of negative camber on the rear which out is out of spec and one of the things that i've noticed driving it which is very unique to this vehicle is i've experienced breaking oversteer and so i was coming into a corner pretty hard and i came in too fast so i gave it more breaks and most cars in that scenario like literally every car i've ever driven will just push forward an understeer and this car the rear kicked out and so i had to counter steer fix it get back uh on the road um i didn't go off the road but you know what i'm saying like you got to get it back the right direction and so that can kind of be a unique experience because most cars you drive will understeer uh when you're at the braking limit coming into a corner and this did not and part of it has to do with the rear suspension setup but another part of it is that it has these cheap tires in the rear that are smaller than they should be they're not as wide as they should be and they have excessive negative camber so both of those will lead to less grip and so i'm thinking that putting these on wider tires and then getting an alignment for the rear i should be you know kind of minimize that braking oversteer at least reduce it from what it is currently so it behaves a bit more neutrally rather than over steering while braking i am going to weigh all of the tires just to see if there is any difference between the fusion hris and the bridgestone re71rs these for the front the 205s weigh 22 pounds these in the rear 23.2 pounds so just a little bit over a pound heavier for that 20 millimeter wider tire and so we'll once we get those off i'll weigh them and see what those weigh so my only challenge now is figuring out how to get these tires in this car to get them to the tire center [Music] all right tie that down and i think that's how it's gonna have to be all right so i've got the bridgestone tires on and the fusion tires are off and the braking results as cliche as it sounds are pretty unreal it's pretty hard to believe how big of a difference between these two tires one of the things i also noticed when i got these swapped the front tires are fusion vri's the rear tires are fusion hri so the tires didn't even match uh the v and the h standing for the speed rating so the rear tires actually had a lower speed rating than the front tires previously there's a whole lot of mess going on so these were some pretty poor tires and now we've got some more legitimate tires on there so i did some data testing with this vbox sport i'll include a link to this in the video description but anyways starting with the fusion tires the first test i did was at 136 feet stopping from 60 miles per hour to zero in 3.4 seconds with a peak deceleration g-force of negative 0.999 so just under 1 g of deceleration 136 feet stopping from 60 to 0 is not very good and then i did two more tests after that with the same tires the next test was at 140 feet peak deceleration g of 0.936 and that was in 3.55 seconds and then i did one final test after that and it stopped in 143.9 so almost 144 feet from 60 miles per hour in 3.58 seconds with a peak deceleration g of 0.926 so you can see as that tire is heating up as it's breaking more and more its deceleration is getting worse and worse and so i also did get an alignment for these as i had mentioned previously my little handheld digital inclinometer sketchy way of measuring the rear negative camber was actually pretty much spot on they were both at negative 2.0 negative camber the stock spec is somewhere between negative 1.3 and negative 1.7 so the s2000 actually has pretty aggressive rear negative camber from the factory but they went ahead and took that down to negative 1.4 and they also fixed the front right tire which had slightly too much negative camber fixed the toe everything's evened out on there so perfect alignment now and so then i did the same brake testing with the bridgestones the only difference is really it was five degrees warmer outside so 60 degrees fahrenheit when i tested the bridgestones 55 with the fusions the fusions are all seasons the bridgestones are summer tires but not a huge difference five degree fahrenheit difference uh exact same location no wind similar tire pressures so i tried to account for all the variables and here is where it gets kind of nuts so the first test i did uh with the re 71's 112.3 feet stopping from 60 miles per hour in 2.84 seconds with a peak deceleration of 1.165 gs uh so huge difference versus the first test .165 g versus negative 1g so a .166 g difference for that first test the second test i did with these tires 111.4 feet stopped in 2.72 seconds and a peak deceleration of negative 1.216 gs 1.2 gs with these tires and this was actually slightly downhill the location i'm doing from the stop to the start of the deceleration is about a 5 to 10 foot drop not huge but it is going slightly downhill so at a slight disadvantage uh but you can see it's consistent 112 to 111 versus the other tire went from 136 up to 140. now the final test and this is crazy stopped in 107.9 feet in 2.63 seconds with a peak deceleration of negative 1.193 g's so it was able to consistently hold a higher g-force even though the second run had a higher peak g-force the third one was more consistent with it and so this is crazy 108 feet stopping distance with these cars versus best case 136 feet with these tires right here worst case this is a difference of 36 feet of 0.95 seconds between the two a whole another second of time and so i'm going to put up the video side by side of me doing this testing so you can see on the top this is me with the fusions and then on the bottom with the bridgestone re71rs and i'll put a green light green dot to the side of the video once it's come to a complete stop so both of these cars are stopping from about 65 miles per hour the bridgestones are actually starting one mile per hour faster but kind of negligible difference there for the video the testing is all measured from 60 exact so in the video you can see how much time difference there is between stopping coming to a complete stop and one versus the other and so you know i was looking at some prices online these fusion tires these vris and hris are no longer sold but they range from 65 bucks to 125 for the hris 95 to 120 for the vris i did the math uh basically let's say you got these as cheap as possible that was about 320 bucks i looked these tires up on tire rack uh today's pricing 536 for the set for both the front and the rear and remember those rears are slightly wider so 536 216 difference between those tires and these tires and yet they can stop 36 feet faster i mean imagine what you can do with an extra 36 feet with an extra almost a second to react so you know in emergency situations think about this you've got an additional 36 feet you've got an additional uh a duration of time to react to whatever emergency situation you need to and stop with these so is it worth saving 200 bucks uh to to lose that safety net which you have with these tires now i'm not saying you have to get all out summer tires they're certainly going to be better you know all seasons and regular summer tires that can handle the rain uh perhaps a bit better than these will but there are definitely better tires out there than the cheapest thing you find on the shelf and i think that's the important lesson to learn with this video you know actually invest some money in your tires because that's your safety and if it's for performance reasons if it's a track car obviously the benefits here are huge this is 0.29 g's maximum difference in deceleration between these two a third of a g so clearly those are going to have better lateral accel or lateral grip and they obviously as the data proves have much better deceleration longitudinal grip so very cool to see this data basically what happened with this comparison to give you kind of another idea with these tires on this car it was stopping worse than a cadillac escalade it was literally behaving worse significantly worse than a cadillac escalade and now with these bridgestone re71rs on it it is stopping faster than an alfa romeo 4c so it's it's gone across the entire spectrum as far as the performance and the braking purely from changing the tires the brakes are absolutely no different nothing else has changed on the vehicle it's just got new tires and it's able to stop significantly quicker so very cool to see the data and see that lesson uh in in real numbers of course i'll include links to the products used in the video description if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching you
