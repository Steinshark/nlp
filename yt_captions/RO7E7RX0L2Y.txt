imac stands for inter university micro electronic center located in belgium imek is one of the world's most advanced institutes for microelectronics research perhaps the most historically the semiconductor equipment manufacturer asml has collaborated very closely with imec to research develop and commercialize their tools this long-standing relationship has been very successful for both parties in this video i want to talk about this interesting organization from belgium and the unique way it helped asml become one of the world's leading semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers but first a sponsor read for the asian armature newsletter check out this particular one about cable's sodium ion battery the video for this got over 300 000 views the sign up link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show in 1982 the flemish government of belgium founded a program for advanced research in microelectronics the goal was to strengthen the small semiconductor industry in flanders a small district of about 6.6 million people local governments in belgium have unusually large control over their industrial development so in this case they had the authority to invest in building local industries the program involved setting up three things a laboratory for advanced research a semiconductor foundry and a training program for vlsi design two years later the advanced research laboratory part of the program became imec a non-profit organization located in the city of leuven at the time it had about 70 people led by a professor named roger van overstraten he was a stanford phd at the catholic university at leuven imac's stated mission was to perform r d ahead of industrial needs by three to ten years mostly in microelectronics and design but later expanded to other fields like energy the whole project began with an initial investment of 62 million euro that money helped invest in the latest micro electronics infrastructure like offices 200 millimeter clean room fabs and advanced research labs at its start in 1984 imac funded these expenses through public grants from the flemish government and privately generated annual revenue of about 6.5 million euro the flemish government is generous but every pocket has its bottom so obviously the research lab needed some way to generate money for itself and in the early 1990s imx vp of business development came up with an innovative one thus in 1991 imac introduced his r d partnership model the industrial affiliation program the industrial affiliation program is a business partnership model that helps share the cost of development between a number of partners it brings together a group of industrial researchers and imek researchers to focus on a specific technology imac offers these guys a chance to work together on a neutral ground with clearly defined project scope and ip ownership rules different parts of the value chain the foundries fabulous designers tool makers eda providers and so on all get to communicate and work together to create a single platform the costs of this technology development which can be sizeable are all shared while at the same time the ownership of valuable intellectual properties are either shared or exclusively kept based on how it is discovered it kind of reminds me of a hollywood movie you bring together a talented director actors set designers cinematographers costume designers a big pile of money and so on to closely collaborate on a single project the value of the ips are shared amongst each other based on predefined rules and at the end of the project everyone splits up and goes their own separate ways imec makes revenues from these partnerships both for participating and for the original ip it brings into the venture whatever i p imac finds and owns from those partnerships it turns around and uses to kickstart new partnerships asml makes tools for the semiconductor industry but the company has long considered its core competency to be a system designer and integrator rather than a deep research institute so for r d they closely collaborate with very competent organizations like zeiss philips and of course imac as described back in 2004 by their future president martin van der brink asml has been collaborating with imek on advanced lithography processes for many years the partnership provides asml with valuable early feedback from imec members some are also asml customers which enable us to speed products to market in exchange imec members benefit from early access to new processes and a faster learning curve once new products are installed in their facilities asml and imax relationship is one of the oldest in the industry dating back three decades to the first generation krypton fluoride stepper in 1989. lithography is a very important piece of the semiconductor manufacturing puzzle but it is not the only piece and they all have to fit together seamlessly so not knowing how your lithography tools might potentially play along with the other processes in the workflow can lead to bad outcomes nothing feels worse than you spending millions of dollars building a 200 millimeter sized pizza oven just to find out at the customer site that all of their pizzas are 300 millimeters wide so asml uses imex sort of like a watering hole to gather together other suppliers in the industry to coordinate on how to get everything to work together properly for instance in 1999 i met coordinated a project involving its 193 nanometer arf stepper the project goal was to develop and use different resist materials and masks for the 180 nanometer process node this project brought together researchers from asml five resist makers a resist coder developer four chip makers including from intel and texas instruments one mask tester and a partridge in a pear tree another common project goal is to test a particular tool that is still in development asml makes a new photolithography tool for next generation lithography like 157 nanometer or ev and they want to see how it is used inside a real fab but resources for such things are limited so they bring in imac and a few members from the chip makers to test the tool in a semi-real environment they will attach actual industrial tools from hitachi or tokyo electron to get the most honest review this has the side effect of being very effective marketing for asml and helped asml pull ahead of the japanese lithography makers canon and nikon during the industry transition to immersion lithography when intel dropped 157 nanometer lithography asml quickly recalibrated and decided to go all in on immersion lithography they quickly rushed their immersion prototypes out to imek ahead of the japanese nikon and canon unfortunately were not able to get one to imek as fast and so all the chip makers even the japanese ones got their first taste of immersion lithography with an asml device this eventually led to asml overtaken nikon and canon and assuming lithography leadership this has led to some grumbling from the japanese lithography tool makers who see imek as a glorified asml product showcase far from being a neutral space for researchers but losers whine about doing their best winners go home and take a nice bubble bath imac played a large role in asmo's commercialization of euv long before any euv prototype existed imec was collaborating with the industry's six biggest photo resist makers to find a suitable euv photoresist without a suitable tool imec did their tests using synchrotron generated eev radiation at the paul scherer institute in switzerland finally in august 2006 asml developed the first large-scale full-field euv lithography machine the alpha demo tool imec was one of the first two customers to receive a tool from asml the other customer was the college of nanoscale science and engineering of the state university of new york at albany new york what a mouthful of a name imac's goal with their demo tool was to evaluate its commercial usefulness using gradually more advanced process notes and in the meanwhile identify critical issues in the tool photoresist and the photo mask for some additional context on lithography and its various components i recommend checking out my previous video on 157 nanometer lithography then in 2011 imek received the nxe 3100 from asml and they worked closely with the laser supplier ushio to figure out how to increase the tool's wafer throughput and reduce defects and as euv approached commercialization imac used what they've learned to help integrate the tool into chipmaker's processes with euv now in foundries imac researchers are working on mapping out future process nodes as well as dealing with troublesome issues like stochastic printing failures in euv i think i'll probably cover some of this stuff down the line in future videos but not this one starting in the late 2000s imac has been expanding beyond its european roots it has been interesting to see the organization's global expansion in certain high value areas in 2008 they established their first overseas development center in xinju taiwan's silicon valley that facility has since expanded into a full-fledged r d center focusing on system development and product prototyping for our 2018 article imec taiwan focuses on helping taiwanese companies produce highly advanced products using their semiconductor expertise after that imec expanded to the united states opening a design center specializing in photonics and high performance computing in partnership with osceola county in neo city florida this peculiarly named city also hosts a number of semiconductor firms including sky water technology an american-owned pure place semiconductor foundry sky water has a 200 millimeter facility there and is planning an advanced packaging facility so it makes a lot of sense for imek to be there three years later in 2019 imec usa set up another r d office near the university of california near berkeley out in the sf bay area this office which apparently sits on a wework focuses on studying hardware software co-design and new structures for machine learning and like imac has other offices around the world including in india tokyo san francisco and shanghai however it seems like those offices largely perform interfacing functions with local markets most of the r d appears to happen in europe with the us and taiwan to a far lesser extent a frequent theme that i have seen throughout the history of the semiconductor industry is the critical importance of collaboration the semiconductor manufacturing process is so interdependent that no one company can go it alone imac is in the position it is as the world's most advanced semiconductor research center because of that collaboration their involvement across the value chain gives them high level insights that few individual companies are in a position to glean i am fascinated at how imac has managed to turn itself into a watering hole for a semiconductor collaboration a platform for building teams of rivals working towards a more technologically advanced future that's kind of special alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll
