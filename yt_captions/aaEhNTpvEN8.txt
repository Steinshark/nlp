Iran has a long-running water problem the country is already historically prone to aridity and low rains much of its Central lands are basically uninhabitable without water so over the years the country built a sprawling industrial water system to irrigate the dry soil and feed a booming population and that is where the problem begins in this video we're going to look at Iran's water history and its water management issues but first I want to remind you about the newsletter sign up for updates and new analysis the full scripts of selected popular videos and more the sign up link is in the video description below I try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show I haven't much mentioned Iran before so we should first do a watery introduction there's not much precipitation in Iran when it comes to annual average precipitation they are ranked 158th out of 189 countries furthermore 75 percent of that precipitation falls on just 25 percent of the country's area and 50 of Iran's rainfall occurs during the winter months just four percent during the summer certain areas like the central deserts get less than 50 millimeters of rainfall each year to Iran's North borders the Caspian Sea the world's largest inland body of water its water is brackish and not drinkable but can be desalinated the area also gets most of the country's rain to the South we find the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman this Southern water basin covers just a quarter of Iran's land but has nearly half of its renewable Water Resources there are large mountains and slopes facing these three bodies of water snow falls on them and melts creating several large rivers but with the exception of the karun river these rivers are seasonal they might overflow during the Spring but during the summer there is basically no flow the same goes for Lakes Iran has 10 lakes and most of them are very salty ultimately less than one percent of Iran's 1.6 million square kilometers is surface water there's just not a lot of water here this is not a new thing Iran has been dry for quite some time the first civilizations to arrive back in 1250 BC could only settle in the Region's relatively water-rich Southwest and Northwest settling deeper into the Arid Center required some water management then around 3 000 years ago the ancient Persians pioneered a sophisticated water supply system called the cannot it is kind of like an aqueduct a gently downward sloping underground tunnel that brought snow melt water down from the mountains to the plains sometimes going for tens of kilometers cannot relied purely on gravity so it worked automatically and since it was all underground the water stayed cool and did not evaporate when the water is not needed for irrigation the flow can be damned and stored for later use knowledge of how to build these canots was sophisticated and passed down from generation to generation their success helped them spread throughout the lands from Luxembourg to xinjiang prudent Water Management enabled the success of the akimenid Empire which ranged from 550 to 330 BC the Empire became the largest known Empire of its day despite being nowhere near a big river like the Yangtze or the Euphrates the cannot continued to be used for many years and the engineering discipline was steadily built out by many brilliant Persians over the years one of the oldest Hydro geology books ever written is over a thousand years old the extraction of hidden Waters by the Persian scientists and engineer Muhammad al-qaraji the book discusses the work of finding aquifers digging exploratory Wells and building canots in 1786 agat Muhammad Khan kahar founder of the ruling kahar Dynasty relocated the capital to Tehran Tehran had little access to surface water so over the next 200 years 500 cannots were built to supply the City's population with water other cities in Iran's Central Plains sprouted up and developed to supply all of these places with enough water Iran built many more cannots building over 270 thousand kilometers of underground tunnels in the 1900s however the population's water needs grew beyond the cannot's ability to supply them during the days of the Qahar Dynasty 30 percent of the population was nomadic they travel from place to place in Iran with their livestock taking advantage of the seasons but after World War One a new government led by Reza Shah palabi came to power trying to modernize the country these Nomads were settled into Villages which meant they needed new ways to consistently get water with little water available on the surface the Iranians look to hydraulic Mega projects like dams and irrigation systems Iran's first modern water well was built in 1915 and they quickly grew popular it's easy to see why building a cannot was expensive it can take up to 10 years extending or expanding one might take one to two more years and a great deal of manual labor drilling a hole and getting out groundwater with an electrically powered pump on the other hand can be done very quickly and Iran back then had plentiful amounts of groundwater the authorities pushed for these new and modern systems over the canots causing the ladder to fall into disrepair in 1945 Connaught supplied 75 percent of the country's Water by 1950 that had fallen to just 50 percent in 1963 Muhammad Reza Pahlavi the last Shah implemented a land reform scheme called the white Revolution population growth was accelerating back then 25.8 million large and expanding at about 3 percent each year many of these people moved to and lived in the cities driving rapid urbanization the Iranian Government tried to implement new industrial forms of Agriculture to grow enough food to feed this population the Land Reform tried to help with this its intention was to transfer 50 of the country's agricultural lands from landlord ownership to The Peasants those peasants were then to be taught new growing techniques and given tools like fertilizers to improve their productivity this land reform had profound effects on the canots previously the landlord paid for the maintenance of the Canucks essentially making them a public good the Land Reform took that off their hands no centralized authorities competently took over the Iranian Ministry of Water and Power established in 1964 did not pay the canots much attention and many fell into disrepair so the Land Reform of the 1960s dealt the knots a devastating Blow by two thousand less than 10 percent of Iran's water came from kanats down from the 50 percent in 1950. most of Iran is covered in bare rock mountains and deserts combined with its arid climate only 10.5 percent of the land is arable so the government built dams and pumped out groundwater to irrigate the land 19 new dam projects were initiated of which 14 were completed before 1979. this Industrial Level water management system allowed Iran to expand the amount of irrigated lands from 8 000 square kilometers in 1968 to 22 662 square kilometers in 1976. this policy was borrowed from America it was basically how the Americans developed the dry Western half of the United States so we shouldn't be surprised to see similar problems emerge in Iran too even in those days Iranians started experiencing the problems of groundwater over extraction in 1966 parliament passed laws to ban Drilling and over pumping after signs emerged of a dropping water table the reform didn't go well four out of five peasant families either received no land from the reform or failed to keep it this and other broken promises led to Social instabilities and paved the way to the Islamic revolution the Islamic revolution saw a new government take power in Iran to say the least this new Iranian government wasn't friendly with the West particularly the United States trade restrictions cut off Iranian access to more advanced water Technologies though I should note that water Technologies aren't exactly asml euv lithography machines the current Iranian water situation could not be attributed to a lack of access to water technology anyway these trade restrictions drove Iran to be self-sufficient in food a drive that gained massive National Security implications when Iran entered into the eight year long iran-iraq War at the same time the revolution also ushered in new changes that encouraged rapid population growth in the past three decades Iran's population has grown on average by 1 million people each year at the end of 2022 the World Bank estimates that there are 88.5 million people living in Iran the population has grown over four times since 1960 and doubled in the past 20 years this growth has slowed down somewhat recently the birth rate fell below replacement rate to 1.6 Iran's population policies are something I want to look at in a future video however it is still expanding at about 1.2 percent each year and the government wants to keep it that way for demographic aging reasons in order to support this growth and still be self-sufficient Iran needs to grow a lot of food from 1980 to 2010 Crop Production grew 175 percent this includes wheat potatoes and rice for carbohydrates the cereals wheat barley and rice are generally Iran's biggest crops in 1999 Iran tried to become self-sufficient in wheat becoming the 12th largest wheat producer by 2012. other cultivated items include vegetables sugar corn pistachios melons and soybeans which are for producing oil and feeding livestock I'm getting a little hungry now 93 of all the water Iran uses is for farming the mining industry is a distant second with 1.1 percent the Iranian government encouraged the agricultural sector by heavily subsidizing water and fertilizer costs and guaranteeing food purchase prices nearly free water for the farmers has encouraged its inefficient use Iran's average irrigation efficiency the percentage of the crops water need and the actual water used is under 35 percent this is due to over 70 of the land being surface irrigated meaning that a substantial amount is lost to evaporation this inefficiency has hurt agricultural productivity contributing to the sector's decline within the country's primarily oil-based economy agriculture provided just 12.4 percent of the country's 2021 GDP down from 25.9 percent in 1960. even despite all this Iran is still short of complete food self-sufficiency for instance in 2022 Iran still imported 1.8 million tons of wheat from Russia reforms to improve farming efficiency generally come up against the fact that agriculture still employs 23 percent of Iran's population the current government is sensitive to rural issues believing that one of the previous regime's biggest mistakes was to ignore the issues of The Villages and agriculture Iran's Water Management situation is a little messy even in the most advanced countries water management is a sensitive topic there are multiple stakeholders and compromises are almost always necessary just look at the tsmc Arizona water situation after the Islamic revolution Water Resource Management Affairs devolved from a single centralized body to several one department and four Ministries the Ministry of Health and Medical Education is responsible for setting up drinking water quality standards the ministry of energy the former Iranian Ministry of Water and Power allocates water for domestic industrial and agricultural use it also regulates Wastewater and hydropower then we have the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad this funny name is the result of a 2001 merger between the Ministry of Agriculture which allocates water amongst the farmers and collects water fees and the ministry of construction Jihad the ministry of construction Jihad built water infrastructure like water distribution pipes roads Bridges and water filtration systems they started off as a group of revolutionaries in a special organization Waging War or quote-unquote Jihad against rural poverty with big infrastructure projects their success elevated them to Ministry status in 1984 which caused tension until their merger and then the department of environment does water pollution control preparation policies and assesses hydropower and irrigation projects you can see how this divided situation prevents an integrated approach to the water supply issue in recent decades the Iranian government has tried to tackle the water issue by growing Supply rather than cutting demand not enough water more water more infrastructure more building Iran has continued and even supercharged its historical Dam building to become one of the world's biggest dam building countries Iran has over 588 big and small dams right now with about 100 more under construction depending on your source damning is controversial with widespread effects on the environment yes you get water reservoirs and hydroelectric power but years of water impoundment can damage the area often in unique and difficult to solve ways for instance the upper got Van Dam was only completed in 2012 but the reservoir has impounded and accumulated over 66.5 million tons of salt raising salinity levels in the soils of the surrounding area to feed Rising Urban water demand the government is building high-profile desalination plants on the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf but you must transport this water to the parched Central mega cities which is expensive and I don't think it's economically viable to use desalinated water for agriculture agricultural demand combined with this increasing development has been quite draining literally for the country's surface water take Lake ermia once the biggest lake in Iran and the Middle East it has shrunk aggressively due to persistent drought and water mismanagement a massive Bridge construction project begun in the 1970s and completed in the early 2000s has not helped it basically cut the lake in half accelerating its shrinkage today the lake is now a tenth of its former size its dry lake bed has caused huge salt storms ruining nearby Farms by dropping salt all over the soil this is not a one-off situation Hammond lake is Eastern Iran's largest body of fresh water located on the border with Afghanistan the lake had been a home for people for 5 000 years the lake is already quite seasonal shrinking and growing with the spring rains but during one bad drought in 2001 it vanished entirely the dry lake bed then caused big dust storms a serious health hazard 124 Villages surrounding the area had to be evacuated and then there is the groundwater situation as I mentioned Iran only recently started tapping its groundwater resources a trend that accelerated after the white Revolution land reforms however groundwater has quickly become the country's primary source of water accounting for 55 percent of the total Supply in 2021 nature published a major study of publicly available data in Iran's Wells it estimates that over 74 cubic kilometers of water was pulled out of the ground in the 13-year period from 2002 to 2015 alone that is equivalent to the 34th largest freshwater lake in the world by volume imagine lake in Canada in theory drilling Wells for groundwater should be regulated but in reality there is little enforcement of these laws from 1979 to 2013 the number of wells in Iran Grew From 47 000 to 789 thousand almost all of these are illegal not all of them successfully draw water but it shows the size of the demand as more groundwater is withdrawn the water table declines people are forced to drill deeper to get at that water this is especially the case during the country's serious droughts which will only intensify has the effects of climate change deepen there are real consequences for this for instance the soil and groundwater gets saltier electrical conductivity measurements of the soil a measurement of salinity are 85 percent higher in some areas like the car K Basin this Basin surrounds the karke river and is a big agricultural area declining groundwater levels also make the ground literally sink subsidence Iran's land is shrinking at an average of about six centimeters a year some areas reaching a staggering 19 centimeters a year sinking ground damages transmission lines Bridges and buildings it also undermines structural safety if ever an earthquake were to happen and if that is not enough subsidence damages the aquifer's capacity to carry water sometimes permanently in other words you can't get that back it might be tempting to point at Iran's massive population has the core issue at hand and indeed it does mean less renewable water per person but at the heart of it the story of Iran's Water Crisis is about demand and mismanagement difficult decisions will need to be made with regards to water usage in homes industry and most of all the Farms the question is whether these can be implemented without pissing off too many people that will be difficult for a populist government operating one of the world's most heavily subsidized economies amidst an increasingly turbulent climate change and political situation but the long-term costs of this water mismanagement are heavy long-term reforms are necessary all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the Channel Sign up for the newsletter and I'll see you
