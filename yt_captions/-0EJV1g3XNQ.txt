ladies and gentlemen another day another record that Magnus Carlson has broken and today I'm very excited to announce that Magnus Carlson now has the highest ever Blitz ELO achieved on chess.com Crossing and surpassing hikaru's recent 3336 with a record 3,340 yesterday Magnus lost LED onto chess.com and decided he had had enough of not being at the top of the leaderboard and good Lord my friends when I tell you uh this man absolutely crushed several opponents in a row I am not exaggerating I'm going to share a few of these games with you uh and he did it apparently on his phone and then he took a photo with someone's dog I think Magnus is currently in the US recently he celebrated his birthday uh at I think it was in Miami I don't know he's having a you go look miam Miami is like the best city in America to go to for 3 days or 5 days I like I I don't think there's a better place on Earth that's like great for three to five days and then is probably the worst place of all time uh anyway beautiful dog uh I was going to say beautiful man but you know what I self-explanatory uh and um his chest is beautiful and also speaks for itself and in today's video I am going to show you his games from yesterday's run also I have co uh I have co uh yesterday I recorded a video where I said my throat hurt and then after that video I decided to test just because I had to fly you know I'm a responsible man uh and a beautiful one by the way uh and um and it turns out I I I I have Co it's very mild this time around and CO's this weird thing now where like half the population you tell me have Co they're like it's just a cold go get on a plane it's like look you know I'm going to do the responsible I'm stay home till I test negative uh and um I'm still going to try to get to Toronto but The Fan event won't happen on December 7th it's going to be rescheduled email should have gone out uh to January 26th I hope and if you can't make it that day then we will refund you and I'm going to try to be in Toronto for the Champions chess tour finals which begins on December 9th uh and I got energy I mean I'm just positive but you know I'm also positive because I tested for Good Vibes that was horrible Magnus plays D4 I'm going to take you up the rating ladder from 3313 to 3340 in this game he's playing the second best Norwegian chess player in the world Ari andari Knight F6 and Magnus plays G4 I just realized game review is going to give us feedback which I find very funny uh it's going to give us these these annotations which is which is quite hilarious um yeah this is a Gambit this is called the Gibbons ven Haagen Gambit and basically Magnus is just giving away his G Pawn to take the entire Center like this it's a terrible opening but not when he plays it when I play it I you know I just I just lose all my games uh the idea is very simple you give away a flank Pawn a Side Pawn to take control of the center win Tempe against your opponent uh and then you want to maybe even use the G file to attack the best move here is definitely for black to move the D- Pawn fighting back for space in the center and defending the Knight on G4 um but uh Arian goes back Magnus attacks him again and again and again I mean he just pushes him all the way I don't know why game review is on by the way I hope it's not on for the rest of these uh for some reason here it's going to give us these annotations uh and and Magnus basically just develops as fast as possible Right like again the computer is is just being a mega hater but uh well it is what it is Arian captures the Knight takes Magnus has a very big Center he's going to play Knight F3 he's going to put his Rook on G1 he's going to play Bishop G5 targeting the queen and maybe trading off that Bishop which will soften up that G7 Pawn uh for the Rook when it oh my goodness when it gets to the open file that's basically my only symptom it's like my throat a little bit and a slight cough and I guess I have to talk for 30 minutes on camera uh so I'm going to be coughing a little bit I do apologize but I feel much better like I had Co last year it was very bad I had fever I felt Dead uh now I just feel dead in side but that's because I'm a chess player night I got Co for my birthday I mean like seriously anyway Magnus is two pawns down and makes a rook move which is just like gangster Behavior Rook G1 the idea of Rook G1 is that if Arian takes another Pawn Magnus is going to go here and if this trade happens he's going to be able to take on G7 which is the entire idea uh Arian clearly doesn't like that so he doesn't take the pawn Magnus still goes Bishop G5 so he's played this double Pawn Gibbons V ven Haagen Gambit Arian playing Queen D7 and then trying to fight with his Knight but the second that Arian takes his Knight off the center Magnus takes this way and the idea is that there is now a very nasty threat and the threat is Rook D1 and uh the threat is hitting the queen and then mate so sensing that you know Arian has to do something he takes on C4 and Magnus obviously has to no he doesn't he hits him with Rook D1 anyway the queen is hanging it can't move because that's mate which is brutal and so Arian he can move the Knight back and cover instead he sacrifices the queen which apparently is a mistake Magnus centralizes forcing his opponent to make a rook move so now he can't Castle That way not that he was maybe planning it anyway he shoves aran's Bishop back then he plays Knight B3 looking to reroute at some point he tries to trade off aran's Bishop so he can soften up that notice the time Advantage as well and he just puts his King on C1 King is completely safe Arian has 12 seconds Bishop takes Knight C5 and when this Knight gets in boink this is hanging that's hanging and the game ends in a very brutal way Arian runs away with his Bishop but his King perishes and is brutally checkmated in the center of the board by wh's pieces King has nowhere to go Knight and queen swarm what a game uh I love when Magnus plays offbeat gambits like it's so much fun watching him play these like ridiculous openings and by the way this is really not that bad of a Gambit I mean it is it is aggressive it is bold uh but uh not all the games that Magnus played to get to 3340 were were that crazy uh this game against nihal sarin was one of the most impressive positional games I've ever SE seen in my life and I say that a lot when he plays so first Magnus played D4 Knight C6 which is like super provocative because obviously white can go here and attack Black's Knight and then black will get you know booted around the center um but Nial is a London player so he plays the London so how does Magnus Carlson defeat an opening that is as annoying as the London he plays an imbalanced way put puts the bishop on G4 and then he develops his pieces in a way that that that's pretty confrontational and now Magnus does something which is very funny like we're teaching all of our you know students like put a knight in the set Castle no he just plays H5 dude just straight up plays H5 plays H5 because if you play H3 this could happen in the future which is really really bad uh for white now Nial allows Magnus to push on that side of the board and then kicks him out with his own H3 and now basically says look Magnus this Pawn's going to be a liability it's not going to be an asset and I'm going to play C4 I'm I'm playing in a in a style of Queen's Gambit right C4 solid position I've made no no mistakes I have an advantage stockfish claims I have an advantage Magna says yeah yeah I know but the only way I'm going to beat a player of nihal's caliber is creating a little bit of a tactical situation a little bit of a confrontational situation all right like a little bit of a of a fight of a struggle you know but by pushing your H Pawn all the way really like okay fine puts the bishop on e4 notice how Nial is playing very fast by the way Nial is not intimidated by Magnus he is one of the world's fastest players and accurate Magnus puts the bishop on D5 and when this Knight left the pressure Magnus now castles despite having that pawn all the way Advanced on H4 and the computer agrees with him somehow he just understands that this Pawn can't really be targeted for example Knight F3 you just take play D5 and actually you're going to see that that kind of happens Bishop F3 and instead of taking the bishop allowing the Knight to get there Magnus takes this Knight and then he puts his Pawn on D5 to have a strong Center and then he just starts focusing on the queen side he's like all right Nal you want to trade Queens let's go I have a liability over here but I think I'm strong enough to beat you in a position that's completely symmetrical neither side has a c Pawn white has a bishop for a knight IM balance which is supposed to be slightly better Bishop to E2 and the idea is very simple Knight F3 and I want to win your Pawn I just want to go Knight F3 and at which point this Pawn is going to fall the Magnus plays G5 and the idea of G5 is to meet Knight F3 with Knight H7 or Knight E4 and you're going to see that this encroachment on the the white position is not just a defensive necessity for the black position it's actually designed in an aggressive way now Magnus Zips out to to D7 he could play here also his King could go to G7 right there it is slow Improvement it's a very boring position no C pawns the Rooks are staring at each other nobody wants to take the other person's Rook because if you take the other guy's Rook his Rook is going to control the whole file now Magnus plays F5 oh my clamping on that and the king is going to go join the pawns this is what you need in an end game if you can take space without creating weaknesses it's a good thing you should push pawns and chest as long as you're not creating weaknesses this is a weakness but it's not attackable which is important if the Knight could attack that pawn or the bishop could attack that would be a problem there's no way Nal starts attacking Magnus Magnus backs up strikes at him with his flank Pawn we have a trade and now this is the best move Magnus plays all game and it is a highlevel move Knight db8 returning I don't remember which Knight that was but it goes to a home Square reinforcing the Knight trying to get out and there that is now a threat so he has to be defended Magnus now looks to take over the file by doubling the Rooks we have a trade we have equal material symmetrical pawns bde fgh two Rooks and a knight how is Magnus going to win this game it's 0 against one of the best Blitz players in the world Nal sarin activate the Rook control the file control the file now there's a golden rule in chess if you want to win an endgame that you are trying to win particularly with Rooks you trade one pair of Rooks if you are trying to draw you trade both and I'm saying that because the best move here for white was King D1 I'm not saying I would have played King D1 and I'm not saying Magnus would have traded both Rooks he probably would have gone here but that's the the point you try to trade all the Rooks cuz Knight vers Knight probably can't win but let me tell you who can win one rook and one Knight and the reason for that is defending with a rook is very challenging against an offensive rook and watch this suddenly that pawn formation is an asset Knight C6 that pawn is a weakness I'm zipping I'm I'm I'm zigging and I'm zagging right I'm going to G1 Knight B3 and nal's entire position falls apart and that pawn is a hero B7 by the way if you're confused what happened there he didn't take because there would have been this but G takes H3 the Pawn's just going now he takes he takes because of B7 Rook G8 Knight D7 here you do make your queen but uh and the crazy thing is that pawn that Magnus advanced in the opening H5 and H4 literally won him the game it won him the game because Nial reacted and they played the entire end game on completely symmetrical position but all Magnus had is a space advantage and it is so crazy to me he turned this into a win he turned this into a winning idea this is a 3100 rated Blitz player like you and I could live three lifetimes combine all of our trustability we wouldn't be near that level crazy also I don't know why Nal always changes like he's playing under the Tanzania flag I he always Chile um anyway what a game um I got two more for you uh and uh this one was against wonderful time wonderful time is Twan mlle for a long time he was the world's strongest I am he was crazy good at Blitz is crazy good at Blitz I drew him recently which was a big accomplishment for me in title Tuesday Magnus at this point 33-25 uh and we will end the day with him playing Daniel nitzki um Daniel nitzki probably was awake at like two in the morning when Magnus was playing these games like yo I gotta get some games against Magnus and Magnus was on fire wonderful time Twan mlay was actually streaming these games as well they played a a long match actually mlay did quite well he had some good positions against Magnus uh E4 E5 and Magnus plays a Gambit he plays the Danish Gambit uh the Goring Gambit is technically Knight F3 Knight C6 D4 technically this is the Goring gamut with Knight F3 Knight C6 but D4 and now not Queen takes but this and rather than playing takes and accepting the Danish Gambit mlay plays this move and the theory here is that white takes has an isolated Pawn develops and black plants the queen on C4 those of you that are Advanced players who actually study the theory of some of these gambits uh like you know at 900 at 900 life is good you know your opponent uh you play this your opponent takes you go here your opponent takes and your opponent like hangs a queen like that's life you know at triple digits uh but you have to study your theory at 900 so CD4 Knight C6 white does this it looks like like black is able to win this Pawn by taking but you can't do that cuz I would remove your oxygen tank I would take your knight with check and then I would take your queen for free so rather than that black goes here and then takes and plays Queen C4 and this has all been played before the idea is to prevent white from castling that's basically the point and now black wants to Castle put pressure on White's Center all been played before what does Magnus do what he does best it sends an invitation to to to mle like let's go to the end game Queen B3 mlay says yes I would like to go to the end game but I want to do it my way now you'll notice mlay spent 30 seconds on that move more 27 plus 17 more than 30 seconds that was a that was that was terrible calculation by me I have Co I have Co brain uh 44 seconds right um now this is Theory at which point you know white has the doubled pawns but the active rook and then both sides Castle but Magnus uh does this and just very cleanly just snags a pawn just takes the B7 Pawn uh gives his opponent a check and Now does not guard the pawn here but rather gets out of the way because the pawn on B2 is not that significant because then I'll go here and I'll immediately Counterattack so mlay accidentally kind of falls into a little bit of an opening trap and basically has to trade off some pieces and we have the following position Magnus has Bishop for a knight and an extra pawn and a little bit of imbalance to work with and he just makes it look so simple all right how do like how do you win this with white you probably plant your Bishop somewhere it's solid defended and sniping the enemy position then you advance your pawns you got to double up your rook and remember the rule of thumb if you're going to trade Rooks you can trade one I would not trade both but when you have Bishop endgame up upon PA probably you're going to win all right but last game it was not as clear so he gets his Bishop kicked out here comes L creating counterplay right now some of you would be tempted to defend your Pawn here let's say Rook C1 but then black is going to get active black is going to start bothering you play Knight D2 for example Rook A6 and you got to be very careful Magnus here understands that this is not a major problem plays Rook F5 the point is that if Knight C3 which is completely free by the way suddenly there's that let's say you play F6 Rook C5 which is brutal because then I get in and I'm gonna I'm going to eat everybody over there so mlle has to defend his King now Magnus goes here he immediately warps The Rook around to attack the pawn that is the softest in the black position forcing black to play this ugly but necessary defensive move that Rook is toast and now and only now he advances his weakness he's going to go here that move has two purposes deflect The Rook from the defense of the pawn but second fix the pawn on the same color Square as the bishop white wants a world in which he can exploit the pawns on the same color Square as his Bishop like that by the way by the way but also he wants a world in which at least one Rook survives to Target the other pawns on the dark squares so The Rook is going to Target pawns on both colors the bishop is going to Target pawns on light squares and the pawns are going to work in a way where they create a barrier pushing back the opponent's pieces and not letting them get comfortable on any squares and then since it's an end game that doesn't have Queens the king is going to play a a prominent role with Queens a king really shouldn't play a prominent role in the end game cuz he's going to get smacked around cuz the queen is a beast all right Knight D2 and by the way what a move targeting that Bishop that's a little bit stuck in the mud gangster move here from Magnus the threat from black is to grab the bishop and get in my dude says you want to take my Bishop King F2 Bozo King F2 now if you want my Bishop you activate my Rook this leads to Rook A7 and the collapse of your position right we get into a rook end game I have this and they are mobile that is a mobile set of Pawns now mlay does it his own way he does it like this Knight B3 at this point mlay is busted up he doesn't trade Rooks he keeps The Rook active but it's just a matter of time Magnus is rapidly approaching the position first he goes here and plays defense but again he's also up like 50 seconds on the clock so he could technically do anything if this was titled Tuesday and they had a second of bonus time he actually has to win the game he can't just like stall F5 but look how clinical this is that pawn is the the last Pawn remaining Rook C7 but there's another major problem here for black I wonder if you understand what it is that Pawn's weak but what is the other major problem for black in this end game it's the king when your king is not just not active when your king is actively exploitable it's a problem Rook A1 of course Magnus finds it abandoning his Pawn because I'm gonna get into the back rank it's not made but I'm GNA trade your Rook remove the defense of this pawn and it looks like I can't get in at all right now but let me tell you when that pawn goes away I suddenly have two connected pass pawns two connected pass pawns three four squares away from queening is fatal and when the dust settles Magnus is only a pawn up but let me tell you this feels a lot more than like like a lot more than one Pawn now it really feels like a lot more than one Pawn he pushes you can't let the king get close if King E8 you don't give a check you don't give a check you can give a check as long as you come back but you just play Rook C 7 and the idea is you go for these pawns right let's say black plays G6 you you you can even snag another Pawn but you have to set this up in a way where you slowly bring everybody forward grab as much as you can and then push push in a methodical way King F7 Rook C7 now you can push why can you push because you will play C6 here Ure the queen promotes or black does this and you promote with discover check and you win the game and so Magnus got to 3330 clean game and this one against da was sick this was the game that clinched him the highest Blitz ELO 3340 of all time I think the game previous he had broken the record or he had tied it maybe he was 3336 or 3337 but ending it on a good note highest ever rating petting a dog while while he's at it E4 from Daniel nitzki Daniel in my opinion in three Blitz particularly online Blitz with no increment no bonus time I think Daniel nitzki on a good day is the third best I want I want I want you to listen to what I'm saying three minute no bonus time especially online with a mouse the three best players in the world are mnus Hikaru and Daniel nitzki on a good day that third place spot could be up for debate it could be fuja it could be Nial sarin who I just showed you but these guys guys are monsters in 3 you start adding bonus time like 3132 it's no longer Dian because he loses a little bit of that element of like time because he's an aggressive player he's an initiative player but if you let his opponents have a Lifeline not to lose on time that's a big Lifeline but he's in my opinion on a good day top three in the world in three in three chess which is crazy which is like a crazy accomplishment so very cool to see him playing Bishop B5 it's a close Sicilian with Bishop to B5 check it's called the canal attack or the MOs I thought this was called the Moscow variation but I don't know uh and basically white brings the bishop back because he already forced black to make certain commitments Magnus plays E6 and then starts taking a little bit of space on the queen side he's going to play Bishop E7 Bishop B7 and then he's going to Castle or he's not going to do any of that he just's going to play C4 which is interesting so I don't know why he would play C4 and not finish up his development first but that's why I talk about the games and he plays them he does this right away way now it's a matter of which of these Pawn breaks is white going to use right closed position eight pawns each Pawn break to make progress he does it this way Magnus is not going to take he wants to keep his pawns together but to enable that he needs to make sure this Rook is protected because every time a pawn moves mentally you have to think what's happening in the position what's opening Bishop B7 now two things defend the Rook we have a big trade da develops the Knight targeting that weak pawn and Magnus h what why did Magnus not play like that or that or something I I guess he didn't like Knight D4 which is crazy this dude just straight up gives away a pawn for nothing now I don't think this was exactly planned but I think his level of understanding here is so high again this could be just guess like I could be guessing him up it could have been 2 a.m. in Miami Magnus was in his underwear like on the toilet and he just hung the pawn on B5 and he just overes underestimated White's position but actually in the Fallout it's really the position's really interesting because despite being down a full Pawn like a pawn that just got taken and you know a move later he just gets out of the position like nothing happened despite that happening somehow this Pawn controls such important squares in the white position which if white doesn't fight back for those squares with D3 or B3 he's never going to develop the dark squared Bishop he's going to have to move his D or B Pawn and it's actually not that easy to do so Knight B5 for example castles you may ask why not this well because actually who's going to guard that like that's that pawn is going to be taken take take take you know Queen E2 I'm gonna go D5 like Black's chilling and then black is going to spend the rest of the game fighting against these two so Knight A3 and now Magnus plays D5 he he's the one he's the one calling the shots he's like not so fast D even D5 is a weird move to me because I thought the whole idea was to pressure this he says no let's trade naris is happy to make that trade Bishop D5 and niski gets everything he wants he gets everything that you would think he wants in the position he gets to trade off his weak e four Pawn which was Under Fire the C4 Pawn which was a thorn he's Pawn up clean Pawn how is black better how how is that possible well he's better because how is white actually going to you like are these two pawns that are just standing around are they assets or are they liabilities right it's like white has two precious jewels but black has an avalanche has two Steamrollers just going straight at them so are they assets or they liabilities like like I just want to draw your attention to something if white got several moves in a row okay and got a position that looked like this right and then you know let's say Rook C8 and then black played like Knight C white played Knight C4 and then white played like Bishop D2 and then like Rook B1 now white is winning look at the evaluation right now white is pressuring now in a perfect world what would happen is that you know white would get these pawns like this but that it's not a perfect world it's not a perfect world so how are you going to ensure that happens well di starts pushing the second he pushes boom and now that's weak Magnus trades Bishops why does he trade because naroditsky lost the pawn so instead of B4 the computer wanted white to undevelop his Knight and defend that's not that's so hard I mean and then Magnus would have gone here and then he would have put his Queen on A1 just for good measure I mean like look how disrespectful the move Queen A1 is it's not the best move but it's and he grabs this narad disc's Pawn has fallen he no longer has an advantage let me tell you this Pawn's not feeling so good without its friend all right qu look at that move the shish kebab right here we got the the red pepper the green pepper we got the Adon Kebab on there Bishop Chief oh where's that move coming from Queen poking at the pawn Knight C5 immediately taking advantage of the weaken square and Magnus won the pawn he won the pawn Knight A7 though is a fork slight blunder should have imp patient should have played Rook A8 first Knight D4 both guys miss it we're going to forgive him for that Queen A4 Knight E4 hits the Queen Bishop takes Queen E4 and now boink a clean Fork White could play something like rookie too but I got news for you I could maybe even take this take take back rang Checkmate but that's not how the game ends the game ends Queen B1 Magnus grabs the Knight not only does he grab the Knight he grabs 3340 the highest Blitz ELO in chess.com history uh doing it by winning like 90% of his games in crazy like interesting sacrificing a pawn for a positional grind that game against nalar and one of the most impressive symmetrical type of positions I've ever seen him win that game against wonderful time Pawn up surgical technique the crazy game against tar earlier it's just fun it's it's just fun to watch and he did it all while apparently on an iPhone just like hanging out in a friend's house unless you have place in Florida too but um very fun I mean it's just it's just cool to see and um I'm going to go rest my throat um you all have a great rest of year December 6th or whenever you're watching this video uh that's all I have for you today get out of here
