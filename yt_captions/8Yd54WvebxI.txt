ladies and gentlemen it's currently early 2024 and AI is taking over the world artificial intelligence is the Cornerstone of every single international business conference AI potentially poses a massive problem for a ton of Industries and many many people could potentially lose their jobs careers passions as AI takes over except in chess in chess we live in harmony with our AI overlords you see Ai and chess can be completely horrible at the game it can be the best in the world at the game it doesn't matter we extract the benefits from AI but people still want to see human beings play chess and in today's video I've got a treat for you because I I discovered a new terrifying but absolutely hilarious chest bot and this chest bot doesn't even have a name you see I was browsing snap Snapchat people my age used to use it back in the day now I don't I don't even know who uses it and there's an AI on there and I played that AI that AI is supposed to be a mirror of yourself and I played it in a game of chess and you are not going to regret clicking on this video because buckle up this was absolutely nuts this bot doesn't have a name maybe it should have a name call it something interesting like Dexter remember those remember those cartoons on Cartoon Network I was playing with the black pieces in this game and this is truly seven-dimensional chess the bot began with the move E4 I was actually quite shocked the bot even knew the move E4 like I thought it wouldn't and I thought all right I'm playing a bot I don't know how good it is let me play C5 let's keep in mind that uh I once lost a game of chest to a treadmill I haven't made a video about that game cuz back then I wasn't a YouTuber but you never know how good an AI is until you start playing it so E4 C5 I went for the Sicilian Defense this is the the most confrontational opening against the Kings Pawn did not go for for my traditional caroan and here the AI played Knight C3 okay Knight C3 is a close Sicilian you know generally the open Sicilian is predicated upon whether white plays the move d4 or not if White's not going to play D4 CU they don't want to get their Queen in the center we're going to have we're going to have closest cilian so I played A6 A6 is an interesting move generally against the close Sicilian black will put the bishop on G7 this is known as the dragon style Sicilian uh but A6 is designed to very quickly expand over here it's one of the most common moves and maybe even to B4 slowly kicked the Knight out of the center so I played A6 and the AI played Bishop C4 already maybe a slight inaccuracy to move Bishop C4 uh Bishop C4 is um generally not good if it's going to run into this move B5 but you know we're going to see what happens uh and uh I played B5 right so okay terrific uh I'm attacking the bishop on C4 now at this point things already got a little bit weird and I I I I thought I wasn't going to have enough content here because in this position the computer played Queen B3 now that's Mateen one if it's White's move this is always thinking it's white to move so you know you can keep an eye on this queen B3 I told it you can't play Queen B3 you can't teleport through your opponent said oh man all right I'll play Knight F3 you know this is generally considered pretty good protocol developing your pieces like this but I thought well the bot made a mistake because now I can just take the bishop I told it it couldn't play Queen B3 it tried to develop okay no problem so I took the bishop I thought okay I'm in good shape now I'm up a bishop but I wasn't ready in this position it played Bishop takes C4 it Monster reborned its bishop and that's how I knew we are going to get content out of this video you see I I I just had a Pawn on that square I took the bishop instant replay the bishop respawned I don't have a pawn anymore now I follow the rules of the game okay I'm not going to spawn any pieces I am basically playing against a bot that has an unlimited supply of pieces at any given moment so I'm ready to lose right now I got to protect my king before it spawn something on my king so I played the move E6 I think this is a pretty good move it blocks my opponent's Bishop's diagonal and now for some reason the bot here the bot did kind of a Switcheroo on me I wasn't really ready for this one I thought the bot was going to Castle but it decided to play Bishop back to D3 safe move right now I know I've got to develop I've got to I've got to you know get my pieces out slowly so it played Bishop to D3 and I developed the Knight to F6 now again a move ago what it probably should have done other than Castle is it should open up the center of the board to get out its Bishop but what I wasn't ready for is that it would do the old switcher Roo it would play Bishop D3 and then Bo it would pogo stick over the bishop to do kids still pogo stick or do they just Tik Tok Dance all day I don't even know uh but pogo stick right Pogo sticked uh over the bishop uh on D3 people still have Razor scooters is that a thing I feel like a geriatric uh older uh citizen here just sitting here complaining about the youth anyway D4 is a natural move I told you in the very beginning of this video that if it wants to play an open Sicilian it's going to play D4 it's predicated upon that move clearly uh the name bot does in fact want to do that I took on D4 uh and it played uh Knight takes D4 so far so good now it's going to Castle it's going to play Bishop G5 and F4 and we're going to have a nice and exciting Sicilian on our hands I mean I don't have a B Pawn but whatever it's fine I I'll live so here I played Knight C6 okay I played Knight C6 the idea of course is to is to Target the Knight on the center of the board and and again remember this bot Breaks the Rules but sometimes it actually plays logically so I have absolutely no idea what's in its brain in this position it played Bishop to E3 defending the Knight like that's the worst part about this bot is that it's a complete that bends the rules and has no idea where any of the pieces are and then it'll play a really logical move it's kind of like you it sort of plays chess pretty similarly to how you play chess you're you're not too different this nameless robot and yourself uh you just know how to poop and stuff not always in the right location I mean but whatever anyway Bishop 2 E3 all right Bishop 2 E3 and I and and I developed my Bishop to B4 this a very common move in the Sicilian particularly in E6 A6 Sicilians known as the timonov or the pulson Khan there's a little bit of information for you you like to put the bishop over here put some pressure right so Bishop B4 and in this position um the the bot castled it it castled its king I actually kind of suggested castling so I played Bishop to B4 and I was like I play Bishop B4 you should really consider castling your king I just wanted to know if it knew what that was and it said okay I Castle oh oh and I was like oh oh oh oh oh oh oh so I also castled all right not like that we both castled our Kings all right both of us have castled our Kings and then in this position the bot said okay your move and I was like no but I just Castle what are you talking what I thought I I thought this was the end of the game but uh the bot said okay well I Castle again I didn't want to argue with it you know what if it wants to Castle a second time it wants to like really Castle I said all right fine Knight takes D4 I figured the less pieces the bot has the better right and and and in general the move that I would like to play in this position like right now just from a optical standpoint my Bishop is a little bit behind in development and I want to attack a pawn in the center like this but I can't do that unless you know the knight's going to take so I thought all right look if I get rid of my opponent's pieces then I'm going to trade then I'm going to attack the center then that's how we're going to play now I was not ready for the pogo stick Jutsu again because in this position the terrifying bot play Queen takes D4 it forgot it moved its Bishop there it jumped over fine and now it's attacking my Bishop good move white definitely has an advantage the position is plus 3.85 because it thinks it's white to move at which point why would take my Bishop I played a move here I'm not really proud of it's not a good move I should probably bring the bishop back I should keep the bishop alive I took the Knight that's not a good move you see there white definitely has an advantage uh White is uh White is up upon Pawn um and if white takes with the queen or the pawn I probably got to you know very quickly fight back here uh so I took and then it played B takes C3 and now white just white is just clearly better right if you look at the evaluation it's plus two because again it thinks it's white a move if you're wondering why white is clearly better I have a lot of dark sked weaknesses I'm also a pawn down so I'm a pawn down my Bishop is stuck White's got a very powerful Queen White has the only dark sored Bishop on the board and white is going to play Rook B1 Rook D1 put some very serious pressure on me and just not let me get my Bishop out so I'm down a pawn and I have no compensation this is what we call White is up a pawn and has the compensation right but I played Bishop B7 I'm keeping a positive outlook on life I'm going to play D5 I'm going to put my Rook on the C file and we are going to see what happens and white plays Rook fd1 which is a really good move um yeah I mean putting a rook in the center of the board ready to fight on the def file the bot is also going to go here like I said it makes a lot of dumb moves but then it also plays the game the right way which is very very frustrating right now the best move here for black probably to fight back in the center of the board and so I uh I played Pawn to D5 okay and um yeah now black is back in business you know white can take this Pawn if white takes this Pawn I'm going to maybe take with a knight and then I'm fighting against these doubled pawns if this Pawn is here which I can just move over white is much better but you see the evaluation is point plus. N9 0.1 and here it's 1.3 1.2 it'll it'll get up there a little bit if it thinks for a little bit longer but but it's definitely better to have UND doubled pawns right so I play D5 and now here um the terrifying bot plays Bishop takes D5 so it chops down on my Pawn by jumping over the queen okay now I'm a smart guy uh so I play Pawn takes D5 right it took me and now now I'm I'm in good shape I'm up a bishop I thought all right it blundered stupid bot I take terrific it took back now here I could trade the queen actually it's probably the best move offer a queen trade my queen is well supported two times and if the bot doesn't take me I can make the bot now I was a little bit worried about bringing out my queen why was I worried about bringing out my queen because the ghost of the bishop is haunting this Pawn you understand this bishop already respawned multiple times so I had a a feeling if I took it would spawn a bishop out of nowhere all right I was very worried about this I was very worried that if I played Queen D5 a bishop would just fly over from z27 and take my queen which is why in this position I went Knight takes D5 and I was right I was rightfully afraid of the bot because in this position the bot played Pawn takes D5 it played Pawn takes D5 and I asked it where was the pawn it said the pawn was on e4 so I I was right not to put my queen in the center because it would have taken me so I played Knight takes D5 and it took whoops and it took my knight with the pawn now I'm now I'm losing all right again I will remind you that a moments ago this was the position I was up a knight I was about to trade the Knight for the bishop I was going to bring my queen out there not not right now not right now but just in the future I was going to deliver me now I'm down all right I'm losing by three pawns I just went from down one Pawn to down three pawns I don't have any pieces and white is going to win this game by playing C4 C5 C6 D6 marching down the center of the board and beating me or mating me just straight up mating me over here now this is tough this is really tough at this point I was mad for doing this and um you know I didn't think that any content was going to come out of this so I said you know what we're going to buckle up rookie 8 we're going to take the open file and we are going to play this end game like Magnus Carlson and like I said I am not going to bend the rules I am a proper man I'm going to follow the rules of the game of chess and if this bot wants to be a deviant okay wants to be a criminal of the game wants to uh denigrate the game all right wants to bring the game of chess into disrepute then it can and in this position the bot played C4 and like I said this bot Breaks the Rules but when it's time not to break the rules there goes Its pawn and it is going to March the pawn directly into C I'm completely lost I have absolutely nothing so I buckle up and I play Rook C8 and as if it wasn't bad enough of course the best move in this position is C5 unquestionably the best move is just to March into the position because I can't do anything maybe the second best move is to Triple up overprotect the pawn make sure the king is not M it on the back rank at any point just put the bwn on C6 as if it wasn't bad enough this position and this bot hadn't cheated enough in this game in this position the bot played C2 to B3 the bot played B3 and I said which Pawn went to B3 and the bot said this one now it UND doubled its pawns I told you like three minutes ago the only thing that's good about the black position is the fact that white has doubled C pawns they don't have doubled C pawns anymore not only does white not have doubled C pawns the bot was trying to play Connect 4 the entire time I mean what am I supposed to do all right I'm a human being I have limitations I can't fly all right I got I got I got to get into a gigantic metal object def I don't have wings I can't even play chess properly I got a thing against me that's playing connect for and chess at the same time and it probably knows my location and it probably knows what I want to buy next week probably knows when I'm going to name my first child I I like I what am I supposed to do I did whatever I what what any human being could do I tried to fight back I played A5 played A5 what's the idea of A5 I'm trying to use my flank Pawn to take and then damage the structure I don't know what did the bot do when I played A5 it didn't play C5 luckily it forgot about that it played A3 okay what did I do followed my plan followed my dreams played A4 because now if it takes me it's got a couple of weaknesses I don't know we we'll hope for the best we'll see what happens I maybe right maybe okay terrific he played B4 yeah now it's plus 4.7 5.3 all right and it it's just winning it has three connected pass pawns that's what we call that we call a pawn that if it has no pawns stopping its path to the end of the board it's called a pass Pawn we call two pawns together this connected path pawns we call this three connected path pawns you know what we really call it we call it a migraine that's what we call it it's a migraine I'm lost so I played Bishop A6 because I got to do something and I don't want to resign all right the entire idea was to weaken the Bots Pawn on the C4 Square which is exactly what I did now the bot wins by playing C5 or B5 B5 and C5 it's all completely winning like I said look as if cheating wasn't bad enough as if having the capability to do anything you want at any given moment was not good enough in this position the bot played Knight to B1 now admittedly it would have been better to attack my Bishop first and then play Knight B1 I mean if it wanted a night it should have at least prevented me from taking the pawn on C4 because now not only am I getting counterplay I'm getting hope and the most dangerous thing to give a person who is at their wits end is Hope especially in a competitive environment so my bot plays Knight to B1 respawns a night just really wanted a knight really wanted a knight so I played Rook takes C4 because that's defended now at this point I'm ready for you know a bishop to reappear and to take my Rook but I got to go for something I mean I can't just give up right I have to go for something so I play Rook takes C4 to my surprise the bot plays Queen to D2 so I said okay now we're back in business okay the bot is up Five Points of material but now I can do what's called a rook swing this is called a rook swing a rook lift whatever you want to call it and now this is how we are going to create counterplay we are going to try to beat the bot like this this is what we are going to try to do all right this kind of reminds me of um Yu-Gi-Oh the Yu-Gi-Oh the original after darts and Atlantis the big battle the the the Kaiba tournament that he put on and Yugi the Pharaoh was dueling against Leon the little kid with the red hair and it like he won the duel with the last card basically like he has to throw away half his cards every single time because the castle of strongberg or if if this isn't resonating with you you got to watch the original Yu-Gi-Oh not the one on the motorcycles that one is I don't even that's teaching people to like text and drive seriously I don't even know anyway my point is Rook G4 we're down to our Wits End we've got to do what we can we've got to go for the king now again instant replay the queen just went to D2 right it just went to D2 well now the bot decides that it doesn't like where the queen is and the queen actually turns into a horse and goes Queen F3 Queen F3 defending mate threatening my Rook don't like it but luckily it didn't take my Rook which would have been really bad so it does that and I play Rook to G6 and now the bot blunders my plan here was to probably double up my Rook somehow somehow maybe bring my Bishop back maybe look for forking opportunities on the E2 square but none of that is even necessary now because this cheap in garbage bot plays Queen to G3 and I was like yes and I took the queen and I took the queen and now justice will prevail and they always say you have a choice to take toward the center or away from from the center away that way away from the center take toward the center and this is why they say it because now the bishop is not protected the bot played away from the center and now I am completely winning because now I'm just going to go Queen here and go after the king and another way you win this position is you just trade the Rooks just get rid of the Rooks because the Rooks together are really powerful but the solar Rook will never stand up to the queen and another thing that I will do is I will make sure I will never get back rank mated then my queen and Bishop will scatter and they will take all of White's pieces and then I'm going to win the game and then it went [Music] here and it took my rook and as I have told you from the beginning of the video I have 16 god-given pieces and I am not going to replace them by cheating so when the bot took away from the center and left its own Bishop to to perish in the center of the board and I took it fair in square the bot respawned and now I am once again completely lost because the bot will hide the king and queen and Bishop are insufficient material here to win this game the Rooks will double up and then white will simply escort these pawns to the edge of the board the only thing that I can do here is blockade them but it's simply a matter of time until the blockade is lifted I have to leave and the pawns will promote my time is limited the bot just took my Rook so what did I do I prepared for the endgame my king now cannot be M it on the back rank because my king cannot be made it on the back rank I am going to run into the white position with my queen while my Bishop monitors the advancement of this pawn and as if it wasn't bad enough as if it wasn't bad enough to hang that Bishop to me and then take my rook in this position the bot played Bishop to F4 spawning yet another piece onto the board like it has done multiple times already and now taking a seveno Advantage into the end game and now the bishop stands powerfully it protects all the pawns the bishop is is going to escort this Pawn this is simply not fair so what did I play in this position I played Queen to F6 because you know what if the pawn goes up I'm going to go here stop the pawn and try to sniped The Rook on the opposite end of the board which I figured there was a good chance the bot would not see and I was right because in this position the bot did not see the attack on The Rook on the A1 square and instead this bishop which is just surfaced on the board again went to G5 an attack on my queen a heinous misstep but again I was cognizant of the fact that if I went there there is a chance that this bot will take my queen and with no Queen remaining on the board I will not win remember I am not going to cheat to break the rules against this absolute Bozo so I have to respect the rules of the game and that is why I took on G5 with my Pawn some of you may be wondering why I didn't take with my queen attacking this I was worried I would be recaptured and if a piece spawned from the heavens then I would no longer have a queen and I was right and I was right because in this position the bot really decided to turn it up and after playing Bishop to G5 Pawn takes G5 it played Bishop takes G5 again that is my third time seeing a dark squared Bishop on this board this time I decided I've had enough and you know what if it dropped the bishop on the sky from me another time that would have just been what happened and that's how this video would have ended but instead of that that's not what happened and instead the bot went for my king welcome back to the light squared Bishop there it is in all of its Glory I didn't know what to do here I had a really bad feeling if I took that Bishop the bot would take my king at which point I would not argue because it plays chess on its own rules and if I tell it that I can't do that or it can't do a certain thing it kill my family you know what so you know let's just let's just handle it exactly how we want but the chess gods were watching this game because in this position I decided to be brave and I decided to take but to my horror the ches bot spawned a new queen I'm already down Five Points of material but it spawned a new Queen anyway yet luckily for me it spawned the new Queen right here which made my job a little bit easy because all I had to do was take was I worried that my queen would be hanging yes was I worried any of these pawns or a knight or an invisible Bishop could take my queen yes but none of that happened instead of taking my queen the bot sent a missile from above onto the G5 Square Rook to G5 and this may shock you but I did not take the Rook because the last sequence of moves put my queen on the G5 Square H5 Square not G5 square and from this position I can take the rook and I went Allin you ever seen a high stakes hand a poker person goes all in other person has a clock on them they've got to make a massive decision do they go all in as well do they fold what are they going to do only you can see the cards it's check on the king the king can go to F2 or the bot can cheat the system and capture my queen somehow and here after a moment of thinking the bot indeed realized it has an open space and it played King to F2 and in this position I played Queen F1 Checkmate and I won the Battle of seven-dimensional Chess versus this brand new terrifying Gotham bot humanity is still safe
