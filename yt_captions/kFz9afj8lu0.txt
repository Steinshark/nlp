what's up mkbhd here so can you game in 8k and would you even really want to that's the question that i'm going to try to answer with this video which you guys know what that means uh this video is gonna be 8k what the whole thing yeah the whole thing it's going to be rough on the processing but hey we're doing it with all the hype about these consoles though with the ps5 coming out with the xbox series x and i've done videos about both of them this sort of conversation started to drum up again where did the pc games really do that much more than console games can these new consoles essentially be pc gaming and you wouldn't be crazy to think that by the way a lot of what we've seen with new consoles as people try to decide which one to upgrade to have shown a lot a pretty big generational leap and so we're impressed with that but that's when the pc gaming community gets in my ear and they're like hey marquez look that's cool and everything but the real power still comes from the real computer so of course this wouldn't be an mkbhd video on 8k gaming without a little bit of an exclusive so this is the first time anyone's seeing on camera the new nvidia geforce rtx 3090 so this is the highest end in nvidia's new 3000 series it's a gigantic huge graphics card uh but this is the top of their new lineup and this is capable of things that no new console will even really be able to touch of course we're talking about 8k gaming now of course frame rate is king and i've said that myself i said that in xbox video but if you want to maximize detail and immersion in every possible way in this gaming world you also need high resolution and so that's why we're trying to answer the question can you even game right now in 8k and if anything can do it this can now you may remember an older video where i did try to game in 8k that was three years ago believe it or not and looking back it was worth a shot we had the dell 8k monitor we had a powerful computer but there were a lot of workarounds happening for one you needed two cables from the computer to the monitor and it was stitching the whole thing together and when we finally got it running i mean it ran at 8k technically but you saw the footage it wasn't amazing but now it's 20 20. so we've got to step our game up like mr beast would want us to so remember this this is the 88 inch 8k oled tv from that dope tech video it's back and main gear has also stepped up their game so this is their f-131 so this is their custom computer basically built around the 3090 so if the 3090 is as nvidia says built for 8k gaming then the rest of this computer's got to be built for 8k gaming too and it is so intel core i9 10 900k so that's 10 cores 3.7 gigahertz space clock turboing up to 5.3 gigahertz you got 32 gigs of fast hyperx fury ram in here an msi mpg z490 gaming motherboard they're always great with names and then a terabyte samsung nvme ssd the 970 pro is the boot drive and then there's another two terabyte ssd for mass storage you know for stuff you don't need to access quite as quickly so it's all in a custom built aluminum chassis you see the rgb in there you see that mkbhd logo the matte black outside the tinted glass and the side panel this thing means business well not not business i mean unless unless 8k gaming is your business then that's a pretty sweet business anyway let's get into it also don't worry this isn't a review of the new card there are no benchmarks in this video this is just about 8k gaming but i'm sure we'll have all of that and more very soon when the linus tech tips video and the hardware connects videos drop matter of fact i'll link both of those below when they do actually drop their videos about the card because i'm sure people are interested in that but also i think it's pretty safe to say this card will probably crush synthetic benchmarks all right so we got a little setup going here the main gear computer on the desk next to me and the 8k tv in front of me i want to show you guys something really quick though so on this built for 8k graphics card it's got hdmi 2.1 ports like i talked about and that's what enables that single cable to do 8k out and this is the hdmi cable we're using and uh if you look at it it's a little thicker it's a little more averse to like bending uh but this is the type of cable you'll need to get 8k through a single cable to the tv and now if i go ahead on the desktop and check out display settings you can see there you go 7680 by 4320 is the resolution we're getting so we're ready to play all right so we got a few games installed and i want to play first one i want to show is forza horizon 4. i've been a driving game type of person for a long time sports games and driving games but i'm pretty sure seeing all the detail of the map and the car in a driving game is gonna be a major advantage to having this many pixels and there's this pretty sweet demo mode that we'll go through that has like four different seasons and a bunch of different cars and it's a pretty sweet demo okay so now we're in the game and i have the controller actually connected this intro though i think when they make these they don't render these at 8k so this is less than 8k i think this is either 4k or maybe 1080p it doesn't look as good as 8k gaming but let's go into video oh there it is right off the bat 8k 60fps all right here's what i see oh the center festival and even this i think i don't think we're 8k yet but it looks so good ever you want to be that doesn't look okay all right we're almost there about to drive a sena directly into a giant screen let me show you this is definitely what's happening [Music] horizon is here to stay all right so right off the bat it's telling me we are like locked at 60 fps so in the autumn setting i'm seeing like all these leaves on the ground all the leaves on the trees all the detail in the sky it's stuff you would still see at 1440p or 1080 but it's that much crisper and i'm driving a little bit recklessly while trying to talk at the same time oh god a cena would not make it through that all right let's see what inside the car oh i cracked the windshield already beautiful wow that is the mclaren steering wheel for sure it's not exactly what my hands would look like but that's that's pretty good okay now you get to winter i've done this before the winter is insane you see every little snowflake falling on the screen everything no matter what perspective you're in you're getting snowflakes oh wow okay still pretty much locked at 60 fps if we wanted to go higher we'd need a higher pressure rate screen there's these little smoke things that come up and the smoke i don't know if it looks as realistic but like once you start to game at 8k you start to notice like every single little thing the developer decided to put in the game it's like when you watch a high resolution animated movie and you know that everything in the movie had to be intentional because it had to be animated in it's kind of the same thing with this game like everything you see on this map and everything you hit with the car and everything that falls out of the sky it's all very intentional to give you a more immersive feeling and you notice all of it like all these fences i'm hitting in this dirt and splashing all right let's see if i can actually get some some good times in in this demo while the lasers fire into the sky distracting me all right cutscene i feel like you can kind of see it shift down to 1440 or 1080 in the cutscenes and then back up to 8k when the gaming starts again because it's pre-rendered stuff here all right yeah that's not 8k wow there is a k it's very clear when it turns back on all right guys this will be easy just don't miss a checkpoint this bikes with the smoke and now it's just a lot of leaks lots of textures the fans in the back of the car let me get in the car for a second so sick all the water droplets on the screen too each of them has a reflection in it of the world behind it like as if you were actually looking through a camera back here all the water droplets on the top of the car hey blue needle i'm loving this i would be if i had this set up at home i would never stop playing this at 8k has the gpu struggled yet okay now we're down to 50 fps right 96 but like when there's that much stuff happening on the screen at once i'm kind of not shocked you're pushing a lot of pixels 30 plus megapixels for every single frame a lot of wind looks like i'm the only one left god that's good oh that transition though and then this is the last part of the cutscene it's summer we're back in the center i'm pretty sure again this pre-rendered part not quite and then it switches to 8k wow oh we're flying oh we are flying we gotta catch the centenario and the bugatti up there while the jets and the leaves and everything distract me holy moly i like how the speedo is in kilometers per hour but my my actual attack is an mph catch the bug catch the bug that was way too easy i shouldn't have caught the bug that easily oh boy i can tell you as i'm distracted by the interior of this car from being in high-end mclarens that's exactly what the menu looks like when you're driving the car you do not want to miss out on watching this get around i mean the car i can't breathe that's fun i'm telling you you can tell when it switches from the pre-rendered like i'm going to say 1440p looking cutscenes which look amazing right into the actively rendering gameplay i swear you can see it switch and it looks really good when you actually get into it alright let's try another game alright this next game is called control ultimate edition i'm already in the game right now and it's showing in 8k 52 fps so i'm just looking around here and this animation of hitting books i think is hilarious but also i want to show you something real quick so if i go into video settings options and switch render resolution so this is other things in the environment that it's rendering out to 5k you can see if we resume the game now now it's actually starting to work the gpu i'm down to 21 fps the clearly what it's rendering back there is super high resolution so if i'm trying to see every single detail you're going to be losing frames 21 fps now but when i have the actual resolution of the game set to 8k which it is and then render resolution of the world set to 2k maybe even let's go 4k and see how it does resume game 36 fps so i think really if we're going to have the best experience that's going to have to stay at 2k so it's not invincible the card itself isn't going to literally do anything you ask at it so you can see now the world is a little lower resolution but i mean clearly the character is still high quality and the game is so high quality let's go out this door this has been a creepy game oh oh oh what is this floating what bro i okay okay okay this is where it's gonna really show that i'm not actually a good gamer oh god how long till i die do the thing oh okay well exposed i think you can tell this is this is the type of game that would benefit from i think a little bit higher refresh rate like the the driving game obviously higher refresh rate but gaming is like full immersion you need the detail also um this is the type of game where if you're really just trying to get immersed and truly horrified by a horror game like look at these look at these textures look at these textures all these are so high quality the reflections the character herself and i when i when i go up to like a piece of glass and you can see her reflection in the glass too like that's the type of stuff your eye expects to see when you're actually somewhere where there would be a reflection so this is pretty sweet all right i have learned a lot i think i'm ready to give a conclusion to answer the question in the title of the video can you game in 8k yes especially if you have a 30 90 you can handle pretty much any game in pretty much any resolution now the world of gaming in 8k is not just a great gpu and a great game you also need an 8k display and that world of 8k gaming monitors doesn't really exist yet so that that little piece of the puzzle that's less to plug in is still not very mature yet we had that dell ak monitor years ago we have this lg 8k tv that's thousands of dollars you probably still don't have a need to try to game an 8k yet in 2020. but if you do actually have the right setup gaming can be spectacular at a higher fresh rate or high resolution if you have the right setup and this is more than enough to be the right setup i'm just i just want to get like a comparison now between the best that the consoles have to offer because i've been somewhat of a console gamer for the past couple years you see me play 2k all the time you see me play need for speed all the time things like that i'm just trying to figure out how big is the difference between those games on say a 4k tv versus the 8k stuff that this is kicking out so far really good stuff and yes if you're a pc master race person you will be able to say the consoles can't do this officially kicking out 60 fps at 8k it's glorious it's beautiful so that's been my experience thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace
