Advanced Micro Devices or AMD started a few years after Intel and along with Intel it is the only semiconductor startup of its class to be still independent led by a wildly charismatic leader the company scratched and clawed its way to beat incredible odds what was its secret what did it do right in this video let us take a look at amd's early history as it grew from a ragtag group of rejects from Fairchild into a semiconductor contender but first I want to remind you about the newsletter check out the newsletter to read the entire scripts for previously released videos including those you might not have seen before the sign up link is in the video description below I try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show AMD began on a chilly evening in December 1968 in Jerry Sanders rented Malibu Beach House born in 1936 to a young couple who divorced when he was four Walter Jeremiah Sanders III was raised by his paternal grandparents his grandfather treated him poorly profanely telling him that he would never amount to anything Sanders grew up wanting to get an education and be someone to prove his grandfather wrong after graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in electrical engineering in 1958 he joined the Douglas Aircraft Company there he worked on power transistors earning 500 a month then one day he encountered a sales engineer from Motorola he took one look at the Motorola Engineers Nice Clothing nice car and total lack of knowledge about their own products and decided he was doing the wrong kind of engineering Sanders applied for and joined Motorola soon thereafter he did very well there he quickly became the salesman of the year and soon covered much of Wisconsin and Illinois he was so good that in early 1961 he started hearing from a little company in Northern California its name was Fairchild semiconductor Fairchild of course was a Silicon Valley Legend the progenitor of the area's spirit and style the birthplace of the modern semiconductor industry Fairchild was founded in September 1957 by eight semiconductor scientists from Shockley semiconductor Labs the Traders ate after receiving Venture Capital funding from Arthur rock and a larger commitment from the investor Sherman Fairchild the company opened doors in the city of Mountain View they started up at a good time when the U.S military began buying incredible amounts of transistors automatic selected Fairchild for a guidance and control system for their Minuteman ballistic missile however the product suffered from metal flaking issues in response Fairchild co-founder Jean Wei Ani experimented with leaving a layer of oxide on the wafer as protection this revolutionary step is now known as the planar process debuted in 1959 the planer process and its planar circuits allowed Fairchild to dominate the early semiconductor industry scaling production allowed the company to rapidly lower the prices of their integrated circuits a transistor costs 13 cents to produce 10 cents of that was human labor but sold for a dollar fifty a 91 profit margin sales exploded from 500 000 in 1958 to 21 million in 1960. for a brief period in the late 1950s and early 1960s Fairchild was America's leading producer of high performance silicon its parent company Fairchild camera and instrument boasted record sales initially skeptical Sanders agreed to fly out to California to meet some of the people they blew him away including the brilliant Bob Noyes noise was one of fairchild's eight co-founders and served as the company's general manager they told them about the magic of semiconductors as well as their plans to change the world and he knew that he had to work with these guys Sanders joined in 1961 as a district sales manager calling on TV and radio customers Fairchild then wanted to move out of the military space and into the consumer space likely due to increasing competition and cutbacks in spending again great timing the FCC was pushing a TV technology change from very high frequency or VHF to ultra high frequency UHF spectrums conventional radio tubes cannot easily handle these frequencies so TV tuner manufactures turn to planar transistors management pretty much left Sanders alone giving him a great deal of Freedom his rise at the company is the stuff of Legend five years later before the age of 30 he was fairchild's worldwide marketing director by 1968 Fairchild semiconductor had fallen into a bit of a difficult time the problem was that despite its history making Innovations the company also frequently failed to deliver reliable products on time several big customers were lost because they were not able to invest in sufficient testing to work out the Kinks owner Sherman Fairchild decided to bring in a new suite of managers more focused on the manufacturing side of things thus Lester Hogan took over as chairman and CEO of the Fairchild parent company Hogan was renowned for having turned around Motorola semiconductor division he brought over eight members of that team with him the Fairchild sales people sarcastically nicknamed them Hogan's Heroes after the then famous American TV sitcom sensing that big changes were afoot many of fairchild's best people started to leave they would go on to some of silicon Valley's most iconic companies the most notable of the defectors were Gordon Moore Bob Noyes and Andy Grove they left in August 1968 to found the semiconductor manufacturer Intel a few weeks in Hogan demoted Sanders from his marketing manager post Sanders asks for severance and got a Year's worth of pay forty five thousand dollars with nothing to do now Sanders drove down to Malibu and rented a beach house for the month there he decided to start his own thing Sanders new semiconductor startup had eight co-founders all of them from Fairchild the guys other than Jerry Sanders were John Kerry an integrated circuits expert from Fairchild a member of Carrie's team Sven Simonson also joined Ed Turney fairchild's former director of sales and marketing Jack Gifford fairchild's linear circuit marketing expert three members of Jack's team also joined Frank Bott Jim Giles and Larry stenger and what to call this company the top logical Choice was Sanders Associates but that was already being used by New Hampshire electronics company Advanced Micro Devices was the 17th name on a long list it only worked because the 16 names ahead of it did not pass checks with the California and Delaware business and trademark directories amd's promise was its people a ragtag group of both salespeople and Technical people working together to create new opportunities in the semiconductor Market their first ad did not talk about a product but rather the founding team the business plan needed 1.75 million dollars or about 14 million dollars in 2022 bucks the least possible amount of cash to spin up a semiconductor Factory the new tsmc N3 Fab in Arizona will cost 28 billion dollars it is hard to imagine that 14 million is enough to put together the Landscaping now anyway AMD was starting up at a bad time the tech industry was in a downturn then and money was tight famously Intel's VC deal took a few phone calls and a single piece of paper AMD took a lot longer than that legendary VC Arthur Rock turned Sanders down flat saying that it was too late to go into semiconductors quote no hope end quote Rock added that he would never back a company run by a marketing guy and also that his team was mediocre ouch Sanders recalls Bob Noyes always said that it took him five minutes to raise 85 million dollars well it took me 5 million minutes to raise five million dollars it was just Grim but I knew I had a story I knew we could make money Jonathan Lovelace of the capital group Advanced thirty thousand dollars to essentially save the fledgling company and slowly Sanders cobbled together the money from investors like Bank of America dlj's VC arm and a Rockefeller but the biggest investor was a group of former Fairchild employees who believed in Sanders his vision and team interestingly enough this also included Bob Noyes who initially said with some skepticism you mean they're really gonna try to make the stuff AMD was incorporated in May 1st 1969. their first headquarters were in Santa Clara in the back of a rug Cutting Company the semiconductor industry was in a rough patch then silicon chips were no longer high-priced premium devices only for the military to use they were becoming Commodities produced in high quantities for anyone to use but as they say Hard Times make great companies the three years from 1967 to 1969 saw 33 new companies begin life including some of silicon Valley's Legends zeeve Drury and monolithic memories who created the programmable array logic or Pal genre a nice intercil the watch chip Pioneer and where my father used to work and lj7 of moss Tech which was once the world's leading producer of dynamic memory at its peak they had 85 percent global market share it was the start of class the Stars fell on many of them made lasting marks in the industry and AMD sought to take its place amongst them and they would of that whole class the only independent companies left are Intel and AMD Sanders early strategy for AMD had three major prongs first AMD would not try to produce their own proprietary chip products Sanders considered that to be too risky instead the company sought to be the preferred Second Source manufacturer for companies buying high quality National semiconductor and Fairchild chips to emphasize the point amd's early chips had similar naming conventions to the First Source chips for instance if Fairchild had the UA 741 then AMD had the am 741 this made it clear that their chip was a simple drop-in replacement people called AMD copyists a few companies even sued them saying that they can't use their number but AMD prevailed in those lawsuits the company did produce a few proprietary products the first being the very Innovative am2501 logic counter but AMD largely remained a Second Source house until later in the decade in the wake of a financial catastrophe being a Second Source provider though smart would probably not be enough there had to be another differentiator Sanders decided that amd's differentiation would be a commitment to Excellence high quality very reliable products he told his customers at amd's products met a military-grade standard Mill standard 883 this despite the fact that AMD didn't have any government customers such a standard required more tests and closer inspections but Sanders knew that it meant that he could charge a few bucks more for his products later on the Japanese semiconductor industry would also take up the high quality assurance label with great effect it was their way of gaining vast share into the American markets one last big factor in AMD strategy were Distributors these companies resell inventory purchased from other companies but that undersells their importance Distributors not only provide financing by buying in bulk but their own sales and marketing teams can amplify reach and exposure in 1970 AMD struck a deal with its first distributor Avnet a subsidiary of Hamilton electronics at that time Hamilton was one of the nation's biggest Electronics distributors there were also fairchild's distributor which understandingly did not want AMD to be involved but Sanders and Steve zelenik the company's first outside salesman had very good relationships with Hamilton founder Tony Hamilton avnet's 17 Outlets greatly extended the company's sales reach their first stocking order of 250 000 was greatly appreciated in these trying times in 1971 AMD entered the ram market with the 64-bit am3101 and the linear Market they also started building new facilities to produce large-scale metal oxide semiconductors or moss and bipolar memory sales that year reached 4.6 million dollars and the company showed a small profit of 176 thousand the year after that the company went public selling about 500 000 shares at fifteen dollars fifty cents per share the money would be used to buy more equipment and set up its first Offshore Manufacturing facility a back-end facility in Penang Malaysia in 1973 company Revenue reached 11.2 million dollars and 1.3 million in net income buoyed with optimism Jerry Sanders announced that he wanted AMD to be America's sixth largest a semiconductor manufacturer by 1975. at the time they were not even in the top 10. in these days AMD was known for their very strong culture the aforementioned Steve zelenik said that everybody he knew to have worked at AMD said that it was the best place they ever worked in their lives many of the company's employees came from big companies they were professionals and worked extremely hard Management in turn wanted to reward their workers for going that extra mile at the very start AMD had an employee stock bonus plan which gifted every employee 250 shares 100 shares at the very start with another 50 shares every six months not everybody understood it Sanders overheard someone saying in the cafeteria the stock obviously isn't worth anything they're giving it away after the company finally turned a profit in 1972 the stock bonus plan was replaced with one of the most generous profit sharing programs in Silicon Valley that prosperous 1973 allowed AMD to pay out 146 150 to its employees the prosperity ended quickly the October 1973 OPEC oil embargo compounded by the political paralysis of Watergate turned 1974 into a sour year for both the semiconductor industry and The Wider economy fiscal 1974 sales amd's fiscal calendar went from April to March due to its May 1st founding had been going extremely well into the third quarter sales that quarter declined 30 percent from the second quarter this was because of distributor returns back then manufacturers booked shipments to Distributors has Revenue but if there was no final sale to a customer and those Distributors returned those products then it could cause a rare negative Revenue situation that exactly was what happened worse yet as this Revenue crunch was happening the company was investing cash into massive new facilities in Penang Malaysia as well as its third Fab in Sunnyvale California the stock crashed to basement levels in December 1974 you could have bought the whole company for just seven million dollars forcing the board to implement anti-takeover measures so the whole fiscal year had AMD showing record revenues 26 million dollars but growth vanished for the first time in fiscal 1975 with the company showing a revenue decline to 25.8 million they were forced to lay off employees for the first time 300 people and everyone went to 44 paid hours a week Sanders hated it so much at the time that he later instituted a no layoff policy styled on the Japanese concept of Lifetime employment the company amazingly managed to stick to it for the next 10 years AMD survived 1975 but macro economic conditions up ahead looked rough and they would be rough until at least the early 1980s management needed a strategy to avoid another such close brush to death the first inklings of that strategy came at a relaxed Saturday evening dinner at a restaurant in San Francisco's North Beach area this simple and concept strategy had the company gradually shifting towards its proprietary products but they would not ditch their second sorting business but rather leverage it having both the proprietary and Second Source Products would allow amd's creative salesman to package the two together being able to offer a larger selection gave AMD another Edge over the commodity Second Source makers and on the technical side the company's Engineers would take an industry-standard product like the Intel 8080 and redesigned it for better performance in certain aspects this saved the am 9080 from a similar lawsuit that Intel filed against National semiconductor for their 90 ad knockoff with the increasing value of a chip design moving away from second sourcing was ultimately Smart in 1984 Congress passed the chip protection act which protected a Chip's basic design from reverse engineering for commercial production AMD followed the strategy to a t in less than two years the company introduced over 150 new products half of them were proprietary amd's most prominent proprietary product was the am 2900 family of microprocessors first released in 1975 its popularity helped put AMD on the map as an innovator it was widely used in computers from Hewlett-Packard data General and so on for the first time companies like National semiconductor Motorola and Raytheon came out of the woodwork to Second Source an AMD product yet AMD still continued to produce reverse engineered clones of their competitors top chips like the aforementioned am 9080. in 1976 AMD sealed across licensing agreement with Intel in which they agreed to license each other's products the agreement's immediate effect was to help promote the microprocessors adoption amongst the wider industry the two companies being able to Second Source each other's products gave customers greater confidence in their supply chains Sanders would characterize AMD back then as Intel's leading follower acknowledging Intel as the leader for a long time AMD made and sold the most 8080s in the industry second only to Intel itself this 1976 agreement marks the first former agreement between the two Rivals we will dive deeper into this Infamous rivalry in a future video amd's fiscal 1976 saw growth return but the economy was still rough and Sanders wanted to financially stabilize AMD semiconductor manufacturing is capital intensive and the company frequently had to take out debt to support these expansions the company wanted to build up a financial cushion thus enters a story Siemens the massive industrial conglomerate was West Germany's second largest company they had a fledgling semiconductor business of their own and wanted to grow it perhaps by buying an American Semiconductor maker they first sniffed out Intel and Moss Tech but Intel's co-founders didn't want to sell and most tech already had a significant shareholder so Siemens turned to AMD and negotiations began around 1976. Sanders had no interest in selling AMD to a bigger company after being booted from Fairchild he never wanted to work for someone else however a significant minority investment might be possible as sender said we're not for sale but we could be leased after a long round of negotiations in 1977 Siemens agreed to buy a 20 stake in the company for 22.5 million dollars or about 45 dollars per share this was nearly twice the stock price at the time AMD had originally proposed 100 a share which Siemens pushed back against AMD reportedly replied no one with patience has ever lost money on AMD stock even though they paid a rich price for it at issuance the Siemens deal gave AMD some Financial stability and widespread credibility when Bob Noyes of Intel heard about the deal he reportedly said if we'd known that they take 20 Intel would have done it he would later do so with IBM a few years later in 1980 AMD generated 225 million dollars in sales in 10 years the company had gone from essentially zero to 200 million dollars and they made more profit in 1980 alone than they made in their first 10 years of existence to celebrate Sanders gave away a house in a time when house prices were starting to get really crazy he told his employees that if certain company goals were met that one lucky AMD employee would win 240 000 over 20 years to finance a house AMD of course hit these goals and Sanders drew a name from the bowl the name he chose was 21 year old Josie liano a recent Filipino immigrant making less than four dollars an hour on the graveyard shift and struggling to support her extended family stunts like this built up amd's unique culture back then from the very start Sanders insisted that treating people right along with tenacity optimism and collaboration would be one of the company's core values going into the 1980s AMD had a long and winding road ahead of it but they were on the right track all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the Channel Sign up for the newsletter and I'll see you guys next time
