[Music] oh hey that's not good at all didn't see there on this elevator ride all right what's up mkbhd here so as the end of the year sort of creeps up on us we are finally able to do like all of our big end of the year projects like the smartphone awards the blind camera test and maybe a few others just because we're feeling adventurous and so this is one of the ones that came up that i wanted to talk about which is just everything that i'm carrying daily my tech everyday carry if you want to call it that the what's in my bag that's something else people call it i'm just going to call it tech i choose tech i've chosen now i'm going to go through this backpack and this just so you know this isn't the tech i carry every single day like some people might show a backpack and they're like yeah i carry all this stuff all the time i don't i'll tell you as i go through it which stuff i carry every day and which stuff is like for when i travel but you'll get the idea this is basically some of the stuff that i've enjoyed the most that's come out this year and i choose to use one note is it's not always the best thing or the best version of everything and that's fine i don't need to own the highest end version of every laptop or computer tech moves on i have my needs met by this stuff that's enough of a spiel uh before we get into it though there is a little bit of a giveaway at the end of this video so definitely stay tuned for that if you want to win some of this stuff all right so let's get into it let's start with the bag right this is a bag that technically this version of the bag you can't get so i'm going to link everything else that i'm talking about in here down below but this is the peak design everyday backpack it's the 20 liter version so the smaller version this has been one of my favorite bags for a while this is actually the second version they've made but you see the red trim up here at the top and on some of these straps and things like that and of course the mkbhd logo down at the bottom this is a version of the bag that they've made just 10 of for me and the team here at the studio so we happen to use these if you're lucky enough that we've like given you one because you visited the studio and we liked you you're one of 10 and if you're a giveaway winner you'll have one of them but anyway this is the peak design backpack this is a section in the thirds there's a top middle and a bottom oh and there's a back let's just do the back first all right first things first laptop this is the 13 inch m1 macbook pro i've reviewed this thing i don't edit videos on the go so again this is not like my professional uh video creation kit this is stuff that i will take when i go travel or when i need to use stuff i don't need a macbook pro but it's just a little bit longer battery life than the macbook air just a little bit better of a screen and just a little bit more annoying with the touch bar but i love this laptop and it has not let me down since you guys saw the review it's been a pretty big game changer this year also in the second back sleeve here is my tablet of choice which is the 11 inch ipad pro i don't feel like i need the bigger ipad pro it's pretty close to the screen size of the laptop so this ipad pro it's got the icon skin in black on black and this is the cellular version as well i feel like i mostly just watched videos on it at this point there's a lot of other random stuff i can do i also have done thumbnails on the ipad which is why up top here i have the apple pencil but it doesn't always spend its time attached to the tablet so i have the apple pencil on the tablet but that's mainly a a media thing watching videos in the back seat of a car or just kind of hanging around then there's a lot of other small pockets up here in the top of the laptop laptop and the top of the bag i might have uh the mkbhd microfiber cloth in there and i also have my headphones of choice so i don't use headphones very often but in a pinch the airpods are pretty sweet i'm not a big fan of the hardtip airpods so these are the airpods pro and these are in icons red and black which is dope and then i think i have a card reader up here yep there's my card reader so anytime you'll see the camera in here later but anytime i take photos and i need to read them the laptops haven't had sd card readers in years now so i have to have a card reader and this is the one i keep using i've showed this in bag videos before it's still great and then that is it for the back so let's get into the front in the top is whatever i'm like using at the moment so for now i have my wf wf for h i think it's wh w h 1000 xm4s these i don't carry every day these are the wireless headphones i will not travel without so they have great battery life great sound great noise cancellation i've also reviewed these anytime i'm getting on a plane anytime i'm going to travel these go right in the top of the backpack every single time and then i also well i'm not doing much else with it so if i'm bringing food to work or from bringing a couple extra whatever i'll put in the top of the backpack this is a little pouch i don't even know who makes it but i sometimes will throw some cables in here or something like that it's empty for now but it just kind of hangs out in the bag and that's the top part i'll put my keys in this little hidden pouch too i don't know if you know about the peak design hidden pouch all right so then this uh this backpack has this pretty sweet feature where on either side a full length zipper i can pop in from the side there i did the wrong side i usually am from the other side but that's where you get into the middle and bottom sections of what's in my bag here i have my camera so this is the canon r5 and the 15 to 35 rf lens so i do carry this everywhere i don't use it all the time and it's also not the camera i shoot with professionally often when we're shooting video for stuff like car videos or handheld video we'll go with the sony a7 s3 it's just a technically better video camera for a lot of what we do or even a komodo or something like that but i take a lot of photos so if i'm doing photos if i'm doing thumbnails specifically on a stills camera or if i'm just doing instagram photos or whatever i'm a big fan of canon's color science of canon's images um canon r5 has been in my bag for a little while shout out to peter mckinnon for putting me on this camera if i do need to shoot video in a pinch it's also pretty good at that but i don't usually do that so my photo camera sd card's in it already and then i'm already to the bottom see i told you it wasn't much so actually let me just go ahead and show you up here in this little wing here is where i carry my pens and right now i only have two pens and a sharpie so if i have to sign something or write my name on something i'll have those easily every time i need them they're there i also used to keep my contacts in here before i got lasik now i literally have eye drops that's what happens when you change from contacts to lasik so that's what's in the little pocket up there this backpack has all kinds of pockets that i don't necessarily use that much of but i'm still a huge fan of the bag in case i ever do need them then we get to the bottom and this is the only charger that i carry with me so if i'm traveling i will have to add an iphone charger i didn't talk about my phones yet through my pocket so i'll get to that at the end but usbc everything so far has been going pretty well this is oneplus's warp charge 65 charger it'll charge my phone but it's compatible with almost everything else here at up to 45 watts so this charges the ipad this charges the macbook pro this charges the eos r so just this one cable and brick will do it and it's a pretty thick wire but that's been pretty sweet i don't have to have the macbook pro charger and you know the phone charger and all kinds of other stuff in here this is my one charger and that's what's in my bag so as far as everyday carry the last stuff you probably want to hear about is my phone so i am a two phone person still i've talked about this in the past i stay in the android world and the iphone world pretty much on the regular i've split my screen time between these two phones a lot lately too and i also just realized i have two blue phones this is uh the oneplus 8 pro still in my pocket and the iphone 12 pro nebula blue pacific blue very different blues but i yeah two blue phones for me right now like i said not always the best i don't carry the iphone 12 pro max because that phone i've talked about it before but it's huge and it's just a little too big for for someone like me who has an ipad already i don't need the huge screen all the time and for this android world obviously this isn't the most state-of-the-art android phone it's getting close to a year old now but i've been a fan of the software experience battery life's still great camera's good enough so these are the two phones that i've been carrying for a little bit and that i think just about does it for my current 2020 everyday tech carry okay so the giveaway information that you all stayed so patiently for it's pretty simple i'm gonna be giving away one of these bags so this actual bag here custom one of very few mkbhd edition peak bag filled
