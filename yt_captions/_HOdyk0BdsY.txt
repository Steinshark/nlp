ladies and gentlemen in this video I am going to do two things number one I'm going to make a massive announcement number two I'm going to offer a bunch of you free stuff 100% free no questions asked have I peaked your interest yet tremendous let's proceed number one the announcement I built a chess bot now not exactly me I'm a YouTuber but my amazing team of engineers build a chess bot and that chess bot is named Levi Levi is on my chess courses website Chesley and the purpose of Levi is to help you practice the opening courses that you get if any of you have ever tried to learn an opening sometimes it's really difficult you go play against people you lose a bunch of points you try to play against bots they don't play the opening against you Levi is designed on three different modes to practice your opening courses against you and then give you feedback show you how you made it out of the opening now the thing is Levi generally only plays against you if you own a course for now but not for the next 48 hours this is part two of the announcement for the next 48 hours I am granting every single person watching this free access to one course with white and one course with black E4 and Carl Con on Chesley on my website 100% free so that you can go try to play against Levi and see how you like it we built Levi uh off of Maya Maya is a uh is basically an AI that plays chess like a human so if you ever felt like you're playing a bot and it's playing like kind of wacky and then plays really strong Maya is designed to practice against you like a human so I'm super excited about this feature and I'm going to play it in this video that is the purpose of today's video and yes it's called Levi cuz that's not my name so you get free access to a course for the next two days to practice against Levi then of course we will yeah we will go back to if unless you buy it of course uh so I'm going to put the link in the description you go to ches.com you just got to make an account you pop into your dashboard and you will see play Levi it's got a big sticker over here with a new you click play Levi and this is one of my games against Levi already so this is this is where it saves uh and uh you hit play now and here you know you'll see which difficulty we'll start with easy uh and then um you know you can click easy whatever you can and so on I'm going to do easy and we're going to do E4 New York style and you will see E4 New York style and under black you will see at a minimum caroan okay because we are that is what we are doing so E4 New York style and let's go show me your best Bozo says Levi and uh life is good I have to start the game because I'm playing with the white pieces and that's how chess works now a couple of quick things we don't have pre-moving yet uh because actually that feature is somewhat difficult to code and we're working on it so in the E4 New York style uh we we go for the Vienna and that is what I'm going to do and right now Levi okay so Levi played this move which is it's not the most popular move uh and I don't know if Levi is deviating from from from known territory that early but uh I'm going to play what what I think is uh is a normal way to play um in the Vienna you're supposed to play like this and then you're supposed to play Pawn to F4 okay and that's that's what we're doing we're we're defending with the bishop we're going to put the Knight right here okay Levi captures and keeps telling me you know show me your best uh by the way we will be adding more voice lines uh you know at soon uh just not at the very moment this is version one so you are all getting to test version one of Levi and then you will be able to leave feedback so I see this pin uh general rule of thumb it's it's good to Target the bishop I don't think that's a particularly good move to capture uh it kind of allows me to get an active Queen but Levi seems very confident targeting my queen and my Pawn I'm going to slide the queen back and uh attack the Knight on D4 okay the Knight goes back yeah and now so I mean so far so good Levi playing I think like a like a pretty decent 900 uh I haven't gotten my Rook into the game yet so I might as well you know add uh add my Rook to the party and now I'm thinking you know maybe I'm going to go attack Levi on this side of the board uh Knight here to get a trade and then keep pressuring doesn't doesn't look that bad let's play Knight to D5 um Pawn takes not a bad move targets the bishop targets the Knight but let's take like this uh okay that's that's a threat and maybe potentially Bishop here so I'm going to play C3 but Levi is playing quite well I mean I got to tell you nice move by the way oh my God that's terrifying so he's play like like a solid I think 1100 you know I'm going to trade Bishops uh we're going to we're going to go here and so far so good I mean listen if I can't beat my 900 uh equivalent in in AI mode uh we might have some problems I can take but then the Rook is going to come here I'm not actually sure how good that is so let's keep our focus on on on the Vienna attack so let's play Rook F2 and then let's play Rook here uh okay let's slide back and and and this is just in our line of sight that is basically what we're playing for I mean Le Levi is not letting me win easily I mean this is really good practice I feel like uh I'm going to go for the pawn though it is weak and I'm going to attack it and and yes it is about time that Levi made one mistake I suppose but I mean it was it was a good fight I'm going to slide back uh we're up so you know I'll make a trade uh and now we'll just have to very slowly and methodically win this game without making any catastrophic mistakes because that would be very embarrassing uh we'll go here Queen is hanging Knight is under pressure and it took Levi 27 moves but Levi blundered and that you know that's life uh will'll trade the Rooks let's just not blunder any Perpetual check let's bring the queen back to F2 I can I can even sacrifice and win the pawn end game Let's do that it's completely and by the way yeah we'll we'll we'll have pre Moving on but uh this is you know you don't have to play like this but you can and this is all normal I got to tell you Levi did good now when this game is done what we're going to see you're going to get you're going to get to see feedback on your game so this is probably the most useful thing uh within Levi uh is that after you finish a game the point is not to be like game review chess.com has got game review unlock all the brilliant moves all the blunt that's not exactly what we're showing you what we're going to be showing you on Levi is uh how well you played the opening and did you have a good position after the opening ended and that to me is is extremely important stuff so let's cut the king off you know black is going to uh you know get the king to the edge of the board here and this is Checkmate uh right now in two moves okay you won by Checkmate now what you do when the game is over you can click new game but what I think is use is to click feedback and feedback is very fascinating so first what happens on the feedback page is um is uh you know it it thinks for a little bit and this takes a little while but first what happens is you can click go to feedback and there it is and it says the bot deviated at the move Knight C6 and you played F4 which was a good move and then every three moves it gives you an update of your opening so you'll notice that I maintained plus3 plus3 plus. 7 you were fine after the deviation move and you had a slight Advantage six moves after so the the the we built Levi so that it would give you feedback on how you did when the opening ended and six moves later and that way you can see the stability of your opening so if you click on any of these moves that allows you to go there you obviously have a stockfish graph I mean you've seen this before but we're we're our Focus here is not on brilliancies it's not on you know uh it's not on that stuff all right you get enough of that the point here is to show you how did you play your opening like and in the future we will save all of these moves and we will tell you how you did right so the bot went here and that was a deviation and and after that by move 11 we had an advantage and as you can see I had an advantage for for majority of the game now uh again uh I will uh I will exit and we will come to this page and and by the way uh also all the courses are 25% off right now just as a small detail um because it's uh it's the holidays you could also leave feedback if you'd like by the way um you can uh you can leave feedback now I'm going to play the medium bot I'm going to play with black let's say I play a uh a caroan right so we're going up now and uh the bot plays E4 so let's see how this bot does and this time I'm going to try to deviate uh and and not play fully correctly so we're playing a caran okay we have an exchange caran uh bot plays Knight F3 um I mean it's a little hard to deviate Now isn't it so I'll play Knight C6 bot is I think still in the opening and um how about how about this how about I play Queen A5 check okay I'm going to attack the the bishop and the right so everything's protected and now um I mean I obviously I want to make a huge mistake but uh let me make a couple of inaccurate moves so I will play E5 which is definitely a mistake right so now I've I've deviated and I'm under pressure so let's just let's just see what happens of course it's this bot is around, 1500 so I should probably still be able to win uh but you know yeah it we'll see so Pawn takes I'm down a pawn right position is not particularly good uh and uh you know I'm going to I'm going to try to finish up my development here by playing Bishop F5 and maybe something like rugby eight so so the opening has not gone well for me I got caught in the opening I I I'm definitely not doing particularly well uh but now now we can you know now we can fight back so let's play Knight to G6 I'm I'm a little bit concerned okay yep discovered attack uh I can slide back with my queen let me let me offer a bishop trade though okay we we're trading I'm still down upon uh that's completely reasonable let's Castle this is not a fork but that is okay the bot missed it okay so again intermediate bot did not did not catch the fork that's fine uh I don't want to get forked so I'm going to come back I'm a pawn down still could be worse so if I capture is that a thing am am I getting Fork there cuz the Rook is okay so now I need to make sure not to like lose the game right away and and that's actually shockingly difficult to do so let's play Rook F7 to stop this um is the bot going to go to the open file oh my goodness it is actually playing Super well so this is this is what I'm saying like I really feel like uh Levi is quite good practice uh sometimes Levi does some goofy stuff and and makes like silly mistakes but I mean so do humans you know so let's let's trade the Knight I think the Knight is a little bit too powerful um and you know Rook here is probably a good move luckily Levi did not do that I'm going to go here to try to trade and open up my my rook and yeah luckily Levi is you know in intermediate so doesn't quite get end games that well so now we're going to double up and maybe just attack these pawns so I'm down a pawn but I've managed to kind of get out of the worst of it um I mean I could even play Rook F7 here and I could get a draw I mean you know I could I could maybe draw the game Levi does tend to repeat moves for some reason uh so okay we're in a Vortex here and it it turns out that you know Levi repeats moves with me and we saved the draw all right we we you know it could have been worse like it could have been a big disaster um actually here it's already kind of difficult because I will go here for example uh well we'll we'll we'll get our feedback first but it was it was actually looking you know not so bad now one other thing that I did not exactly mention uh which you can see in the feedback is where the position is in the course so this is really interesting um you're going to get your feedback right you're going to get your feedback and then once the feedback come see see look at this look look look you were fine at the deviation but six moves after White had a clear Advantage so my opening rating is a big thumbs down so I got my feedback my feedback says I went here right I deviated but this is fine the 97 I'm already losing right I'm losing this is really really bad so it said your opening rating uh was no good and uh yeah it could have it could have been a lot better now what's interesting is that in the beginning um over here you can actually see where the positions occurred in the course so this is the funny thing right you can go to the study that you own of the course that you own and then analyze it which is which I find really look at this you can go here you could click it and boom look at that now you are literally in chapter 4 lesson two of your Carl conour and you are studying the line and okay I mean I played Knight C6 but see you know this is a reasonable and and and you know it shows you the explanation I should have went here Bishop D3 and then you know in the course this happens and and we we could have we could have made a transposition but fine um and that's look at that right and it it it it shows you where it is in the course that you own we kind of are trying to like finish up this ecosystem of uh of of you have the course like you played a training game and now this is where it's available in the course and then obviously uh you deviate it and and and then after that you know everything after the deviation you know is what it is uh and that's that that's that's I to me I think this is a a very fascinating tool by by the end of the game when we were repeating you see the evaluation is is already back to equal um but uh yeah this kind of shows you yeah rough and if you want to analyze you want to Deep dive you can just click analyze and it'll just open up another tab you can also import the game into uh wherever you play chess or analyze your chess again our goal with this was not to build a game review this this is not that's not what we're trying to accomplish here that already exists but but the goal was to get you to to see how you do in the opening and several moves later now why don't we go back uh and uh and and after going back why don't we play uh the hard bod now the hard bot's a fascinating one it uh it it it it sometimes does super well and sometimes it it it it plays a little bit all over the place we're still trying to kind of narrow it down I'm going to play gambits for black although you can play caroan again um I'm gonna play the gambits for black here we go and um it plays F4 against me wow that is not what I was expecting you know what I'm just going to resign I'm I'm gonna play uh I'm GNA play the Cara I I mean there there are some but that's not you know nobody plays F4 so let's play Let's Play The Hard bot let's play the caroan and uh let's see what the what the hard bot plays against me it plays D3 wow okay so is it going to play a Kings Indian attack yes that's a pretty rare line I have to tell you um the best line here for black is to take the center with E5 G3 okay this is normal stuff uh this is in the carocon course Bishop D6 and now I will Castle the bot plays pretty fast pretty intimidating so there's a lot of things we can do here I mean Rook E8 A5 at this point I'm a little bit less concerned of playing exactly what's recommended in the course and a little bit more just like figuring out my on my own so I'm going to put my rook in the center the bot is preparing an attack it's going to play King H2 it's also stopping me from playing Bishop G4 um one thing you don't want to do against the Kings Indian attack is lock the center that sort of allows uh the opponent to play F4 let's see if the hard bot does that uhoh uhoh oh my goodness all right well this could be instructive I'm going to take a little bit of space as well and try to put my knight here but I'm about to get absolutely Steam oh my goodness oh my goodness uh-oh this is this is like a worst nightmare so this is this is if you play a caroan your opponent plays Kings Indian attack and now I mean I am just in I'm I'm almost losing just so you understand from a human standpoint I am in serious trouble but let's see let's see if the bot is able to no no no no no Levi chill man I'm playing my playing my Alter Ego out here now I'm going to go H6 and try to defend myself but H6 is not a good move because H6 is what we call a hook this is now a hook in my position and it allows the bot to uh to Target uh something in my territory to force a trade now this was my idea but H4 is really strong now oh my God this is really bad I was actually hoping I would beat Levi and I would like look really smart but uh wow I I mean I might just I might straight up lose to Levi that is pretty wild but that'll show you that it's a it's pretty strong um okay I mean I sort of regret giving it this position I I got to tell you all right G5 to try to fight back looks terrible Let's Play Bishop E7 to stop G5 oh my it's just going to go here and here I mean how do I what do I do here I I I really don't want to go G5 but I I mean I might just have but that looks horrendous but getting G5 here is terrible too all right let's go G5 and just you know what if we lose we lose right like what what what can I do I'm going to take with the Knight to try to plug the hole and maybe F6 F6 you know what F6 and and maybe I bishop f8 and run my king also oh my goodness this is absolutely terrifying uh maybe rookie s if I just make a run for it it's going to take maybe you know what I'm I'm going to go I mean I I I don't I can't take with the H Pawn because I I mean I just don't think I can allow the rook in I think if I allow the rook in I'm I'm probably just losing so I think I'm going to take with the F Pawn Yeah The Rook is is pressuring some stuff luckily though that's defended at least for now and you know I was thinking to just play something like Queen F6 and after this it looks a little bit okay however if white is able to sacrifice on H six and get into the position it could be very very very dangerous um but I'm I mean I can play no I can't play Knight E7 because then I would lose the defense of this Pawn so maybe I just keep running and if the bot sacrifices it sacrifices and I lose okay this is a sign of a bot that might be a little confused though so now let's run the king to safety yeah and I and I mean I I just think Levi is preparing the sacrifice and if it works it works like what what can I do uh let's go Bishop here I think the sacrifice is coming it's not is Levi just trying to overload my nervous system like what is what is going on uh okay uh well my King's here my king kind of made it out and maybe now I can bring some help over there maybe by the way like you okay the Knight is trying to come around this way so I think I should stop that but I can also create counterplay I mean Levi did all of this but Levi's not sacrificing for some reason cuz Bots are weird so maybe I just I just go for it like maybe I'm going to be the one attacking soon I'm going to play Rook C8 and C4 right Levi is kind of stuck okay I think we're making progress we are making a huge comeback let's go oh my goodness Bots are so weird uh I want to move my knight but I'm a little bit worried maybe I play Bishop E8 maybe I play Bishop G7 and then Bishop E8 maybe I play Knight A5 to try to put The Rook on C2 uh-huh I mean it still has this but it's just not doing it it it's it's just not sacrificing so I guess I'm going to go get counterplay oh my whoa Knight B3 I mean it looks like I'm accomplishing something but I could completely not be so that's okay but now now The Rook left wait now The Rook left so now I can attack The Rook yes this is progress look at this I'm unraveling okay and now we're going to double and and I'm I think I'm happy oh this is good this is very good this is a whole different story now than what we had a moment ago and I'm sliding out of the way to double and the bot I think is just totally collapsing uh I could get my queen over I can check I'm getting over here I'm getting with my queen huge comeback oh my goodness the Queen's getting to C2 oh just it hung me it was a 50/50 well I guess it should have went King D1 there and I guess it just blundered Checkmate wow that was that was a crazy game I mean I think Levi had a pretty big advantage in the opening uh we can we can do a little feedback there um wow okay [Music] so okay okay okay very interesting let's go to our feedback so Levi deviated super early see the failed Kings Indian uh uh and it deviated really early in the game uh I played correctly and then it went Knight F3 and then and then it went G3 although in the uh o this is the previous game in in um here it deviated you know it's claiming it technically deviated on on G3 and I played this which was a good move so from the opening I was fine but but then Knight C6 I was worse you see I was worse we consider this okay because it's kind kind of in the balance like it's not plus three but obviously you don't really want to give away any advantage to your opponent uh but uh so maybe in the future this will be red again this is like completely version one and we built it and we're ready for there to be small problems this a very unpleasant position and it only got worse like it was plus 1.6 here you know and and Levi was attacking me and I think the maximum it was was here plus two uh and it was plus two because I would imagine there's a sacrifice and you know Levi could have just won uh but it didn't it didn't uh and it it it allowed me to get back into the game I managed to run my king to the other side and slowly it you know it just kind of it lost its way it didn't know what to do and then Big Boss Gotham chess took over got into the position and this was already very bad news so we we we got a Counterattack on this side of the board um I mean I think it kind of gave up on the position a little bit but you know such as life and the hard bot you know the hard bot is is one of the most uh one of the most difficult to create um because it it has to play like a human for a for a you know a good amount of time uh and then uh you know it has to at some point it's got to make a mistake right and then you have to punish it so um at the moment the bot has a tendency to deviate from the course a bit early uh we will change this so the bot probably you know at at the early levels it will be deviating quite soon uh later it will not so it will uh it will probably play until move Seven 8 n like something that you see in the course uh and then it will uh after that it will play on its own for but again even now even if it's going to deviate like a little bit early you're still getting positions that look very similar to the course and ultimately you will get a lot of practical experiences so easy medium hard this is around the range that it's going to play against you you can choose with white and black if you have a course and for the next 2 days even if you don't own any courses E4 will pop up here and you will have access so what that means by the way is if you go to courses uh you will uh you will see E4 so you you can actually go play around you can play this opening against Levi you can practice drills in random order you can do quiz Shuffle right so these are all featur like if if you don't know there are so many ways to study my opening courses um they have hours of video they have quizzes they have uh you know and that's you have a explore page which allows you to to mess around to find a c if you play a game on ches lcom or something and you know you you you you don't know where the how to find the well I I don't know which study it is E4 KN C3 oh where is this view study oh okay perfect boom like these are all features that that really help the experience and like I said in the beginning of this video for the next 2 days those of you that don't have access to anything uh and cannot play against you will get access to these two courses uh at a minimum okay now those of you who own the courses don't worry we're not just giving away stuff for free after two days access will be revoked the purpose of this is to just give people a chance at playing Levi and also we want to see we want to see the data we want to see how Levi plays so we want to make Levi better all right again we didn't just build any type of Bot there's a million different Bots you can play there's Martin Nelson all the Bots like on on ch.com that's not the point this is specifically to practice your opening courses because I think it is really difficult to learn opening courses and I think a lot of you would agree with me difficult to learn openings you play humans they don't play what you want to play you play Bots they don't play what you want to play you play humans you lose rating this is all unrated this is all to help you uh practice your openings and um yeah so enjoy go play against Levi we want to see uh how much traffic the website can also handle how many hundreds or thousands of you might play against Levi uh at the same time and um if you want to buy a course for the next two days also they are uh 25% off so uh technically this was you know you could say well this was one big uh promo video but again I'm mostly excited about the fact that we have a bot that plays like a human we don't re we don't have a bot that plays like a really bad bot and then like a really good bot we tried to build something that will emulate what it's like to play rapid games on chess.com and help you practice in a comfortable environment and then you know go play uh against humans once you feel comfortable and to practice your openings so that's the purpose of today's video uh enjoy your stuff and uh yeah get out of here
