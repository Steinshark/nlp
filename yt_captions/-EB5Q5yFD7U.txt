welcome to the vivo next three you might have already seen that teaser video I made about a month ago but now the phone has been officially announced we can really get into the meat of it this is the phones retail package and you can tell straight away that a lot of love has gone into it there's a 44 watt super flash charger a pair of noise canceling air phones of course the phone itself and just below that a USB C cable now for the fun bit so with a record-breaking display an ultra high-resolution camera and some class-leading hardware the vivo NEX three is of really impressive package on paper but what I want to do in this video is compared to the Galaxy Note 10.1 droid has to offer and in the end we're gonna crown a winner the short conclusion is this each of these devices really helped me appreciate what the other was able to achieve as well what exactly I mean by that is the longer answer I really like how the new 10 plus feels it is a massive phone but it's only next to something like this do you realize just how good of a job Samsung has done making it feel manageable the note is far lighter and this combined with it being a sliver thinner makes it feel substantially more svelte if you've had the chance to pick up one of Apple's newer iPads I would describe picking up the note 10 plus as a similar experience it's kind of like one of those oh wow that is a lot lighter than I thought it was going to be moments it is a little bit sharper around the corners but overall it wins the prize for economics and the vivo doesn't even feel bad it just feels like about what you'd expect it to you'll start to see and actually a big reason why I made this video is that whilst these two phones look very similar on paper and to some people probably even in person they're made with very different design philosophies whilst the note is built on refinement and polish the next feels new daring and experimental and that also translates to the way they look aside from that psychedelic or aglow option the note is a fairly plain looking phone whilst the NEX introduces a pretty bizarre circular camera setup kind of reminiscent of a mechanical watch face and just when you thought you'd seen every single possible smart phone finish here's another one in bright light you get wide bands of bacala and as you tilt the phone it turns into a more consistent gradient and then you've got buttons where while Samsung has mildly experimented by moving all the physical buttons to the left of the phone vivo has just straight-up removed them in this continuous pursuit of complete seamlessness they've been replaced with virtual equivalents which to be fair still give a satisfying response and they're easy to feel for but I wouldn't call this in itself an advantage what is an advantage though is the fact that vivo retained the headphone jack whilst the note didn't so kicking off the deep dive with a bit of charging we've already seen that the NEX comes bundled with a 44 watt charger and whilst the note is technically capable of 45 watts it only comes bundled with a 25 watt adapter so that's what most people are gonna use as expected then vivo is steams ahead and by the time the Newton plusses hit 8% the Nexus Audion 13 the battery capacities themselves are pretty similar and actually pretty high on both you get a 4500 million per cell on the necks and 4300 milliamp hours on the note do you ever wish that there was one smartphone released per year that had the best elements of all the other devices sometimes I do and having the cameras on these two devices together is an agonising example of that because there is just so much joint potential here both bring something completely different to the table and in this case we're talking the vivos ability to capture stunning 64 megapixel photos and the notes color processing and it's video quality so yes providing you're in good light the next three is 64 megapixel photos look spectacular I wasn't sure what to expect going in but these photos are notably more detailed when you crop in then the notes 12 megapixel ones I wouldn't use the sixty four megapixel mode in low-light but I was surprised to see even in average lighting even when the subject isn't being blasted by the Sun it's still getting way more information in vivo also has a super macro mode that lets you get really tight focus on objects that are right in front of you plus the phone's wide F 1.8 aperture compared to the notes means that photos in the day have a lot more natural background blur this phone truly has the potential for even more impressive and more cinematic shots than on the note but generally I find that Samsung processes color better and by comparison the next shots can seem a little pale both of these phones are brilliant for taking photos but the note is well ahead when it comes to both video quality and video stabilization oh yeah and this applies to the front cameras too another thing worth noting if you're trying to have log for example the Galaxy Note and Plus this front camera is far more capable it records are not just 4k resolution versus 1080p on vevo but dynamic range is better even the audio quality is better on a bit of a side note if you do enjoy it straight to the point tech content like this a sub would be massively appreciated there is a lot more coming especially with the whole slew of smartphones that are about to drop very soon anyways one very important consideration with the next three is the fact that the chip inside this phone is faster than both the snapdragon and the XE NOS versions of the note 10 plus armed with the snapdragon a 55 plus the next three is around 10% more powerful but the note has a whole extra four gigs of ram and faster ufs 3.0 storage so in a weird kind of way both versions are absolute performance tanks but they specialize in different tasks the next three will pull ahead in gaming whilst the note can handle more simultaneous applications at once and should be able to load things faster I tried playing world war heroes 2 on the NEX and you are looking at ultra settings that are nearly stable 60 frames per second it's gorgeous easily some of the best graphics I've ever seen on a phone and that brings me onto the elephant in the room that viewing experience they call this the waterfall display because of how it slopes into an almost vertical slant on the sides and I've seen a lot of conversation about it there are a lot of lovers there are a lot of haters so this is my tape I spent a long time looking at and using the curved panels on Samsung phones but it's only when you see this side by side that you realize and just how curved the next threes is I mean if you look at this phone from the front the sides pretty much disappear and with most games completely filling the screen it's impressive it really does as advertised make it feel that your content is spilling over the sides that said this also makes me appreciate that the notes display doesn't discolor nearly as much on the sides and the fact that it remains responsive across it's entire width with the vevo these waterfalls are not really made for touching it's not like you're getting more display to interact with mind you that's needed because if they were responsive you'd be suffering accidental touches like crazy but this also means that the waterfall is purely a visual thing it's not like you can all of a sudden start scrolling lists using the sides of your phone also whilst both are similarly large Super AMOLED panels the note ends display is higher resolution with less screen glare - although the fact that Samsung now filters blue light automatically from your display does mean the vivo has cleaner brighter whites so waterfall display I don't mind it it looks impressive it feels futuristic but at the same time it's probably not up there with the priorities in terms of what I want from a phone display both devices also use in display fingerprint scanners the speed is about the same but some sense ultrasonic scanner is technically superior it needs less pressure to activate and it can work even when your fingers are wet although personally not a fan of that unlock animation it feels lacking especially when compared to vivos completely customizable offering and speaking of customizable offerings the software you're looking at here is vivos fun touch OS and it shares some aesthetic traits of samsung's 1ui skin like the rounded square icons but under the hood they work pretty differently with vivo for example you swipe up once from the bottom and you can see all your quick toggles which is actually faster than the two swipes and a stretch you need to do the same on the Samsung they've both got a dock mode they've both got powerful battery saving features and both place an emphasis on reach ability which is pretty important when you're handling screens of these dimensions alright so up until this point really close battle you're probably thinking I don't know which one is winning but there are some things about the notes and in fact quite a few of Samsung's more recent flagships that I like and that I think give it a bit of a leg up the note m+ has microSD card support the ability to wirelessly charge and wirelessly reverse charge other devices plus an amazing haptic engine in fact the larger vibration motor in this phone is a big part of why there's no headphone jack here has effectively taken its place and I get it better vibration quality sounds like one of those take it or leave it don't really care kind of features until you use it typing and just the subtle vibrations you feel when interacting with the UI feels spot-on on the note you get IP certification for water and dust resistance and there's more even the speakers are fantastic on the note because the phone has an earpiece that's so tiny it's almost invisible Samsung have switched the speaker audio to instead come from the top of the phone as well as the main speaker on the bottom it sounds a lot more immersive than on the vivo which only has a single unit and then whilst it's not a massive deal for me we also can't ignore the fact that the note comes with the s-pen it's just impressive that this is being stored inside the phone and yet they've still managed to make a phone that is both slimmer and lighter and contains a similar sized battery oh yeah and both phones also have a massive 256 gigs of internal storage and both have a 5g variant but for what it's worth in every single room I tried the Wi-Fi speed on the next range from slightly faster to a lot faster than the note so what is the conclusion here I mentioned earlier that each one of these devices really helped me appreciate the other and hopefully as we've gone through this video you've started to see why that is these are two top level flagship smartphones but they've gone about achieving this in pretty different ways that waterfall display the flagship feature of the NEX is cool I like it but I don't think it adds much to the daily smartphone experience I think things like great haptics or the speaker quality on the note are subtler more important features that said the next brings a lot more than just this display it's larger battery it's faster charging it's more powerful chip and the headphone jack they all make it relevant but if price was no object I would still side with the note on balance as the more well rounded device ultimately though the cost is important and so as soon as I get the final confirmed prices I'm gonna drop them in a pinned comment below and so based on that let me know which phone you think won this competition then stop watching my name is Erin and this is mr. who's the boss I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
