it is one of the most copied works of literature for effectively a thousand years so it's a it's a book that essentially let's put it this way that anyone who could read for the better part of a thousand years in the west was reading boethus it's it's unbelievably influential and that with his other translations make their way into the Middle Ages and so the the metaphor I like to use it's like you know the flowers have have died we we know we heard Ian hery Ali recently say the West is a cut flower it's like the flowers have died but these books are seeds these books are seeds of the ideas and it's as if he cast them forward into the future so that hundreds of years after his death those seeds would grow again into you might say the beautiful garden of of of Western you know medieval culture this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic [Applause] world so everyone it is a pleasure to finally have Stephen Blackwood on my channel uh as you know uh Stephen Stephen is the president and founder of rosson college he was also one of my uh he was my neighbor at The Exodus seminar you know sitting next to me bringing us back to this story you know expressing his wisdom with with so much tact uh you know he's become a friend and someone that I respect very much and so I'm happy to have him on and we're going to talk about uh boethus we're going to enter into boethius's consolation of philosophy Stephen wrote a wonderful book uh called the consolation of boethus as poetic liturgy and I mean I read this I was amazed at some of the things he was bringing up you know I'm not someone who's that good at poetry but that I could just see when I was reading his text that he was so close to the way I see the world and to the things that I care about and so I'm excited for him to be able to expound that for us today so Stephen thanks for coming on thanks for having me Jonathan yeah so tell me a start off like what it is that attracted you first of all to to boas's text maybe how people most people will know boas but maybe you know give a brief introduction of of who he is what it is was going on around him and why he wrote his consolation well I think that uh well bu's been a big inspiration for me for for for many years and uh you know just in a really quick sketch the you we're talking about the he's born in the late fifth century ad so sort of right around the fall of Rome 475 or or so and then he uh he lives for about 50 years and he's born into a to a wealthy uh should actually adopted into a wealthy sort of very Patrician family and he's he gets the the best education you can get probably in you in Athens or Alexandria he learns Greek uh does all of the studies all of the forms of knowledge that were were important you know music and and and Mathematics astronomy you know rhetoric logic all of those all of those things philosophy and uh he rises to the very s very highest Heights of the of the Roman Empire this is after the fall of Rome now right so so rather than an emperor there's a kind of foreign King theodoric uh but it's it's it's it's kind of as if you had you know at one of our modern States everything was functioning except a foreign King had come in over the top and so it's it's actually much more coherent than people might might think so he rises to the very you know the Senate is still there and and so on he he becomes the uh the master of offices the mistro vorum uh he becomes a Consul and he says the happiest day of his his his his life is that uh his is the day his two sons both become consuls and the reason I I share this is because he's at the very sort of tiptop of of Education of political uh influence of wealth of of of of sophistication he's a he's a he's a poet he's a mathematician he's an inventor he's he's really just at the very top of of his game and and and what what what brius uh sees is that Rome which had for so long relied upon you might say Greek intellectual infrastructure and this is this is not a a wild claim I mean the the the all of the Romans the educated Romans were themselves speaking Greek for hundreds of years and being educated in Greece and actually forging their their their literature according to Greek models and their architecture and all of that they UND they understood this themselves very very self-consciously um but Greek is being lost and and and so buus sets himself to task to translate all of these kind of seminal texts of Greek into Latin latinize this this super structure of of of of of wisdom and uh he he translates Works in mathematics and and logic and and and music and so on and these are effectively kind of latinization you know making available you know pretty much someone else's work into a form it's a translation or a you know a making available in a new form but Lar into translation and then dis absolute disaster strikes he is accused of treason and thrown in prison and a year later uh he is according to contempor the Contemporary accounts we have he's Haled to prison and uh uh brutally tortured and executed and uh that's the end of buthus that's the end of this man who had hoped let's say say to had the dream in some sense I think you can say the dream of restoring the intellectual foundations of his of his beloved sort of you know City and and of all of Rome uh ends in in in the worst sort of in a sense death you can can imagine except of course that's not the end of buus while he is in prison he writ a book that is not contradict with everything he's written but at the same time totally different these texts on you know the translation of nomus and so on they're very dry I mean you know you should read them if you're interested but they're very hard to get through they're very dry they're very logic chopping they're all about ratios and the music and so on that was that was an important text for almost 2,000 years and but you know they're they're a slog let's put it that way and and in prison while he's in prison he writes one of the most astonishing works of literature that I think has ever ever ever been written and and in this it's like he puts in a certain sense he puts all of his fine-tuned learning down and he goes right to the heart of the question but of course he's not putting it down he's putting it into a new form these years of study and in this and in this book he uh this is a a work of consolation this is a a book in which very raw in which a woman who's a personification of philosophy comes to comfort a man a prisoner a man who's been bereft of taken away everything that he had his his wealth his family his position his reputation everything he's got nothing left and there he is in his PR so it's you know buus played by himself you might say in this in this amazing literary drama and and this this this woman named philosophy comes to comfort him and to restore him to his inner self-possession to his his his his knowledge and possession of himself and that's the you know we may perhaps we'll have a talk a bit about the the book but but but in terms of the biography uh what's amazing is that uh uh you know this book that is in a way so different from his other works uh just the literary power the the gripping character of this I I I say that uh uh this is this is one of those books that you can give to someone who's in an enormously difficult situation whether it's you know cancer or or terminal disease or or loss or or or you know some kind of form or pain or indecipherable you know thing in their lives uh and it and it speaks directly to that because that's where it starts that's the that's the problem this book is written about and we don't we actually don't know uh really how this book got out into circulation and somehow got out of the the the the prison there's there's so far as I know there's little to no record of it for like 200 years and so imagine you here this this you know this long Arc it's so important to remember these things you know the long Arc of of of of time of culture of civilization of the Soul uh he this man who I think had hoped in his own lifetime that these works that he was translating would help to restore Rome he did not know Rome was really effectively over you know a few decades after his death it's you know it's a kind of Backwater goes from a million uh inhabitants or so at it at its height to essentially you know 30,000 it's like a swampy Backwater during the the the the Carol engine into the Middle Ages but what I want to leave you leave this this uh moment of his biography with is this book somehow gets out and after a couple hundred hundred years it it really gets out and it's the it's translated in English by King Alfred we were talking about that um earlier and uh but in Latin it is it is one of the most copied works of literature for effectively A Thousand Years so it's a it's a book that essentially let's put it this way that anyone who could read for the better part of a thousand years in the west was reading beus it's it's unbelievably influential and that with his other translations make their way into the Middle Ages and so the the metaphor I like to use it's like you know the flowers have have died we we know we heard Ian hery Ali recently say the West is a cut flower it's like the flowers have died but these books are seeds these books are seeds of the ideas and it's as if he cast them forward into the future so that hundreds of years after his death those seeds would grow again into you might say the beautiful garden of of of Western you know medieval culture yeah and so there's a sense in which buthus though he he thought I think that well he had no doubt hopes as we all do that his work would bear some fruit in his lifetime uh you he had a a terrible death and yet in the long span of time time and perhaps you could say Pro Providence uh that which he had given his life to Bears enormous fruit hundreds of years uh after his death and so I've often thought about this that you know from buthus we see it's not up to us What Becomes of our work it's only up to us to do to undertake it as Faithfully as we can yeah and I think you're some of some of the ideas that you brought about are important to emphasize which is that the boethius's work you know became a model for literature in the Middle Ages became a model for poetry became a model you know and did ultimately more to synthesize the ancient Greek thinking and Carry It Forward than like you said his other kind of copying of of ancient text and so there's a strange innovation in the text itself but it is also a kind of gathering together in crisis so his personal crisis his suffering and the you know the things that he had to go through become like a microcosm of what is happening to the West at that moment you with all the barbarians coming in and and this kind of moment of uncertainty and chaos and in this in that strange way like you said the book itself becomes a little Arc that carries all this thinking in a very compressed form with all its different meters and its different approach to poetry into the flowering of the of the High Middle Ages you could say and becomes a model for that um I want to invite you all to the very first symbolic World Summit over 3 days we will finally meet in real time in real space and everyone from this little corner of the internet will be there to explore the theme of reclaiming the cosmic image of course I will be speaking but there will also be Martin Shaw who is an amazing mythographer father Steven D young of Lord of spirit Fame there will be Richard Roland from the universal history series veser Stamper Nicholas kotar and Neil de gr that you've all seen on my channel here and there for entertainment we have everyone's favorite apocalyptic band The One and Only dirt po Robins this event will be the chance of a lifetime to capture and embrace our current moment so join us from February 29th to March 2nd 2024 in Tarpon spings Florida visit the symbolic world.com Summit for more information and I will see you there [Music] and it's also important it's hard for people to think that because so many people think that the Middle Ages are just a dark period you know they don't understand to what extent poetry and and music and you know meter was important especially in what we call the high Middle Ages in the west into the weird weirdly too into the world that into the Barbarian world that had taken over his Rome right so the influence of his work will made itself will make it itself known in France and England in all of these Barbarian lands that are now kind of Reviving the Roman the Roman world so it really is an astounding story of how of what of what he was able to do in his suffering yeah yeah and it's a very important point you make about the way he's Gathering up the wisdom of the past and um you know he's he's he's you know today we sort of you know have this idea that you know try and say something original and and and and new and you know for buus you know he was I think you know he thought the highest thing that you know in a way the highest and best would be to to to to share the greatest uh uh you might say the wisdom of the past in a way that could be heard and and heard and new and so he he he is writing as if you might say it's his work is synthesizing and bringing together um without saying he's doing that I'm not saying he think oh here I have I've got all the answers right here no he's he's he's but what he's actually doing is is take looking back to Plato and Aristotle and to the stoics and and the neoplatonist and all the poetic tradition to Homer uh and uh and indeed I I I would argue to the to to his experience of of Christianity and bringing all of this up in a form that uh that he thinks is fundamental so it can speak to his time interestingly uh I mentioned Christianity we we know we the Christian he wrote texts on on the Trinity and so on there's no mention of Christianity or of Christ or anything like that in the consolation it's a really interesting uh kind of question or challenge or history for for many scholars um uh and my I'll simply say that my my sense of that is that what he's doing is is sharing uh the wisdom as he understands it in a universal form and we could talk about you know what the logos is and and what he might have understood uh uh about the relationship between the let's call it the Pagan and uh Christian trai Traditions or the old Pagan philosophical tradition and and the Christian uh religion is a very very interesting uh question but fundamentally he's putting things in a language of universality and that's one of the reasons I think he's such an important voice today uh because amidst our our our our our fragments are alienated sort of dysfunctional uh dis disagreements uh often you know very shallow uh he he he offers I think a voice that goes right to the heart of very fundamental uh human questions yeah and I I think the way that I also understand his work is something like the maintaining of a secular space in within Christianity that is you know and you can see it again play in terms of microcosms which is that he's expressing the continu ation of the Pagan world the neoplatonic world the the Greek world into this burgeoning Christian World he's expressing that as a possible you know image of what of what is good and what is what is in the future and then you could say that not surprisingly that his aesthetic or his vision gets taken up by the secular world in in the the Virgin and Christian reality which is why the Kings you know supposedly Queen Elizabeth also like loved boethus and King Alfred and these secular figures would look to boethus because they were playing in some ways a secular role within the Christian Vision they were they were not directly related you know although they did go to church they were Christians they were somewhat of a remove for that somewhat like a narx of the church um and I think that that's one of the powerful things about Christianity that people forget in are kind of postan age which is that is the way the Christianity laid itself out as being both you know having the highest mystery in these theological uh texts and these mystical hymns but then also being able to entertain you know the works of soc The Works of Aristotle The Works of Plato The Works of the Greeks and a vision of poetry even preserving the dramatic text preserving the the the works of literature that were produced in the in the ancient world as a kind of you could say narx to Christianity a place where we can explore these ideas without explicitly saying always having a religious uh well and there's just two quick points to add to that and the first is that uh you know people today forget that uh the the Greeks thought there were entirely rational you know might say philosophical arguments uh you they talk about the highest good or or God uh or about the practices that enable you to approach or understand or come as close as you can to understanding those things those are those are completely rational philosophically divised derive principles so it's not as if you know you've got this I don't know some sort of cold philosophy in the one hand and then in the the other hand with these kind of Simply irrational or mystical practices I mean it's the most ra for the Greeks it's the most rational thing in the world you might say to to to try to understand uh uh uh that which you do not understand that which is beyond you uh and to be adequate somehow to that understanding we could talk about intellectual humility we could talk about you know so this this what I'm suggesting is that is that in in in in the consolation for example there comes a moment in right in the middle of the book in the middle of the argument where philosophy system you know you know the problem with with our thinking our kind of rational thinking is it divides things up and you know divides up that which is which we most seek which is one and whole and unified might say the highest good it divides it up in such a way that that that that it can't sat it can't satisfy precisely because it's dividing it up and we could talk about you know the implication of that argument but what what she says is is that so what do we need to do like what's the answer to that problem that's a big problem and it's a problem we all face day by day right which is that you know the way in which all of your efforts can outstrip can somehow divide up or be inadequate to the to the thing that you seek which is kind of a a unified self-possession and so uh and she says well and what do you think we should do and he says well we should seek the father of all things and so what you really see in this fulcrum of the argument is that they're turning upward you might say to that which is the source of rational understanding but in a unified form and they're seeking they're seeking that source for help to bridge that divide and so all I want to say is that you we talk about the the the the religious element here what I what I want to say is there is a Phil there's a there's such a thing as a philosophical religion in which you are you you adopting habits and practices that you know are necessary it doesn't take some add-ons some big leap or anything like that it's it this is like this is a fund something you can do on a fundamentally rational basis and the other point I would make just very quickly is that is that it's not it's also that the the the the the inheritance of these uh chist these these platonic and artian the neoplus and so on the Greek the Greeks broadly speaking it's not uh just that they were kind of you sort of useful in the background they're absolutely vital to the whole history of Christian theology to understand itself I mean you know the Bible's written you know the New Testament is written in Greek the Creeds are written in Greek and there's a reason for that and so you might say they're they're they're interpreting and understand I'm not saying that it's there that that Christianity can be reduced to the ancient Greeks but what I am saying is that we we don't as a as a fact get our understanding of what Christianity is about in the west outside of the the mediation uh of uh of the intellectual structures that enabled that to be understood and and in a sense it's not just that this goes so far and then this picks up it it's there's a sense in which those intellectual structures themselves are transformed by their engagement with the Christian Revelation so it works both ways yeah I think that's a that's a great point I was you know because obviously you know you send me this book your your book and I was reading it and I thought well I have to reread the consolation I hadn't read it in maybe 15 years or something and I was so struck by that part of the book itself I felt like I was falling right into the problem of emergence the the question of complexity that we're dealing with today and and I realized to what extent you know how deeply boreus had perceived it and what you know and you can see that this type of thinking you know the relationship between the many and the one and the the kind of jump into Intuition or this jump into something which transcends multiplicity you know was was so deeply understood and now it's become a mystery to us because we we've had a few centuries of of kind of rationalistic scientism that is running out now and and people are realizing that again but definitely revisiting those chapters in the constellation is is worth it for people who are thinking about the problem of complexity you know even in technical terms right now um so maybe we can just quickly well not quickly but you know yeah go into the argument of the of the book itself before we fall into the rhythms that's the thing that I I really want to get into but maybe we can help people understand a little bit what the argument of the book you know buus is is basically lost all the things that thinks or that most people think has are valuable to life that are what make you what make life valuable and then consolation is trying to help him see through that uh and so maybe you can p take people through the kind of basic argument of the book and and what he's trying to help what philosophy is trying to help breus understand I i' I'd love I'd love to and tell me if I'm going too slow I try and do this as quickly as I can you know it's like sorry it's like reduce the one of these fuls of Western Civilization to a few sentences please at least you know no more than so many words well well let me just first uh take take the take it uh take the chance if I if I can uh some of your your listeners might be interested in I suspect and if they haven't already read read the constellation of philosophy and and if they're looking for uh to read it in in English uh the the one that I I most like is this one this little Little Red Book it's called the Lo from the lobe Library L EB it's published by Harvard just a little about as big is your hand and it's got the Latin and the English uh both together and so you can look back and forth but it's a nice little volume have on the Shelf uh there's something lurgical there's something just very beautiful about the material materiality of a book I can't read books uh uh uh on a Kindle or something myself very successfully and so I I like to recommend this just because I think it's a beautiful experience to have this book uh in your hand but the the basic argument is this is that it starts very very powerfully uh with we uh with a poem and it's a Woe Is Me poem Oh you know this all this has happened and you know I'm I'm I wish I could die uh you know but I can't you know but you know I call for death and he doesn't come and it's just it's very wo is me poem it's not and and uh uh and then the book says I as I was writing as these verses were being dictated to me by the muses and the the poetic Muses are there they're telling him what to write uh this this blazing figure comes in this philosophy she's described as like having absolutely blazing eyes or she's she's she's able to pierce right through him and she's got this this s of ambiguous stature see sometimes she looked like she was as big as a as a human being and other times she was up to the to the heavens very rich symbolism and then other times her head went through the heavens U and she says basically who let these uh Shany C Mary trul ask who let these theatrical Tarts or poetic Horrors or whatever you want to say in here to this man they have no cure for his pain they only make it worse and and and so she's basically saying you know she's he's he's caught in this and I think this is a really interesting moment because we've all been there right you know this moment where you can't see out of your own a depression uh you're you're you're in a bad thought pattern or whatever you want to call it you can't get out you can't get get out and feeling sorry for yourself and that makes thing and then you feel passive and you the victim and it's all so terrible and so she comes in and um and so it's very interesting her first move is this kind of condemnation of these poets who are just making things worse it's a kind of feeling uh sory for myself uh like Netflix show or something and and she and she K she kicks them out but it's worse than that because it's in a pattern and it's like a loop it's a loop and so she she kicks them out but very interestingly she then says this woman who has just banished The Poets or the the muses she says leave him to my uses to heal and make whole so what she's suggesting is that there's a different kind of of poetry that isn't just sort of Phil story for myself uh wo is me but but but but could be salutary and and and transformative and so um but then she she has uh she he can't even recognize her this we we have to skip through the symbolism it's terrible to thing to do in a Jonathan pedo podcast uh maybe we can revisit it at some point but what that her she is such a richly symbolic figure um he can this the first few pages you could spend hours on them but he can't recognize her even though he studied with her so his his vision is blurred with tears but that's also metaphorical he can't access he he can't recognize his surroundings he doesn't know himself he can't recognize her and there's this beautiful moment she's wearing this dress that she says she's woven herself um what does that mean it's like wisdoms represent what we can see wisdom by is the work of wisdom itself something like that yeah and uh but it's torn H it's torn it's it's you know marauding you it's like Bandits she he says it's Event Event like all the the many competing philosophical schools have each taken a garment Taken part of it they've ripped the stoics or the Skeptics or the epicurian or whatever uh but you know clearly what buthus is after is that unitary you know what brings all these together so what he what she says is so this beautiful moment she makes a fold in her dress this kind of a sacramental moment and she wipes the tears away from his eyes so that that he can see her and recognize her as the teacher of his Youth and so there's a very beautiful moment in which and I think this is deep right I mean like the first moment you can't you can't get there you like it's a moment of it's an act of Grace fundamentally it's an act of the good towards us that gets us out of frees us liberates us from our our our our inescapable self kind of regard and self-pity but then what happens is it is just tough freaking love she's like you know tell me what's wrong with you basically and he goes on this long diet tribe about oh I lost this I lost that I was mistreated I've been accused falsely of treason and now I'm here in the prison and of course he's writing all this but he's portraying himself as just an absolute I have been and you know let's take his word for it let's assume he's justly his account of his situation is fair and he is a victim of these terrible injustices and she and she said and he says I've been I've been uh I've been banished and she says to him and this is such a pivot in the book she says banished you say a man's true Homeland if you are banished from your true Homeland well then I say you have banished yourself because only you can remove yourself from you know true self-possession in the place that you belong and so his retort is well hold on I've I've lost all these things how could I be happy and so the first part of the book I'm going to move much more quickly here now first part of the book is is a kind of negative action she has to separate him out from his attachments in the world his attachment to money his attachment to his position of power and his Fame and all of that and she so she shows him by and by you can certainly read read your way through these beautiful arguments and they're so powerful in which she she says okay you know let's take money for example you know is it ever really yours what if the stock market crashes you know what if what if someone steals it away it's like and in the argument of all these things same with frame Fame well you could have your reputation trashed H and then what you know her argument is anything that can be taken away from you is not really yours so that's that's the first part of the book and he go and he has to think okay then well you know what is mine and so she'll say well well what are you really seeking in in those things that's the next thing so let's say in wealth maybe you're seeking security so she shows that there's a spiritual good that's really being sought in this thing that that you think is the thing but can be taken away from you so it can't be what you're really after because you wouldn't want a it wouldn't be a real happiness if someone if it were externally dependent it could just be taken away so then she goes to show that what the the you might say the actual object is being s whether it's security or or or or power in the sense of ability to realize myself my power to realize what I'm really up seeking in the world that say it's not external uh or or or or security or or beauty or whatever the case may be and so she shows through this argument that there's a kind of unitary all these things are connected they're not separate they're actually you know the thing that would really be be desirable is to to make you secure is also beautiful uh is also self-sufficient and so on and so she shows how each of these spiritual Goods that are behind the material you might say things are actually all participating in in in in in in in a single unified good and so then we come to this problem that we were talking about a minute ago which is that okay well yeah that's it that's the thing uh but then the problem is my seeking of that in time and you know sometimes I'm doing this and sometimes I'm doing that they're all dividing this up and so the very thing that I my the very thing I want my approach to that thing is preventing me from having that thing and that's a very that's a very it's a very uh it's a very uh deep moment and I think it's important to take a step back and reckon a bit with you know this as the kind of problem of finitude itself right you know the the you know how can any of our efforts you ever amount to anything let's say you want to love your your partner your wife your husband your child you want to love them like perfectly you want to this is like even that it's like you know nothing but failure you know it's like the the efforts to be adequate even to this one thing and so there's this moment of prayer that follows that in which they're turning towards the highest good to help them overcome that problem and uh the remainder of the of the of the book it gets in a sense the problem becomes even more real even even even sharper so let's say you're starting out in this world of you know you know Injustice and uh being robbed of everything you had you know uh in in a moment of suffering and you know his complaint at the beginning I should have said is is that there's no order in the world because these things would not be possible if there was order in the world I would not be in this this this position of disenfranchised Injustice if there were and and so what she shows in this first half is that there is order because your actions this is an argument that comes from Plato your actions are their own reward so you know remember we were saying how if it's external like you know riches well that can be taken away from you but if if you uh what she shows is that it within our actions the good or evil they bring about is internal to them so if you do something good in virtue you an act of love that can't be taken away from you it's it's what you are whereas even if you're not caught if you do something that degrades your soul that degradation is internal you lie you betray someone whatever that's so so what she says is that uh is that is that um uh actions have their own reward or punishment present in them yeah the good that you do that's the reward and it's it's a it's the it's a reward in also in the sense that you cannot it cannot be taken away from you can't you can't be stripped of that good because so and so too in the negative side that and so so what she shows is that in fact intrinsic inaction is already this Justice of you getting the reward of the punishment you deserve because his claim at the beginning is you know good people are you know get punished and you know bad people get rewarded and she's saying well that may look that like what it is externally but actually internally that's not the case and it's a very deep and Powerful because there is ultimately there can be no happiness he argues other than one that is internally possessed so then the question is how do you how do you possess that but the second part of the book is very interesting because you can see in a sense and I think we all face this okay we're living in what seems like a disordered world and then the answer can be well over Yonder there's a Unity that we seek and that you can maybe in a moment of kind of mysticism or something uh approach uh but then very interesting in the second half of the book The The Prisoner buthus rearticulates the initial problem at a higher you you might say even more fundamental level because he's what he wants ultimately you might say what all human beings in some sense I would argue want is not simply an answer that is over there because we're living in the world of of the finite and the broken and the particular he wants an answer that makes sense here uh in in the midst of this and so the the later part of the book deals with this question of the relation between let's say um uh uh Time and Eternity of the finite and the infinite and uh in a difficult sort of theological section at the end ultimately with the relation between Free Will and Providence or the you might say the absolute unity and of of of the first principle itself and and I think what's so beautiful about the the the the ending of this this book which I'm not going to spoil for your uh for your listeners what's so beautiful about the ending of the book is that it's a bit like the question of um of a ladder like if you get to the top and you kick away the ladder or you get to the top and you learn that the top destroys the ladder because it's all predetermined or something was like wait a second what what was my journey after all like what was was that not real and so what I what I think is going on in this beautiful book and the way in which its wisdom is put in the form of of poetry of images of of of of beautiful rhetorical uh uh turns is this really a work of you might say pedagogy it's a work in which the wisdom is being put in a way that is adequate to the both the soul of the reader in confusion and alienation on the one hand and to the integral uh wisdom that it is it is it is it is uh conveying so the fundamental you might say argument is one that moves from alienation and this sense that the whole world is disordered but that demands to be able to see uh an order within that to one that leads him on a journey such that he can see a deeper you might say spiritual logic as governing the world but but more just as importantly to come to see himself the mechanisms and principles of his own knowing of his own activities as you might say in the image of or a manifestation of that underlying uh wisdom yeah and so in that way it's a deeply incarnational approach it's not a it's not a gnostic idea like you proposed at the outset like the idea that you know all of this is all illusion all this is all nothing and once you get to the mystical with the one then you know all that other stuff doesn't matter but rather this formulation at all the levels of How It's adapted to the the particular and I think this brings us to you know the reason why I wanted to talk to you mostly in the first place which is that in your book one of the arguments you make is that the very structure of the poems the very use of meter the very way in which boethus you know structures the the the the meter of the lines in the text is an incarnation of his journey moving from a kind of broken disunity and uh and uh you know a kind of confusion towards this deeper Unity uh and that in some ways that one of the reason why it has such an impact on Western Civilization is that it is paraliturgical or it is lurgical in the sense that if someone goes on the journey with Bia even reads aloud the poems that that participation in the Rhythm as as much as the ideas that he's he's he's formulating rationally is reordering the soul of the participant towards the good that is aimed at in the book so maybe you can break down that argument because I was really fascinated by you know the the proposition you can talk a bit about how you came to that and and and what that looks like well what I um so say a few things what I what I discovered and I I hasten to add like the the acoustic super structure of this book is astonishing um and I sort of uncovered this but it's bit like I don't know falling into a ditch and finding a gold treasure or something uh it's like it I didn't I didn't make the treasure I just I just sort of realized it was there and uh effectively what I what I I I argue is that the the these poems meters are organized into a a beautiful sort of of symmetrical and interwoven structure so there's a you might say a uh an an an ordering of the acoustic character of the book that I suggest mediates Time and Eternity and now this maybe sounds like a difficult thought uh but what I would want to maybe start with is is that is it this the need for repetition is absolutely fundamental to our need or to our ability to know to know anything so let's just to give a good simple example you know you can't so much as recognize um and and memory let me say memory and repetition are absolutely fundamentally uh uh uh connected so so you couldn't so much as uh you can't recognize uh you couldn't so much as recognize yourself in the mirror or or your your front door or your mom or whatever without without memory right because it's memory that allows you to to recognize in the present this as something that you already you already know and so so um so memory is necessary to see a repetition but repetition is necessary uh because without it there's no there's nothing stable at all so imag imagine uh imagine you know just like being in a fire hose you know life is a fire hose it's just coming at you there's no interpretation of anything it's just you know you don't even know it's water right because it's just that's you know that that's the kind of overwhelming flux of movement and change you total nothing but change let's put it that that way and you know life feels that way sometimes right I mean that so you can look at this let's just start in the most stable way I mean in the most in the in in the in the simplest way let's say you know we've all been around babies you know uh most of us anyway when they're you know early on when they're born and you know they they look up at their at their hand and and they don't even know that's their hand yeah right like they have no idea it's just they're not yet conscious of of that fact and so the question is how do you move from that moment as a as a child as an infant that can't even recognize its mother or its own like limbs to one that knows oh this is me and that's that's my mother and what I what what I'm arguing is that it's the it's repetition it's seeing this again and again and again that that stabilizes imagine yourself as an infant it's just everything moving around and to us like you the world is stable it's like no there's the door to the front house and that's Mom and you know there's the fireplace and you know there's the there's the the the the painting on the wall or whatever and here are the people I see them all but the question what I'm trying to draw out here is how do you get there to the point where that you can interp that world versus where the baby starts but I don't want to put ourselves in the baby's position in a sense of to where we actually are right because the question is how do you you can only interpret the movement of uh of the World Around You by stabilizing it by by having a frame that locates it such that you can see this particularity within a pattern whether it's a person uh this I'm giving examples of physical things but as you go deeper you realize there are deeper patterns that govern those things and so my argument fundamentally is that we need recurrence of rep we need to expose ourselves to to to recurrence or repetition in order to be shaped in such a way such that our memories are able to interpret and understand the world around us and so we see this you know we see this you know all the time with you know the the cycle of day and night you know imagine we were just living in one endless day and there was no sun coming up and down imagine there was no cycle of of of seasons of course if you live at the equator that is in fact what what you have but for most of us we're living in a in a movement through time in which there are these cycles and so and we we do this at home we have rituals in the morning and we have rituals in the evening and we have rituals at you know Christmas time or religious holidays and so on we have Civic liturgies in Canada remembrance days is is historically an import an important moment in America in the United States Thanksgiving is an important such day and what those are are rhythms of a certain kind of practice through which We Gather our ourselves and our experience in order to understand it so you pause on Thanksgiving and you you you might say you gather up all of the last that has happened since you've last done that in a moment that allows you to to to understand yourself in relation to say gratitude yeah but I would say at a at a at a more fundamental level or at a very fundamental level this is the case with all of us all the time but I'll add just one one one more thing and that is that there's a sense in which you think about the in you can't recognize something that isn't part of a repetition that you recognize yeah and so we are in a certain sense nothing but the memories that we hold that allow us to interpret the world and that's why the shaping of our memories is so important because it's what enables us to to see to see the world around us and so in some sense that's why you might say the study of history or the forming of ourselves in relation to fundamental patterns otherwise you end up being like the infant who doesn't even know that's your mother you can't you can't see what's in front of you the world is is is an unstable flux until you internalize its patterns such that you can see them outside of you yeah and I I think that before we get deeper into the boethus idea you know it's important for people to understand that in that's why Plato you know almost joins together the idea of memory and knowledge that is to know something is to remember it and you know we can find different ways of formulating formulating that metaphysically you know obviously Plato had a this kind of reincarnation model where where where the sense that you're remembering you know ancient lives and that is what making is making you participate in it and you know as humans now we can we don't need a reincarnation model to understand that even biologically we understand that we are the ascendance of of patterns that have re-embodied themselves over and over and over and we part and it's when we when we know something means we're tapping into that at the low level we could also formulate it vertically and understand that when we know something we are connecting to a cosmic memory we're connecting to a cosmic pattern of repetition and of truth that instantiates itself to the world and we kind of remembered that way so even whether you look at it as biological or whether you look at it vertically towards these idea that there are these kind of uh Transcendent Cosmic patterns we can understand how knowledge is memory it it and it's represented that way in the Bible by the way constantly you know you could we could call it aention in memory right aention and memory as as kind of two faces of the same thing um the idea that God remembers man that man remembers God we see that in the story of Noah we see that in the story of Jonah we see it ly in the you know and when we you know even when we talk about the way in which we participate in the people that came before us we formulate that as memory why do we we have memorials we talk when someone dies in the Orthodox tradition we say memory Eternal and that their memory be Eternal but it it is it's not just a a vague sentimentality it's a mode of participation right it's a mode of I'm connecting to those ancient lives and I'm a continuation a reod ment of the good that they these people did in our lives today um and so I think it for people just to understand that that that this isn't just a kind of artistic artistic uh fancy to talk about these questions of pattern and memory but they really are really the way that in which we engage with with the way in which we recognize the world to exist you know just full stop um yeah and there's a way in which the like if you imagine you know life in the fire hose and in some sense you know uh we're in this time in history we're all way too much in the fire hose in a sense right and but if you if you imagine you know by metaphor the infant who can't recognize anything um uh as a kind of metaphor for how uh many of us certainly myself you know are living far too much of the time uh the question is well what is the alternative to that and what is it that allows anything to become stable so that you're you're you're you're not simply like if you imagine you know every day living every day different with completely different patterns completely different people completely different place you you you would know nothing at all right you're just you're just in this in this constant sea of change and what I think is is is so interesting is that is that you know these you know what is going on in a moment in which you know you step outside of that and you sort of understand oh that moment and this moment and this moment those are all those are all in me and connected and understood and you know I think it's often interesting to talk about for example uh people often in experience of nature have this sense which you know they they they move beyond the particular into something that gathers the particular often in music or art and you're listening to I don't know Bach is often very famously brought up in these connections because of the way that his music has such an astonishing integration of patterns moving through time that you can you can track with and so what I'm wanting to say most fundamentally is that there is no you self-consciousness itself like any knowledge of anything is a stabilization uh that is taking us outside of the immediate into something that is transhistorical right so the moment that you you know let's say you know you you understand yourself to be the same person that you were that the same person as you were when you were a kid you know that you haven't changed and grow grown up and so on but you see a continuity you're like oh no you remember that and now and so in that moment in our in ourselves what we have in our in our memories is a way of making the past present now and so memory is by definition and of course the present doesn't really exist right because as soon as you're aware of it it's already happened it's like you know that it's like perception you know the thing by the time you see it it's already in the past you know even just a micr or whatever but it's already happened and so what I'm trying to suggest is that is that Ian it sounds very huant and difficult when you talk about the relation between Time and Eternity but this is really the the the nature of of of life right is that that you you can be you can be lost in flux and movement or you can the answer to that is to find some longer continuity that you by definition has already taken you outside of time but then the question is well what does that have to do with my movement through the world in time and so in some sense that's precisely what patterns give us is they give us ways of stabilizing ourselves in our movement Through Time such that we're able to see in the moment the Eternal or open the moment becomes something that reveals a deeper stability yeah and so it's interesting like one of the arguments that you make very simply in the book that I found really powerful is that you talk about how the patterning of the words and the patterning of the uh you know the creation of these the these frames they are nemonic in the sense that they help you remember right and people talk about that sometimes too when they say that one of the reasons why monks would chant the Psalms or that rabbis would chant the Psalms is so because by you doing this kind of pattern language uh it's easier to remember the text but there's also a deeper sense in which it's demonic right is in the sense that it's connecting you to the pattern of reality itself it's making you remember that it is through this pattern existence that anything that everything that we participate in comes to find any cohesion whatsoever right the fact that you exist is pneumonic right the fact that that because you're able to connect all these different ele elements together towards knowing that like you said the 5-year-old version of Stephen and you in in a in a very mysterious way is the same being that is continuing on with the same the same pattern um yeah and I just thought that was really interesting because maybe can go bit a a little bit into that into you know because the this is to me the deeper understanding of musicality and also the deeper understanding of you know when we we I remember when I was in school but people talked about uh the idea of The Music of the Spheres and how it's kind of this kind of ridiculous uh mythology right the idea that the Spheres make music and that we we don't hear it anymore but that is the deepest part of that which is that the Music of the Spheres or even the ancient study of Music wasn't just the ancient study of how to make entertainment music for for a party but really how to live in the patterns like really what liturgy is and this is what this is there in BO himself as well in his text yeah so I mean let's let's just uh let's put it this way that that um two things first the the uh this whole kind of the art of memory the the we talk about ne ne the neonic is you know it's pretty amazing first of all what you what what a human mind can remember and you as you know Plato and the fedis is worried about our losing our memories when we start writing things down and you know that's of course exactly what happens we see that with the Internet it's not what you know it's where to find it and all this kind of nonsense but it's also true that it that's what happens is you know when you don't need to you know you you lose that and so it's actually a very scary thing to think about how much less we have in us to understand the world right because we think we can just find it all we don't even know what what to look for right and so what I what I want to say is first of all that the the human mind is an amazing thing from the point of view of of memory and if you look into the medievals and even today their memory competitions people who think they have bad memories are then capable of astonishing Feats right but the the the the deeper Point H is is what that is doing in terms of formation and so uh it's interesting that when we have in English for example we have in the first place we would say in the second place and this is a this is a hold over from from from the art you might say the art of memory in the Middle Ages when you would if you were trying to remember something you would say okay well let's say the maybe the houses on my street or the the uh the rooms in my house and you you say okay I'm going to put this thing that I want to remember in the first room and you you picture it there and I'm put this thing in the second room and and so on and that this is sort a short version of how the art of memory works but I want to make a much deeper point which is that like you in some some sense you can only understand that which you have the places to put things you can only put things in places you have to put them is what I'm trying to say and so what does that mean well Aristotle has this this uh uh wonderful uh account of of of habit and you know today we like to think well you know I did all these bad things but I'm not really that doesn't really Define me that's not really what I am and well Aristotle would say no you are you are what you've what you what you what you've done and and habits are very powerful right because you know they're they're they're they're they're like an unconscious memory you repeat it and you did it again and again and again and then it's just what you are like you know I give the example sometimes that in the home that that my family lived in for many years at one point they moved the cutlery drawer for the silverware from one part of the kitchen to the other and it was after I'd gone to college and every time I come back I would always be going there right because it but but you can you can put that uh uh you can take that example and realize that that that we form ourselves by the things we do and if you're formed in I don't know listening to a lot of negativity and anger and frustration and ranker on the internet like that's what you become in a profound sense right that's where that's the truth of Plato's line right is that you you you the kind of vision we bring is to the world the form of perceiving limits what we're able to see in it and so the whole question of habit is so important for example if you were a parent you know you think about well you could you know teach your child to you don't know to have no self-control and and and and you know be completely you dominated by his or her emotions by rewarding certain behavior and and so on and then what what the world that that child is able to see is completely constrained by the habits they have taken on the person they can become is limited by the fact that they're they they have habits that prevent a deeper form of seeing in the world whereas if you you know is the wonderful line in the scripture says you know if you set your mind on things above such that you have habits of recollection such that you're able to see and perceive deeper pattern deeper patterns and you might say become more and more adequate to those patterns whether it's of you know love or patience or humility or or whatever then that's what you're able to find in the world but it's not as if you can access in the world that which you don't already have the way of being able to see and that's why I give the language of the the image of the infant who who is who is lost to even seeing his or her own hands in the world now because we have the categories of Consciousness like it's not as if we're a blank slate the infant is innately able to recognize these patterns because the human Mind Is Made in such a way as to be able to perceive them and if it weren't then it wouldn't be able to able to see them but the the point fundamentally is that everything is at stake in the habits we develop and the patterns we expose ourselves to because it is what we will be able to see in the world yeah and I think that's such a everybody can find examples in themselves or in other people where they've noticed that you know let's say someone who who is not trustworthy or someone who tries to trick people people tries to get things will their world will get built that way and then at some point they'll find themselves in a situation where they're also surrounded by people that you can't trust that you're surrounded by people that they shouldn't trust but it's and and the opposite is true is that you know this is something that you can see in Christ's word the idea of of saying that if you judge not right lest you be judged that is that if you if you practice the good then all of a sudden you will start to see goodness in the world that because the world has multiplicity and variance and that and and there's even a powerful way in which if you learn to live in the good and see the good you can actually call the good out of others right you can actually and you you know that because sometimes you realize that when you're with certain people you're the best version of yourself and then when you you're with other people you kind of become the worst version of yourself in all in all kinds of ways and that this is what what you're trying to bring about is that the patterning of existence has a deep effect on on who you are and who you remember yourself to be because we do have the potential of being of change like of changing that's that's what humans are we can be you know all kinds of different things and that can happen at at any time in our life but if we have these deep patterns of virtue but also deep patterns of habit in the simple sense you know like eating three meals a day sleep sing certain amount of hours you know and I see it in my life because I I have a you know I have this weird I have a kind of creative Bend to myself and I can see myself sometimes fall into like not you not sleeping not eating well not and then things start to shake around me like in every way like not just in terms of my habit but also in terms of the way I treat others the way I see the world the way I interpret the way other people treat me then it starts to shake but you know maybe you can bring us through a little bit how it is that bothus does it in his text like what is it that he brings you to through really you without going into the details about the different meters of the poems but the basic image of how he takes the reader the participant in his text through a kind of poetic transformation towards towards the highest good sure I'd be I'd be I'd be happy to to to to try and say a few things about that I've just been sort of meditating on I think what you're saying is very very very very very deep I mean the way that I mean what is the see we tend to think that the way we feel about the world is how the world is right but it's actually no no no no that's that's exactly that's where Plato starts is saying no um you can your the way you you might say feel about the world is determining what you're able to see in it that's what's going on it's nothing you might say to do with the world in a sense uh and so question is well how do you do have a vision that's more and more adequate to seeing what's really there and that's that's you might say the whole question of the spiritual intellectual life that's a whole question of parenting or teaching or whatever how do you how do you shape yourself or others into a way that you can see what's really there and you think about the difference between someone who's you know you know always complaining or woe is me or whatever or or always busy and running onto the next thing as sometimes I am often I am or someone who is I don't know what is what is it like to be with someone that sees you when you when you're in their presence you think gosh I just feel better I feel like I'm I'm I'm seeing I'm I'm I'm closer to what I'm meant to be what is going on with someone who I knew I've known a few people like this who very presence was able to mediate a deeper sense of the world a true and More Beautiful sense of the world um now now in terms of BU is I'll just give a couple of examples um The Poetry Works in different ways one way it works is you know those of you who you know read poetry you know that you know the way the Rhythm works is part of the way the message is conveyed the message is is encoded in that sense partly in the in the in the in the in the way in which the it sounds you know um you get these wonderful rhythms I I give example you know towards the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring not even a mouse and that that and that kind of Rhythm you have this sort of way of you know you're you're it's it's loing you in it's a beautiful uh repeated pattern again and again um uh but you can also have you can also have uh rhythms that are that are jarring uh that that are they surprising or or or or or unexpected of course that's what Jazz often of often does and so so one level at which the the the poetry works is it's it's it's simply manifesting you might say the the the truth or the idea that is present in the poem so for example there's a there's a lovely lyrical me meter Dum D Dum D dum dum d d Dum D Dum D Dum that that in this this it's called a glycon but what's beautiful in that is that he uses it in early on to describe the the stability of the seasons and and and the the the consistency of these changes in nature and so he's using this wonderful lyric she's using it I should say lady philosophy philosophy is using it as a way of con she's trying to settle him down and speak a kind of stability to him in his instability and she does this so I mean so wonderful the way she does this both by giving him images that his mind can say oh yeah I know those patterns in nature I I've seen I've seen I've seen seen that but also putting it in a way so that it's sonically acoustically stabilizing and lyrical it's like you know we all know with a with an infant you know what do you do with an infant that's that's that's you know upset and crying and so on you know tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap right you you you and then you know you can music can do the same thing but you at the very most basic level the rocking is a pattern that stabilizes the child so that's one sense and then there there are other poems where where she's talking about the instability of Fortune for example and it'll be like Dump Dump Dump you know it will be it will be she'll he she'll use an unstable meter to convey the instability so that's one level but then what's amazing is that is that H is that some of these meters they occur later on and then the question is well what's going on there is it the same is it just well okay well we figured it out last time and it was inst it was lyrical and stable or it was instable but actually what I what I what I think is is is is going on is the way in which the later uses of the meters are doing something Redemptive relative to uh the that you might say the problems or issues or matters that were raised in the in the first time time time around so you know there's there's one in in in which um the instability of a meter that was used to describe the you know the you contingency or Fortuna you know the instability of of the world you know all its unknowns she actually uses to show how that instability is comprehended by a deeper pattern so the way I um I think this is so beautiful Jonathan because um because there's a there's a deep sense in which healing has to take place at the sight of the wound right like if if you've had this kind of experience or that and you've been shaped or damaged or or broken there's a sense you know that's where the healing has to be and so I think one thing that's going on in in the in the poem is she's she's she's redeeming these broken Moments by uh through this you might say acoustic recollection of an earlier moment to give you might say the answer to the problem or the pain that was in the first instance and so it's it's a way of you might say redeeming by show by recollecting uh and of course psychologists use this this this uh all the time but then there's a third level and that is that is I think that as as you look at the poem as an acoustic struct the the poems of the book as an acoustic structure and in readers who are interested can see uh pattern this out in color uh at the the back of of the book you've got to get the paperback though because the hard cover was printed in black and white and it's much harder to see but in the paperback you can see these unbelievably intricate patterns of the poems and so what I'm I'm arguing is that is that the whole acoustic structure of the Poetry has an interwoven uh uh uh pattern that means that any point of it is part of it's like what you say about fractalization right any point of it is integrated within a larger pattern and so um in fact I maybe maybe uh share two things quickly and one is that um you know I think we this is how memory works right like uh I give the example in the book that where I grew up I love wild roses and I've all these you know these the first instance you you see the rose wow that's that smells good and it's kind of a memory on its own but then the longer you go through life like that well oh that reminds me of that place that I used to go in the summer and with that person and then it it it it it it's a reminder of childhood and it's a rem and so you start seeing that you smell the rose again and you're like whoa that has all these deep forms of pattern that it brings up to you maybe it's a it's it's reminding you of loss or of happiness or and so all of these things become collected precisely because the patterns are moving through different moments in time and and you know I I you know I my grandmother died a few years ago and but I know you know if someone was wearing her perfume it was very distinctive to her that would bring back all of my memories of my my grandm so there's a there's this sense in which one thing we want to do is to scaffold into life the patterns that enable us to gather up our past as present in a way that it can be comprehended and then and then um uh the other thing I say is that as you say if you look in the pend of my book you see all these really complicated patterns and I had a moment when I was writing this that I thought I mean really like is is it really there like this thing pretty complicated and um and I was uh my brother was living in rural Vermont my wife was away and my brother had come to visit uh in the the sort Hills of Vermont and Mountain Ridge and I had taken him to the bus station and I was driving back uh and and uh uh so this woman hitchiking the side of the road uh and uh well of course that's why you hit shik side of the road but anyway she's standing the side of the road and she's she's she's clearly upset she's got a garbage bag with all sort of her possessions and I uh I I stopped and you know before I could start heard even stopped she was she was already kind of threw her things in the back and got in and she was very upset uh she was a you know woman in very challenging circumstances and as I got to know her where she was going was about 45 minutes away and I was not too too far from where I was I was going and we got into a a conversation about her and she had a very sad sort of life story multigenerational dysfunction and drug abuse and children in prison and it was it was very very very sad and uh uh she had been crying and I I don't know what had happened she had sort immediate crisis where she couldn't stay where she was and had to go somewhere else and so um her things in the garbage bag and uh uh uh her name was constant uh I I think she may have been I don't know if she maybe she was an angel maybe she was as I as I tell this story it just seems to be unbelievable her name her name was constants right yeah but anyway so she was very upset and I I asked her I was trying to you know as we try to do for people it's like what philosophy does for bu is I was trying to calm her I was trying to help her find you know ReDiscover herself and uh so I asked her you know what do you what do you like to do and uh she said oh I said I love to knit and I said really well well tell me tell me tell me about it um and she said well you know when I'm when I'm knitting he said why do you like knitting she said well when I'm knitting she said I I Lose Myself in the pattern and and I said you know here I was working on these patterns and things about the recollection self-possession and I mean she meant lose herself in the sense of finding herself he was connecting with something something something something more permanent and and I said uh well you know you knitting anything now and and she said yeah I am I'm knitting this this this blanket for my daughter and and I said tell me about it and she said well it's it's pretty complicated and I said well I'd love to hear about it and she said okay well there's there's 12 sections and each of the sections has six colors and the patterns uh the colors Mo uh change in these patterns in each section and then they relate and I was like holy smokes like this is unbelievable she this woman is telling me a an account and she got all this in her head and she in the back it's in this bag in the back do you want me to show it to you and so here I had this beautiful kind of revelation of this you know woman in in very difficult circumstances who was showing me like in her profound way the truth of what was happening what I had sort of discovered in some sense in buthus that that you know you think it's complicated you know it is life is complicated Bach is complicated yeah but it's complicated it's very complication it's it's interwovenness is what enables it to stabilize and gather things into a pattern and so I came of course to think that these patterns really were not only really were there they can be there knitting they could probably be there in bathus exactly so uh it's to thanks to constants that uh you might say in a sense I came to see how how much we need to expose ourselves to patterns through which we can uncover and discover ourselves yeah I mean it's such a great Insight that you have because if you can imagine the woman uh knitting you know and you know I imagine at first she's counting right she's actually counting she's like one two three da d da and at some point she probably also stops counting where it becomes like when you're dancing and you're not thinking about it and you're just you're just doing a walls and you're not thinking about where you're putting your feet and kind of enter into that Rhythm and to what extent like you said it it transports us into something that is beyond us you know that is when we can kind of understand the power of of poetry its relationship to something like liturgy in the strict Christian sense but also liturgy in the broader sense which is these patterns whether it is family meals whether it is you know even the simple patterns of how you organize your day and how you kind of set things up um that these are that all of this is connected to how humans Find meaning you know it's very powerful definitely wow and so thanks Stephen I would say everybody if if if there's someone here now that hasn't read the consolation of philosophy and you you're not going to read it like I you're a hopeless person at this point like it is an astounding text one of the foundational text of of of Western civilization and also check out Stephen's book it's called the consolation of buus uh as poetic liturgy it's very it's a it's a technical book but the art argument is very powerful and it's worth looking into especially if you're interested in the question of patterns and how patterns affect us today and so Stephen thanks for everything you do you know everybody who who doesn't know about rosson college it is worth looking into rosson college it is a seed of Hope in this time I was able to uh to participate in a trip with uh with Stephen and the some of the people around rosson College was astounded at what it is that it's possible to do today uh and it does give us hope in a moment where we feel like everything's breaking down uh thanks for what you're doing Stephen it's truly appreciated well thank you Jonathan it's a great privilege to have this conversation uh to be on your podcast and your friendship has been a a great gift to me I I'll only say in conclusion that to those who haven't read buus just remember that if you're ever in a really a difficult circumstance um that that book is is is uh is there is there for you I I once uh a friend of mine I was uh once met a friend of mine at a at a meeting it was a board meeting in Boston and she had had cancer uh and I thought it had gone away but it had come back and uh it was very sad uh uh anyway I didn't know what to do and I went into the bookstore and uh there was a bookstore there and I bought herook I I think I just have to give this woman a copy of beus and uh she wrote to me a few weeks later saying that you know words had never been so meaningful to her and uh so I I I say that because uh it might be that this is a book that can u in a time that you really need it you can turn to it yeah all right thanks Stephen and we'll talk soon as well we'll see each other possibly for uh the second part of our uh of our team of Bible interpreters we're hoping to see that happen for those who are hoping that that will it seems like it might so that would be wonderful thank you Jonathan it's a real pleasure bye for now thanks
