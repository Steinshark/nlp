let's do this planet scale forever Planet scale is committed to providing a reliable and sustainable platform for our customers not just in the short term but forever and for this reason we are prioritizing profitability that's the only logical conclusion to a company what what else could you prioritize over profit like I mean I understand that if you make enough money and you're a private company and you say you don't want to continue to just go for um profits you want to be able to just have really great employee experience like that could happen but at the end of the day like this still has to be number one until you can make it number two obviously prioritizing profitability means that you make your customers customers happy right because you know what makes customers really happy free so they could make customer so customer happiness can't be number one because then you just give everything away for free like that would be the that would be the uh that would be the happiest customer you could possibly have you know what I mean but I did I did want to talk about this I think Planet scale is in some pretty hot water so here we go Planet scale forever Planet scale is an infrastructure company now our service is Mission critical and we value reliability Above All Else reliability isn't just an uptime percentage on your status page it isn't just a river in Egypt it means your business is self- sustaining even unprofitable company has a date in the future where it could disappear with an everchanging world and economy this is the situation fraught with risk we've Chen to build a company that can last forever this is why I've made the decision to prioritize profitability for Planet scale so my Curious my curiousness is what were you prioritizing beforehand that did not lead to profitability well growth doesn't make any sense growth makes no sense if it's not profitable right like if growth only means you grow in more money lost that's not real so so if it's adoption if what you mean by adoption in this then it it honestly like I'm going to I'm going to be real here if the plan was to grow as fast as possible and then figure out profitability I think that's shitty right people build businesses on top of you now it's one thing if you're trying to do like you know you're trying to sell a product of some sort so you scale by not making as much money and then at some point you have to like Raise Your Money a little bit that's different right that's much different because the person can just buy coffee from somewhere else but if you're selling a database in which people are building businesses on and then you kind of pull the rug on it that's that's that feels different right that feels somehow different because it's not it's not an it's not a consumer end uh consumption it's like a business end consumption and so that I I I don't like where it's going so I could be wrong you know as of today Planet scale can project profitability after the following key decisions to part ways with members of our team primarily sales and marketing and sunset our hobby plan I would like to express my extreme gratitude for the people we are parting ways with today okay so does Hobby plan mean free tier our hobby plan will be retired as of April 8th 2024 you can find more information about it I forgot to turn off alerts um you can find more information about the plan deprecation such as uh exporting your data or upgrading in our hobby plan uh frequently asked questions so this first one as much as I don't like it I do get this these smaller comp companies tend to hire a lot these smaller tech companies that are like promised to make a lot of money they tend to hire a lot and then of course you know at some point you know as the old phrase the fat lady sings and you have to make real hard decisions the show's over now what do you do and now you have to you have to make a really strong decision and so I understand layoffs I'm not saying they're good obviously they're horrible um I think that that layoffs are the sign of one of two things a failure to plan for a changing economy two failure at be uh being uh good leadership I don't see how Lay layoffs really happen either way so that's every company well I mean that's the thing is that that means the leaders are responsible layoffs should be a direct reflection on the ab the person's ability to lead there's there's a lot of tech companies that did not have any uh layoffs because they were they were they they grew correctly L take y futurist what is L take about saying that layoffs are a sign of leadership leadership is not having good responsibility they're not shepherding their product you gotta you got to tell me why that's not that's not reasonable that is laugh really really so you you you don't think Google over hiring people wildly during the pandemic name five oh I can tell you right now Netflix didn't there was no covid layoffs we're a big company the thing is is that you have to go and look for companies to name you can go to a list of companies if you look at a list of companies and the companies isn't exceeding into the millions then there is all those companies that did not lay off they did and it was not responsible no we didn't the only thing that we ever did during that time is that we have deined in animation we've shut down a vertical because the vertical is not something that we're going to invest into as much as far as the public documents say that I know about that's the only there was a 100 people laid off that I ever know about during that okay that's different that's saying hey we're no longer doing this type of content because we don't think it's the juice is worth the squeeze that's not that's not laying off that's making a strategic decision okay laying off is like oh we did this all wrong and we've over hired and we're not making any money and we've totally effed up it's like with content you have to go okay I guess we should try animation people may love animation let's try it we don't know maybe they don't love animation we won't know because we have to make the content that's like a very different thing you're being pedantic that is literally that is life that is how it works you have to invest into something versus just being irresponsible with hiring and yes 100 people is much different than 10,000 Google Facebook laid off 13,000 people that is a that is a failure of leadership there's no way you can tell me that is the same thing as a 100 people I'm not going to come up here and try to make you guys like me by looking at your opinions and trying to agree with you so you guys go Oh yay Oh yay he likes what I like no you I don't care that's the reality I'm going to tell you exactly what I think okay this is what I think I think it is a failure of management that you did not foresee this and you should have been taking this to begin with okay if you start a company and your whole goal is to get adoption and you get a whole bunch of people to join in and then you have to rug pull them on free membership as they're trying to build out something to me that is a fundamental problem okay I think that is a fundamental leadership issue so suck it I don't care all all right we'll keep on going I understand completely that retiring our free tier will cause inconveniences to some of our users should have worded this better I understand understand completely that retiring our free tier will really make people upset and we have kind of a few people that's probably what the that's what you should have said I hope people understand that our take sorry for all the cursing I normally am not I'm not a big fan of cursing because typically it doesn't convey your opinion well but in like a high emotional point I think it does con convey the feeling of what you're trying to say I typically don't like to use it especially as adjectives the adjective cursing I think is the lowest IQ I think it's room temp room temp language you know what I mean I hope people understand that that we take our mission incredibly serious well I assume so and we uh and this decision was not made lightly if it puts you in a difficult situation please email support and we'll see what we can do to help you okay that's good to hear I I appreciate that planet scale is the main database for companies totaling more than 50 billion in market cap whether you count calories paid for let's see paid for your morning coffee sent a work message or bought a new pair of shoes it is Mo almost certain that you have interacted with our technology today Planet scale has recognized by deoe as one of the fastest growing tech companies in the US see that's where this whole growing in in this thing you know I'm going to I'm going to put something out there I'm going to say something I think I think this marks the end of Planet scale here's why now maybe I'm wrong I could be wrong but I'm going to throw this out here is right now here's your piece of the pie people who want manag databases here is the group of people that are paying you hope that this right here pays for this right here can we all agree with that you hope that it pays for all this plus more that's a good Circle yeah that that was a freehand ass Circle and that was good okay um that's what you hope that's like how this stuff works right okay we all get this the problem is is they just erased this so you are now new you're building a new company you don't want to have to manage your own database so you go out there and you look at all of the different options right uh I Can Only Name a couple neon and turo I I know there's another one keyley right uh maybe there's another item that I don't know about uh I think AWS now has some sort of managed database or had one or is having one I'm not really sure I can't remember um anyways there's a bunch of them super base right there's there's a whole bunch of them right there's a bunch of them why would you choose this one real talk why would you choose Planet scale at this point you have to pay to see if you even like it you're going to have to make that decision based on the documents you look at you know how these databases as a service work they work because one someone uses it right you know some some Rando uses it two they're happy with it three they use it in a paid setting you just took the funnel away so now the funnel really can only be what me telling you to go use them like what's your funnel how how how do you create a funnel now and that's where I think that there's there's a there's a huge problem here they have no funnel for new users and so what are they going to do just hold on to what they have which could happen but it just you just you like you have to try to move the market by getting people to commit to buying it now I'm not saying so I am saying I think they this kind of marks the end but there is this other thing that they're so good and they have the proper selling team that they're going to businesses and they're actually having these one-on-one conversations and convincing management this is this is what you should use and they're just completely changing their strategy all together and now it's not about me it's not about you it's not about us individually becoming the funnel it's about B2B being the only funnel now that on the other hand okay I get that there we go but no no more side project Andy that I think that's going to be hard there you go so that's like the two that I think can happen so I either think they're going to go down or they're effectively going to become they're just purely B2B that's the that's their only two options now which is very interesting which is also very interesting because all of these one all of these ones are able to be B Toc right they can all support B Toc so that means whatever however Planet scale is scaling isn't Planet worthy like they're not they're not able to actually uphold this load it's it's too expensive for them so I'm sure technologically they probably have a huge technological hurdle right now I don't know what the technological hurdle is but my guess is that it's it's it's they have a deeply technical debt that's causing real monetary problems it's worse they took away Service uh at half the world without any notice yes that's what I mean so that's where I think that they're going to have a really hard thing because now they have the next problem so let's just say you are a person making decisions and you've heard about a few different companies right and now you have Planet scale here right Planet scale has been on a rise for popularity I think we can all agree to that this is probably what has led to their downfall is their rise in popularity the very thing in which they have done has also been their own death note meaning they dude they had Aaron Francis in here and Aaron Francis is awesome he was making amazing videos for them dude Aaron Francis AF I love Aaron Aaron is a positive amazing force in the Tech Community just a glorious person and all of that paid to into marketing is causing the rise of people going into Planet scale and then what the hell happens they realize they can't keep this up they got to go down right it's almost kind of hilarious right like this this this Oopsy Daisy that happened and so I don't know if this is real or not but I think that to me this just points to they have a true fundamental scaling problem somewhere and they're unable to maintain a free tier it's too expensive Aaron Francis video is why I tried plan scale completely buy I completely buy that is some Unity Unity is different Unity has okay so I can explain why Unity is much much different Unity it it has nothing to do with what you think unity's problem is way way different okay Unity makes a game engine right they've been able to actually be profitable and and make money for a long time they went public and they had to scale they have like 7,000 employees right now right they are raging the scale which means that they also are now like being held to public standards they now have to make money they now have to not only make money but make more money every single quarter year-over-year constantly going constantly growing constantly innovating at all points it's the death of the public right I think publicly traded companies are really partially terrible and so Unity which could have just been happy making a lot of money continuing to only expand in this area maybe trying to push into ads maybe trying to grow more of their business in various ways they they they hired like wild they have grown way out of control they're scaled way out of their mind and they had to Simply make more money because of the market remember when you when you do an initial public offering you raise hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars when you sell all them stalks and so now they need to take all that money and plow it back into the company and so what happens they plowed and they're not growing so what they had to do they had to come up with some crazy ass what I mean it eventually became two and a half% I think of sales or X dollar per download like that's what happened wait they have 7,000 they had 700 I think they might still a Unity employee it may be 6,000 count I I may be incorrect on that one uh 6,700 as of December 31st okay so I'm I'm I'm approximately correct the number decreased by 919 or 11% compared to the previous year okay so I was correct I'm less correct now so unity and them are very very different they both rug pulled in some sense unity's rug pole felt more evil because Planet scale is a part of your startup Unity is your game that's ve those are very different propositions like I like yikes uh so what are you saying a company specifically in Tech should be very wary of going public I think they should I personally think that you should be very wary of going public as any company because you are going to be beholden to like the public markets I'm not saying I love public markets I'm happy the fact that I can buy pieces of company and own them and as they grow I get to make money off that right like being like that is a very cool way to wealth but it's also a very yucky way to wealth right in the sense that it puts companies under these extreme pressures which cause just a bunch of weirdnesses and who knows what the impact of society and greater is blah blah blah blah right it's great it's bad GPU companies stons anyways uh so I think Planet scale has an extremely extremely hard road ahead of itself our reliability scalability and customer service speaks for speaks for itself the database space is full of unnecessary hype we are opting out our technology has proven among the world's uh some of the world's largest tech companies we do not need to or we do not need to give away endless amounts of free resources in order to keep growing so when I I mean again when I hear this to me it says that there is a they have a large technical hurdle that they're they're struggling with and that they're not growing their cost of growth is too much their margins is too much and that they have to make a drastic change such as this that I mean that's how I read it that's how I read it and I also thought so I I haven't read this but I I saw this person uh make this post and I kind of wanted to I I wanted to read this as well um the planet scale situation is kind of a bummer for me I do not have the experience or expertise to comment on the business reason industry side of things just how it feels as a user perspective so I read these couple lines and said oh crap I should save this for uh I should save this uh because this is good killing the free tier really puts it in a tough spot for me I see Theo talk about a lot of a lot about the idea of young devs who care a lot becoming advocates for software and bringing them into their orgs I and I literally did that with Planet scale bada bing bada boom I kind of feel like uh this is something I just said no I only pre-read it to hear only pre-read it to hear like this is literally spot on which is people feel like they they they they they develop this thing they see it they become advocates for it and they feel like you know you become the best advocate for technology you can make a company company profitable by being excited about it there are at least probably more at this point three products in production from the agency I work at last year because I came in and wanted to use it and I went really and it went really really well all of those are paying so the ROI for my free DB uh is at least three scaling real customers which to me feels really bad to effectively cut that off another big reason I'm bummed is that I genuinely think Planet scale is the best database out there and I really want to recommend it to people but $40 is a lot per month the data uh branching rollbacks serverless driver scale unbelievable UI schema recommendations monitoring and more are the best I have ever used and it sucks that a ton of devs who would have seen and fallen in love with all that stuff are now not going to $40 a month is a lot for you to try out something that's not what these production people are using they're going to have a more expensive plan okay but the hobbyist plus plan the one where you pay and you have like a small site that gets enough traffic that you have to pay that's what you're pay is minimum $40 listen you have countless hours of code and you don't have $40 a month for uh my more serious funded projects uh Insider VI we uh we probably just going to pay the $40 and move on it's whatever we can afford it but for my new projects videos I don't know man it's a tough sell at this point Planet scale will always have a special place in my heart when I posted my first videos a year and a half ago having zero clue what I was doing on the worst mic in the history by the way if you're going to make a video little little quick thing your video can be significantly worse than your mic invest in a mic just go buy at least a $100 mic okay I'm not going to be some audio file but sound good enough it's that simple like then you can have a voice like me and you can literally never succeed due to your voice but that's different uh notice that I by the way notice that I haven't said anything about the database company I prefer okay I've actually really tried to be fairly agnostic in that way by the way I I've tried to be here I've talked about why I like it and the CEO saw it and sent me some of their swag as dumb as it might sound that really did mean a lot of course it did I mean who wouldn't want to be recognized here who wouldn't want that real talk like if I used like I have a turo beanie that's my favorite thing I love it I have a torso beanie it it makes me happy every single time I put it on it makes me just like feel warm and fuzzy on the inside I have a react Miami t-shirt that Michelle sent me honestly it makes me I I literally retweet react Miami so much more simply because she sent me a T-shirt and I feel it just feels special right sometimes just being recognized makes you feel special you know what I mean that's that's real like you make a video about something you love they see it they say thank you and shoot you over a t-shirt makes you feel a little special okay makes you feel it makes you feel special uh terso will not get rid of their free tier public numbers that uh globber tweeted yesterday cost them 17 cents per DB right now to run uh they used a techn how do I know they used a technology that scales really well and also you got to remember that these are core Linux committers here I'm going to I'm going to give you a little fact if you're going to be choosing a foundational piece of material for your company you should go look at who runs each one of these foundational pieces of material the reason why okay I I wasn't going to talk a lot about too the reason why I like too a lot is that globber and his co-founder both are 20-year Veterans of committing to Linux they know it deeply thoroughly in and out many commits both of them into the ACT actual operating system that I use all the time B they both worked at silid DB silb is the now faster better scaling version of Cassandra written in C++ glober specifically spent two years tuning performances and that is it no other things at all just pure focus on performance now these two people Pekka and uh globber decide I'm going to build a DB company so guess what yeah you sorry I I I know what I chose and I know I chose right cuz I knew like when I saw when I saw the credentials I'm like this is the thing that I can get behind because I believe in the people you know what I mean I believe in the people that's a very different experience now their company still may go down maybe they won't make enough money maybe not everybody's going to go over and that's real like that's going to happen that happens to plenty of companies but I believe that they can actually make a real like if if anyone's going to make a product they will make that product and I'm sad that it's going to be a lot harder for me to advocate for Tech and have to look for Alternatives myself for all the random crap I love building because $40 is just too much of that kind of thing exactly salid DB is great yeah I agree it's it's very impressive uh let's see I hope this works out in the end I really want them to succeed not just because I like the company but because I want to see things that are P let's see that they are pioneering first class serverless support branching and rollbacks become more widely adopted I've recently decided uh tried out super base branching and it was a huge W which is great to see hopefully this shows up in more places that's pretty awesome is that a peel box that's pretty sweet box apparently this man drives a 1997 Honda beer Planet scale don't post your keys on social media kids yeah W Honda yeah if a if some other company can do 7 cents per dat database how the hell is PL scale charging $4 because well first off R&D is really expensive but I think that uh Planet scale has a large technical hurdle like I said I personally think I have no reason to believe this I have no concrete material I'm not hiding from you guys some secret knowledge to me when I read this it says to me that they have a scaling or technical hurdle that I am unaware of the cost to run each database is higher is is high enough that free tier can't exist and I think that that's a pretty reasonable read between the lines here right am I being grossly uh you know uh grossly negligent in my opinions no if you get rid of this and you downscale to me that says hey we can't keep up this it's crazy that they sneak the layoff announcement in the middle of this the layoff announcement should have been separate I think it should have been a different time and I think it's it's it's generally kind of yucky
