before the video get started I do want to give you 
a heads up that of course this was recorded before   social distancing wasn't put into place which 
means that of course you should stay at home   like I am or stay in the office by myself like I 
am but I do want to give a huge thank you to my   Crescenta for still allowing us to share with you 
guys this latest version Oh broke versus Pro so   enjoy hello welcome to broke versus pro gaming 
last time can may have gotten the jump on me   however I'm flipping the tables of time with the 
good help of our friends over Micro Center we're   sponsoring this video you did not yes no yes I did 
you have a $300 setup that's all the money you get   really good yeah 300 so the cool part about this 
episode is that I get to do whatever I want so in   like last time we had to like build my PC outta 
like ten dollars I could go straight to like I   don't know what we have yet risin 9 but yeah sure 
resinize do it thread Ripper why not but you know   what to keep things fair okay which really embody 
the spirit of broke versus Pro and if I'm pro I'm   not building my own PC whoo but that's for losers 
who builds their own PC I'm just gonna buy one I   mean you yeah you can have fun building your 
300 ollar PC or whatever you're gonna do I   don't really care I'm gonna go ahead just pick 
a prebuilt okay by the way that's our sound guy   rich hi rich rich you're in the shot again your 
roof good hey Cody okay I need some help so we're   doing pro verse broke again okay ken is finally 
been dethroned I get the unlimited cool budget so   can you help me find a cool desktop ya know for 
sure I'm the building today money up like Dells   we have plenty of power specs okay oh what's this 
oh wait this is what we Ken got this for the first   episode right the lien leuwen this is almost like 
I feel bad unlike you who goes like completely   overkill I feel like if I did something like this 
that's not fair because you don't even know what   the rest of my setup is I've already talked to 
the Micro Center guys I'm already this is all   planned out I know exactly the way you scripted 
the video no I know the other things I've got   I've got to you script the video I have a secret 
weapon on the other side of the store but I need   my PC first with you okay if I scripted the video 
would be much better than this okay oh I call it   the great this one yes Strix jido 10 th $13.99 k 
look at how reasonable that is those 10 Pro for   all your professional whoa I'm a pro onion we're 
happy let me see what's inside okay I can't open   it so this this is my secret weapon this behold 
no no not the arcade oh yeah so I picked f1 for   a reason because this is a full simulator setup 
this is by next level racing and I've actually   wanted one these for a while so this is the full 
seat we have the pedals we have the triple monitor   setup gonna you know tell me back or I will show 
you how it's done mmm I knew what I was doing I   came here hmm I don't like this my pedals are a 
little loose go away this is mine let me have my   happy moment can we in there boys whoo I hate to 
admit it but that looks pretty good it's pretty   good right okay slight miscalculation there well 
thank god this isn't a real game or Austin would   be dead yes dude oh I'm so happy right now oh no 
my controllers connected what'd you do what did   you do why did they disconnect I get the point so 
what's the plan I don't know everything's out of   my price range look why nine seems like totally 
there was a spot to start I mean it's all good   sign when Windows 10 is already like more than 
a third of my budget I will say you are kind of   right 50 bucks for an Athlon yeah fine what are 
the prices looking for like feeding motherboards okay you really need to look at 80 320 here 320 
right here I'll take pity on you and hope okay   that's what you need how much $43 see okay so 
you're like 98 dollars right now you can do this   I believe in you wait but I so wait for $300 I 
also need to get a monitor and get work yes a   lot of work costs like 40 frosted would cost 
like 54 it would cost like 20 cases probably   like okay well I don't realistically at this 
point I don't even think I can use a case well   what do you do an xbox again or something maybe 
a laptop a $300 laptop okay sure what options   do I have mr. I got sponsored by micro center 
and giving Ken scraps oh wow I wouldn't know   anything about something like that and imagine 
so a sea of laptops yeah a lot of which are out   of my price range will all be fine look see 
it's a suddenly over W okay okay yeah out of   my price range out of my price range nope too 
expensive too expensive too expensive close but   too expensive chromebook too expensive whoa hi 
there oh this guy let's see $299 bucks okay but   wait oh it's rising it's rising by thirty three 
thirty two hundred you will you be able to play   f1 on that on rising three in a bigger plan if I 
can get twenty frames out of this I'll be happy   oh okay you know what okay I'm gonna take pity 
on you since you've got such a powerful system   here okay come with me I actually saw something 
your ghost was here you need a laptop cool this   is a setup video I will graciously provide you 
this cooler which with five RGB fans will give   you at least half an extra frame per second I 
don't think this is RGB I think this is just   gee I don't think this will help me but it'll 
definitely make it more different and push that   push that $30 oh yo you get the red one you want 
red or green there get green you Capitan you have   a razor laptop for the gamers by gamers rise up 
rise up on me I appreciate the help I don't know   why I'm doing this how heavy is this thing it's 
a hundred pounds oh this your PC oh yes wait wait   wait wait wait wait there's there's a there's 
a gap so stalk it comes with a metal side panel   however metal is so 2011 so instead I put on the 
clear side panel to see my RX 2070 super my rise   in system it's very impressed look look it's 
RGB this RGB implant - okay so I'm holding the   camera now yeah because I'm a good buddy rich to 
help me out nothing like a pro set up to have pro   friends to help you build I am also happy that 
you were able to buy yet another friend to help   you out where's my pain you to be here now no 
look at that true friendship this is probably   one of the most important parts of the setup 
is this is our seat this is where we not only   all three of our monitors but also the petals the 
wheel pretty much everything is built around this   setup I've never built one of these before so 
I don't know how I'll just gonna go oh no one   what a nice box hey yo Ken here's your desk oh you 
can game on this I'll take what I can get oh look   at that look how comfortable look at my lumbar 
support here I'll just be like chillin like oh look meanwhile I'm just gonna how's your setup 
come and start my build just gonna whip this up pretending to build a car right now are 
we seven again I'm not gonna lie this is   actually not that bad look this is actually 
kind of cool yeah I didn't even need glue   or tape but the real question is will the 
back of that box hold up with you leaning   against it all day long I would hope 
so if it held a hundred pounds worth   of stuff but big you're leaning against it 
yeah I'm not at a hundred pounds of force   you ain't my honey I'm sorry to say he's 
all yeah yeah yeah would you tell me that where you going Ken so while Austin and rich are 
over there building Austin's place eat my setup   is actually pretty much ready now all I have to do 
is assemble my racing wheel which is really just   this charity case Xbox one controller that Austin 
was gracious enough to lend me and my racing wheel   that conveniently just sits on the Xbox controller 
we'll see how this works well we got we I guess   put this girdle thing then we put this thing on 
here the arm lines up with the analog stick and   all I have to do is put the cap on it hey I like 
that look at that nice steering wheel so now that   this steering wheel is done I'm gonna go ahead and 
to see how Austin and rich are doing and from the   sounds of it they're still heavily in build mode 
right soon as you left we got a lot of work done   we're almost done with the seat now this looks 
almost the same as from when I left it alright   well they're still building I got bored so I left 
and most importantly we're at Austin's house so   we're gonna do what anyone would do when you're 
at your friend's house and they're not watching   is a chip the fridge this is like the saddest 
version of MTV Cribs if you thought Austin was   living large apart from his fridge that's very 
stainless steel he ain't living that big in his   kitchen at least that's for sure he started 30 
minutes ago to format my computer something oh no   I'm just scouting the competition so close it's so 
close no you're crying the screens behind and I'm   lined up here don't you guys take a bolt through 
to hold it so this rust master chess xw and it's   $70 it is certainly not cheap however now is this 
a incredibly good meal there's also a really salt   set of petals Oh what it's like a real spark ooh 
it's it's a real sparkle wheel that looks like   real carbon fiber and that's Alcantara holy also 
in the Box we have a nice set of petals to over a   micro Center and Thrustmaster have the hook up we 
have the TLC n petals now this is actually as far   as I know not even out yet so they specifically 
set this out so we can take a look at it these are   load cell and magnetic petals so this will run you 
about $200 when it goes on sale but essentially   these are supposed to be some of the best sort of 
race and petals that you can get as they're fully   customizable oh okay will you clear some boxes out 
here all right that is a set of petals right here   do you see the brake pedal right here look how 
much pressure that is oh oh I'm gonna take this   what do you stop taking my things upgrade there 
we go for the displays we're using three of these   ASIS vg2 seven eights now there's a couple reasons 
why I like this first of all it's a 27 inch   display which is about the maximum thing we can 
fit on this setup but on top of that they're 1080p   low resolution it isn't really matter because 
they're fairly far away and they run in a full   144 Hertz with not only free sync but also G sync 
and like 260 bucks this I feel like is easily the   best call to get us the most immersive experience 
short or something like VR or a projector but I   much prefer using ivory plays I'm coming boy yet 
so when you bite this cockpit it doesn't come   with any kind of monitor mounts now if you just 
want to use a single monitor you can do that we   have the triple monitor setup right here so oh 
yes the triple monitor stand might be a pretty   hefty 150 dollars still 850 dollars less than the 
Apple display stand and it supports three monitors   so it's like that means it cost like $50.00 per 
monitor yeah okay so first monitor setup again   everything's pretty loose so we can adjust it to 
just the right angle but to this gonna be sweet   next step is to get the other monitors mounted 
there's gonna be a ton of cables here so we   have monitor display cables we have monitor power 
cables we have the power cable and the turbo for   the wheel the pedals have to have cables run but 
from there we should be pretty close to actually   getting a game up and running there'll be a lot 
of tweaking and tuning once we have everything   mounted together one more time actually one 
more I'm not ready okay oh sure I'll do it again alright he's good the second time so austin 
needed some help to install his bezel free   kiss story of my life you can see this is what 
looks like obviously this is not fully aligned   but this is what it looked like before with the 
bezel free kit it's not 100% perfect I think we   may have to do a little bit more tweaking do 
you can see especially when you're kind of   sitting roughly in the seat that actually looks 
to be pretty good oh look at that look at that   hey what's my button I don't know which 
button this is you could already tell   the difference with also throwing balls 
that's fast that's 90 frames per second Oh   like that's ridiculous oh I mean obviously 
need practice on it but this totally works yes I feel good in saying that this is actually 
going to work right I mean the wheels feels good I   would like to tweak with a little bit more force 
feedback but you can see it's pretty accurate   we're getting 80 frames per second or so which on 
three monitors seems to be fine the pedals seem to   be pretty much accurate oh all right do it I'm 
gonna tweak this we're gonna put that the bezel   freaked it on but I think pretty close we're 
ready to start the broke versus Pro challenge   okay very Savior you're not allowed to turn off 
the halo by the way I'm not a trap the halo good no assists besides the dragon line because 
breaking it sorry alright so it is 5 minutes   to 4 so we have approximately been shooting for 
about 10 hours or something like that mattre um   but the Sun is going down so we're gonna have 
to hit the lights here there we go and here it   is my setup Wow so impressive it's great right 
$300 HP risin laptop with some kind of vague   Radeon integrated graphics I did have to make 
some slight modifications I have a door yours   doesn't have a door need doors mr. Bryton it's 
fine I can also jump right in and we're good   we're good fighting there we go okay your 
door opens we're good we're good we're good   you feeling good right now yeah shut my door 
on you I think it's time for qualifying sure   so the rules will be very simple we're going 
to have how long do I need five minutes of   practice sure okay five minutes of practice one 
qualifying session and then a five lap race to   determine is the broke setup really better than 
the pro setup that sounds like a bomb all right   this let's go let's do it what are you getting 
I'm give me 32 frames I'm getting a 80 that's   cool man I looked up and blew the corner yeah 
that's why that's why I'm trying not to look   up if I'm real though this wheel not doing much 
for me really so the 3d printed controller wheel   thing is giving me more precise control but I'm 
still only using one thumb to steer because my   shift buttons are X and ay which is what I'm 
most used to on a controller and I don't feel   comfortable switching to shoulder buttons right 
now to change my ears so with the way that's   configured I might actually take my wheel off 
and just straight up play with the controller   I'll definitely feel way more at home which is 
kind of what I need right now considering it Hey I'm gonna say the best part of this is definitely 
the wheel like I get so much force feedback here   really kind of tells me where the car is trying 
to go like where it's like really fighting me   these pedals are also really nice I bet they want 
to spend more time with them and kind of actually   figure out exactly the right sort of level like 
I feel like the brake pedal could be a little bit   firmer with one of the other Springs so with our 
practice laps done and neither us being a clear   winner the next step is to qualify so I think we 
only get doing it one lap to this I believe so   all right here we go here we go whoo the Suns 
in my face with these giant displays luckily   I don't have that brightness so I can't really 
I'm not too confident my qualifying just because   I've missed a few beats but we'll see whoa one 
forty point six taught me obviously I beat you   you haven't finished yet yeah there we go yeah I 
beat you by three point four seconds on that lap   all right so it all comes down to this should 
you spend $200 and build your set up a box or   should you get the old $300 or whatever it was 
or should you get the ultimate racing Pro setup   and see what the real pros do you know all right 
like me this is for the 1% no this is for this is   for the 99% I'm so used to being the 1% oh we're 
gonna have to oh wait I need clutch really oh go oh you're right there with my giant monitors I can 
see you oh okay you know you can have that that's   fine I'm not gonna get my eggs I started better 
than Austin I didn't go your so why are you so   wide Oh Oh gotcha I like to do drive carefully 
now well this is great Wow like really ahead   yeah like a terrible spot I had to put in Reverse 
to get back to life a little too late there but   that's okay I have a lot of room for error now 
oh alright it comes down to this going keep the   porch keep the porch keep the push I need you to 
make a mistake I don't think I'm gonna catch you   unless you make a mistake it feels great it feels 
really good oh man I beat the rich dude my fastest   lap is two point two seconds passes yeah but I was 
a more composed driver which is all that matters   thank you very much for watching this episode of 
broke versus Pro if you like check out the stuff   we talked about this video the links will be in 
the description again huge shout out to Micro   Center for sponsoring my setup and I guess part 
of yours until next time can any parts I want
